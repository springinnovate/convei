TI  - Analysis of factors related to non-sentinel lymph node metastasis in 296 sentinel lymph node-positive Chinese breast cancer patients
T2  - CANCER BIOLOGY & MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) may be unnecessary in 20%-60% of breast cancer patients with sentinel lymph node (NSLN) metastasis. The aim of the present study was to review the medical records of Chinese patients with early-stage breast cancer and positive NSLN metastasis to identify clinicopathological characteristics as risk factors for non-NSLN metastasis.Methods: The medical records of 2008 early-stage breast cancer patients who received intraoperative sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) between 2006 and 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. These patients were clinically and radiologically lymph nodenegative and had no prior history of receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy or endocrinotherapy. The clinicopathological characteristics of patients with positive NSLN metastasis who underwent ALND were investigated.Results: In the present study, 296 patients with positive NSLN metastases underwent ALND. Positive non-NSLN metastases were confirmed in 95 patients (32.1%). On univariate analysis, >= 3 positive NSLN metastases (P <0.01), NSLN macrometastases (P = 0.023), and lymphovascular invasion (P = 0.04) were associated with non-NSLN metastasis (P <0.05). In multivariate analysis, the number of positive SLNs was the most significant predictor of non-SLN metastasis. For patients with 0, 1, 2, or 3 associated risk factors, the non-SLN metastatic rates were 11.5%, 22.5%, 35.2%, and 73.1%, respectively.Conclusions: The number of positive NSLNs, NSLN macrometastases, and lymphovascular invasion were correlated with nonSLN metastasis. The number of positive SLNs was an independent predictor for non-NSLN metastasis. When 2 or 3 risk factors were present in one patient, the probability of non-NSLN was higher than that in the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group 20011 trial (27.3%); thus, avoiding ALND should be considered carefully.

T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy has been shown in the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z0011 trial to be sufficient for women with early-stage breast cancer and 1 to 2 positive sentinel lymph nodes; however, many patients received non-specified radiotherapy. Practice patterns since the publication of this study were analyzed using a large nationwide database showing a decrease in completion axillary lymph node dissection and marked variability in radiotherapy field design.Background: For clinical T1-2N0 breast cancer, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has been shown in American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z0011 to be sufficient for women with 1 to 2 positive sentinel lymph nodes with no added benefit for completion axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Z0011 specified whole breast radiotherapy (RT) using standard tangential fields; however, later analysis showed variation in field design. We assessed nationwide practice patterns and examined factors associated with patients undergoing completion ALND and subsequent radiation field design. Patients and Methods: Women with clinical T1-2N0 breast cancer who underwent breast-conserving surgery, axillary staging, and whole breast RT in 2012 to 2013 were identified in the National Cancer Database. Multivariable logistic regression modeling was used to examine axillary management and RT, adjusting for demographic and clinicopathologic factors. Results: Among 83,555 patients meeting criteria, 9.3% underwent upfront ALND, 75.8% underwent SLNB only, and 14.9% underwent SLNB with completion ALND. From 2012 to 2013, upfront SLNB increased from 90.1% to 91.4% (odds ratio, 1.14; P < .001). Among 9474 patients that underwent SLNB with 1 to 2 positive sentinel nodes, 31.2% received completion ALND. Among patients with 1 to 2 positive sentinel nodes, SLNB increased from 65.8% to 72.1% from 2012 to 2013 (P < .001). For patients with 1 to 2 positive lymph nodes that underwent SLNB only, 63.4% underwent breast RT, whereas 36.6% received breast and nodal RT. Conclusions: Nationwide practice patterns of axillary management vary. Despite an increasing rate of SLNB, many patients still receive upfront and completion ALND. Furthermore, there is significant variation in RT field design, and modern treatment guidelines are warranted for this patient population. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Seabed Mapping in Coastal Shallow Waters Using High Resolution Multispectral and Hyperspectral Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal ecosystems experience multiple anthropogenic and climate change pressures. To monitor the variability of the benthic habitats in shallow waters, the implementation of effective strategies is required to support coastal planning. In this context, high-resolution remote sensing data can be of fundamental importance to generate precise seabed maps in coastal shallow water areas. In this work, satellite and airborne multispectral and hyperspectral imagery were used to map benthic habitats in a complex ecosystem. In it, submerged green aquatic vegetation meadows have low density, are located at depths up to 20 m, and the sea surface is regularly affected by persistent local winds. A robust mapping methodology has been identified after a comprehensive analysis of different corrections, feature extraction, and classification approaches. In particular, atmospheric, sunglint, and water column corrections were tested. In addition, to increase the mapping accuracy, we assessed the use of derived information from rotation transforms, texture parameters, and abundance maps produced by linear unmixing algorithms. Finally, maximum likelihood (ML), spectral angle mapper (SAM), and support vector machine (SVM) classification algorithms were considered at the pixel and object levels. In summary, a complete processing methodology was implemented, and results demonstrate the better performance of SVM but the higher robustness of ML to the nature of information and the number of bands considered. Hyperspectral data increases the overall accuracy with respect to the multispectral bands (4.7% for ML and 9.5% for SVM) but the inclusion of additional features, in general, did not significantly improve the seabed map quality.

TI  - Use of remote sensing indicators to assess effects of drought and human-induced land degradation on ecosystem health in Northeastern Brazil
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land degradation (LD) is one of the most catastrophic outcomes of long-lasting drought events and anthropogenic activities. Assessing climate and human-induced impacts on land can provide information for decision makers to mitigate the effects of these phenomena. The Northeastern region of Brazil (NEB) is the most populous dryland on the planet, making it a highly vulnerable ecosystem especially when considering the lingering drought that started in 2012. The present work consisted of detecting trends in biomass [leaf area index (LAI)] anomalies as indicators of LD in NEB. We also assessed how the loss of vegetation impacts the LD cycle, by measuring trends in albedo and evapotranspiration (ET). LAI, albedo and ET data were derived from MODIS sensors at 8-day temporal and 500 m spatial resolutions. For precipitation anomalies, we relied on CHIRPS-v2 10-day temporal at 5 km spatial resolution data. For detecting trends, we applied the Theil-Sen slope analysis on time series of MODIS LAI, albedo and ET images. Trend analysis was performed for the periods ranging from 2002-2012 (no severe droughts) to 2002-2016 (including the last drought). LAI trends were more pronounced and had a stronger signal than ET and albedo, therefore, LAI was our choice for mapping LD. The first analysis highlighted the human-induced LD prone areas whereas the last detected drought-induced LD prone areas. Considering only the trending areas, which was about 23.4% of the total, 4.5% of this area has undergone human-induced degradation whereas drought was responsible for 73%, although, not mutually exclusive. As reported in the literature and official data, grazing intensification might be a factor driving human-induced degradation. We noticed that the range of variation of LAI is narrow and even narrower for albedo, which demonstrates that land surface response is more influenced by soil reflectivity rather than the characteristic sparse vegetation coverage (LAI ranging from 0.04 to 0.4 in the Caatinga biome), which can barely alter albedo. Finally, the effects of LD on ET anomalies were assessed by Granger causality and impulse-response analyses as means to link land surface feature changes to the hydrological cycle. Albedo had a slightly weaker impulse than LAI on ET whereas precipitation played a major role. These relations are site-specific and, land surface features (biomass and albedo) showed to have a more substantial influence on ET in severely degraded areas. We concluded that drought led to trends indicating LD prone areas in NEB and the degradation cycle has positive feedback derived from ET reduction resulting in an increased net moisture deficit, although the latter statement has yet to be further investigated. The study warns of the desertification risk that NEB is facing and the need for the authorities to take action to mitigate degradation and drought effects on both traditionally surveyed (desertification nuclei) and newfound LD prone areas. We also highlight the limitation of confirming LD, as to date there is no post-drought data available and, lessons learned from the Sahel case make us cautious about claiming that an area is in fact degraded.

TI  - Assessing ecosystem collapse risk in ecosystems dominated by foundation species: The case of fringe mangroves
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem collapse, i.e. the endpoint of ecosystem decline, is a central concept of IUCN Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) assessments and the identification of ecosystems most vulnerable to global environmental change. Estimating collapse risk can be challenging for ecosystems reliant on a few dominant species to perform most of their functions because the range of suitable and feasible indicators is small. This study investigates the robustness and adequacy of the current RLE approach for risk assessments in such ecosystems, using a fringe mangrove ecosystem as a case study. Following the RLE protocol, we constructed a conceptual model of the key ecosystem processes for the Philippines' fringe mangrove forests. Satellite remote sensing data and existing maps of mangrove forests were then combined to assess the spatial distribution of the ecosystem considered (Criteria A and B), while the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index was used to assess biotic degradation (Criterion D). Insufficient data were available to assess Criteria C (environmental degradation) and E (quantitative analysis). Overall, the ecosystem was assessed as 'Least Concern' based on extensive geographic distribution and only weak support for declines in extent. Criterion D was classed as 'Data Deficient' since there was no clear relationship between the vegetation index and fringe mangrove degradation. Our results demonstrate how gaps in our appreciation and understanding of the structure and functioning of ecosystems are more likely to impede risk assessments of ecosystems characterised by a small number of foundation species, due to the low level of redundancy between candidate indicators available for their assessments. Satellite remote sensing combined with derivation of explicit conceptual ecosystem models provides a way to structure efforts to identify suitable indicators as well as opportunities to overcome many of these challenges, even for relatively data-poor ecosystems.

TI  - Flash Flood Hazard Using Optical, Radar, and Stereo-Pair Derived DEM: Eastern Desert, Egypt
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Flash floods are classified among the Earth's most deadly and destructive natural hazards, particularly in arid regions. Wadi El-Ambagi, one of the largest drainage basins in the Eastern Desert of Egypt, is frequently subjected to severe flash flood damage following intense, short-lived rainstorms. This wadi is home to one of the few road networks which connects the Nile River Valley to the Red Sea Coast. At its outlet lies Quseir, one of the major coastal towns in the area. Quseir is a developing tourism and scuba diving town, and is known for its historical importance as an ancient port; thus, efforts are in place to preserve the town's heritage. The lack of hydrological and meteorological data in this region necessitates the use of a hydrological modeling approach to predict the spatial extent, depth, and velocity of the flood waters, and hence locate sites at risk of flood inundation. This was accomplished by understanding the characteristics of surface runoff through modeled hydrographs. Here, elevation data were extracted from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and a two-meter digital elevation model (DEM) derived from WorldView-2 stereo pair imagery. The land use/land cover and soil properties were mapped from fused ASTER multispectral and ALOS-PALSAR Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data to produce a hybrid image that combines spectral properties and surface roughness, respectively. The results showed that storm events with rainfall intensities of 30 mm and 60 mm over a two-hour period would generate maximum peak flows of 165 m(3) s(-1) and 875 m(3) s(-1) , respectively. The latter peak flow would generate floods with depths of up to 2 m within the town of Quseir. A flood of this magnitude would inundate 217 buildings, 7 km of the highway, and 1.43 km of the railroad in the downstream area of Wadi El-Ambagi. Findings from this work indicate that the integration of remote sensing and hydrological modeling can be a practical and quick approach to predict flash flood hazards in arid regions where data are scarce.

TI  - Surface water bodies mapping in Zimbabwe using landsat 8 OLI multispectral imagery: A comparison of multiple water indices
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Water is integral for the survival of humans, animals, as well as vegetation and information on its spatial distribution is important for water resources management. Various methods have been applied to detect and map land surface water, especially due to the availability of a large range of satellite sensors. The main methods involved are either general feature classification techniques or thematic water body information extraction. Thematic water body extraction methods make use of band information and in this study; spectral indices are used to delineate land surface water for Zimbabwe using Landsat 8 OLI images. Multiple algorithms i.e. spectral indices were used to extract surface water bodies from Landsat 8 imagery.Then overall accuracies and Kappa coefficients and average reliability were then applied to assess the performance of the seven applied models. The results have shown that the LSWI plus VI can map surface water bodies with an overall accuracy of 86%, kappa statistic of 0.70 and a reliability accuracy of 89%. Comparatively, the index produced good results followed by the mNDWI which had an overall classification accuracy of 84% and an average reliability of 87%. Following on the list in terms of performance was the AWEI(sh), mMDWI plus VI, NDWI and NDWI plus VI. However, other indices had slightly lower results comparatively. The study noted that LSWI plus VI applied on Landsat 8 OLI data can reliably delineate land surface water in a subtropical environment.

T2  - JURNAL ILMU DAN TEKNOLOGI KELAUTAN TROPIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Research on benthic habitat mapping in the Wangi-wangi Island waters was very limited. Therefore the spatial data availability of benthic habitat in this area is also very limited. The purposes of this study were to map the shallow water benthic habitats using Sentinel-2 image based on object-based classification method (OBIA) and to calculate the accuracy level of benthic habitat classification results in the Wangi-wangi Island waters of the Wakatobi District. This research was conducted in the Wangi-wangi Island waters around Sombu Dive waters and it's surroundings. The study used satellite Sentinel-2 data with 10x10 m(2) spatial resolution acquired on 4 April 2017 and the field data were acquired in March - April 2017. Satellite image was classified with OBIA method using contextual editing at level 1. At level 2, we used supervised classification with some algorithms such as support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), Bayesian, and k-nearest neighbour (KNN) with input themathic layer from field data. The classification of benthic habitats was performed in 12 and 9 classes with the application of segmentation-optimization scale of 1, 1.5, 2, and 2.5. Based on OBIA method, benthic habitat can be mapped with the best overall accuracy of 60.4% and 64.1% for the image classification of 12 and 9 classes, respectively with SVM algorithm and the optimum segmentation scale of 2.

TI  - The Role of Hyperspectral Imaging: A Literature Review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Review
AB  - Optical analysis techniques are used recently to detect and identify the objects from a large scale of images. Hyperspectral imaging technique is also one of them. Vision of human eye is based on three basic color (red, green and blue) bands, but spectral imaging divides the vision into many more bands. Hyperspectral remote sensors achieve imagery data in the form of hundreds of adjoining spectral bands. In this paper, our purpose is to illustrate the fundamental concept, hyperspectral remote sensing, remotely sensed information, methods for hyperspectral imaging and applications based on hyperspectral imaging. Moreover, in the forensic context, the novel methods involving deep neural networks are elaborated in this paper. The proposed idea can be useful for further research in the field of hyperspectral imaging using deep learning.

TI  - Fire regimes at the arid fringe: A 16-year remote sensing perspective (2000-2016) on the controls of fire activity in Namibia from spatial predictive models
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Dry-season fires affect the grassland and savanna ecosystems in Namibia and other regions around the globe. Whereas climate, especially precipitation, has been found to constrain fire activity in (semi-)arid regions through productivity, the feedbacks with human systems lack generalization. Here, we assess the biophysical and human-related controls of fire activity in Namibia based on a 16-year record (2000-2016) of the MODIS Burned Area product (MCD45A1). The two derived parameters of fire activity include burned area (positive continuous) and the number of fire occurrences (zero-inflated counts), and are individually investigated at a 0.1 degrees-resolution by means of five common statistical and machine-learning techniques. We evaluate performance and consistency among the models using the adjusted coefficient of determination and the root mean square error, which is obtained from 5-repeated 10-fold cross-validation. A comparable measure of predictor importance among the models is assessed by means of a permutation-based approach. As spatial autocorrelation is present for both parameters of fire activity, we consider this with a spatial cross-validation setup, where k-Means clusters of geographic coordinates are used to derive the test partitions. We find complex machine-learning techniques generally improve the predictions of both parameters of fire activity. Our results confirm the exceptional importance of mean annual precipitation for fire activity across Namibia and highlight human impacts as an additional control of fuel availability. Apart from an increase of burned area and fire occurrences at a mean annual precipitation of approximately 400 mm, population and livestock densities strongly limit fire activity in the best-performing Random Forest models. The largest burned areas are found with moderate green-up rates of vegetation, which we attribute to the presence of open landscapes. The consideration of spatial autocorrelation generally decreases model performances but the relative decreases are higher for the models of burned area, which we attribute to the increased spatial autocorrelation present with this response variable. Resultantly, we recommend accounting for spatial autocorrelation in the evaluation of spatial ecological models and the assessment of predictor importance. Although Namibia's land use practices denote a special case, our model may be of relevance to other regions located at the arid fringe of fire-affected ecosystems and those with projected future aridification.

TI  - Population genomic data reveal extreme geographic subdivision and novel conservation actions for the declining foothill yellow-legged frog
T2  - HEREDITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Genomic data have the potential to inform high resolution landscape genetic and biological conservation studies that go far beyond recent mitochondrial and microsatellite analyses. We characterize the relationships of populations of the foothill yellow-legged frog, Rana boylii, a declining, "sentinel" species for stream ecosystems throughout its range in California and Oregon. We generated RADseq data and applied phylogenetic methods, hierarchical Bayesian clustering, PCA and population differentiation with admixture analyses to characterize spatial genetic structure across the species range. To facilitate direct comparison with previous analyses, we included many localities and individuals from our earlier work based on mitochondrial DNA. The results are striking, and emphasize the power of our landscape genomic approach. We recovered five extremely differentiated primary clades that indicate that R. boylii may be the most genetically differentiated anuran yet studied. Our results provide better resolution and more spatially consistent patterns than our earlier work, confirming the increased resolving power of genomic data compared to single-locus studies. Genomic structure is not equal across the species distribution. Approximately half the range of R. boylii consists of a single, relatively uniform population, while Sierra Nevada and coastal California clades are deeply, hierarchically substructured with biogeographic breaks observed in other codistributed taxa. Our results indicate that clades should serve as management units for R. boylii rather than previously suggested watershed boundaries, and that the near-extinct population from southwestern California is particularly diverged, exhibits the lowest genetic diversity, and is a critical conservation target for species recovery.

T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The gain-loss approach for greenhouse gas inventories requires estimates of areas of human activity and estimates of emissions per unit area for each activity. Stratified sampling and estimation have emerged as a popular and useful statistical approach for estimation of activity areas. With this approach, a map depicting classes of activity is used to stratify the area of interest. For each map class used as a stratum, map units are randomly selected and assessed with respect to an attribute such as forest/non-forest or forest land cover change. Ground observations are generally accepted as the most accurate source of information for these assessments but may be cost-prohibitive to acquire for remote and inaccessible forest regions. In lieu of ground observations, visual interpretations of remotely sensed data such as aerial imagery or satellite imagery are often used with the caveat that the interpretations must be of greater quality than the map data. An unresolved issue pertains to the effects of interpreter error on the bias and precision of the stratified estimators of activity areas.For a 7500-km(2) study area in north central Minnesota in the United States of America, combinations of forest inventory plot observations, visual interpretations of aerial imagery, and two forest/non-forest maps were used to assess the effects of interpreter error on stratified estimators of proportion forest and corresponding standard errors. The primary objectives related to estimating the bias and precision of the stratified estimators in the presence of interpreter errors, identifying factors and the levels of those factors that affect bias and precision, and facilitating planning to circumvent and/or mitigate the effects of bias. The primary results were that interpreter error induces bias into the stratified estimators of both land cover class proportion and its standard error. Bias increased with greater inequality in stratum weights, smaller map and interpreter accuracies, fewer interpreters and greater correlations among interpreters. Failure to account for interpreter error produced stratified standard errors that under-estimated actual standard errors by factors as great as 2.3. Greater number of interpreters mitigated the effects of interpreter error on proportion forest estimates, and a hybrid variance estimator accounted for the effects on standard errors.

TI  - Wild pigs as sentinels for hard ticks: A case study from south-central Florida
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY-PARASITES AND WILDLIFE
M3  - Article
AB  - As a result of shifts in the habitable range of ticks due to climate change and the ongoing threat of exotic tick species introductions, efficient surveillance tools for these pests and disease vectors are needed. Wild pigs are habitat generalists, distributed throughout most of the United States, and often hunted recreationally or removed as part of management programs, making them potentially useful sentinel hosts for ticks. We compared ticks collected from captured wild pigs and standard tick dragging methods on a south-central Florida cattle ranch from May 2015-August 2017. Three hundred and sixteen wild pigs were surveyed, and 84 km spanning three habitat types (seminative pasture, improved pasture, and hammock) were dragged. In total, 1023 adults of four species (Amblyomma auricularium, Amblyomma maculatum, Dermacentor variabilis, and Ixodes scapularis) were collected from wild pigs, while 39 adults of three species (A. auricularium, A. maculatum, and I. scapularis) were collected from drags. Only one immature specimen, a nymph, was collected from a pig, while dragging collected 2808 larvae and 150 nymphs. Amblyomma maculatum comprised 96% of adults collected from pigs, while A. maculatum, I. scapularis, and A. auricularium comprised 38%, 33%, and 28% of adults collected from drags, respectively. Adults of all tick species found on drags were found on pigs, and wild pig surveillance detected adults of an additional species not found on drags. Dragging was far superior for collection of immatures but not for adults of most species found in this study. These findings suggest wild pigs could be used as a sentinel for the detection of tick species. When combined with ongoing wild pig research, hunting, or management, wild pig surveillance can provide an effective method to survey for adult tick presence of some species of interest and may assist in tracking the range expansion of some tick species.

TI  - SPECT/CT-guided lymph drainage mapping for the planning of unilateral elective nodal irradiation in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
T2  - EUROPEAN ARCHIVES OF OTO-RHINO-LARYNGOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - To investigate the feasibility of lymph drainage mapping (LDM) using SPECT/CT to help select head and neck cancer (HNSCC) patients for unilateral elective neck irradiation (ENI). Patients with lateralized HNSCC treated with radiotherapy routinely undergo bilateral ENI, despite the incidence of contralateral regional failure being relatively low even after unilateral ENI. We hypothesized that patients with a lateralized tumor without visible lymph drainage to the contralateral neck have an extremely low risk of contralateral involved nodes. Excluding the contralateral neck from elective irradiation will reduce radiation-induced toxicity and improve quality-of-life.Fifty-five patients with lateralized cT1-3N0-2bM0 HNSCC not crossing the midline underwent LDM. Radiolabeled Tc-99m-nanocolloid was injected in 4-5 depots around and in the primary tumor. Lymph drainage patterns were visualized using planar scintigraphy and SPECT/CT after 4 h. We report on the incidence of contralateral drainage, the location of draining areas, and the size of underlying nodes.Lymphatic drainage was successfully visualized in 54 patients (98%). In 11 patients (20%) with visible contralateral drainage, 14 draining areas (16 nodes; median volume 0.50 cc, diameter 8.0 mm) were identified. Neck levels with contralateral drainage were level II (88%), III (25%), and IV (13%). Contralateral drainage was significantly higher in T3 compared to T1-2 tumors (45 and 14%, respectively, P = 0.035).SPECT/CT-guided LDM is feasible and can be used to guide unilateral ENI in HNSCC patients in prospective studies. In addition, the anatomical confidence in visualization of contralateral drainage indicates a potential for ENI limited to draining levels alone.

TI  - An Improved Phase Filter for Differential SAR Interferometry Based on an Iterative Method
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Phase quality is a key element in the analysis of the deformation of the Earth's surface carried out with differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry. Various decorrelation sources may degrade the surface deformation estimates, and thus, phase filters are needed for this kind of application. The wellknown Goldstein filter is the most widely used due to its simple implementation and computational efficiency. In the past years, improved filters have been proposed, which are based on this filter but introduce variations in the data processing. The effectiveness of these filters mostly depends on the size of the filtering window, the weight of the smoothed spectrum, and the kernel used to filter the spectrum. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of four of these filters and present a new method that outperforms all of them. The proposed filter is based on an iterative method in which the original phase is denoised progressively with adaptive filtering windows of different sizes. The effectiveness of the filter is controlled by the interferometric coherence, a direct indicator of the phase quality. Moreover, we introduce some modifications regarding the processing of the power spectrum. Specifically, we propose to smooth the original phase using a new filter which is based on a Chebyshev interpolation scheme. The performance of the new filter has been tested on both simulated and real interferograms, acquired by RADARSAT-2 and the Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar, which mapped two different geological events that caused surface deformation.

TI  - Estimation of Power Plant Emissions With Unscented Kalman Filter
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Emissions from power plants constitute a major part of air pollution and should be adequately estimated. In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating nitrogen dioxide (NOX) emission of power plants by developing an inverse method to integrate satellite observations of atmospheric pollutant column concentrations with species concentrations and direct sensitivities predicted by a regional air quality model, in order to discern biases in the emissions of the pollutant precursors. Using this method, the emission fields are analyzed using a "bottom-up" approach, with an inversion performed by an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) to improve estimation profiles from emissions inventories data for the Sydney metropolitan area. The idea is to integrate information from the original inventories with tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emissions estimated during one month from the air pollution model-chemical transport model, and then, for validation, to compare the resulting model with satellite retrievals from the ozone monitoring instrument (OMI) above the region. The UKF-based estimation of NO2 emissions shows better agreement with OMI observations, implying a significant improvement in accuracy as compared with the original inventories. Therefore, the proposed method is a promising tool for estimation of air emissions in urban areas.

TI  - Monitoring Thermal Activity of the Beppu Geothermal Area in Japan Using Multisource Satellite Thermal Infrared Data
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Beppu geothermal area, one of the largest spa resorts on the northeast Kyushu Island of Japan, is fed by hydrothermal fluids beneath the volcanic center of Mt. Garan and Mt. Tsurumi in the west. We explored the thermal status of the Beppu geothermal area using nighttime multisource satellite thermal infrared data (TIR) from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and Landsat 8 thermal infrared scanner (TIRS) to monitor heat loss from 2009 to 2017. We also assessed heat loss from Mt. Garan fumaroles to investigate a relationship between them. The normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) threshold method of spectral emissivity, the split-window algorithm for land surface temperature (LST), and the Stefan-Boltzmann equation for radiative heat flux (RHF) were used to estimate heat loss in this study. Total heat loss increased by about a 35% trend overall from 2009 to 2015 and then declined about 33-42% in 2017 in both the Beppu geothermal area and Mt. Garan fumaroles overall. The higher thermal anomalies were found in 2015 mostly in the southeastern coastal area of the Beppu geothermal region. The highest thermal anomaly was obtained in 2011 and the lowest in 2017 within the Mt. Garan fumaroles. The areas with a higher range of RHF values were recorded in 2015 in both study areas. Finally, the results show similar patterns of heat loss and thermal anomalies in both the Beppu geothermal area and Mt. Garan fumaroles, indicating a closely connected geothermal system overall. This suggests that nighttime TIR data are effective for monitoring the thermal status of the Beppu geothermal area.

AB  - The Mediterranean region is a unique area characterized by a large spectrum of atmospheric phenomena, some of which have a high impact on many aspects of human activities, safety and wellbeing. The area is long considered as a hot spot of such atmospheric phenomena deserving multidisciplinary scientific attention. The scientific research that has been carried out on these high impact atmospheric processes that occur in the Mediterranean area is indeed widespread and the available international literature is very extensive. The paper touches initially the temperature and precipitation regimes, followed by a discussion of floods and droughts. The exciting cyclogenetic patterns of explosive cyclones and medicanes are presented in separate sections. The lightning activity and the presence of dust and other pollutants are also presented herein. The atmospheric chemistry of the region which is increasingly becoming of utmost importance for the area under study is distinctly discussed. Attempts to modify the weather (the precipitation, in particular) are outlined too. The effects of climatic change on various atmospheric processes are considered throughout this paper, in addition to a dedicated section on temperature and precipitation.

TI  - Merkel Cell Carcinoma of the Wrist: A Case Report
T2  - ANNALS OF PLASTIC SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose Merkel cell carcinomas are a rare type of neuroendocrine tumors of the head, neck, and extremities commonly found in older patients. Merkel cell carcinomas present as red-to-purple and nontender nodules with or without surface ulceration, usually measuring 2 cm in diameter.Case Presentations An 83-year-old woman with a skin-colored nodule on the dorsal aspect of her right wrist was referred to our department for treatment. The regional lymph nodes were not palpable, and the positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan did not reveal any distant metastases. We conducted wide excision of the lesion and sentinel lymph node biopsy. The defect caused by the excision and partial bone resection was reconstructed using a radical forearm rotational flap and a split-thickness skin graft. Postoperatively, the patient received adjuvant radiation therapy. We observed wound healing and an absence of complications such as recurrence at 1-year follow-up.Conclusions Merkel cell carcinomas are rare but aggressive neuroendocrine skin cancers, which rarely occur in the upper extremity. Our treatment of nonamputative wide excision and sentinel lymph node dissection, followed by postoperative radiation therapy, showed no local or distant recurrence. Here, we review the current literature on Merkel cell carcinomas and describe our approach of treatment.

TI  - Processes controlling the downstream evolution of ice rheology in glacier shear margins: case study on Rutford Ice Stream, West Antarctica
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ice rheology governs how glaciers flow and respond to environmental change. The rheology of glacier ice evolves in response to a variety of mechanisms, including damage, heating, melting and the development of crystalline fabric. The relative contributions of these rheological mechanisms are not well understood. Using remotely sensed data and physical models, we decouple the influence of each of the aforementioned mechanisms along the margins of Rutford Ice Stream, a laterally confined outlet glacier in West Antarctica. We show that fabric is an important control on ice rheology in the shear margins, with an inferred softening effect consistent with a single-maximum fabric. Fabric evolves to steady state near the onset of streaming flow, and ice progressively softens downstream almost exclusively due to shear heating. The rate of heating is sensitive to local shear strain rates, which respond to local changes in bed topography as ice is squeezed through the basal trough. The impact of shear heating on the downstream evolution of ice rheology in a laterally confined glacier suggests that the thermoviscous feedback - wherein faster ice flow leads to higher rates of shear heating, further softening the ice - is a fundamental control on glacier dynamics.

TI  - Effects of hydrological events on morphological evolution of a fluvial system
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study quantifies morphological evolution of the Dez River, Iran, from 1955 to 2016. The approach uses a sequence of Landsat images, aerial photos, and topographic maps. In addition, the hydrological data including average daily discharge and yearly maximum discharge at the Dezful hydrological station for the period (1955-2016) were used. The study reach was divided into 48 meander loops from upstream to downstream. Active channel width (w) was determined at 10 m intervals and changes assessed along the study reach of the Dez River. Morphological indices including sinuosity index; straight meander length; centerline flow length; erosion area; erodible length channel migration; centerline elongation; and radius of curvature were calculated in the reach. Results showed that the study reach of the Dez River changed dramatically in response to major floods, although the general trend is towards a narrowing of active channel width by 38% in the period 1955-2016. Results show that most of the meander loops in the study area extended and expanded. Between 1989 and 1995, all types of meander change were observed. There was a direct correlation between the frequency of hydrological events (flood days) bigger than 2-years return period and elongation of bends.

TI  - Fine Resolution Epithermal Neutron Detector (FREND) Onboard the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter
T2  - SPACE SCIENCE REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - ExoMars is a two-launch mission undertaken by Roscosmos and European Space Agency. Trace Gas Orbiter, a satellite part of the 2016 launch carries the Fine Resolution Neutron Detector instrument as part of its payload. The instrument aims at mapping hydrogen content in the upper meter of Martian soil with spatial resolution between 60 and 200 km diameter spot. This resolution is achieved by a collimation module that limits the field of view of the instruments detectors. A dosimetry module that surveys the radiation environment in cruise to Mars and on orbit around it is another part of the instrument.This paper describes the mission and the instrument, its measurement principles and technical characteristics. We perform an initial assessment of our sensitivity and time required to achieve the mission goal. The Martian atmosphere is a parameter that needs to be considered in data analysis of a collimated neutron instrument. This factor is described in a section of this paper. Finally, the first data accumulated during cruise to Mars is presented.

TI  - Monitoring of an Indonesian Tropical Wetland by Machine Learning-Based Data Fusion of Passive and Active Microwave Sensors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a novel data fusion approach was used to monitor the water-body extent in a tropical wetland (Lake Sentarum, Indonesia). Monitoring is required in the region to support the conservation of water resources and biodiversity. The developed approach, random forest database unmixing (RFDBUX), makes use of pixel-based random forest regression to overcome the limitations of the existing lookup-table-based approach (DBUX). The RFDBUX approach with passive microwave data (AMSR2) and active microwave data (PALSAR-2) was used from 2012 to 2017 in order to obtain PALSAR-2-like images with a 100 m spatial resolution and three-day temporal resolution. In addition, a thresholding approach for the obtained PALSAR-2-like backscatter coefficient images provided water body extent maps. The validation revealed that the spatial patterns of the images predicted by RFDBUX are consistent with the original PALSAR-2 backscatter coefficient images (r = 0.94, RMSE = 1.04 in average), and that the temporal pattern of the predicted water body extent can track the wetland dynamics. The PALSAR-2-like images should be a useful basis for further investigation of the hydrological/climatological features of the site, and the proposed approach appears to have the potential for application in other tropical regions worldwide.

TI  - Multi-temporal, multi-frequency, and multi-polarization coherence and SAR backscatter analysis of wetlands
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite recent research into the Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technique for wetland mapping worldwide, its capability has not yet been thoroughly investigated for Canadian wetland ecosystems. Accordingly, this study statistically analysed interferometric coherence and SAR backscatter variation in a study area located on the Avalon Peninsula, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, consisting of various wetland classes, including bog, fen, marsh, swamp, and shallow-water. Specifically, multi-temporal L-band ALOS PALSAR-1, C-band RADARSAT-2, and X-band TerraSAR-X data were used to investigate the effect of SAR frequency and polarization, as well as temporal baselines on the coherence degree in the various wetland classes. SAR backscatter and coherence maps were also used as input features into an object-based Random Forest classification scheme to examine the contribution of these features to the overall classification accuracy. Our findings suggested that the temporal baseline was the most influential factor for coherence maintenance in herbaceous wetlands, especially for shorter wavelengths. In general, coherence was the highest in L-band and intermediate/low for both X- and C-band, depending on the wetland classes and temporal baseline. The Wilcoxon rank sum test at the 5% significance level found significant difference (P-value < 0.05) between the mean values of HH/HV coherence at the peak of growing season. The test also suggested that L-band intensity and X-band coherence observations were advantageous to discriminate complex wetland classes. Notably, an overall classification accuracy of 74.33% was attained for land cover classification by synergistic use of both SAR backscatter and interferometric coherence. Thus, the results of this study confirmed the potential of incorporating SAR and InSAR features for mapping Canadian wetlands and those elsewhere in the world with similar ecological characteristics.

TI  - Computer-aided prediction model for axillary lymph node metastasis in breast cancer using tumor morphological and textural features on ultrasound
T2  - COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and objectives: Axillary lymph node (ALN) status is a key indicator in assessing and determining the treatment strategy for patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer. Previous studies suggest that sonographic features of a primary tumor have the potential to predict ALN status in the preoperative staging of breast cancer. In this study, a computer-aided prediction (CAP) model as well as the tumor features for ALN metastasis in breast cancers were developed using breast ultrasound (US) images.Methods: A total of 249 malignant tumors were acquired from 247 female patients (ages 20-84 years; mean 55 +/- 11 years) to test the differences between the non-metastatic (130) and metastatic (119) groups based on various features. After applying semi-automatic tumor segmentation, 69 quantitative features were extracted. The features included morphology and texture of tumors inside a ROI of breast US image. By the backward feature selection and linear logistic regression, the prediction model was constructed and established to estimate the likelihood of ALN metastasis for each sample collected.Results: In the experiments, the texture features showed higher performance for predicting ALN metastasis compared to morphology (Az, 0.730 vs 0.667). The difference, however, was not statistically significant (p-values > 0.05). Combining the textural and morphological features, the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and Az value achieved 75.1% (187/249), 79.0% (94/119), 71.5% (93/130), and 0.757, respectively.Conclusions: The proposed CAP model, which combines textural and morphological features of primary tumor, may be a useful method to determine the ALN status in patients with breast cancer.

T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This case study investigates peri-urban land-use conflicts and changes, in a typical African setting, for a village located on the outskirts of the capital city of Gaborone-Botswana, in order to explore policy implications for sustainable core-region development. The year 1982 provided the baseline situation that was compared with other dates, namely: 1996; 2006 and 2012 in order to analyze land-use conflicts, competition, and succession. The study tracked the landuse changes using: Geographic Information System (GIS), with 1:50 000 air photos taken in 1982; Landsat images from 1996 and 2006 as well as 2012 Google images of medium resolution. The investigation also relied on a social survey, historical landscape reconstruction approaches, field interviews and direct observations. An analysis of 1982 aerial photographs revealed that Gabane Village had experienced little urban influence from the city of Gaborone at that time. Subsequently, stakeholders with different socio-economic demand emerged. This caused extensive land-use changes over the study period. The residents of Gabane nonetheless employed diverse adaptive strategies to sustain their livelihoods. An analysis of the proposed 2001-2025 Development Plan for Gabane Village, identifies possible future land-use changes and conflicts and proposes tentative policy solutions for the emerging sustainable development challenges.

TI  - Impact of flood and seasonality on wetland changing trends in the Diara region of West Bengal, India
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The hydrological condition of any floodplain wetland depends on the water availability through surface run-off from adjacent areas. The seasonal variation of rainfall and resultant flood bring massive change in the wetlands of that region. The present study focuses on identifying wetland inventories and trend of wetlands of the Diara region of West Bengal. Diara region of Eastern India is a highly dynamic physical region bounded by two frequently shifting rivers (River Ganga and Kalindri) and relatively tightly bound river Mahananda in its three sides. Two types of Normalised Difference Water Index, water presence frequency and hydrological stability analysis using LANDSAT data of 1973-2016 have been done for this study. The result shows that the wetland area was 14,124.78 ha during 1999 and it has turned into 4885.92 ha during 2016 which indicates the extreme flood event of 1998-1999 over entire region has brought a boost in the wetland scenario for a shorter period but it is in the decaying phase now-a-days. Total 1552.56 ha of wetland in this area is identified as stable based on the regular appearance of water over there.

TI  - Intercomparison of Satellite Remote Sensing-Based Flood Inundation Mapping Techniques
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the accuracy of five different digital image processing techniques to map flood inundation extent with Landsat 8-Operational Land Imager satellite imagery. The May 2016 flooding event in the Hempstead region of the Brazos River, Texas is used as a case study for this first comprehensive comparison of classification techniques of its kind. Five flood water classification techniques (i.e., supervised classification, unsupervised classification, delta-cue change detection, Normalized Difference Water Index [NDWI], modified NDWI [MNDWI]) were implemented to characterize flooded regions. To identify flood water obscured by cloud cover, a digital elevation model (DEM)-based approach was employed. Classified floods were compared using an Advanced Fitness Index to a reference flood map created based on manual digitization, as well as other data sources, using the same satellite image. Supervised classification yielded the highest accuracy of 86.4%, while unsupervised, MNDWI, and NDWI closely followed at 79.6%, 77.3%, and 77.1%, respectively. Delta-cue change detection yielded the lowest accuracy with 70.1%. Thus, supervised classification is recommended for flood water classification and inundation map generation under these settings. The DEM-based approach used to identify cloud-obscured flood water pixels was found reliable and easy to apply. It is therefore recommended for regions with relatively flat topography.

T2  - FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 17th Biennial Meeting of the International-Association-of-Craniofacial-Identification (IACI)
CL  - Brisbane, AUSTRALIA
AB  - Soft tissues of the human face hang from the skull under the downward vector of gravity. Subsequently, the fall of the tissues is not likely the same between supine, prone or upright positions with ramifications for soft tissue measurements such as average soft tissue thicknesses used in craniofacial identification. Here we use high-resolution Dimensional Imaging1 DI3D stereo-photographs (Glasgow, Scotland) to map the shape change between upright and supine position in the same 62 participants and encode the surface shell differences as greyscale pixel intensity values. Statistical tests were conducted using MANOVA at 31 capulometric landmarks, with posture as the independent factor in a repeated measures design, and sex, somatotype and age (two groups of <50 and >50 years) as independent factors in a between subjects design. Results indicate that facial morphology changed in characteristic fashion between the positions: when supine, the soft tissue extruded inferior and lateral to the eyes (Delta(min) = +1.2 mm; Delta(max) = +3.0 mm, p < 0.05) and retracted lateral to the mouth and around the nasolabial fold (Delta(min) = -1.0 mm; Delta(max) = -2.4 mm, p < 0.05). These patterns were more marked in older subjects (posture = p < 0.01, eta(2) = 0.55; and age = p < 0.01; eta(2) = 0.29). By calculating mean heat maps for the faces, this study clearly demonstrates that posture influences the cheeks/eyes as well as the nasolabial fold, thereby holding broader ramifications for face morphology than previously reported. Since many prior facial soft tissue thickness studies report data for supine subjects, correction factors are provided for converting supine facial soft tissue thickness data to upright estimates. Out-of-sample performance tests of posture-corrected supine means derived from two CT samples (using upright B-mode ultrasound data from living subjects as ground truths) confirmed the utility of the correction factors for landmarks that fall in zones affected most by the posture change (lower standard errors after correction). The standard error improvements were -0.9, -0.6, -0.5, and -1.4 mm respectively for the mio-mio', go-go', zy-zy' and mr-mr' landmarks (reductions indicated by the negative sign).

TI  - Land surface temperature trends as indicator of land use changes in wetlands
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The impacts of agricultural expansion on wetlands are diverse and complex. Land surface temperature (LST) has a great potential to act as a global indicator of the status of wetlands and changes in their hydrological and evapotranspiration regimes, which are often linked to land use and cover changes. We use the whole MODIS LST archive (2000-2017) to perform time series analysis in the Kilombero catchment, Tanzania; a large wetland that has experienced major land conversions to agriculture during the last two decades. We estimated pixel based trends using three models: a seasonal trend model, and aggregated time series using annual means and percentile 90. We characterized the trends found by using land cover change maps derived from Landsat imagery and a post-classification comparison. The relation between Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and LST trends was also studied (r = - 0.56). The results given by the seasonal trend model and annual means were similar (r = 0.81). Fewer significant trends were found using the percentile 90, and these had larger magnitudes. Positive LST trends (i.e. increasing) corresponded to deforestation and farmland expansion into the floodplain, while forestation processes resulted in negative LST trends. Moderate increases of LST in natural wetlands suggest that the impacts of human activities extend also into non-cultivated areas. We provide evidence of how time series analysis of LST data can be successfully used to monitor and study changes in wetland ecosystems at regional and local scales.

TI  - Short-lived pause in Central California subsidence after heavy winter precipitation of 2017
T2  - SCIENCE ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tulare Basin in Central California is a site of intensive agricultural activity and extraction of groundwater, with pronounced ground subsidence and degradation of water resources over the past century. Spatially extensive observations of ground displacements from satellite-based remote sensing allow us to infer the response of the aquifer system to changes in usage and to marked recharge events such as the heavy winter rainfall in 2017. Radar imagery from the Sentinel-1a/b satellites (November 2014 to October 2017) illuminates secular and seasonal trends modulated by changes in withdrawal rates and the magnitude of winter precipitation. Despite the increased precipitation in early 2017 that led to a marked decrease, or in some areas, reversal, of subsidence rates, subsidence returned to rates observed during the drought within a matter of months.

TI  - Spatial patterns of long-term vegetation greening and browning are consistent across multiple scales: Implications for monitoring land degradation
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding spatial-temporal patterns of terrestrial vegetation response to climate change (long-term greening/browning) is important for developing strategies to mitigate degradation. Semiarid rangelands are especially susceptible to degradation, which challenges wildlife conservation and human livelihoods that depend on livestock production. In the cold-arid Trans-Himalayan ecosystem (northern India), temperature is increasing, and it is also becoming progressively wetter. Yet, counter-intuitively, there are widespread concerns over degradation. We evaluated whether greening/browning patterns in long-term satellite-derived vegetation indices (normalized difference vegetation index [NDVI]) are consistent across different spatial and temporal scales using 6 datasets: MODIS (250m, 500m, 1km, and 5.5km), SPOT 1km, and GIMMS 8km. Results indicate browning in the spring and greening in late summer. Location of hotspots of degradation (browning) was broadly consistent across spatial scales (10(-2)-10(2)km(2)) and were found in regions with warmer temperature and at higher elevations. Broadly, the spatial/temporal pattern of browning does not coincide strongly with location and timing of human land use via livestock grazing. This geographical and seasonal context indicates that vegetation response may be more strongly related to climate than to human land use (overgrazing). Importantly, the dynamic nature of greening/browning, across space and time, is not captured by composite annual metrics (sum-NDVI, max-NDVI, and mean-NDVI). This reiterates the importance of both intraannual and interannual assessments. Location of hotspots indicates that degradation occurs in a spatially contiguous manner, but these are not stationary and instead shift with seasons. Overall, the results show that evaluating the consistency of greening/browning trends across different spatial/temporal scales is critical for understanding and managing vegetation degradation.

M3  - Article
AB  - Space based earth observation technology applicable to forest inventory and monitoring is well known in the scientific community. High-resolution satellite images form an important data source for forest mapping and change detection at regional and national scales. The value of forest change information derived from remote sensing data is significantly enhanced if this information is integrated into a spatially explicit geographic information system. Satellite-based rapid assessment was conducted to measure spatiotemporal changes in Batudulang forest over the years. The general approach to quantify change in the spatial aspect of the forest involved change detection using moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer satellite-based normalized difference vegetation index. A further top-down approach using high-resolution data from Google Earth was used to complement the mapping and specifically identify areas of spatial, temporal, and thematic change on a grid basis (1 x 1 sq. km .). Results from change detection studies revealed that the forest area changed from 287 sq. km . in 2008 to 189 sq. km . in 2016. Visual image interpretation of high-resolution Google Earth images (2001-2013) analyzed 63 grids, of which 30 showed significant change and 33 exhibited no change.

TI  - Wheat and maize yield forecasting for the Tisza river catchment using MODIS NDVI time series and reported crop statistics
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Stakeholders, policy makers, government planners and agricultural market participants in Central Eastern Europe require accurate and timely information about wheat and maize yield and production. The study site, the lowlands (altitude below 200 m) of the Tisza river catchment is by far the most important wheat and corn producing region in the Carpathian basin, and even in Central Eastern Europe. The conventional sampling of on field data and data processing for crop forecasting requires significant amounts of time before official reports can be released. Several studies have shown that wheat and maize yield can be effectively forecast using satellite remote sensing. In this study, a freely available MODIS NDVI satellite data based wheat and maize yield forecasting methodology was developed and evaluated for estimating yield losses effected by drought.Wheat and maize yield was derived by regressing reported yield values against time series of 15 different peak-season MODIS-derived NDVI. The lowest RMSE values at the river basin level for both wheat and maize yield forecast versus reported yield were found when using at least six or more years of training data. Wheat forecast for the 2000 to 2015 growing seasons were within 0.819% and 19.08% of final reported yield values. Maize forecast at county level for the 2000 to 2015 growing seasons were within 0.299% and 17.14% of final reported yield values. The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency index (E-1 ) is positive with E-1 = 0.322 in the case of wheat forecast, and with E-1 = 0.401 in the case of maize forecast, which means the developed and evaluated forecasting method performs acceptable forecast efficiency. Nevertheless the occurrence of extreme drought or extreme precipitation can alter the forecasting efficiency resulting over or underestimation. Overall statement, which based on MODIS NDVI, possible yield losses can easily be forecasted 6-8 weeks before harvesting and applying simple threshold levels, yield losses can be mapped simply.

AB  - Sentinel lymph node (SLN) based pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) in prostate cancer (PCa) is appealing over the time, cost and morbidity classically attributed to conventional PLND during radical prostatectomy. The initial report of feasibility of the SLN concept in prostate cancer was nearly 20years ago. However, PLND based on the SLN concept, either SLN biopsy of a single node or targeted SLN dissection of multiple nodes, is still considered investigational in PCa. To better appreciate the challenges, and potential solutions, associated with SLN-based PLND in PCa, this review will discuss the rationale behind PLND in PCa and evaluate current SLN efforts in the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in men in the US.

AB  - Breast cancer metastasizes through the lymphovascular system to the regional lymph nodes in the axilla and to both visceral and non-visceral sites. Renewed interest in the route by which tumor cells gain access to blood and lymphatic capillaries are the subject of research at mechanical, anatomic, pathologic, genetic, epidemiologic and molecular levels. Two papers presented at the 7th International Symposium on Cancer Metastasis in San Francisco showed tumor cells entering the systemic circulation through the sentinel lymph node. This information challenges the current paradigm where clinicians believe that access is gained through intra- and peri-tumoral blood vessels and that metastasis to axillary lymph nodes is an interesting epi-phenomenon. The sentinel lymph node era has changed the modern surgical approach to the axilla and the basis of this change is summarized in this paper. A new approach to the management of axillary metastases after systemic therapy relies on determining whether there is a complete pathologic response; if no tumor is found in the previously biopsied node, a complete axillary lymph node dissection may be avoided. African American women seem to inherit a trait from West African ancestors and tend to develop more lethal types of breast cancer. These tumors may have a molecular machinery that enhances their ability to metastasize to visceral sites and future research may unearth the mechanisms for this phenomenon.

TI  - Deep Recurrent Neural Network for Agricultural Classification using multitemporal SAR Sentinel-1 for Camargue, France
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The development and improvement of methods to map agricultural land cover are currently major challenges, especially for radar images. This is due to the speckle noise nature of radar, leading to a less intensive use of radar rather than optical images. The European Space Agency Sentinel-1 constellation, which recently became operational, is a satellite system providing global coverage of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) with a 6-days revisit period at a high spatial resolution of about 20 m. These data are valuable, as they provide spatial information on agricultural crops. The aim of this paper is to provide a better understanding of the capabilities of Sentinel-1 radar images for agricultural land cover mapping through the use of deep learning techniques. The analysis is carried out on multitemporal Sentinel-1 data over an area in Camargue, France. The data set was processed in order to produce an intensity radar data stack from May 2017 to September 2017. We improved this radar time series dataset by exploiting temporal filtering to reduce noise, while retaining as much as possible the fine structures present in the images. We revealed that even with classical machine learning approaches (K nearest neighbors, random forest, and support vector machines), good performance classification could be achieved with F-measure/Accuracy greater than 86% and Kappa coefficient better than 0.82. We found that the results of the two deep recurrent neural network (RNN)-based classifiers clearly outperformed the classical approaches. Finally, our analyses of the Camargue area results show that the same performance was obtained with two different RNN-based classifiers on the Rice class, which is the most dominant crop of this region, with a F-measure metric of 96%. These results thus highlight that in the near future these RNN-based techniques will play an important role in the analysis of remote sensing time series.

M3  - Review
AB  - Intraoperative fluorescence imaging (IFI) can improve real-time identification of cancer cells during an operation. Phase I clinical trials in thoracic surgery have demonstrated that IFI with second window indocyanine green (TumorGlow((R))) can identify subcentimeter pulmonary nodules, anterior mediastinal masses, and mesothelioma, while the use of a folate receptor-targeted near-infrared agent, OTL38, can improve the specificity for diagnosing tumors with folate receptor expression. Here, we review the existing preclinical and clinical data on IFI in thoracic surgery.

TI  - Groundwater Withdrawals Under Drought: Reconciling GRACE and Land Surface Models in the United States High Plains Aquifer
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Advanced Land Surface Models (LSM) offer a powerful tool for studying hydrological variability. Highly managed systems, however, present a challenge for these models, which typically have simplified or incomplete representations of human water use. Here we examine recent groundwater declines in the US High Plains Aquifer (HPA), a region that is heavily utilized for irrigation and that is also affected by episodic drought. To understand observed decline in groundwater and terrestrial water storage during a recent multiyear drought, we modify the Noah-MP LSM to include a groundwater irrigation scheme. To account for seasonal and interannual variability in active irrigated area, we apply a monthly time-varying greenness vegetation fraction (GVF) data set within the model. A set of five experiments were performed to study the impact of groundwater irrigation on the simulated hydrological cycle of the HPA and to assess the importance of time-varying GVF when simulating drought conditions. The results show that including the groundwater irrigation scheme improves model agreement with ALEXI ET data, mascon-based GRACE TWS data, and depth-to-groundwater measurements in the southern HPA, including Texas and Kansas, and that accounting for time-varying GVF is important for model realism under drought. Results for the HPA in Nebraska are mixed, likely due to the model's weaknesses in representing subsurface hydrology in this region. This study highlights the value of GRACE data sets for model evaluation and development and the potential to advance the dynamic representations of the interactions between human water use and the hydrological cycle.

TI  - The spatial distribution of critical wind erosion centers according to the dust event in Hormozgan province (south of Iran)
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Wind erosion and its consequent dust storms has become one of the environmental risks in today's world, which has annually caused non-compensable destruction in environment and human health. Since wind erosion is one of the main factors of desertification which could result in dust storms, studying and locating the wind erosion centers in southern parts of Iran is of crucial importance. The aim of this study is to determine the spatial distribution of wind erosion centers associated to local dust event in Hormozgan province (south of Iran). Different factors such as soil features, climate, surface roughness, vegetation cover, topography and the length wind exposure should be investigated for zoning the potential wind erosion regions. Studies showed that many of these factors are relatively uniform for the study region. Therefore, zoning based on all of the above-mentioned factors is not efficient. For this reason, soil texture along with vegetation cover and topography were studied in the current study to zone wind erosion. First, satellite data of soil texture, normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI), and topography were used to address the potential regions of wind erosion in warm and cold periods of the year by ArcGIS. Then, the data of 14 synoptic stations in Hormozgan province were utilized to plot the maps of dust event occurrences. Finally, by combination of the satellite and synoptic data, the map of land sensitivity toward wind erosion was provided, and the obtained results were compared with observations of Forest, Ranges and Watershed Organization (FRWO) of Hormozgan province. The results indicated that there are potential regions for wind erosion and dust sources in the study region. In a way that coastal areas have the highest probability to become wind erosion centers. In this regard, Jask, Bandarabbas and Bandar Lengeh are the first three regions in terms of wind erosion; while Abu Musa has the lowest priority in terms of possessing wind erosion centers. Also, it was revealed that sensitivity to wind erosion and dust storms was higher in warm periods of the year as compared with the cold seasons. The results of this study are in agreement with the observations of FRWO of Hormozgan province. Therefore, desert greening measures and actions to prevent wind erosion can control many of dust storms in the regions.

TI  - NetworkGT: A GIS tool for geometric and topological analysis of two-dimensional fracture networks
T2  - GEOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Fractures rarely occur individually but more usually as networks of numerous fractures whose arrangement, abundance, and interaction control the mechanical and transport properties of rock masses. Of particular importance are the distributions and spatial variations of different geometric (locations, orientation, length, etc.) and topological (intersections, connectivity, etc.) attributes of fractures in a network. Geographical Information Systems (GIS) provide a means to map and digitize two-dimensional fracture networks from a variety of field and remote sensing data and to display the results in the form of quality maps. We introduce NetworkGT, an open-source toolbox for ArcGIS capable of efficient sampling, analysis, and spatial mapping of geometric and topological attributes of two-dimensional fracture networks. The toolbox helps to extract and plot geometric and topological information from a given two-dimensional fracture network including: rose diagrams, plots of frequency distribution and topology, and maps of topological parameters. Using a fracture network example from offshore NW Devon, United Kingdom, we illustrate the practicality and effectiveness of the toolbox. This includes computing a contour grid with 1326 subsampled regions within the fracture network, which is used to demonstrate the quantitative capabilities of the toolbox and the ability to spatially map important network properties. The toolbox will help to facilitate the increasing application of geometry and topology in the analysis and comparison of fracture networks at a range of scales. Furthermore, the integration of the NetworkGT toolbox into ArcGIS allows two-dimensional fracture networks to be interpreted, mapped, and fully analyzed within the same software package.

TI  - The role of discourse in family policy reform: The case of Finland
T2  - CRITICAL SOCIAL POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Since 2010 and the onset of the economic crisis, Finnish governments have pressed for structural reforms, including unpopular cuts to family benefits and services. This article analyses the government discourse used for legitimating some of these reforms: the cutbacks in child benefit and the restriction of full-time childcare. It also assesses whether this discourse bore the hallmarks of a neoliberal austerity discourse, which could suggest that the reforms were not just a matter of fiscal balancing but also a matter of neoliberal welfare state restructuring. We argue that the economic crisis was central in the powerful communicative' discourse used by the governments for legitimating unpopular cuts. Not only did it draw on ideas from an austerity discourse advocating financial sustainability, fiscal prudency and debt reduction, it was also impregnated with ideas from a neoliberal worldview questioning some of the main principles of the Nordic' family policy model.

TI  - Understanding the impacts of human resettlement and projected land use dynamics in Chimanimani district of Zimbabwe
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover change has been identified as a major driver of global environmental change. In agricultural landscapes that are undergoing land cover conversions, there is need to investigate the nature, extent and pattern of these conversions. This helps to assess the resultant forest cover changes and their consequences, as well as to help inform sustainable biodiversity conservation measures. This study tests whether and in what way agricultural expansion drives land cover change in resettled landscapes of Zimbabwe now and in the future. Classified Landsat Thematic Mapper images of 2000, 2009, and Landsat 8 image of 2013 were analyzed, using the widely used Markov modelling framework, to determine land use and land cover changes between the year 2000 and 2013, as well as future land cover dynamics in the area of interest. Specifically, land cover data was used to simulate land cover transitions up to 2050, using Markov chain model. Historic land cover modelling and future spatial predictions revealed increases in cropland accompanied by decreases in plantation and forests. This study concludes that agriculture is a major driver of land cover changes, especially forest cover changes in newly resettled agricultural landscapes.

TI  - Land Cover Change in the Lower Yenisei River Using Dense Stacking of Landsat Imagery in Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate warming is occurring at an unprecedented rate in the Arctic due to regional amplification, potentially accelerating land cover change. Measuring and monitoring land cover change utilizing optical remote sensing in the Arctic has been challenging due to persistent cloud and snow cover issues and the spectrally similar land cover types. Google Earth Engine (GEE) represents a powerful tool to efficiently investigate these changes using a large repository of available optical imagery. This work examines land cover change in the Lower Yenisei River region of arctic central Siberia and exemplifies the application of GEE using the random forest classification algorithm for Landsat dense stacks spanning the 32-year period from 1985 to 2017, referencing 1641 images in total. The semiautomated methodology presented here classifies the study area on a per-pixel basis utilizing the complete Landsat record available for the region by only drawing from minimally cloud- and snow-affected pixels. Climatic changes observed within the study area's natural environments show a statistically significant steady greening (21,000 km(2) transition from tundra to taiga) and a slight decrease (700 km(2)) in the abundance of large lakes, indicative of substantial permafrost degradation. The results of this work provide an effective semiautomated classification strategy for remote sensing in permafrost regions and map products that can be applied to future regional environmental modeling of the Lower Yenisei River region.

TI  - Catalytic abatement of CO species from incomplete combustion of solid fuels used in domestic cooking
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - This study reveals a first time approach to catalytic based interventions primarily on indoor air pollution emanating from commercial and household solid fuel burning in a region in Nigeria. An intensive survey of the temperatures at different locations in the common stoves used for cooking was conducted so as to ascertain temperatures suitable for catalyst efficiency and stability. Furthermore, cobalt and iron based catalysts were prepared using ultra stable Y type zeolite as supports. The synthesized catalysts were characterized for its physico-chemical properties. The catalytic efficiency of the supported catalysts was tested using simulated exhaust gases in a fix bed reactor. The study further explored real time testing of the catalyzed ceramic monolith using two different wood species. First, the best catalyst in terms of simulated exhaust testing was selected. Consequently, a small layer of zeolite Y was deposited at 3% of the monolith weight to enhance the subsequent adhesion of the best catalyst powder to the structured monolith. Then to catalyze the zeolite Y wash-coated monolith with the cobalt precursor, the dip fcoating technique was used. From the results, the average values of temperatures observed from the surveyed cook stoves using wood and plant residue as fuel were confirmed to be in the range of 203-425 degrees C which is considered suitable for catalysts activity. The Co/ZY catalyst showed approximately 100% CO conversion (T-100) at 250 degrees C for initial CO concentration of 1000 ppm, making it the most effective, while T-100 was increased to 275 degrees C and 325 degrees C for Fe/ZY and Co-Fe/ZY catalyst respectively at an exhaust residence time of 20000 h(-1). The catalytic converter in real time testing for CO abatement performed well for both wood species. Only minor differences have been noticed.

TI  - Influence of the margin vegetation on the conservation of aphid biological control in apple orchards
T2  - JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The influence of three margin strip treatments (wildflower strips, grass strips and spontaneous vegetation) adjacent to apple orchards on the biological control of Dysaphis plantaginea Passerini (Hemiptera: Aphididae) was compared during two consecutive years. The wildflower strips provided the highest amount of floral resources. Within the margin strips, hoverflies responded positively to higher resource provisioning whereas ladybird abundance did not differ between strip treatments. Within the orchards, the presence of parasitoids, hoverflies, and ladybirds in aphid colonies and the predation of sentinel aphids were not significantly affected by the adjacent strip treatments. The number of natural enemies observed in aphid colonies was mainly driven by aphid number. Aphid numbers were higher close to the margin strips suggesting that aphid colonization from orchard edges may counteract the positive effect of wildflower strips on natural enemy abundance and on a reduction of aphid infestation. The results confirm the positive influence of floral resource provisioning by wildflower strips on the conservation of aphid natural enemies, but also suggest that effects of wildflower strips on aphid regulation inside orchards are not very strong compared with spontaneous vegetation naturally occurring in the margins.

TI  - Detection of seagrass scars using sparse coding and morphological filter
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The proximity of seagrass meadows to centers of human activity makes them vulnerable to a variety of habitat degrading insults. Physical scarring has long been recognized as an important but difficult-to-quantify source of habitat fragmentation and seagrass loss. We present a pixel-based algorithm to detect seafloor propeller seagrass scars in shallow water that promises to automate the detection and measurement of scars across the submarine landscape. (1)We applied the algorithm to multispectral and panchromatic images captured at the Deckle Beach, Florida using the WorldView-2 commercial satellite. The algorithm involves four steps using spectral and spatial information from radiometrically calibrated multispectral and panchromatic images. First, we fused multispectral and panchromatic images using a principal component analysis (PCA)-based pan-sharpening method to obtain multispectral pan-sharpened bands. In the second step, we enhanced the image contrast of the pan-sharpened bands for better scar detection. In the third step, we classified the contrast enhanced image pixels into scar and non-scar categories based on a sparse coding algorithm that produced an initial scar map in which false positive scar pixels were also present. In the fourth step, we applied post-processing techniques including a morphological filter and local orientation to reduce false positives. Our results show that the proposed method may be implemented on a regular basis to monitor changes in habitat characteristics of coastal waters.

T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease with worldwide distribution. It affects both humans and animals. Dogs may serve as a sentinel as well as a potential carrier for Leptospira infection in human. This study was conducted with the aim of investigating the sero-prevalence of Leptospirosis, and differentiation in blood parameters in positive and negative cases of dogs.Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out from August 2016 to December 2016 in Kathmandu valley. A total of 70 blood samples were collected from street dogs and tested against Leptospira infection using Immunocomb Canine Leptospira Antibody Test Kit.Results: Out of 70 blood samples tested, eight samples (11.4%) were positive. The average mean and SD of total Leucocyte count of positive and negative cases were 79 750 +/- 12 090/mm(3) and 11 026.98 +/- 4316.742/ mm(3), respectively. Levels of blood parameters (total Leukocyte count (TLC), blood glucose, serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), and calcium and phosphorus) were found to be increased, and significant between positive and negative cases p<0.05, where blood urea and protein remained constant and non-significant.Conclusion: Detection of Leptospira antibody in non-vaccinated dogs indicates a significant threat to human population and demand unique strategic action plan for the control and prevention of disease.

TI  - Mapping Damage-Affected Areas after Natural Hazard Events Using Sentinel-1 Coherence Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The emergence of the Sentinel-1A and 1B satellites now offers freely available and widely accessible Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. Near-global coverage and rapid repeat time (6-12 days) gives Sentinel-1 data the potential to be widely used for monitoring the Earth's surface. Subtle land-cover and land surface changes can affect the phase and amplitude of the C-band SAR signal, and thus the coherence between two images collected before and after such changes. Analysis of SAR coherence therefore serves as a rapidly deployable and powerful tool to track both seasonal changes and rapid surface disturbances following natural disasters. An advantage of using Sentinel-1 C-band radar data is the ability to easily construct time series of coherence for a region of interest at low cost. In this paper, we propose a new method for Potentially Affected Area (PAA) detection following a natural hazard event. Based on the coherence time series, the proposed method (1) determines the natural variability of coherence within each pixel in the region of interest, accounting for factors such as seasonality and the inherent noise of variable surfaces; and (2) compares pixel-by-pixel syn-event coherence to temporal coherence distributions to determine where statistically significant coherence loss has occurred. The user can determine to what degree the syn-event coherence value (e.g., 1st, 5th percentile of pre-event distribution) constitutes a PAA, and integrate pertinent regional data, such as population density, to rank and prioritise PAAs. We apply the method to two case studies, Sarpol-e, Iran following the 2017 Iran-Iraq earthquake, and a landslide-prone region of NW Argentina, to demonstrate how rapid identification and interpretation of potentially affected areas can be performed shortly following a natural hazard event.

TI  - Prairie or planted? Using time-series NDVI to determine grassland characteristics in Montana
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Temperate grasslands are a highly threatened global biome. Complicating management and conservation strategy development, modern grasslands can be difficult to characterize across landscapes since they range from native and semi-native to completely non-native species compositions such as those found in heavily managed pastures. Similar to methods used to differentiate C3 and C4 grasses, we investigate the ability of using temporal variations in growth characteristics as an alternative pathway to predicting native versus introduced species composition across grassland landscapes. To do this, we conducted an exploratory analysis using a time-series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index values as a measure of vegetation greenness with Landsat 5 TM imagery across a growing season and performed an unsupervised classification. Results from the classification were compared with field observation to determine if we can differentiate between native and introduced grassland types in the Northwest Glaciated Plains subecoregion of northeastern Montana. Our results indicated that we predicted grassland cover with 81% accuracy within our 200 km(2) study area and 71% accuracy in our 5000 km(2) secondary study area. Further extrapolation of our methodology, combined with the refinement of vegetation indices of time-series imagery, classification algorithms and the availability of data from planned Landsat and Sentinel missions, may provide the spatial detail necessary to improve grassland monitoring and rangeland management over large areas.

TI  - SPATIO-TEMPORAL ANALYSIS OF SURFACE URBAN HEAT ISLAND BASED ON LANDSAT ETM plus AND OLI/TIRS IMAGERY IN THE CITY OF KOSICE, SLOVAKIA
T2  - CARPATHIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The availability of multispectral imagery including a thermal infrared band enabled monitoring the spatial pattern of land surface temperature (LST) and linking it with land cover properties. Multispectral data archives allow for assessing the dynamics of urban heat island (UHI) by the means of LST mapping for particular area. The research on UHI has been focused on large cities where the phenomenon is the most pronounced. However, UHI concerns also smaller cities which are more abundant and over a half of urban population lives in cities with less than a half of million inhabitants. Therefore, this paper focuses on assessing the pattern of the UHI in the city of Kosice as an example of a typical small post-communist Central European city after changes of urban landscape induced by transition to capitalism and modern trends in economy. We demonstrate the effect of urban greenery on the UHI phenomenon in Kosice using the Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 imagery and ground-based weather station data. We determine differences in the LST distribution in the city under various weather conditions in the vegetation season from 2013 to 2015. The results revealed the spatial pattern of the LST and UHI in Kosice which is unique from regional perspective. Globally, the results support the hypotesis that UHI poses problem even in such a small city. Expansion of urban fabric by construction of new residential, commercial and industrial estates and also building new traffic infrastructure in last few years amplified the UHI. Strong correlation was calculated between the LST and the amount of urban greenery in the city. Even narrow green alleys or small parks are capable of mitigating the UHI phenomenon which can be a usefull argument for officials in Kosice but also in other cities to support investments in development of green areas.

TI  - Application of ACOSOG Z1071: Effect of Results on Patient Care and Surgical Decision-Making
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - The translation of new clinical information into practice can be quite lengthy. We examined our experience in using new data showing that sentinel lymph node biopsy in women after neoadjuvant chemotherapy was feasible. Adoption of ACOSOG (American College of Surgeons Oncology Group) Z1071 was rapid with 73% of patients being treated with the new paradigm within 18 months.Background: The ACOSOG (American College of Surgeons Oncology Group) Z1071 assessed the feasibility of performing sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in node-positive patients who completed neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). Historically, adoption of clinical research into practice takes years. The goal of this study was to determine the effect of Z1071 on our practice. Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective review of Z1071's influence on a single institution's practice. Patients with biopsy-proven positive axillary lymph nodes before NACT were eligible for the study. After NACT, patients with nodal response according to imaging and exam were candidates for SLNB. Two cohorts were stratified according to diagnosis date before and after Z1071 results were presented on December 5, 2012 at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. Fisher exact tests and nonparametric rank tests were used to compare cohorts. Results: The pre-Z1071 cohort included 74 patients and the post-Z1071 cohort 56 for a total of 130 patients. Post-Z1071, 73% (41/56) underwent a SLNB with an average of 4 nodes removed. Moreover, 27% (15/56) of patients had an axillary lymph node dissection as first intervention post-Z1071, compared with 99% (73/74) pre-Z1071. Axillary pathologic complete response pre-Z1071 was 35% (26/74) and post-Z1071 was 27% (15/56) (P = .35). Conclusion: This report shows that meaningful practice changes can be implemented rapidly. Changes in practice generated by clinical trial results should be monitored and outcomes followed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Sentinel-2 Image Fusion Using a Deep Residual Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Single sensor fusion is the fusion of two or more spectrally disjoint reflectance bands that have different spatial resolution and have been acquired by the same sensor. An example is Sentinel-2, a constellation of two satellites, which can acquire multispectral bands of 10 m, 20 m and 60 m resolution for visible, near infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR). In this paper, we present a method to fuse the fine and coarse spatial resolution bands to obtain finer spatial resolution versions of the coarse bands. It is based on a deep convolutional neural network which has a residual design that models the fusion problem. The residual architecture helps the network to converge faster and allows for deeper networks by relieving the network of having to learn the coarse spatial resolution part of the inputs, enabling it to focus on constructing the missing fine spatial details. Using several real Sentinel-2 datasets, we study the effects of the most important hyperparameters on the quantitative quality of the fused image, compare the method to several state-of-the-art methods and demonstrate that it outperforms the comparison methods in experiments.

TI  - Assessing the impact of the new ICD-10-CM coding system on pharmacoepidemiologic studiesAn application to the known association between angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angioedema
T2  - PHARMACOEPIDEMIOLOGY AND DRUG SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeTo replicate the well-established association between angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors versus beta blockers and angioedema in the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) era.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective, inception cohort study in a large insurance database formatted to the Sentinel Common Data Model. We defined study periods spanning the ICD-9-CM era only, ICD-10-CM era only, and ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM era and conducted simple-forward mapping (SFM), simple-backward mapping (SBM), and forward-backward mapping (FBM) referencing the General Equivalence Mappings to translate the outcome (angioedema) and covariates from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM. We performed propensity score (PS)-matched and PS-stratified Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).ResultsIn the ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM eras spanning April 1 to September 30 of 2015 and 2016, there were 152017 and 145232 angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor initiators and 115073 and 116652 beta-blocker initiators, respectively. The PS-matched HR was 4.19 (95% CI, 2.82-6.23) in the ICD-9-CM era, 4.37 (2.92-6.52) in the ICD-10-CM era using SFM, and 4.64 (3.05-7.07) in the ICD-10-CM era using SBM and FBM. The PS-matched HRs from the mixed ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM eras ranged from 3.91 (2.69-5.68) to 4.35 (3.33-5.70).ConclusionThe adjusted HRs across different diagnostic coding eras and the use of SFM versus SBM and FBM produced numerically different but clinically similar results. Additional investigations as ICD-10-CM data accumulate are warranted.

TI  - Early impact of the ICD-10-CM transition on selected health outcomes in 13 electronic health care databases in the United States
T2  - PHARMACOEPIDEMIOLOGY AND DRUG SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeTo describe the consistency in the frequency of 5 health outcomes across the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) and Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) eras in the US.MethodsWe examined the incidence of 3 acute conditions (acute myocardial infarction [AMI], angioedema, ischemic stroke) and the prevalence of 2 chronic conditions (diabetes, hypertension) during the final 5years of the ICD-9-CM era (January 2010-September 2015) and the first 15months of the ICD-10-CM era (October 2015-December 2016) in 13 electronic health care databases in the Sentinel System. For each health outcome reviewed during the ICD-10-CM era, we evaluated 4 definitions, including published algorithms derived from other countries, as well as simple-forward, simple-backward, and forward-backward mapping using the General Equivalence Mappings. For acute conditions, we also compared the incidence between April to December 2014 and April to December 2016.ResultsThe analyses included data from approximately 172 million health plan members. While the incidence or prevalence of AMI and hypertension performed similarly across the 2 eras, the other 3 outcomes did not demonstrate consistent trends for some or all the ICD-10-CM definitions assessed.ConclusionsWhen using data from both the ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM eras, or when using results from ICD-10-CM data to compare to results from ICD-9-CM data, researchers should test multiple ICD-10-CM outcome definitions as part of sensitivity analysis. Ongoing assessment of the impact of ICD-10-CM transition on identification of health outcomes in US electronic health care databases should occur as more data accrue.

TI  - Assessment of groundwater potential in Tirukalukundram block of southern Chennai Metropolitan Area
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater is an important resource in all major urban centres. Continuous extraction leads to degradation and depletion in the water quality which can be protected by selecting proper groundwater recharging techniques. The present study aims to determine the groundwater potential by integrating the remote sensing and geographic information system which helps to identify the locations which are in critical stage and immediate steps can be taken to recharge the groundwater. Thirukalukundram block of Kanchipuram district in Tami Nadu, India, has been chosen as study area. To demarcate the groundwater potential zone, surface attributes such as geomorphology, land use/land cover, contour map, drainage density and sub-surface attributes such as lineaments and soil maps are created using satellite imageries, toposheet, soil and geomorphology data of the study area. The thematic maps prepared using geographic information system and weights have been assigned to the attributes by considering the influence on the storage capacity of groundwater. Four categories of groundwater potential zones such as below low, low, moderate and high have been classified. From the analysis, 5% along the coastal plain area covers high groundwater potential zone, 20% of the area towards north-west and south-west hold moderate groundwater potential. 60% of the total area hold low groundwater potential zone which are located towards south-west direction. 15% of the study area contains below low groundwater potential zone in parts of south-west direction. This study helps to identify the suitable locations for extraction and recharge of groundwater.

TI  - Long-Term Oncologic Outcomes of Laparoscopic Sentinel Node Navigation Surgery in Early Gastric Cancer: A Single-Center, Single-Arm, Phase II Trial
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel node navigation surgery (SNNS) in early gastric cancer (EGC) is technically feasible according to previous literature, however its long-term oncologic safety has not been reported.A single-center, single-arm, phase II trial was conducted to determine the oncologic outcomes of laparoscopic sentinel node (SN) biopsy in clinical stage T1N0M0 gastric cancer patients. Cases with positive SNs on intraoperative pathologic examination underwent conventional gastrectomy with radical lymphadenectomy (SN-positive group), whereas those with negative SNs underwent laparoendoscopic-limited gastric resections without further lymph node dissections (SN-negative group). The primary endpoint was 3-year relapse-free survival.Between July 2010 and April 2013, 113 patients were enrolled, with 100 patients being included in the final analysis. SNs were detected in 99 patients. The mean number of identified SNs was 6.1 +/- 3.9. Eleven patients were included in the SN-positive group and 89 in the SN-negative group. After a median follow-up period of 46.4 months, four patients died and three showed cancer recurrence. All recurrences occurred on the remnant stomach after endoscopic submucosal resection or wedge resection in the SN-negative group. The 3-year relapse-free and overall survival rates were 96.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 92.2-100.0%) and 98.0% (95% CI 95.2-100.0%), respectively.Our results indicate that laparoscopic SNNS may be oncologically safe in EGC. Limited gastric resections should be carefully performed to prevent local recurrence in SN-negative cases. A randomized controlled trial is needed based on the present study.

TI  - Comparison of aerosol optical depth between observation and simulation from MIROC-SPRINTARS: Effects of temporal inhomogeneous sampling
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The global distribution of aerosol optical depth (AOD) is simulated using an aerosol transport model coupled to an atmospheric general circulation model with high spatial and temporal resolution. Daily representative AOD from model simulation is estimated after consideration of observation sampling in daytime (ground-based) and overpass time (satellite) after cloud masking. Large deviations in AOD are found after considering temporally inhomogeneous sampling, with positive differences over desert regions and negative differences over anthropogenic pollution and biomass burning regions. Mean difference in daily AOD of 5.33% (standard deviation of 8.02%), because of temporal inhomogeneous sampling, is identified based on observation time information from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Relative differences in AOD of > 50% and > 30% were found in 7.9% and 22.8% of the data, respectively. Based on the observation time information from the AERONET, relative root mean square error (rRMSE) of AOD due to temporal inhomogeneous sampling is estimated to be 4.30-18.66%. After correcting for temporal sampling inhomogeneity, the simulated global AOD was compared with AODs from MODIS and AERONET. The simulated AOD becomes lower than MODIS AOD because of emission and transport discrepancies related to dust, a limited accounting of nitrate processes, and limitation errors from MODIS AOD retrieval. A regional positive bias in SPRINTARS AOD was found in biomass burning regions, which is due to transport pattern errors related to the initial injection height of emissions. A weak correlation is found over the regions with multiple aerosol sources because of complex interactions of individual aerosol types.

TI  - Integration of satellite remote sensing data in ecosystem modelling at local scales: Practices and trends
T2  - METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Spatiotemporal ecological modelling of terrestrial ecosystems relies on climatological and biophysical Earth observations. Due to their increasing availability, global coverage, frequent acquisition and high spatial resolution, satellite remote sensing (SRS) products are frequently integrated to in situ data in the development of ecosystem models (EMs) quantifying the interaction among the vegetation component and the hydrological, energy and nutrient cycles. This review highlights the main advances achieved in the last decade in combining SRS data with EMs, with particular attention to the challenges modellers face for applications at local scales (e.g. small watersheds).2. We critically review the literature on progress made towards integration of SRS data into terrestrial EMs: (1) as input to define model drivers; (2) as reference to validate model results; and (3) as a tool to sequentially update the state variables, and to quantify and reduce model uncertainty.3. The number of applications provided in the literature shows that EMs may profit greatly from the inclusion of spatial parameters and forcings provided by vegetation and climatic-related SRS products. Limiting factors for the application of such models to local scales are: (1) mismatch between the resolution of SRS products and model grid; (2) unavailability of specific products in free and public online repositories; (3) temporal gaps in SRS data; and (4) quantification of model and measurement uncertainties. This review provides examples of possible solutions adopted in recent literature, with particular reference to the spatiotemporal scales of analysis and data accuracy. We propose that analysis methods such as stochastic downscaling techniques and multi-sensor/multi-platform fusion approaches are necessary to improve the quality of SRS data for local applications. Moreover, we suggest coupling models with data assimilation techniques to improve their forecast abilities.4. This review encourages the use of SRS data in EMs for local applications, and underlines the necessity for a closer collaboration among EM developers and remote sensing scientists. With more upcoming satellite missions, especially the Sentinel platforms, concerted efforts to further integrate SRS into modelling are in great demand and these types of applications will certainly proliferate.

TI  - Model-based analysis of urban settlement process in eco-sensitive area of developing country: a study with special reference to hills of an Indian city
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid and unplanned expansion of a city into its eco-sensitive areas like hills, wetlands, and forests is becoming a major concern, particularly in developing countries. Understanding the process and causes of such unplanned urban expansion is of paramount importance for framing sustainable urban development policies. This paper presents a modelling concept that relates urban settlement in such eco-sensitive areas with potential socio-economic, demographic and geographical factors. The model is applied to an Indian city Guwahati, which is experiencing serious environmental degradation due to unplanned urban settlement in its eco-sensitive hilly areas. While topographical and settlement data were derived using satellite data in GIS platform, all other necessary data were collected from relevant government organizations. On validation of the multi-linear regression model, the coefficient of determination and the root mean square error are obtained as 0.938 and 1.7, respectively. Model results show that geographical parameters are less influencing as compared to the other socio-economic and demographic factors. Sensitivity analysis of urban settlements in hills of Guwahati city carried out with respect to the considered factors reveals that land value and free space availability in the surrounding area of a hill are the most sensitive parameters. This indicates that city development plans should give more importance to outward spatial expansion in plain areas with regulated land value and zoning scheme to minimize unauthorized settlement in eco-sensitive hilly areas of Guwahati city.

TI  - Comparison of high-density LiDAR and satellite photogrammetry for forest inventory
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Point cloud data derived from stereo satellite imagery has the potential to provide large-scale forest inventory assessment but these methods are known to include higher error than airborne laser scanning (ALS). This study compares the accuracy of forest inventory attributes estimated from high-density ALS (21.1 pulses m(-2)) point cloud data (PCD) and PCD derived from photogrammetric methods applied to stereo satellite imagery obtained over a Pinus radiata D. Don plantation forest in New Zealand. The statistical and textural properties of the canopy height models (CHMs) derived from each point cloud were included alongside standard PCD metrics as a means of improving the accuracy of predictions for key forest inventory attributes. For mean top height (a measure of dominant height in a stand), ALS data produced better estimates (R-2 = 0.88; RMSE = 1.7 m) than those obtained from satellite data (R-2 = 0.81; RMSE = 2.1 m). This was attributable to a general over-estimation of canopy heights in the satellite PCD. ALS models produced poor estimates of stand density (R-2 = 0.48; RMSE = 112.1 stems ha(-1)), as did the satellite PCD models (R-2 = 0.42; RMSE = 118.4 stems ha(-1)). ALS models produced accurate estimates of basal area (R-2 = 0.58; RMSE = 12 m(2) ha(-1)), total stem volume (R-2 = 0.72; RMSE = 107.5 m(3) ha(-1)), and total recoverable volume (R-2 = 0.74; RMSE = 92.9 m(3) ha(-1)). These values differed little from the estimates of basal area (R-2 = 0.57; RMSE = 12.2 m(2) ha(-1)), total stem volume (R-2 = 0.70; RMSE = 112.6 m(3) ha(-1)), and total recoverable volume (R-2 = 0.73; RMSE = 96 m(3) ha(-1)) obtained from satellite PCD models. The statistical and textural metrics computed from the CHMs were important variables in all of the models derived from both satellite and ALS PCD, nearly always outranking the standard PCD metrics in measures of importance. For the satellite PCD models, the CHM-derived metrics were nearly exclusively identified as important variables. These results clearly show that point cloud data obtained from stereo satellite imagery are useful for prediction of forest inventory attributes in intensively managed forests on steeper terrain. Furthermore, these data offer forest managers the benefit of obtaining both inventory data and high-resolution multispectral imagery from a single product.

TI  - An empirical comparison of interpolation methods for MODIS 8-day land surface temperature composites across the conterminous Unites States
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Eight-day composite land surface temperature (LST) images from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Specroradiometer (MODIS) sensor are extensively utilized due to their limited number of invalid pixels and smaller file size, in comparison to daily products. Remaining invalid values (the majority caused by cloud coverage), however, still pose a challenge to researchers requiring continuous datasets. Although a number of interpolation methods have been employed, validation has been limited to provide comprehensive guidance. The goal of this analysis was to compare the performance of all methods previously used for 8-day MODIS LST images under a range of cloud cover conditions and in different seasons. These included two temporal interpolation methods: Linear Temporal and Harmonic Analysis of Time Series (HANTS); two spatial methods: Spline and Adaptive Window; and two spatiotemporal methods: Gradient and Weiss. The impact of topographic, land cover, and climatic factors on interpolation performance was also assessed. Methods were implemented on high quality test images with simulated cloud cover sampled from 101 by 101 pixel sites (1-km pixels) across the conterminous United States.These results provide strong evidence that spatial and spatiotemporal methods have a greater predictive capability than temporal methods, regardless of the time of day or season. This is true even under extremely high cloud cover ( > 80%). The Spline method performed best at low cloud cover ( < 30%) with median absolute errors (MAEs) ranging from 0.2 degrees C to 0.6 degrees C. The Weiss method generally performed best at greater cloud cover, with MAEs ranging from 0.3 degrees C to 1.2 degrees C. The regression analysis revealed spatial methods tend to perform worse in areas with steeper topographic slopes, temporal methods perform better in warmer climates, and spatiotemporal methods are influenced by both of these factors, to a lesser extent. Assessed covariates, however, explained a low portion of the overall variation in MAEs and did not appear to cause deviations from major interpolation trends at sites with extreme values. While it would be most effective to use the Weiss method for images with medium to high cloud cover, Spline could be applied under all circumstances for simplicity, considering that (i) images with < 30% cloud cover represent the vast majority of 8-day LST images requiring interpolation, and (ii) Spline functions are readily available and easy to implement through several software packages. Applying a similar framework to interpolation methods for daily LST products would build on these findings and provide additional information to future researchers.

TI  - Predation and Parasitism of <i>Halyomorpha halys </i>(Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) Eggs in Minnesota
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys (Stall (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), has spread across North America and is causing serious economic damages. Current management of this pest is based primarily on use of insecticides, which can disrupt integrated pest management programs. Alternatively, biological control is a more benign management tactic. This study provides the first examination of potential impact of parasitoids and predators of pentatomid eggs in Minnesota. Over 2 yr, 10,074 fresh and 9,870 frozen H. halys eggs were deployed in two forest and two soybean habitats in St. Paul, Minnesota from June to August. Our results demonstrate that rates of parasitism and predation were low, accounting for only 0.4 and 3.7%, respectively, across years, habitats, and egg states. In general, the parasitoid Telenomus podisi Ashmead (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae), had higher impacts on H. halys eggs in soybean, and generalist predators were more prevalent in forest habitats. Overall, predation was higher on fresh versus frozen eggs, and parasitism was not consistent across egg states. Although the rates of H. halys mortality due to natural enemies were low, results of our study may be conservative estimates of their true impact. Also, sentinel egg mass surveys should account for undeveloped parasitoids to better quantify H. halys egg mortality by native parasitoids. Alternative management tactics, such as the introduction of Trissolcus japonicus (Ashmead) (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae), could be considered to improve biological control of H. halys. Our findings serve as the foundation for future work on biological control of this pest and other pentatomids.

TI  - Initial therapeutic choices for hypertension in the Portuguese Sentinel Practice Network
T2  - REVISTA PORTUGUESA DE CARDIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction and Objectives: Finding out which drugs are chosen to treat incident cases of hypertension may help in interpreting prevalent use of antihypertensive agents. We aimed to determine the proportion of patients who begin treatment with each antihypertensive drug class, which physicians initiate treatment and whether family physicians alter prescriptions initiated by others, and to compare the prescribing patterns of family physicians and other specialists.Methods: In this cohort-nested cross-sectional study between 2014 and 2015 within the Portuguese Sentinel Practice Network, family physicians notified incident cases of hypertension, reporting treatment, who issued the initial prescription and whether treatments initiated by other physicians were changed.Results: A total of 681 incident cases were notified. The initial prescription was issued by the patient's family physician in 86.9% of cases (95% CI: 84.2-89.3%). The most frequently used agents were angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (51.3% of patients, 95% CI: 47.5-55.0%), thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics (32.2%, 95% CI: 28.8-35.8%), and angiotensin receptor blockers (21.4%, 95% CI: 18.5-24.7%). Compared to other specialists, family physicians used less beta-blockers (20.4 vs. 5.9%, p<0.001) and loop diuretics (8.2 vs. 0.8%, p=0.003). Prescriptions initiated by other specialists were changed by family physicians in 11.6% of cases (95% CI: 6.0-19.6%).Conclusion: Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were the most frequently prescribed antihypertensive class. Most diagnoses were made by the patient's own family physician. Prescriptions initiated by other specialists were usually continued by family physicians. Prescribing patterns were similar between family physicians and other specialists, except for lower use of beta-blockers and loop diuretics. (C) 2018 Sociedade Portuguesa de Cardiologia.

TI  - The Causative Fault of the 2016 M<sub>wp</sub> 6.1 Petermann Ranges Intraplate Earthquake (Central Australia) Retrieved by C- and L-Band InSAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On 21 May 2016, an M-wp 6.1 earthquake occurred along the Petermann Ranges in Central Australia. Such a seismic event can be classified as a rare intraplate earthquake because the affected area presents low seismicity, being at the center of the Indo-Australian plate. Also, the architecture and kinematics of shear zones in the Petermann Orogen are largely unknown. We used Sentinel-1 C-band descending data and ALOS-2 L-band ascending data to constrain the causative fault. Our analysis revealed that the earthquake nucleated along an unmapped secondary back-thrust of the main feature of the area, namely the Woodroffe thrust.

TI  - The administration of adjuvant chemo(-immuno) therapy in the post ACOSOG-Z0011 era; a population based study
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: The ACOSOG-Z0011-study has resulted in a trend to a more conservative treatment of the axilla for selected sentinel-node-positive patients. However, axillary nodal involvement has always been an important factor for tumor staging and tailoring adjuvant chemotherapy plans. This study evaluates the impact of omitting completion axillary lymph node dissection (cALND) on the administration of adjuvant chemo (-immuno)therapy in Dutch clinical T1-2N0M0 (cTl-2N0M0) sentinel-node-positive breast cancer patients.Methods: Data were obtained from the nationwide NABON breast cancer audit. Descriptive analyses were used to demonstrate trends in axillary surgery and adjuvant chemo (-immuno)therapy. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with the prescription of chemo (-immuno)therapy.Results: In this cohort of 4331 patients, the omission of a cALND increased from 34% to 92%, and the administration of chemo (-immuno)therapy decreased from 68% to 55%, between 2011 and 2015 (P < 0.001). Patients treated with cALND had an OR of 2.2 for receiving adjuvant chemo (-immuno)therapy compared with SLNB only patients. Lower age, a hormone receptor (HR) status other than HR-positive, HER2-negative, increasing tumor grade and stage, and a lymph node status >= pN2 were independently associated with a higher probability of chemo (-immuno)therapy (P < 0.05).Conclusions: This study showed that Dutch cT1-2N0M0 sentinel node-positive breast cancer patients treated with cALND had a higher independent probability for receiving adjuvant chemo (-immuno) therapy compared with SLNB only patients, even when corrected for lymph node status and HR-status. Probably, the decisions to administer adjuvant chemo (-immuno)therapy were not only based on guidelines and tumor characteristics, but also on the preferences from physicians and patients.

TI  - Application of Multi-Sensor Satellite Data for Exploration of Zn-Pb Sulfide Mineralization in the Franklinian Basin, North Greenland
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Geological mapping and mineral exploration programs in the High Arctic have been naturally hindered by its remoteness and hostile climate conditions. The Franklinian Basin in North Greenland has a unique potential for exploration of world-class zinc deposits. In this research, multi-sensor remote sensing satellite data (e.g., Landsat-8, Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER)) were used for exploring zinc in the trough sequences and shelf-platform carbonate of the Franklinian Basin. A series of robust image processing algorithms was implemented for detecting spatial distribution of pixels/sub-pixels related to key alteration mineral assemblages and structural features that may represent potential undiscovered Zn-Pb deposits. Fusion of Directed Principal Component Analysis (DPCA) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) was applied to some selected Landsat-8 mineral indices for mapping gossan, clay-rich zones and dolomitization. Major lineaments, intersections, curvilinear structures and sedimentary formations were traced by the application of Feature-oriented Principal Components Selection (FPCS) to cross-polarized backscatter PALSAR ratio images. Mixture Tuned Matched Filtering (MTMF) algorithm was applied to ASTER VNIR/SWIR bands for sub-pixel detection and classification of hematite, goethite, jarosite, alunite, gypsum, chalcedony, kaolinite, muscovite, chlorite, epidote, calcite and dolomite in the prospective targets. Using the remote sensing data and approaches, several high potential zones characterized by distinct alteration mineral assemblages and structural fabrics were identified that could represent undiscovered Zn-Pb sulfide deposits in the study area. This research establishes a straightforward/cost-effective multi-sensor satellite-based remote sensing approach for reconnaissance stages of mineral exploration in hardly accessible parts of the High Arctic environments.

TI  - Land-use/cover change in Coimbatore urban area (Tamil Nadu, India)-a remote sensing and GIS-based study
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to explain land-use/cover changes in Coimbatore City Corporation using Landsat ETM+ and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) data for the period of 2003-2014. Two Landsat images from years 2003 and 2014 were downloaded from USGS Earth Explorer. Maximum likelihood method was used to classify the images into five classes: urban fabric, vegetation, water bodies, agriculture lands, and barren lands. Overall kappa accuracy measure is about to 87.60 and 86.15% for the years 2003 and 2014, respectively. The change detection analysis has been performed for years 2003 and 2014 postclassified images. The results of the study have indicated that Coimbatore City has experienced rapid modifications in LULC, particularly in terms of urban/built-up area. Over the past 11 years, urban/built-up areas have increased by 94.5 km(2), resulting in a significant drop in the area of agricultural land and vegetation cover. It is found that (1) urban areas are increased 200% due to population growth cum rapid economic progress. (2) Vegetation cover decreased 38.76% due to conversion into urban features. (3) Water bodies in area increased to 15.78% due to eradication of encroachment. (4) There is loss of 1.89% of agricultural lands due to demand for construction activities. (5) About 85.24% of barren lands were converted into other uses, particularly 57.33% to urban areas. (6) Urban growth has accelerated towards north-eastern, northern, and eastern parts, where national highways exist. The built-up areas were dropped from 85.32 to 22.28%, within 5-km distance from the city center.

TI  - Methylene blue stained reticulocytes in a Giemsa film - a case study
T2  - New Zealand Journal of Medical Laboratory Science
M3  - Article
AB  - This case study details a female breast cancer patient with an increase in mean cell volume and a raised reticulocyte count. Her blood film showed basophilic stippling within the polychromatic cells that did not morphologically resemble traditional red cell inclusions, such as Pappenheimer or Howell Jolly bodies. The patient had undergone a sentinel node biopsy, and had been injected with methylene blue. The blue dye had entered the circulation and stained the reticulocytes in vivo, which was then evident in a Giemsa stained film. The hypothesis is that the methylene blue acted in a similar fashion to new methylene blue, and worked as a supravital stain within the body, before the laboratory film was made. A film made a few hours later failed to show as many inclusions, suggesting that this rarely observed phenomenon is time-dependant.

TI  - Discerning the pre-monsoon urban atmosphere aerosol characteristic and its potential source type remotely sensed by AERONET over the Bengal Gangetic plain
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study, we evaluated the pre-monsoon urban atmosphere (UA) aerosol characteristics remotely sensed by Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) over the Bengal Gangetic plain (BGP) at Kolkata (KOL) and their implication in potential source types and spatiotemporal features. About 70% of the AERONET-sensed aerosol optical depth at 0.50 mu m, AOD(0.5) (Angstrom exponent, alpha at 0.44-0.87 mu m) during the pre-monsoon period (February to June) was greater than 0.50 ( 1); the pre-monsoon mean of AOD(0.5) (alpha) was 0.73 (0.83) which was found being slightly higher (lower) than nearby AERONET stations (Dhaka/Bhola) located over the eastern Ganges basin. The volume geometric mean radius for the fine mode (FM) (coarse mode, CM) UA aerosol from AERONET retrievals was estimated to be 0.14-0.17 (2.24-2.75) mu m. The spectral distribution of the monthly mean of UA aerosol single-scattering albedo (SSA) exhibited an increasing trend with an increase in wavelength throughout all wavelengths during April, unlike the rest of the pre-monsoon months. Investigation of aerosol types indicated the pre-dominance of dust during April and a mixture of urban/open burning with mixed desert dust during the rest of the pre-monsoon months. Potential aerosol source fields were identified over the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP), east coast, northwestern India, and oceanic regions; these were estimated at elevated layers of atmosphere during April and May but that at surface layers during February and June. Comparison of aerosol characteristics over the BGP (at Kolkata, KOL) with that at six other coincident AERONET sites over India revealed mean AOD at KOL being 11 to 91% higher than the rest of the AERONET stations, with the relative increase at KOL being the highest during March; this was attributed to persistent high values of both FM and CM AOD unlike the rest of the stations. The monthly mean of SSA was the lowest at KOL among AERONET stations, during February and March. Comparison of the AOD from the AERONET aerosol retrievals over the BGP UA with the coincident Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) latest retrievals (C005 and C006) indicated a moderate correlation between the two retrievals; discrepancy in MODIS-retrieved relative distribution of FM and CM AOD was inferred compared to AERONET in the UA.

TI  - Gauging the Improvement of Recent Mean Sea Surface Models: A New Approach for Identifying and Quantifying Their Errors
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents an assessment and comparison of recent mean sea surface (MSS) models. Using a new approach and independent altimeter data sets, we quantify the major improvement of the CNES_CLS15 and the DTU15 models. We observe a reduction in the amplitude of omission errors thanks to the use of new geodetic altimeter data sets (i.e., Cryosat-2 and Jason-1 geodetic): they are reduced by a factor of 2 compared with previous generations (CNES_CLS11). We also quantify commission errors resulting from the leakage of residual ocean variability and altimeter noise into the MSS models. For wavelengths shorter than 250 km, the error is of the order of 1-2 cm(2), i.e., approximate to 10% to 20% of the sea level anomaly (SLA) variance. The global error of both 2015 models has similar orders of magnitude and spectral power densities, although the commission errors of the CNES_CLS15 model are about half as large as those of the DTU15 model. Its absolute error is also slightly smaller than for the DTU15 model in coastal regions and at high latitudes. Conversely, the DTU15 model produces smaller omission errors, especially in the open ocean over strong bathymetric features. More importantly, the MSS errors still have a substantial impact on altimetry products for wavelengths ranging from 30 to 100 km: the error explains approximate to 30% of the global SLA variance, and the error can be 2.5 times higher on uncharted ground tracks (e.g., Sentinel-3) over rugged bathymetry.

TI  - Automatic mapping afforestation, cropland reclamation and variations in cropping intensity in central east China during 2001-2016
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and automatic monitoring and assessment of vegetation changes are important to support food security, ecosystem balance and global climate regulation. Compared with urbanization and deforestation, vegetation changes such as afforestation, cropland reclamation and variations in cropping intensity were understudied. This study aimed to propose an Automatic Method for detecting Multiple vegetation Changes (AMMC) through a knowledge-based strategy. Five temporal indices were proposed in order to fully characterize different vegetation types from four aspects: vegetation abundance, temporal dispersion, primary/minor temporal continuity, and growing season length. The AMMC takes advantage of the knowledge on the expected temporal trajectories of vegetation dynamics, which could be tracked based on their corresponding trends in these temporal indices. The efficiency of the proposed AMMC method was verified with its applications in central east China using 500 m 8 day composite MODIS datasets from 2001 to 2016. An overall accuracy of 94.75% was achieved when evaluated with 3,011 reference sites. Results revealed that there were totally 7,180 km(2), 3,610 km(2) and 3,280.5 km(2) areas of afforestation, cropland reclamation and variations in cropping intensity in central east China, respectively. This study verified that afforestation efforts were succeeded, but "Grain for Green" project was not as expected since more cropland was reclamation implemented at less favorable biophysical conditions than cropland retirement.

TI  - Is the Awareness of the Aerosol State Useful in Predicting Enhanced Lightning for Lightning-Producing Storms over Northern Alabama?
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrievals from the Terra and Aqua satellites currently provide the largest satellite aerosol dataset for investigating relationships to meteorological phenomena, such as aerosol impact on electrification in deep convection. The usefulness of polar-orbiting satellite aerosol retrievals in lightning inference is examined by correlating MODIS AOD retrievals with lightning observations of the thunderstorms in the summers during 2002-14 over northern Alabama. Lightning flashes during the 1400-1700 local standard time peak period show weak but positive correlations with the MODIS AOD retrievals 2-4 h earlier. The correlation becomes stronger in particular meteorological conditions, including weak vertical wind shear and prevailing northerly winds over northern Alabama. Results show that the MODIS AOD retrievals are less useful in predicting enhanced lightning flash rate for lightning-producing storms than the forecasts of other meteorological variables that are more closely linked to the intensification of convective storms. However, when relatively weaker convective available potential energy (CAPE) is forecast, the probability of enhanced lightning flash rate increases in a more polluted environment, making the knowledge of aerosols more useful in lightning inference in such CAPE regimes. The aerosol enhancement of lightning, if present, may be associated with enhanced convergence in the boundary layer and secondary convection.

TI  - Multi-Criteria Evaluation of Snowpack Simulations in Complex Alpine Terrain Using Satellite and In Situ Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This work presents an extensive evaluation of the Crocus snowpack model over a rugged and highly glacierized mountain catchment (Arve valley, Western Alps, France) from 1989 to 2015. The simulations were compared and evaluated using in-situ point snow depth measurements, in-situ seasonal and annual glacier surface mass balance, snow covered area evolution based on optical satellite imagery at 250 m resolution (MODIS sensor), and the annual equilibrium-line altitude of glaciers, derived from satellite images (Landsat, SPOT, and ASTER). The snowpack simulations were obtained using the Crocus snowpack model driven by the same, originally semi-distributed, meteorological forcing (SAFRAN) reanalysis using the native semi-distributed configuration, but also a fully distributed configuration. The semi-distributed approach addresses land surface simulations for discrete topographic classes characterized by elevation range, aspect, and slope. The distributed approach operates on a 250-m grid, enabling inclusion of terrain shadowing effects, based on the same original meteorological dataset. Despite the fact that the two simulations use the same snowpack model, being potentially subjected to same potential deviation from the parametrization of certain physical processes, the results showed that both approaches accurately reproduced the snowpack distribution over the study period. Slightly (although statistically significantly) better results were obtained by using the distributed approach. The evaluation of the snow cover area with MODIS sensor has shown, on average, a reduction of the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) from 15.2% with the semi-distributed approach to 12.6% with the distributed one. Similarly, surface glacier mass balance RMSE decreased from 1.475 m of water equivalent (W.E.) for the semi-distributed simulation to 1.375 m W.E. for the distribution. The improvement, observed with a much higher computational time, does not justify the recommendation of this approach for all applications; however, for simulations that require a precise representation of snowpack distribution, the distributed approach is suggested.

TI  - Team-based comanagement of diabetes in rural primary care
T2  - CANADIAN FAMILY PHYSICIAN
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To explore clinical indicators among patients with diabetes in southern Alberta and assess changes over time, and to compare patients with diabetes attending a reference clinic (RC), which had adapted its service model to address the specific needs of the patient population, with patients with diabetes attending comparison clinics (CCs) in the same region.Design Analysis of longitudinal data from the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN).Setting Rural southern Alberta.Participants A community-based family medicine clinic and the 6 other CPCSSN clinics in the same region at the time of the study.Main outcome measures A range of data elements from patients with diabetes within the RC, as well as from patients with diabetes from the CCs, were analyzed by CPCSSN to compare rates of comorbidity and mean body mass index, hemoglobin A I , levels, and blood pressure, as well as service use and measurement frequency. Rate of change per year was modeled longitudinally for each of the outcomes.Results The RC had higher proportions of patients with comorbid conditions and a consistently higher mean body mass index. Mean HbA 1C levels varied minimally between the RC and CCs, with both sets worsening slightly. However, the rate of worsening among patients with diabetes in the RC was found to be significantly greater (P<.05) than for those in the CCs. Blood pressure also varied minimally between the RC and the CCs, with both sets improving; however, the RC had a significantly greater (P<.001) rate of improvement than the CCs did. Finally, a greater proportion of patients in the RC had complete data for these 3 outcome measures, and RC patients made a greater number of clinic visits compared with the CC patients (P<.001).Conclusion This study describes a team-based comanagement organizational model and might provide useful commentary about organizational effectiveness in primary care. Although improvement in health outcomes cannot be directly attributed to any specific change in clinic organization, some statistically and likely clinically significant benefit was found associated with the service model of the RC in a relatively medically and socially challenged patient population and in a conservative evaluative design.

TI  - Impacts of natural yield variances on wine composition and sensory attributes of <i>Vitis vinifera </i>cultivars Riesling and Cabernet Franc
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Impacts of naturally-varying yields on composition and sensory attributes of Ontario Riesling and Cabernet Franc wines were investigated. The sites investigated represented five Vintners Quality Alliance sub-appellations. A grid pattern of sentinel vines was established in each vineyard for data collection. Yields were divided into categories [low, medium, or high (LY, MY, HY)] at harvest (2010, 2011) and replicate wines were made from each. Wines were subjected to sensory sorting tasks to confirm differences between yield categories and sites, and were thereafter subjected to descriptive analysis. All HY vines had higher clusters/vine, berry weights, and Ravaz indices. The HY Cabernet Franc wines had lower colour, anthocyanins, and phenols. Sensory sorting revealed differences amongst wines and descriptive analysis demonstrated several aroma/flavour attributes between yield categories. The HY Riesling wines had less fruit and honey and higher mineral and floral attributes, whereas HY Cabernet Franc wines displayed higher bell pepper, vegetal, and herbaceous characteristics and less fruit attributes. Riesling wines from Lincoln Lalceshore North and Niagara Lalceshore sub-appellations had higher mineral or vegetal attributes, Four Mile Creek had more apple/pear, and St. Davids Bench, Beamsville Bench, and Lincoln Lakeshore South displayed higher fruit and citrus. Escarpment Bench and Four Mile Creek Cabernet Franc 2010 wines had the highest bell pepper aroma, Lincoln Lakeshore North displayed the most earthiness, and Lincoln Lakeshore South had the most cooked fruit. In 2011, cooler sites adjacent to Lake Ontario displayed higher vegetal attributes. Zones of differing yields, dependent upon magnitudes of yield differences, can result in substantially different wine sensory properties.

TI  - Dynamic plasticity of macrophage functions in diseased liver
T2  - CELLULAR IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Liver macrophages attract increasing interest due to their crucial roles in homeostasis and hepatic diseases. Recent findings in mice and man suggest a remarkable phenotypic and functional diversity of liver macrophages. Kupffer cells, the subset of tissue resident macrophages with sentinel functions in liver, mainly arise from embryogenic precursors, whereas in injury, liver tissue is engrafted by monocyte-derived macrophages. Both principal macrophage populations respond to local or systemic signals and have substantial effects on reduction as well as aggravation of hepatic diseases. Despite contrasting functions of heterogeneous macrophage subsets in disease progression and regression, they may provide promising targets for novel therapeutic interventions in hepatology. Areas of intense research include their multifaceted roles in metabolic diseases (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, NASH), fibrosis or liver cancer (hepatocellular or cholangiocellular carcinoma, HCC or CCA). We discuss recent findings on the origin, diversity and functional plasticity of liver macrophages in homeostasis and hepatic disease conditions.

TI  - Machine Learning Using Hyperspectral Data Inaccurately Predicts Plant Traits Under Spatial Dependency
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spectral, temporal and spatial dimensions are difficult to model together when predicting in situ plant traits from remote sensing data. Therefore, machine learning algorithms solely based on spectral dimensions are often used as predictors, even when there is a strong effect of spatial or temporal autocorrelation in the data. A significant reduction in prediction accuracy is expected when algorithms are trained using a sequence in space or time that is unlikely to be observed again. The ensuing inability to generalise creates a necessity for ground-truth data for every new area or period, provoking the propagation of single-use models. This study assesses the impact of spatial autocorrelation on the generalisation of plant trait models predicted with hyperspectral data. Leaf Area Index (LAI) data generated at increasing levels of spatial dependency are used to simulate hyperspectral data using Radiative Transfer Models. Machine learning regressions to predict LAI at different levels of spatial dependency are then tuned (determining the optimum model complexity) using cross-validation as well as the NOIS method. The results show that cross-validated prediction accuracy tends to be overestimated when spatial structures present in the training data are fitted (or learned) by the model.

TI  - Optimizing biomass estimates of savanna woodland at different spatial scales in the Brazilian Cerrado: Re-evaluating allometric equations and environmental influences
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Cerrado is the second largest biome in South America and accounted for the second largest contribution to carbon emissions in Brazil for the last 10 years, mainly due to land-use changes. It comprises approximately 2 million km(2) and is divided into 22 ecoregions, based on environmental conditions and vegetation. The most dominant vegetation type is cerrado sensu stricto (cerrado ss), a savanna woodland. Quantifying variation of biomass density of this vegetation is crucial for climate change mitigation policies. Integrating remote sensing data with adequate allometric equations and field-based data sets can provide large-scale estimates of biomass. We developed individual-tree aboveground biomass (AGB) allometric models to compare different regression techniques and explanatory variables. We applied the model with the strongest fit to a comprehensive ground-based data set (77 sites, 893 plots, and 95,484 trees) to describe AGB density variation of cerrado ss. We also investigated the influence of physiographic and climatological variables on AGB density; this analysis was restricted to 68 sites because eight sites could not be classified into a specific ecoregion, and one site had no soil texture data. In addition, we developed two models to estimate plot AGB density based on plot basal area. Our data show that for individual-tree AGB models a) log-log linear models provided better estimates than nonlinear power models; b) including species as a random effect improved model fit; c) diameter at 30 cm above ground was a reliable predictor for individual-tree AGB, and although height significantly improved model fit, species wood density did not. Mean tree AGB density in cerrado ss was 22.9 tons ha(-1) (95% confidence interval = +/- 2.2) and varied widely between ecoregions (8.8 to 42.2 tons ha(-1)), within ecoregions (e.g. 4.8 to 39.5 tons ha(-1)), and even within sites (24.3 to 69.9 tons ha(-1)). Biomass density tended to be higher in sites close to the Amazon. Ecoregion explained 42% of biomass variation between the 68 sites (P < 0.01) and shows strong potential as a parameter for classifying regional biomass variation in the Cerrado.

TI  - Improvement in Surface Solar Irradiance Estimation Using HRV/MSG Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Advanced Model for the Estimation of Surface Solar Irradiance (AMESIS) was developed at the Institute of Methodologies for Environmental Analysis of the National Research Council of Italy (IMAA-CNR) to derive surface solar irradiance from SEVIRI radiometer on board the MSG geostationary satellite. The operational version of AMESIS has been running continuously at IMAA-CNR over all of Italy since 2017 in support to the monitoring of photovoltaic plants. The AMESIS operative model provides two different estimations of the surface solar irradiance: one is obtained considering only the low-resolution channels (SSI_VIS), while the other also takes into account the high-resolution HRV channel (SSI_HRV). This paper shows the difference between these two products against simultaneous ground-based observations from a network of 63 pyranometers for different sky conditions (clear, overcast and partially cloudy). Comparable statistical scores have been obtained for both AMESIS products in clear and cloud situation. In terms of bias and correlation coefficient over partially cloudy sky, better performances are found for SSI_HRV (0.34 W/m(2) and 0.995, respectively) than SSI_VIS (-33.69 W/m(2) and 0.862) at the expense of the greater run-time necessary to process HRV data channel.

TI  - Ten Years of Experience with Scientific TerraSAR-X Data Utilization
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - This paper presents the first comprehensive review on the scientific utilization of earth observation data provided by the German TerraSAR-X mission. It considers the different application fields and technical capabilities to identify the key applications and the preferred technical capabilities of this high-resolution SAR satellite system from a scientific point of view. The TerraSAR-X mission is conducted in a close cooperation with industry. Over the past decade, scientists have gained access to data through a proposal submission and evaluation process. For this review, we have considered 1636 data utilization proposals and analyzed 2850 publications. In general, TerraSAR-X data is used in a wide range of geoscientific research areas comprising anthroposphere, biosphere, cryosphere, geosphere, and hydrosphere. Methodological and technical research is a cross-cutting issue that supports all geoscientific fields. Most of the proposals address research questions concerning the geosphere, whereas the majority of the publications focused on research regarding "methods and techniques". All geoscientific fields involve systematic observations for the establishment of time series in support of monitoring activities. High-resolution SAR data are mainly used for the determination and investigation of surface movements, where SAR interferometry in its different variants is the predominant technology. However, feature tracking techniques also benefit from the high spatial resolution. Researchers make use of polarimetric SAR capabilities, although they are not a key feature of the TerraSAR-X system. The StripMap mode with three meter spatial resolution is the preferred SAR imaging mode, accounting for 60 percent of all scientific data acquisitions. The Spotlight modes with the highest spatial resolution of less than one meter are requested by only approximately 30 percent of the newly acquired TerraSAR-X data.

TI  - Challenging the conventional treatment of colon cancer by sentinel lymph node mapping and its role of detecting micrometastases for adjuvant chemotherapy
T2  - CLINICAL & EXPERIMENTAL METASTASIS
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 7th International Cancer Metastasis Symposium on Cancer Metastasis through the Lymphovascular System - Biology and Treatment
CL  - San Francisco, CA
AB  - All colon cancer patients with lymph node (LN) positive disease are treated with chemotherapy. Patients with node negative disease are usually cured by surgery alone. Yet about 20% of patients develop recurrence within 5years despite node negative status. This may often be the result of missed micrometastases by conventional examination. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping was developed to find those nodes detected by blue dye which was ultrastaged to detect micrometastases. Consecutive patients, underwent SLN mapping with the blue dye with success rate of 99.2%. Average number of LN was 18.3, average number of SLN was 3/patient and overall nodal positivity was 45%. Ten patients had skip metastases. Overall survival of 235 patients was 84months with survival of node negative patients 97months versus 68months for node positive patients. For stage I-IV patients, overall survival was as follows: stage I115 months, stage II90 months, stage III84months and stage IV24months respectively. Patients with micrometastases after chemotherapy had average survival of 108months versus those without chemotherapy was 50months. Thus, SLN mapping techniques is highly successful, easily reproducible and finds micrmoetastases in over 15% of patients which could have been missed by conventional pathological examination. These patients when treated with adjuvant chemotherapy have similar survival as those of node negative disease. Similarly, patients without any nodal metastases after SLN mapping and ultrastaging, may be considered as true node negative disease and may avoid further adjuvant chemotherapy.

TI  - Analyzing urban landscape with City Biodiversity Index for sustainable urban growth
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization process converts natural landscape into an anthropogenic urban landscape. The present paper attempts to understand spatiotemporal urban dynamics of a mid-sized Indian town-Khammam in Telangana-by carrying out Land Use Land Cover Change Analysis for assessing urban growth pattern. A set of metrics of Landscape Analysis available to analyze growth pattern and broadly categorized into two sets-composition and configuration. Principal Component Analysis was used to identify three critical metrics from Landscape Analysis, viz., Number of Patches and Edge Length and Splitting Indexes while two additional metrics of the composition set, viz., Shannon Diversity and Shannon Evenness Indexes, based on expert opinion were added to make the study amenable. Twenty-three indicators of City Biodiversity Index broadly grouped into three core components, viz., Native Biodiversity in City, Ecosystem Services provided, and governance and management of CBI, were analyzed, and five indicators that were amenable to digital interpretation of satellite data pertaining to proportion of park and natural area within city, availability of water or quantum of water for urbanization, extent of natural protected area, extent of parks and natural area, and impact of vegetated area on ambient cooling were studied. Study indicated that in Khammam score of 8 out of a total score of 20 in CBI analysis indicated unsustainable growths, although trends among individual LULC components varied making it essential to study individual patterns. Study highlights need to use such indicators to guide urban development in mid-sized urban towns and cities that could substitute for large metropolitan cities as the growth engine in future.

TI  - Axillary Recurrence Rate in Patients with Breast Cancer and Negative Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph node biopsy is the standard method of evaluating and staging the axilla in the patients with early stage of the breast cancer. The aim of this study is to evaluate the axillary recurrence rate in patients with negative sentinel node biopsy.Methods: From 2006 to 2010, all the patients with a negative sentinel lymph node in their pathologic results were introduced in the study. All patients were invited to the breast cancer clinic for the follow up examination. The axillary ultrasonography was performed to determine the recurrence.Results: Among 150 female patients with negative sentinel lymph node, 52 were entered into the study and were followed up. The mean age was 45.7 +/- 8.58 years, and the mean primary tumor size was 2.36 x 2.40 cm. The primary tumor was located in the upper outer quadrant (90.4%) and the mean number of lymph nodes removed was 1.65. All patients underwent physical examination and axillary ultrasonography, which showed axillary lymph node in 3 patients of 31, 48 and, 62 years. Tumors in all 3 patients were located in the upper lateral part of the axilla and 3 lymph nodes were excised. Only 1 patient had histologically confirmed tumor extension into the axillary lymph node.Conclusions: Axillary recurrence after a long-term follow up of patients with negative sentinel lymph node is very rare and our study suggest that the SLN procedure is a gold standard method for the staging of breast cancer.

TI  - Exposure to ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations and cognitive function among older Mexican adults
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Recent epidemiological research has shown that exposure to fine particulate pollution (PM2.5) is associated with a reduction in cognitive function in older adults. However, primary evidence comes from high-income countries, and no specific studies have been conducted in low and middle-income countries where higher air pollution levels exist.Objectives: To estimate the association between the exposure to PM2.5 and cognitive function in a nationally representative sample of older Mexican adults and the associated effect modifiers. Methods: Data for this study were taken from the National Survey of Health and Nutrition in Mexico carried out in 2012. A total of 7986 older adults composed the analytical sample. Cognitive function was assessed using two tests: semantic verbal fluency and three-word memory. The annual concentration of PM2.5 was calculated using satellite data. Association between exposure to PM2.5 and cognitive function was estimated using two-level logistic and linear regression models.Results: In adjusted multilevel regression models, each 10 mu g/m(3) increase in ambient PM2.5 raised the odds of a poorer cognitive function using the three-word memory test (OR=1.37, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.74), and reduced the number of valid animal named in the verbal fluency test (beta=-0.72, 95% CI: -1.05, -0.40). Stratified analyses did not yield any significant modification effects of age, sex, indoor pollution, urban/rural dwelling, education, smoking and other factors.Conclusions: This study supports an association between exposure to PM2.5 concentrations and cognitive function in older adults. This is particularly relevant to low-and middle-income countries, which are marked by a rapid growth of their aging population and high levels of air pollution.

TI  - Chronology and late-Holocene evolution of Caleta de los Loros, NE Patagonia, Argentina
T2  - HOLOCENE
M3  - Article
AB  - Geomorphological and sedimentary records of Holocene coastal deposits may serve as archives for the local reconstruction of trends in coastal evolution and of the key forcing parameters controlling long-term change. We here present new observations on the sedimentology, chronology, and surface properties of a coupled beach ridge and coastal lagoon system located on the northern shore of San Matias Gulf, NE Patagonia, Argentina. The study is based on remotely sensed data, sediment cores, and a large number of samples dated using optically stimulated luminescence (OSL). The field site is located in a topographical depression within a cliffed shoreline composed of friable sand and gravel stones. The oldest preserved lagoonal deposits formed in the protected inner part of the system c. 2300 years ago. An up to 4-km-wide strandplain prograded rapidly between c. 1000 and 500 years in the more exposed western part of the system. Lagoonal deposition occurred primarily during the last 500 years. The chronology and spatial arrangement of landforms appear to result from a switch-over in sediment delivery probably caused by local implications of major shifts in climate regime. Even though we were not able to identify or benchmark the precise triggers of geomorphological change at Caleta de los Loros, our study presents an example of the potential importance of environmental changes on the rapid and non-linear development of coastal sedimentary systems.

TI  - Racial and Socioeconomic Disparities in Hysterectomy Route for Benign Conditions
T2  - JOURNAL OF RACIAL AND ETHNIC HEALTH DISPARITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The aim of this paper was to explore disparities associated with the route of hysterectomy in the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) health system and to evaluate whether the hysterectomy clinical pathway implementation impacted disparities in the utilization of minimally invasive hysterectomy (MIH).Methods We performed a retrospective medical record review of all the patients who have undergone hysterectomy for benign indications at UPMC-affiliated hospitals between fiscal years (FY) 2012 and 2014.Results A total number of 6373 hysterectomy patient cases were included in this study: 88.7% (5653) were European American (EA), 11.02% (702) were African American (AA), and the remaining 0.28% (18) were of other ethnicities. We found that non-EA, women aged 45-60, traditional Medicaid, and traditional Medicare enrollees were more likely to have a total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH). Residence in higher median income zip code (> $61,000) was associated with 60% lower odds of undergoing TAH. Both FY 2013 and 2014 were associated with significantly lower odds of TAH. Logistic regression results from the model for non-EA patients for FY 2012 and FY 2014 demonstrated that FY and zip code income group were not significant predictors of surgery type in this subgroup. Pathway implementation did not reduce racial disparity in MIH utilization.Conclusion This study demonstrated that there is a significant disparity in MIH utilization, where non-EA and Medicaid/Medicare recipients had higher odds of undergoing TAH. Further research is needed to investigate how care standardization may alleviate healthcare disparities.

TI  - Remote sensing and in situ platform based study on impact of Bay of Bengal cyclones (Phailin, Helen, Lehar, and Madi) on ocean chlorophyll and associated physical parameters
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Impact of four major cyclones: Phailin, Helen, Lehar, and Madi have been studied in terms of changes in ocean productivity utilizing Indian satellite Oceansat-2 ocean color monitor and MODIS-Aqua data during October-December 2013. The 8-day and monthly composite chlorophyll images have been generated owing to the pre-, during, and post-stages of four cyclones; out of which, three were very severe cyclonic storms and the Helen was severe cyclonic storm. The chlorophyll concentration increased two- to threefolds due to the aftereffect of cyclone in the coastal water, and the concentration was very high (around 2-3 mg/m(3)). To understand the possible links of cyclones to cooling and upwelling, MODIS-Aqua sea surface temperature (SST) images have been processed. The SST images have shown the cooling effect near the cyclone track pass, over Bay of Bengal. The cooling was observed by 2-3 degree Celsius during the above cyclones. To understand the in situ surface water and water column salinity and temperature variability, the Argo float data are plotted and interpreted. The surface contour shows the lowering of salinity and temperature with effects of cyclones. In addition, the Argo depth profile data have shown possible mixed layer deepening in few profiles around halocline and thermocline depths. This study will be useful for mapping potential fishing zone, ocean biogeochemistry and other useful applications and research.

TI  - Artificial Neural Network-based Model for Predicting Moisture Content in Rice Using UAV Remote Sensing Data
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The percentage of moisture content in rice before harvest is crucial to reduce the economic loss in terms of yield, quality and drying cost. This paper discusses the application of artificial neural network (ANN) in developing a reliable prediction model using the low altitude fixed-wing unmanned air vehicle (UAV) based reflectance value of green, red, and MR and statistical moisture content data. A comparison between the actual statistical data and the predicted data was performed to evaluate the performance of the model. The correlation coefficient (R) is 0.862 and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is 0.914% indicate a very good accuracy of the model to predict the moisture content in rice before harvest. The model predicted values are matched well with the measured values (R-2 = 0.743, and Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency = 0.730). The model results are very promising and show the reliable potential to predict moisture content with the error of prediction less than 7%. This model might be potentially helpful for the rice production system in the field of precision agriculture (PA).

TI  - Representing the Good: Pastoral Care in a Secular Age
T2  - PASTORAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In 'a secular age' (Taylor 2007), pastoral care is no longer exclusively associated with specific religious traditions and communities. Pastoral caregivers who work in secular institutions provide care to religious and nonreligious people alike, and in several Western societies the term pastoral care is used in relation to nonreligious (humanist) care. In secular contexts, the term 'pastoral care' is often replaced by the term 'spiritual care.' Spiritual care, however, is provided by various professionals, so pastoral caregivers face the challenge of developing adequate and convincing language to explain what is distinctive about their work. In this article, the authors turn to philosophical language in order to develop a conceptual understanding of pastoral care that does not depend on the specific worldview-religious or nonreligious-of either pastoral caregivers or receivers of pastoral care. Using the work of Taylor (1989, 2007) and Murdoch (1970), we explain pastoral care as engaging with people's attempts to orient in 'moral space' and the distinctive quality of pastoral care as 'representing the Good.' Murdoch associates 'the Good' with a secular idea of transcendence that is both a movement beyond the ego and an engagement with the reality of human vulnerability, suffering, and evil. We argue that pastoral caregivers who 'represent the Good' have the task not only of supporting the existential and spiritual processes of individuals but also of promoting dialogue and social justice and of critiquing dehumanizing practices in the organizations in which they work and in society at large.

AB  - The susceptibility of slopes in open pit coal mines to various modes of failure (i.e., plane, wedge, circular and toppling failure) could be envisaged by virtue of processing and analysis of pertinent satellite data. The aim of the present study was to integrate thematic maps generated using remote sensing image processing techniques, in order to finally produce slope failure hazard zonation maps in and around Singrauli coalfield, India. The various failure-inducing factors, variables and parameters can be extracted from different satellite data and imageries. The data acquired by different sensors such as TM, ETM+, etc., of LANDSAT series and CARTOSAT of ISRO Bhuvan was used in this study. All these data were subsequently used to create different thematic maps such as slope map, lithological map, land use/land cover map, principal component analysis map, digital elevation model (DEM), etc. An advanced analysis for extraction of lineament attributes was also undertaken.

AB  - Digital elevation model based extraction of micro watershed helps to demarcate suitable site for groundwater modeling studies using remote sensing and GIS. The present study was explored in over-exploited zones of which out of 15 blocks in Tirunelveli District are under over-exploitation as per Dynamic GW-Resources-2011 while 2009 there was only 4 over-exploited blocks and in 1998 there was no any over exploitation. So, this has to be given more priority for recharge measures as soon as to control this depletion rate. As part of this, the first step is to identify suitable site for artificial recharge. In this paper, the study is undergone for Nambiyar Watershed, hard rock terrain in Tirunelveli District which covers an area of 758.87 km(2). Existence of the scale of groundwater in the study area is determined by four classes ranging from high, moderate, low and poor predicting groundwater potential zones. To derive potential recharge, Landsat 8 satellite data for each month is utilized to estimate evapotranspiration (ET) from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in the ArcGIS environment. The potential zone map is extracted based on the geomorphology, soil, slope, potential recharge, geology, landuse/landcover, drainage density, aquifer depth, groundwater fluctuation parameters. The weights are assigned to each parameter according to the priority importance to groundwater potential using analytic hierarchy process method. This research identifies site suitable for groundwater recharge and these results are validated and used for groundwater modelling studies.

TI  - Historical Cover Trends in a Sagebrush Steppe Ecosystem from 1985 to 2013: Links with Climate, Disturbance, and Management
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the causes and consequences of component change in sagebrush steppe is crucial for evaluating ecosystem sustainability. The sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) steppe ecosystem of the northwest USA has been impacted by the invasion of exotic grasses, increasing fire return intervals, changing land management practices, and fragmentation, often lowering the overall resilience to change. We utilized contemporary and historical Landsat imagery, field data, and regression tree models to produce fractional cover maps of rangeland components (shrub, sagebrush, herbaceous, bare ground, and litter) through the last 30 years. Our main goals were to (1) investigate rangeland component trends over 30 years, (2) evaluate the magnitude and direction of trends in components and climate drivers and their relationship, and (3) assess component trends influenced by climate. Results indicated that over the study period, shrub, sage, herbaceous, and litter cover decreased, while bare ground cover increased. Measured rates of change ranged from - 0.14% decade(-1) for shrub cover to 0.05% decade(-1) for bare ground, whereas herbaceous and litter cover trends were negligible. Net landscape cover changes were consistent with expectations of climate change and disturbance producing a loss of biotic cover, and converting a portion of shrub and sagebrush to herbaceous cover. Overall, fire and related successional recovery was the greatest change agent for all components in terms of area and cover change, while increasing minimum temperature, at a rate of 0.66A degrees C decade(-1), was found to be the most significant climate driver.

TI  - Dynamic change of vegetation cover and productivity of Poyang Lake wetland based on MODIS EVI time series
T2  - Biodiversity Science
M3  - Article
AB  - Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China, is one of two lakes that maintain a natural hydrological link with the Yangtze River. The lake system is critical for biodiversity conservation globally, harboring large number of migratory waterbirds. During the dry season, Poyang Lake fragments in to numerous sub-lakes, and different sub-lakes have different hydrological control and management mode. However, the recent hydrological alternation, presumably caused by the operation of Three Gorge Dam (TGD), is threatening the ecological integrity of the lake system, especially as a wintering ground for waterbirds. A robust investigation of the effects of TGD on vegetation cover and productivity at this critical biodiversity hotspot is therefore timely, and could incorporate recent advances in remote sensing and ecological modelling. In this study, using MODIS EVI (enhanced vegetation index) time series, we investigated the spatiotemporal patterns of growth in the lake for the period of 2000-2014, which includes periods before (2000-2006) and after (2007-2014) TGD was commissioned. Firstly, we extracted 107 16-day MODIS EVI time series (February 2000 to April 2015) for 10 randomly placed transects across the lake. We then applied the adaptive Savitzky-Golay smoothing algorithm to the EVI time series, and extracted four key growth metrics, namely, the starting date of growth season, growth season length, seasonal peak EVI, and productivity index. We found significant associations between the hydrological alternation and changes in vegetation seasonality. First, we found that the vegetation growth characteristics of wetlands under different hydrological control modes showed significant differences. In particular, the vegetation located in the freely connected sub-lakes had a later start of growing season, shorter growing season, lower peak EVI value, and lower primary productivity compared to sub-lakes of other modes. Second, due to the hydrological alteration, growth characteristics of sites in freely connected sub-lakes displayed two cycles per year and differed significantly before and after 2006. The advance of the autumn growing season led to excessive accumulation of biomass, which reduced the palatability of the food of migratory geese. However, this difference does not exist in the sites located in the local controlled sub-lake. Third, free connected and local controlled sub-lakes are both important for the protection of migratory birds of Poyang Lake. It is necessary to protect areas harboring both types of sub-lakes to provide a wider food source for wintering migratory birds. Local hydrology control can, to some extent, slow down the impact of much larger scale hydrological alteration on wetland vegetation growth.

M3  - Article
AB  - We used Level 3 CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations) averaged monthly data to (1) study the climatology of mean aerosol optical depth (AOD) from 2010 to 2015, (2) to compare the mean AOD for different satellites for the period of 2015 and (3) to study the monthly and seasonal variations of mean AOD and extinction coefficient for the period of 2015. The climatology of mean AOD from 2010 to 2015 showed similar patterns of global mean AOD distribution but showed variation in magnitude. The dominance of mean AOD was observed in the latitudes of 0 degrees N to 40 degrees N. Monthly global mean AOD source regions showed dominance in West Africa, India and East Asia. The highest mean AOD (dust + smoke) for these regions was observed in April while the lowest AOD (dust + smoke) was observed in November. The highest extinction coefficients were observed in the MAM season at latitudes of 50 degrees N and 58 degrees S at altitudes of 0.16 and 0.22 km respectively. The highest aerosols in altitude (6 km) were observed during this season.

TI  - A feasibility study of sentinel lymph node mapping by cervical injection of a tracer in Japanese women with early stage endometrial cancer
T2  - TAIWANESE JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of sentinel lymph node mapping characterized by a cervical tracer injection in endometrial cancer.Materials and methods: This retrospective study was carried out using data for 57 patients with endometrial carcinoma who had undergone intraoperative sentinel lymph node mapping and subsequent surgical staging. Technetium colloid and/or indocyanine green was injected into the uterine cervix and a gamma-detecting probe and/or photodynamic eye camera system was used intraoperatively to locate hot spots.Results: Of the 57 patients, 52 (91.2%) had FIGO Stage I disease. Successful unilateral or bilateral mapping occurred in 54 patients (94.7%) and 46 (80.7%), respectively. The median number of sentinel lymph nodes detected was two (range, 0-5). Following sentinel lymph node mapping, 41 patients (71.9%) underwent pelvic lymphadenectomy alone and 16 (28.1%) full lymphadenectomy. The median number of lymph nodes resected was 17 (range, 8-110). Sentinel lymph nodes were involved in four patients (7.0%), two with macrometastases and two with low-volume metastases. The sensitivity and negative predictive value for detecting lymph node metastasis were both 100%.Conclusion: Sentinel lymph node mapping with the use of cervical tracer injection is highly feasible in Japanese women with early stage endometrial cancer.

TI  - Why Do the Godless Prosper? Modeling the Cognitive and Coalitional Mechanisms That Promote Atheism
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGION AND SPIRITUALITY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article offers an affirmative construal of atheism: the attempt to make sense of the world with naturalist explanations and to act sensibly in society following secularist principles (i.e., without relying on supernatural agents or complying with supernatural authorities). After briefly describing the conceptual framework behind this positive conception of a nonreligious worldview, we outline the construction and present the findings of two computational models that simulate some of the cognitive and coalitional mechanisms that engender and nurture religious and nonreligious worldviews. These models allow us to explore the causal dynamics within complex adaptive systems involving (dis)belief in supernatural agents and (dis)affiliation from religious institutions.

TI  - Development and Validation of a Long-Term, Global, Terrestrial Sensible Heat Flux Dataset
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sensible heat flux is a turbulent flux driving interactions between the Earth's surface and the atmosphere, propelling local and regional climate. While turbulent fluxes are measured in situ, global scales require estimates at larger spatial scales, which can be made using remotely sensed satellite data. This study uses a first-order approximation to calculate the unconstrained hourly, terrestrial, 0.5 degrees-resolution sensible heat flux using a land surface temperature consistent with the High Resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder (HIRS) retrievals, six reanalysis-based air temperature products, and a dataset of Zilitinkevich empirical constant C-zil values. This sensible heat flux dataset is constrained using the daily Bowen ratio and available energy, to produce nine constrained, daily products. All resulting global, terrestrial averages are within the uncertainty range of +/- 6.3 W m(-2) from the 38.8 W m(-2) global annual average previously reported in the literature. The product constrained with the net radiation using the Moderate Resolution Infrared Spectroradiometer (MODIS) albedo and air temperature from the National Centers for Environmental Protection (NCEP) Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) performs closest to the FLUXNET ground observations in the monthly analysis. These sensible heat flux estimates should be used for benchmarking global climate models at monthly or annual scales, and improvements should be made to the accuracy of input variables, particularly the temperature gradient, C-zil estimates, and the roughness length.

TI  - Investigation of the effects of wetlands on micro-climate
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Regulation of the microclimatic structure of a region by using land use planning is one of the important strategies, which is used to fight against climate change. The climatic structures of regions are also affected by wetlands as well as land use types. In the present study, based on this information, the micro-climatic effects at the 1 km and 10 km periphery of three dam lakes and two lakes (imranli Reservoir, Golova Reservoir, Dorteylul Reservoir, Lake Hafik and Lake Todurge), which are located within the boundaries of Sivas province, were investigated. Analyses were made using GIS (geographic information systems) and remote sensing techniques.The temperature values are obtained from the Landsat TM-5 images of 2007 summer season which belong to June 18, July 4, July 20, August 5. The calculated surface temperatures were related to the buffer areas of wetlands and land use classes. Buffer areas were formed of 2 types, for 10 km every 500 m and for 1 km every 100 m for each wetland. These buffer areas were cut by 45-degree angles within themselves and divided into 8 zones to increase accuracy by minimizing the effects of other factors (land use, topography, etc.) in the analyses. Analyses were performed separately for each circular zone and each land use. The results were statistically tested in 95% confidence interval. With the help of this study, the necessity of climate-sensitive land use planning was emphasized.

TI  - Infra-annual phenology for detecting understory plant invasion in urban forests
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and repeatable mapping of biological plant invasions is essential to develop successful management strategies for conserving native biodiversity. While overstory invasive plants have been successfully detected and mapped using multiple methods, understory invasive detection remains a challenge, particularly in dense forested environments. Very few studies have utilized an approach that identifies and aligns the acquisition timing of remote sensing imagery with peak phenological differences between understory and overstory vegetation types. We investigated this opportunity by analyzing a monthly time-series of 2011 Landsat TM data to identify acquisition periods with the highest phenological differences between understory and overstory vegetation for detecting the spatial distribution of the exotic understory plant Ligustrum sinense Lour., a rapidly spreading invader in urbanizing regions of the southeastern United States. We used vegetation indices (VI) to establish intra-annual phonological trends for L. sinense, evergreen forest, and deciduous forest located in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, USA. We developed Random Forest (RF) models to detect L. sinense from those time steps exhibiting the highest phonological differences. We assessed the relative contribution of VI and topographic indices (TI) to the detection of L. sinense. We compared the top performing models and used the best overall model to produce a map of L. sinense for the study area. RF models that included VI, TI, and Landsat TM bands for March 13 and 29, 2011 (the periods with highest detected phonological differences), produced the highest overall accuracy and Kappa estimates, outperforming the combination of VI and TI by 8.5% in accuracy and 20.5% in Kappa. The top performing model from the RF produced a Kappa of 0.75. Our findings suggest that selecting remote sensing data for a period when phenological differences between L. sinense and forest types are at their peak can improve the detection and mapping of L. sinense.

TI  - Laboratory based antimicrobial resistance surveillance for Pseudomonas aeruginosa blood isolates from South Africa
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Antimicrobial resistant bacterial infections are widespread globally and increases in antimicrobial resistance presents a major threat to public health. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic healthcare-associated pathogen with high rates of morbidity and mortality and an extensive range of resistance mechanisms. This study describes the antibiotic susceptibility profiles of P. aeruginosa isolates from patients with bacteraemia submitted by sentinel laboratories in South Africa from 2014 to 2015.Methodology: Organism identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing were done using automated systems. Molecular methods were used to detect common resistance genes and mechanisms.Results: Overall the susceptibility was high for all antibiotics tested with a decrease over the two-year period. There was no change in the MIC50 and MIC90 breakpoints for all antibiotics from 2014 to 2015. The MIC50 was within the susceptible breakpoint range for most antibiotics and the MIC90 was within the susceptible breakpoint range for colistin only. Phenotypically carbapenem non-susceptible isolates harboured the following plasmid-mediated genes: blaVIM (n = 81, 12%) and blaGES (n = 6, 0.9%); blaNDM (n = 4, 0.6%) and blaOXA-48 and variants (n = 3, 0.45%). Porin deletions were observed in one meropenem non-susceptible isolate only, and multi-drug resistance efflux pumps were expressed in the majority of the non-susceptible isolates investigated. BlaVEB-1, blaIMP and blaKPC were not detected.Conclusion: The prevalence of resistance to commonly used antibacterial agents was low for P. aeruginosa isolates and similarly, tested resistance mechanisms were detected in a relatively small proportion of isolates. Findings in this study represent baseline information for understanding antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in P. aeruginosa isolates from blood. Our surveillance report may assist in contributing to hospital treatment guidelines.

TI  - Sugarcane ratoon discrimination using LANDSAT NDVI temporal data
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Pre harvest prediction of sugarcane and sugar production is essential for obtaining the objectives of the national food security mission. Traditional field experimentation results are not reliable and are biased. Improvement in the accuracy and timeliness of crop yield estimation by blending of ancillary data and remotely sensed data in the temporal domain is indispensable. Ratoon sugarcane and planted sugarcane are the two prevalent agricultural practices in India. Ratoon sugarcane crop is suitable both from economic and production consideration. Identification of ratoon sugarcane and monitoring of its growth has been poorly studied. The objective of this study is to extract the information related to the ratoon sugarcane using remote sensing data. The present study proposed NDVIT, an index based on temporal values of NDVI data of Landsat 8 for monitoring and discrimination of ratoon sugarcane. This index has been found to provide 91% accuracy when tested on the ground in the Himalayan foothills region of Uttarakhand. Study indicated that the best period for discrimination of ratoon sugarcane crop is during the first week of April and last week of August to the end of September. This matches with the start of tillering stage and during the period of grand growth stage of the sugarcane.

TI  - The prognostic significance of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes for primary melanoma varies by sex
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The immune response to melanoma is manifested locally by tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Men and women are known to have varying patterns of immunity, yet sex-specific prognostic implications of TILs have not been explored.Methods: Patients who had clinically localized primary melanoma with a Breslow thickness of 0.76 mm or more and underwent sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy at our institution were identified. The association between TILs (absent, nonbrisk, and brisk) and SLN positivity was evaluated by using logistic regression. Overall survival (OS) was evaluated by TIL status and sex.Results: Among 1367 patients identified, 794 were men. TILs were brisk in 143 lesions, nonbrisk in 903, and absent in 321, which did not vary by sex (P=.71). SLN positivity was associated with TILs among men (brisk, 3.8%; nonbrisk, 16.9%; and absent, 26.6% [P<.001]). In contrast, there was no association between SLN positivity and TILs among women (P=.49). Interaction between brisk TILs and sex on SLN positivity was significant (P=.029). Among men, presence of brisk TILs was associated with prolonged OS (P=.038) but not after adjustment for SLN status (P=.42). There was no association between TIL status and OS among women.Limitations: Findings from this single-institution study have yet to be validated by other research groups.Conclusions: The implications of TILs in predicting SLN positivity appear to be more relevant for men than for women.

TI  - Diagnosis-based cohort augmentation using laboratory results data: The case of chronic kidney disease
T2  - PHARMACOEPIDEMIOLOGY AND DRUG SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeIn this report, we use data from FDA's Sentinel System to focus on how augmenting a diagnosis-based chronic kidney disease cohort with patients identified through laboratory results impacts cohort characteristics and outcomes.MethodsWe used data from 2 Data Partners. Patients were eligible if they were health plan members on January 1, 2012. We classified chronic kidney disease patients into mutually exclusive categories according to the hierarchy of (1) ICD-9-CM diagnosis (DXGroup), or (2) two estimated glomerular filtration rates <60mL/min/1.73m(2), separated by at least 90days (2-LabGroup), or (3) a single estimated glomerular filtration rates <60mL/min/1.73m(2) (1-LabGroup). We compared the groups on demographic, clinical, and health care utilization characteristics using pairwise standardized differences. We used Cox regression to compare the groups on mortality, adjusting for baseline covariates.ResultsWe identified 209864 patients: 107607 in DxGroup (51%) and 102257 (49%) from laboratory data alone. For every characteristic, the DxGroup was the sickest, followed by the 2-LabGroup and then the 1-LabGroup. The DxGroup was more likely to die than 2-LabGroup (hazard ratio [HR], 1.47; 95% CI, 1.22-1.77) at Site 1; that effect was observed, but attenuated, at Site 2 (HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.07-1.25). The DxGroup was more likely to die than the 1-LabGroup at Site 1 (HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.20-1.55), but not at Site 2 (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.89-1.00).ConclusionsWe suggest that drug safety researchers consider whether the method of cohort identification contributes to generalizability of safety findings.

TI  - Spatial variability of SPI and RDI<sub>st</sub> drought indices applied to intense episodes of drought occurred in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article aims to evaluate the spatial distribution of the standard precipitation index (SPI) and the standardized form of the reconnaissance drought index (RDIst) when applied to intense episodes of drought in the state of Rio de Janeiro (SRJ), Brazil. Data of 99 rainfall stations and 17 temperature stations collected during 31 consecutive years (1979-2009) were used to generate both drought indices, in the annual scale. Rainfall data faults were filled with normal climatological rainfall values provided by the Brazilian National Institute of Meteorology (INMET) in the period 1979-1997. The 3B43 product of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Satellite (TRMM) data faults was used to fill up rainfall data faults during the period from 1998 to 2009. As for the temperature data, faults were completed based on the historical (1961-1990) average of the temperatures registered in stations within the same region. For the calculation of SPI and RDIst indices in the annual scale it was used the computational tool Drinc (drought indices calculator). Spatial results were achieved using the spline tension method applied to the five most intense drought events (1984/1985, 1993/1994, 1997/1998, 1999-2000, 2002/2003 and 2007/2008) of the series, according to each index. The spline tension method presents satisfactory spatial consistency in the characterization of drought in SRJ. The results for indices SPI and RDIst presented similarities in terms of spatial variation when applied to the SRJ, as the SPI demonstrated good characterization of drought severity with fewer data requirements.

TI  - Decreased rate of surgical site infection after spinal surgery with instrumentation using bundled approach including surveillance and intrawound vancomycin application
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Surgical site infections (SSIs) increase the risk of mortality, postsurgery, extend hospital stay, and increase the costs of healthcare. Our aim in this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a multidisciplinary, evidence-based, surveillance program combined with intrawound application of vancomycin in lowering the incidence rate of SSI after spinal surgery with instrumentation.We conducted a retrospective analysis of 637 patients who underwent spinal fusion with instrumentation in our institution at 3 different time periods: prior to our surveillance program (control group), surveillance only (surveillance group 1), and surveillance combined with intrawound vancomycin application (surveillance group 2). The following covariates were considered in the evaluation of between-group differences in SSI rate: sex, age, surgical site, National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance (NNIS) risk index, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification, and other health comorbidities. The causative organism in cases of SSI was confirmed in all cases.The rate of SSI was significantly lower in the surveillance group 2 (1.4%) than in the control group (4.6%; P=.04). On multivariate logistic regression analysis, steroid use (adjusted odd's ratio (OR), 6.06; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.45-23.6) and operative time (adjusted OR. 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00-1.01) were identified as independent risk factors of SSI. Staphylococcus species and Propionibacterium acnes were the principal causative organisms.A bundled approach that includes surveillance and intrawound application of vancomycin is an effective strategy to lower the risk of SSI after spinal fusion with instrumentation. The use of steroid and longer operative time are risk factors of SSI.Our findings support the implementation of a program of surveillance, combined with intrawound vancomycin application, to reduce the incidence rate of SSIs in spinal surgery.

TI  - 25 years of elevation changes of the Greenland Ice Sheet from ERS, Envisat, and CryoSat-2 radar altimetry
T2  - EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The shape of the large ice sheets responds rapidly to climate change, making the elevation changes of these ice-covered regions an essential climate variable. Consistent, long time series of these elevation changes are of great scientific value. Here, we present a newly-developed data product of 25 years of elevation changes of the Greenland Ice Sheet, derived from satellite radar altimetry. The data product is made publicly available within the Greenland Ice Sheets project as part of the ESA Climate Change Initiative programme.Analyzing repeated elevation measurements from radar altimetry is widely used for monitoring changes of ice-covered regions. The Greenland Ice Sheet has been mapped by conventional radar altimetry since the launch of ERS-1 in 1991, which was followed by ERS-2, Envisat and currently CryoSat-2. The recently launched Sentinel-3A will provide a continuation of the radar altimetry time series. Since 2010, CryoSat-2 has for the first time measured the changes in the coastal regions of the ice sheet with radar altimetry, with its novel SAR Interferometric (SARIn) mode, which provides improved measurement over regions with steep slopes.Here, we apply a mission-specific combination of cross-over, along-track and plane-fit elevation change algorithms to radar data from the ERS-1, ERS-2, Envisat and CryoSat-2 radar missions, resulting in 25 years of nearly continuous elevation change estimates (1992-2016) of the Greenland Ice Sheet. This analysis has been made possible through the recent reprocessing in the REAPER project, of data from the ERS-1 and ERS-2 radar missions, making them consistent with Envisat data. The 25 years of elevation changes are evaluated as 5-year running means, shifted almost continuously by one year. A clear acceleration in thinning is evident in the 5-year maps of elevation following 2003, while only small elevation changes observed in the maps from the 1990s. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Use of SMOS L3 Soil Moisture Data: Validation and Drought Assessment for Pernambuco State, Northeast Brazil
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The goal of this study was to validate soil moisture data from Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) using two in situ databases for Pernambuco State, located in Northeast Brazil. The validation process involved two approaches, pixel-station comparison and areal average, for three regions in Pernambuco with different climatic characteristics. After validation, the SMOS data were used for drought assessment by calculating soil moisture anomalies for the available period of data. Four statistical criteria were used to verify the quality of the satellite data: Pearson correlation coefficient, Willmott index of agreement, BIAS, and root mean squared difference (RMSD). The average RMSD calculated from the daily time series in the pixel and the areal assessment were 0.071 m(3)m(-3) and 0.04 m(3)m(-3), respectively. Those values are near to the expected 0.04 m(3)m(-3) accuracy of the SMOS mission. The analysis of soil moisture anomalies enabled the assessment of the dry period between 2012 and 2017 and the identification of regions most impacted by the drought. The driest year for all regions was 2012, when the anomaly values achieved -50% in some regions. The use of SMOS data provided additional information that was used in conjunction with the precipitation data to assess drought periods. This may be particularly relevant for planning in agriculture and supporting decision makers and farmers.

TI  - Multi-Temporal Image Analysis for Fluvial Morphological Characterization with Application to Albanian Rivers
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - A procedure for the characterization of the temporal evolution of river morphology is presented. Wet and active river channels are obtained from the processing of imagery datasets. Information about channel widths and active channel surface subdivision in water, vegetation and gravel coverage classes are evaluated along with channel centerline lengths and sinuosity indices. The analysis is carried out on a series of optical remotely-sensed imagery acquired by different satellite missions during the time period between 1968 and 2017. Data from the CORONA, LANDSAT and Sentinel-2 missions were considered. Besides satellite imagery, a digital elevation model and aerial ortho-photos were also used. The procedure was applied to three, highly dynamic, Albanian rivers: Shkumbin, Seman and Vjose, showing a high potential for application in contexts with limitations in ground data availability. The results of the procedure were assessed against reference data produced by means of expert interpretation of a reference set of river reaches. The results differ from reference values by just a few percentage points (<6%). The time evolution of hydromorphological parameters is well characterized, and the results support the design of future studies aimed at the understanding of the relations between climatic and anthropogenic controls and the response of river morphological trajectories. Moreover, the high spatial and temporal resolution of the Sentinel-2 mission motivates the development of an automatic monitoring system based on a rolling application of the defined procedure.

TI  - Imaging-based outcome prediction in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage
T2  - ACTA NEUROCHIRURGICA
M3  - Review
AB  - Besides the established spot sign in computed tomography angiography (CTA), recently investigated imaging predictors of hematoma growth in noncontrast computed tomography (NCCT) suggest great potential for outcome prediction in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Secondary hematoma growth is an appealing target for therapeutic interventions because in contrast to other determined factors, it is potentially modifiable. Even more initial therapy studies failed to demonstrate clear therapeutic benefits, there is a need for an effective patient selection using imaging markers to identify patients at risk for poor outcome and thereby tailor individual treatments for every patient. Hence, this review gives an overview about the current literature on NCCT imaging markers for neurological outcome prediction and aims to clarify the association with the established spot sign. Moreover, it demonstrates the clinical impact of these parameters and gives a roadmap for future imaging research in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage.

TI  - Worldviews as predictors of wind and solar energy support in Austria: Bridging social acceptance and risk perception research
T2  - ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - With increasing demand for renewable energy, research focusing on social acceptance of production facilities has firmly established itself over the past decades. While the influence of worldviews on individuals' perceptions and behaviour has received widespread scholarly attention regarding a variety of related issues, social acceptance of renewable energy technologies (RET) has not been one of them. The study presented here addresses this shortcoming in the literature by examining the impact of various constructs, including worldviews, with respect to individuals' acceptance of RET in their vicinity. The study builds on a representative sample of Austrian citizens. Our findings suggest that RET belief is most strongly associated with acceptance regarding the construction of RET in participants' community. Further, we find that the more strongly participants feel about a variety of motives that generally support the use of renewable energies, the more accepting they are of local RET power plants. Regarding the effect of worldviews, we find that individuals who value the common good and equality are more supportive of RET in their vicinity. Our discussion focuses on the theoretical implications with particular attention to the results regarding the effect of worldviews.

TI  - SnowCloudHydroA New Framework for Forecasting Streamflow in Snowy, Data-Scarce Regions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We tested the efficacy and skill of SnowCloud, a prototype web-based, cloud-computing framework for snow mapping and hydrologic modeling. SnowCloud is the overarching framework that functions within the Google Earth Engine cloud-computing environment. SnowCloudMetrics is a sub-component of SnowCloud that provides users with spatially and temporally composited snow cover information in an easy-to-use format. SnowCloudHydro is a simple spreadsheet-based model that uses Snow Cover Frequency (SCF) output from SnowCloudMetrics as a key model input. In this application, SnowCloudMetrics rapidly converts NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daily snow cover product (MOD10A1) into a monthly snow cover frequency for a user-specified watershed area. SnowCloudHydro uses SCF and prior monthly streamflow to forecast streamflow for the subsequent month. We tested the skill of SnowCloudHydro in three snow-dominated headwaters that represent a range of precipitation/snowmelt runoff categories: the Rio Elqui in Northern Chile; the John Day River, in the Northwestern United States; and the Rio Aragon in Northern Spain. The skill of the SnowCloudHydro model directly corresponded to snowpack contributions to streamflow. Watersheds with proportionately more snowmelt than rain provided better results (R-2 values: 0.88, 0.52, and 0.22, respectively). To test the user experience of SnowCloud, we provided the tools and tutorials in English and Spanish to water resource managers in Chile, Spain, and the United States. Participants assessed their user experience, which was generally very positive. While these initial results focus on SnowCloud, they outline methods for developing cloud-based tools that can function effectively across cultures and languages. Our approach also addresses the primary challenges of science-based computing; human resource limitations, infrastructure costs, and expensive proprietary software. These challenges are particularly problematic in countries where scientific and computational resources are underdeveloped.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node dissection in prostate cancer using superparamagnetic particles of iron oxide: early clinical experience
T2  - INTERNATIONAL UROLOGY AND NEPHROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Superparamagnetic nanoparticles of iron oxide (SPION) were shown to be non-inferior to standard radioisotope tracer in breast cancer and may be used as an alternative to identify sentinel lymph nodes (SLN). The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) using SPION in prostate cancer and to evaluate its diagnostic accuracy.Twenty patients with intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer were prospectively enrolled in 2016. After intraprostatic injection of SPION, SLND using magnetometer was performed the following day. Extended pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND) was added as a reference standard test. The diagnostic performance of the test were evaluated, as well as the rate of in vivo detected SLN. Surgical times of SLND and ePLND were compared using paired two-sample t test.In total, 97 SLN were detected with median 5 (IQR 3-7) per patient. Non-diagnostic rate of the procedure was 5%. In total, 19 nodal metastases were found in 5 patients, of which 12 were located in SLN. The sensitivity per patient for the whole cohort was 80% and per node 56%. If only patients with at least one detected SLN were considered, the sensitivity per patient and per node reached 100 and 82%, respectively. A median of 20 LNs (IQR 18-22) were removed by subsequent ePLND. Surgical times of SLND and ePLND differed significantly, with medians of 17 and 39 min, respectively (p < 0.001).SLND with SPION is feasible and safe in prostate cancer and the diagnostic accuracy is comparable to the published results of radioguided procedures. In open surgery, SPION may be used as an alternative tracer with its main advantage being the lack of radiation hazard.

TI  - Optimizing kNN for Mapping Vegetation Cover of Arid and Semi-Arid Areas Using Landsat Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land degradation and desertification in arid and semi-arid areas is of great concern. Accurately mapping percentage vegetation cover (PVC) of the areas is critical but challenging because the areas are often remote, sparsely vegetated, and rarely populated, and it is difficult to collect field observations of PVC. Traditional methods such as regression modeling cannot provide accurate predictions of PVC in the areas. Nonparametric constant k-nearest neighbors (Cons_kNN) has been widely used in estimation of forest parameters and is a good alternative because of its flexibility. However, using a globally constant k value in Cons_kNN limits its ability of increasing prediction accuracy because the spatial variability of PVC in the areas leads to spatially variable k values. In this study, a novel method that spatially optimizes determining the spatially variable k values of Cons_kNN, denoted with Opt_kNN, was proposed to map the PVC in both Duolun and Kangbao County located in Inner Mongolia and Hebei Province of China, respectively, using Landsat 8 images and sample plot data. The Opt_kNN was compared with Cons_kNN, a linear stepwise regression (LSR), a geographically weighted regression (GWR), and random forests (RF) to improve the mapping for the study areas. The results showed that (1) most of the red and near infrared band relevant vegetation indices derived from the Landsat 8 images had significant contributions to improving the mapping accuracy; (2) compared with LSR, GWR, RF and Cons_kNN, Opt_kNN resulted in consistently higher prediction accuracies of PVC and decreased relative root mean square errors by 5%, 11%, 5%, and 3%, respectively, for Duolun, and 12%, 1%, 23%, and 9%, respectively, for Kangbao. The Opt_kNN also led to spatially variable and locally optimal k values, which made it possible to automatically and locally optimize k values; and (3) the RF that has become very popular in recent years did not perform the predictions better than the Opt_kNN for the both areas. Thus, the proposed method is very promising to improve mapping the PVC in the arid and semi-arid areas.

TI  - Data assimilation of ocean surface waves using Sentinel-1 SAR during typhoon Malakas
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a data assimilation system is constructed in a third generation ocean surface wave model, MASNUM-WAM, to improve wave simulations. The data assimilation system uses Ensemble Adjustment Kalman Filter (EAKF) method, which is based on dynamic sampling. Difference between 24 h-interval wave parameter fields during the period 7-day before and after assimilation time, is used to construct dynamic ensemble, which is an approximation to background error. Eight experiments are carried out during typhoon Malakas to investigate the impact of different assimilating wave parameters to the simulation errors of significant wave height (SWH). Wave spectrum observations from satellite Sentinel-1 SAR are used for data assimilation. SWH, peak wave period, mean wave direction and wave spectrum are adjusted simultaneously when an observation is available. Results show that the data assimilation system improves the simulation of SWH during typhoon Malakas.

AB  - OBJECTIVE. Recent well-publicized sentinel events have resulted in an appropriately heightened awareness of CT dose. Concern also exists regarding the potential of CT dose increasing the risk of cancer. Several professional societies, governmental and accreditation agencies, and CT vendors have responded to these concerns with campaigns, mandatory standards, and software enhancements. The objective of this article is to review such CT dose management efforts.CONCLUSION. Although CT dose awareness campaigns, mandatory standards, and software enhancements are well intentioned, their implementation is often suboptimal.

TI  - Evapotranspiration Trends (1979-2015) in the Central Valley of California, USA: Contrasting Tendencies During 1981-2007
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Trends in monthly evapotranspiration (ET) rates across three watersheds covering the Central Valley in California were calculated by the latest calibration-free version of the complementary relationship of evaporation for 1979-2015. While a recent study concluded that ET rates of the irrigated fields in the Central Valley were declining in 1981-2007, here an ET trend of about 2.6 +/- 12 mm per decade was found over the same period in spite of a drop in precipitation (-22 +/- 30 mm per decade) and ET rates (-9.5 +/- 10 mm per decade) for the rest of the watersheds, none of them statistically significant. After 2007, the precipitation decline accelerated causing a sharp drop in both irrigated and nonirrigated ET rates across the watersheds. Observations from the California Irrigation Management Information System support the present findings: Under increasing air temperatures, both dew point temperature and relative humidity values increased (at a statistically significant rate) during 1983-2007, while they reversed afterwards, in agreement with the estimated sharp irrigation ET trend decline for the remainder of the study period. Actual (in this case over irrigated fields) and reference ET rates complement each other, that is, they express opposite tendencies, as was demonstrated with California Irrigation Management Information System data, yielding a statistically significant plot-scale irrigation ET rate increase of 31 to 41 (+/- 17) millimeters per decade for 1983-2007 in accordance with a similar drop in reference ET rates of -28 to -50 (+/- 16) millimeters per decade, depending on whether published monthly or daily values (aggregated to monthly ones after leaving out spurious measurements) were employed.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Perforation, dissection, fragmentation, shrinkage and attrition in ecosystems take place due to urbanization. In this study, where and when temporal and spatial heterogeneity occurs is tried to be explained by taking human intervention in landscape pattern and processes in and around the city of Denizli into account and how this heterogeneity affects habitat conditions within the scope of landscape ecology. Landscape pattern metrics were estimated in order to reveal the change in habitats and present the properties of the landscape. 30 pattern indicators on class and pattern levels, which are important to show human-environment interaction, were analyzed in order to indicate the features of the landscape such as area, side, shape and dispersion. To this end, LANDSAT TM/7-ETM/8-OLI satellite images of 1987 and 2013 were classified for laying the foundations of the analysis. Analyses showed that between 1987 and 2013, complicated shape features, increase in edge habitats, de-growth in core areas and eventually fragmentation in landscape have been dominant. Heterogenic structure in landscape has increased. This points not to the self-functioning of the landscape, but to the domination of human intervention over the landscape. Particularly, due to urban growth and sprawl, fragmentation, isolation and habitat loss in croplands have increased. This study sets forth the usefulness of remote sensing, GIS and landscape metrics in understanding how urban dynamics and ecosystems change in developing urban politics.

TI  - Analysis of the tractive force pattern on a knot by force measurement during laparoscopic knot tying
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Quantifying surgical skills assists novice surgeons when learning operative techniques. We measured the interaction force at a ligation point and clarified the features of the force pattern among surgeons with different skill levels during laparoscopic knot tying.Methods: Forty-four surgeons were divided into three groups based on experience: 13 novice (0-5 years), 16 intermediate (6-15 years), and 15 expert (16-30 years). To assess the tractive force direction and volume during knot tying, we used a sensor that measures six force-torque values (x-axis: Fx, y-axis: Fy, z-axis: Fz, and xy-axis: Fxy) attached to a slit Penrose drain. All participants completed one double knot and five single knot sequences. We recorded completion time, force volume (FV), maximum force (MF), time over 1.5 N, duration of non-zero force, and percentage time when vertical force exceeded horizontal force (PTz).Results: There was a significant difference between groups for completion time (p = 0.007); FV (total: p = 0.002; Fx: p = 0.004, Fy: p = 0.007, Fxy: p = 0.004, Fz: p < 0.001, Fxy/Fz: p = 0.003), MF (total: p = 0.004; Fx: p = 0.015, Fy: p = 0.035, Fxy: p = 0.009, Fz: p = 0.001, Fxy/Fz: p = 0.041); time over 1.5 N (p = 0.002); duration of non-zero force (p = 0.029); and PTz (p < 0.001). PTz showed the only significant difference comparing intermediates with experts (intermediates: 13.7 +/- 9.0, experts: 4.9 +/- 3.2; p < 0.001).Conclusions: We clarified the characteristics of the force pattern at the ligation point during suturing by surgeons with three levels of experience using a force measurement system. We revealed that both force volume and force direction differed depending on surgeons' skill level during knot tying. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Inc.

CP  - 7th International Cancer Metastasis Symposium on Cancer Metastasis through the Lymphovascular System - Biology and Treatment

AB  - The clinical utilization of sentinel node (SN) mapping for early esophageal cancer or gastric cancer has been unclear for a long time. However, previous investigations regarding SN mapping of these cancers have shown relatively good results with regard to the detection rate and diagnostic accuracy for determining the lymph node status. SN mapping helps obtain information about individual metastatic status and allows the modification of the operation in early-stage upper gastrointestinal (GI) disease. Radio-guided methods for identifying SNs in early esophageal cancer have been established via endoscopic injection of technetium-99m tin colloid. Previous studies have reported that the SN concept seems valid, and radio-guided SN mapping can be feasible in cT1N0 esophageal cancer. SN navigation surgery are believed to have potential as strategies for minimally invasive modified surgery for early esophageal cancer. A Japanese study group conducted a prospective multicenter trial of SN mapping for early gastric cancer using a dual tracer method with radioactive colloid and blue dyes; they demonstrated a high detection rate and accuracy for determining the metastatic status based on SN mapping. Subsequently, minimized gastrectomy, including partial gastrectomy and segmental gastrectomy with individualized selective and modified lymphadenectomy for early gastric cancer with a negative SN has been performed to evaluate the long-term survival and postoperative quality of life (QOL) in a multicenter prospective trial. This study verified the SN concept in early-stage upper GI disease with cN0 and found that function-preserving esophagectomy or gastrectomy may help maintain patients' post-surgical QOL.

TI  - An assessment of the variation of soil properties with landscape attributes in the highlands of Cameroon
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil properties are useful for assessing the potential of landscapes to provide terrestrial ecosystem services, but they are affected by anthropogenic activities and environmental factors including landscape attributes. This study assessed how soil properties are influenced by landscape attributes and their interactions in the highlands of Cameroon using the Land Degradation Surveillance Framework as a data collection tool. Soil properties (soil organic carbon [SOC], clay content, exchangeable bases [ExBas], electric conductivity [EC], boron [B], manganese [Mn], phosphorus [P], pH) were quantified within classes of landscape attributes. Soil samples were collected on 160 (1,000m(2)) plots randomly located in a sentinel site of 100km(2) and were analyzed using a combination of conventional laboratory methods and mid-infrared spectroscopy. Soil properties were highly affected by soil depths, land use types, slope gradients, and topographic positions, but less by their interactions. Significant interactions existed between land use types and topographic positions for SOC, EC, ExBas, and pH, and between slope gradients and topographic positions for pH, whereas Mn was influenced by the interaction between land use types and slope gradients. Most soil properties were higher in low altitude plots and those with higher vegetation cover but decreased in the upslope direction. The pH and clay contents were less affected by slope gradient confirming the inherent nature of the properties. These results are useful for site-specific implementation of ecological intensification in areas with complex topography such as the highlands of Cameroon, offering a reference for future ecological policies and landscape restoration.

TI  - Comprehensive Etiological and Epidemiological Study on Acute Respiratory Infections in Children: Providing Evidence for the Prevention and Control of Childhood Pneumonia in the Philippines
T2  - JOURNAL OF DISASTER RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Childhood pneumonia has been the leading cause of morbidity and mortality for decades. Although substantial progress in the understanding of risk factors and etiology of pneumonia has been made, childhood pneumonia remains the major cause of death in children, accounting for 900,000 of the estimated 6.3 million child deaths worldwide in 2013. More than 90% of all episodes of clinical childhood pneumonia worldwide occur in low and middle-income countries. More effective and feasible interventions need to be developed and made widely available for such countries, including the Philippines. Comprehensive research, including etiological and epidemiological studies for assessments of risk factors and thereby, intervention studies to reduce the impact of childhood pneumonia are required in hospital settings, as well as community settings, consistently. A research project entitled "comprehensive etiological and epidemiological study on acute respiratory infections in children: providing evidence for the prevention and control of childhood pneumonia, the Philippines" was conducted under SATREPS (Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development), which is a funding scheme to promote international joint research focusing on global issues. This project was implemented in four sentinel hospitals, with some community settings, in the Philippines between April 2011 andMarch 2017, incorporating five sub-components: etiological study, disease burden study, risk factor analysis, intervention study, and its evaluation. In this paper, we introduce the research project of SATREPS focusing on the methodologies, progress, and obtained evidence.

TI  - Gravity and magnetic anomalies of ecuadorian margin: Implications in the deep structure of the subduction of Nazca Plate and Andes Cordillera
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - To improve our knowledge of the deep structure of the Ecuadorian continental margin we combined satellite gravity and magnetic anomalies with the gravity field data obtained in land surveys, integrated as well as with seismicity and geological data. Satellite Bouguer anomalies are elongated, arched and parallel to the continental margin. The lows are related to the Andes Cordillera, while relative westward parallel highs correspond to the Cordillera Costanera and the Talara-Tumbes Cordilleras. Smooth and irregular positive anomalies characterize Oriente Basin. The oceanic Nazca Plate shows negative relative to the sounding normal oceanic crust, ENE-WSW gravity anomalies highlighting the Carnegie Ridge, surrounded by highs corresponding to standard oceanic lithosphere. New gravity field profiles at 1 degrees S and 4 degrees S show Bouguer anomalies comprised between -273 and + 75 mGal, giving higher resolution than satellite data. Gravity crustal models suggest that the continental crust in the Andean Cordillera is 70 km thick, while 20 to 40 km thick in the Coastal region and Oriente Basin. Seismic data show the oceanic crust, 8 km thick, extends beneath the continent to a depth of 200 km, with the highest dip of the subduction slab modelled at Profile 1 degrees S, which is the area of the Andes Cordillera having maximum elevation. Main sedimentary basins and intrusive bodies are related to the local low Bouguer anomalies, whereas high values correspond to allochthonous oceanic units. Reverse faults are widespread and contribute to crustal thickening. Normal faults are located in the forearc basin. Satellite magnetic data reveal anomalies related to the subducting slab below the South American margin, reaching the Andes Cordillera. The Carnegie Ridge is characterized by a roughly ENE-WSW minimum, corresponding to highly magnetized rocks located along the 1 degrees S profile. The E-W anomaly pattern changes sharply at the eastern edge of the seismicity related to subduction; further eastward the NW-SE anomalies are associated with the South American craton in Oriente Basin.

TI  - Surface mapping of the Milh Kharwah salt diapir to better understand the subsurface petroleum system in the Sab'atayn Basin, onshore Yemen
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Sab'atayn Basin of Yemen, hydrocarbons were generated from pre-salt Upper Jurassic source rocks during the Cenozoic and the salt provides the ultimate super seal for the pre-salt and intra-salt traps. Therefore, the proper understanding of salt tectonics is critical for ongoing hydrocarbon exploration efforts targeting the fractured basement play in the Sab'atayn Basin. Based on numerous well penetrations, the presence of non-evaporitic lithologic units such as black shales, marls, carbonates, and sandstones within the Tithonian Sab'atayn Formation is quite common and quite important for the prolific Alif oil play. The internal lithologic and structural complexity of the Tithonian evaporites was addressed by analyzing a few outcropping salt diapirs east of the Habban Field area in the central part of the Sab'atayn Basin. In particular, the Milh Kharwah diapir was studied by recently acquired high-resolution satellite images (16 band VIS-NVIR and SWIR WorldView-3 imagery) integrated by outcrop sampling of the various lithologies exposed in the diapir. The Sab'atayn Formation was found here to be a "dirty salt" as it has not only halite, anhydrite, and gypsum but also various stringers of bituminous marls and other non-evaporitic lithologies. Based on the lithologic composition of 10 surface spot samples and their spectral signal in the infrared satellite data sets, a quasi-geologic map of the diapir was generated. The remote sensing evaluation was done in lieu of the time-consuming and logistically challenging surface geologic mapping in this conflict-stricken region. The geometry of the intra-salt curtain folds seen on the new map, considered as a useful approximation of a geological map, is very characteristic for stems of diapirs seen elsewhere, suggesting significant post-kinematic exhumation and erosion in the area. Salt diapirs reaching the surface dissipate heat more efficiently and thus keep deeper segments of a basin relatively colder and potentially within the oil window for a longer time. Recent apatite fission-track analysis using drill-core samples from four nearby wells provided middle to late Eocene ages (34-39 Ma) for the onset of an estimated 400-500-m erosion of the Milh Kharwah salt diapir constraining our petroleum system model. Moreover, the quantitative lithologic description of the evaporite sequence, integrating the surface samples with high-resolution satellite images, further refined our basin modeling results.

TI  - Are the Poor Digitally Left Behind? Indications of Urban Divides Based on Remote Sensing and Twitter Data
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Every city is-quoting Plato-divided into two, one city of the poor, the other of the rich. In this study we test whether the economic urban divide is reflected in the digital sphere of cities. Because, especially in dynamically growing cities, ready-to-use comprehensive data sets on the urban poor, as well as on the digital divide, are not existent, we use proxies: we spatially delimit the urban poor using settlement characteristics derived from remote sensing data. The digital divide is targeted by geolocated Twitter data. Based on a sample of eight cities across the globe, we spatially test whether areas of the urban poor are more likely to be digital cold spots. Over the course of time, we analyze whether temporal signatures in poor urban areas differ from formal environments. We find that the economic divide influences digital participation in public life. Less residents of morphological slums are found to be digitally oriented ("are digitally left behind") as compared to residents of formal settlements. However, among the few twitter users in morphological slums, we find their temporal behavior similar to the twitter users in formal settlements. In general, we conclude this discussion, this study exemplifies that the combination of both heterogeneous data sets allows for extending the capabilities of individual disciplines for research towards urban poverty.

TI  - Targeted ultrasound and fine-needle aspiration cytology for sentinel node diagnostics in early-stage melanoma: a validation study
T2  - MELANOMA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology (US-FNAC) is used to evaluate the involvement of lymph nodes in various malignant diseases. Its value in detecting sentinel lymph node (SN) metastasis preoperatively in melanoma patients is controversial and is the subject of this study. In this prospective validation study, 91 consecutive patients with melanoma clinical stage I (n=64) and II (n=27) were examined with US-FNAC before SN biopsy from 2012 to 2014 at a tertiary center. All patients underwent lymphoscintigraphy before the US-FNAC. Lymph nodes that showed any of the Berlin morphologic criteria on ultrasonography were examined using FNAC. The median Breslow thickness of the melanomas was 1.22mm (range: 0.47-11.5mm). Twenty-two percent of the patients had metastases in their SNs, 90% of which were smaller than 2mm in largest diameter. The percentages of metastases with a size more than 1mm were 50 and 29%, respectively, in the true-positive and false-negative US groups. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for overall US examination were 30, 81, 24, and 83%, respectively. None of the FNACs contained conclusive malignant cells. The specificity of the FNAC was 76%. Our results show that US-FNAC was not a useful diagnostic tool in our setting as it did not add significantly to the staging and management of patients with mainly thin cutaneous melanomas, perhaps because of the often small size of the SN metastases. It may be useful in the early diagnosis of lymph node metastases in a subgroup of melanoma patients with larger metastases. Copyright (c) 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Retrieval of narrow-range LAI of at multiple lidar point densities: Application on <i>Eucalyptus grandis</i> plantation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is an important forest structural parameter that can be used to characterize various biophysical processes such as photosynthesis, evapotranspiration, and carbon flux. Accurate monitoring of LAI therefore is crucial for efficient management of managed and natural vegetation ecosystems. Remote sensing techniques have proved useful in the quantification and monitoring of LAI in different vegetation types; however, most of the focus has been on vegetation with relatively large LAI ranges. This study aimed to investigate the utility of airborne light detection and ranging (lidar) data to estimate narrow-range LAI (min = 0.71, max = 1.56, mean = 1.08 +/- 0.18) of intensively-managed Eucalyptus grandis plantations. The secondary aim of the study was to assess the effect of lidar point density on LAI retrieval. Reference LAI was quantified in 15 m radius sample plots (n = 46) using hemispherical photography. Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) regression was used to build candidate models that estimate LAI from lidar-derived height and density metrics. The correlations were investigated at different point densities, including the original (> 6 points/m(2)) and reduced density levels (0.25-5 points/m(2)). Candidate models returned adjusted coefficient of determination (adj. R-2) ranging between 0.65-0.83 (RMSE 7.0-10.0% of observed mean) depending on the number of predicting metrics included in the models. A model that had two non-collinear metrics was selected as a compromise model (adj. R-2 = 0.67; RMSE = 9.7%); this model was comparable to the best model, which had many collinear metrics. Estimation accuracies were similar for lidar densities of the original, 2-5 points/m(2) and less accurate for 0.25-1 point/m(2). These findings demonstrated the capability of lidar in estimating observed LAI with low range and variation. The study also suggests the efficacy of moderate lidar point densities acquired at relatively low-cost surveys in attaining acceptable LAI estimation accuracy.

TI  - Effects of Different Spatial Precipitation Input Data on Crop Model Outputs under a Central European Climate
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop simulation models, which are mainly being utilized as tools to assess the consequences of a changing climate and different management strategies on crop production at the field scale, are increasingly being used in a distributed model at the regional scale. Spatial data analysis and modelling in combination with geographic information systems (GIS) integrates information from soil, climate, and topography data into a larger area, providing a basis for spatial and temporal analysis. In the current study, the crop growth model Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) was used to evaluate five gridded precipitation input data at three locations in Austria. The precipitation data sets consist of the INtegrated Calibration and Application Tool (INCA) from the Meteorological Service Austria, two satellite precipitation data sourcesMultisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) and Climate Prediction Center MORPHing (CMORPH)and two rainfall estimates based on satellite soil moisture data. The latter were obtained through the application of the SM2RAIN algorithm (SM2R(ASC)) and a regression analysis (RA(ASC)) applied to the Metop-A/B Advanced SCATtermonter (ASCAT) soil moisture product during a 9-year period from 2007-2015. For the evaluation, the effect on winter wheat and spring barley yield, caused by different precipitation inputs, at a spatial resolution of around 25 km was used. The highest variance was obtained for the driest area with light-textured soils; TMPA and two soil moisture-based products show very good results in the more humid areas. The poorest performances at all three locations and for both crops were found with the CMORPH input data.

TI  - Do payments for forest ecosystem services generate double dividends? An integrated impact assessment of Vietnam's PES program
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Payments for ecosystem services (PES) often serve multiple objectives, such as carbon emission reduction and poverty alleviation. However, the effectiveness of PES as an instrument to achieve these multiple objectives, in particular in a conservation-development context, is often questioned. This study adds to the very limited empirical evidence base and investigates to what extent Vietnam's move to PES has helped protect forest ecosystems and improve local livelihoods and income inequality. We zoom in on Lam Dong province, where PES was first introduced in Vietnam in 2009. Changes in forest cover are analysed using satellite images over a period of 15 years (2000-2014). Socio-economic impacts are assessed based on rural household interviews with PES participants and non-participants as a control group over a period of 7 years (2008-2014). Our results show that PES contributes significantly to forest cover, the improvement of local livelihoods, and the reduction of income inequality.

TI  - Land Subsidence in Coastal Environments: Knowledge Advance in the Venice Coastland by TerraSAR-X PSI
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of satellite SAR interferometric methods has significantly improved the monitoring of ground movements over the last decades, thus opening new possibilities for a more accurate interpretation of land subsidence and its driving mechanisms. TerraSAR-X has been extensively used to study land subsidence in the Venice Lagoon, Italy, with the aim of quantifying the natural and anthropogenic causes. In this paper, we review and update the main results achieved by three research projects supported by DLR AOs (German Aerospace Center Announcement of Opportunity) and conducted to test the capability of TerraSAR-X PSI (Persistent Scatterer Interferometry) to detect ground movements in the complex physiographic setting of the Venice transitional coastal environment. The investigations have been focused on the historical center of Venice, the lagoon inlets where the MoSE is under construction, salt marshes, and newly built-up areas in the littoral. PSI on stacks of stripmap TerraSAR-X images covering short- to long-time periods (i.e., the years 2008-2009, 2008-2011 and 2008-2013) has proven particularly effective to measure land subsidence in the Venice coastland. The very high spatial resolution (3 m) and the short repeat time interval (11 days) of the TerraSAR-X acquisitions make it possible to investigate ground movements with a detail unavailable in the past. The interferometric products, properly calibrated, allowed for a millimetric vertical accuracy of the land movements at both the regional and local scales, even for short-term analyses, i.e., spanning one year only. The new picture of the land movement resulted from processing TerraSAR-X images has significantly contributed to update the knowledge on the subsidence process at the Venice coast.

TI  - Towards Global-Scale Seagrass Mapping and Monitoring Using Sentinel-2 on Google Earth Engine: The Case Study of the Aegean and Ionian Seas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Seagrasses are traversing the epoch of intense anthropogenic impacts that significantly decrease their coverage and invaluable ecosystem services, necessitating accurate and adaptable, global-scale mapping and monitoring solutions. Here, we combine the cloud computing power of Google Earth Engine with the freely available Copernicus Sentinel-2 multispectral image archive, image composition, and machine learning approaches to develop a methodological workflow for large-scale, high spatiotemporal mapping and monitoring of seagrass habitats. The present workflow can be easily tuned to space, time and data input; here, we show its potential, mapping 2510.1 km(2) of P. oceanica seagrasses in an area of 40,951 km(2) between 0 and 40 m of depth in the Aegean and Ionian Seas (Greek territorial waters) after applying support vector machines to a composite of 1045 Sentinel-2 tiles at 10-m resolution. The overall accuracy of P. oceanica seagrass habitats features an overall accuracy of 72% following validation by an independent field data set to reduce bias. We envision that the introduced flexible, time- and cost-efficient cloud-based chain will provide the crucial seasonal to interannual baseline mapping and monitoring of seagrass ecosystems in global scale, resolving gain and loss trends and assisting coastal conservation, management planning, and ultimately climate change mitigation.

TI  - Crevasses as Indicators of Surge Dynamics in the Bering Bagley Glacier System, Alaska: Numerical Experiments and Comparison to Image Data Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the largest sources of uncertainty in sea level rise prediction is glacial acceleration, of which the surge phenomenon is the least understood type. The surge of the Bering Bagley Glacier System (BBGS), Alaska, in 2011-2013 has provided a rare opportunity to study the surge phenomenon in a large and complex glacier system. A surge results in widespread crevassing throughout the glacier system complicating many traditional techniques used to study glacier dynamics. In this paper, we utilize crevassing as a means to investigate the recent BBGS surge through numerical modeling and geostatistical data analysis. Following the principles of structural glaciology, image-based crevasse characterizations are obtained through geostatistical methods applied to Landsat-7 data, supplemented by airborne field observations. On the modeling side, a 3-D full-Stokes finite element model of the BBGS is developed and applied to investigate ice dynamics and surface structures during the recent surge. A von Mises criterion is adopted to simulate crevassing at the glacier surface, oriented along the axes of maximum principal tensile stress. To facilitate evaluation of model- and data-derived crevasse characteristics, three different comparison methods are introduced. General agreement in the model-data comparisons indicates that the model has the ability to represent the BBGS system during peak acceleration. The crevasse-based approach is also employed to optimize the basal sliding parameter and the von Mises stress threshold in the model. Results further indicate that bed topography is an important constraint in modeling the surge process.

TI  - OPG, OPN, EGF and VEGF Levels at Individual Breslow Score Stages in Malignant Melanoma
T2  - ANTICANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background/Aim: Melanoma represents one of the most aggressive forms of cancer. With the rapid increases in the incidence of melanoma in the United States, Australia and Europe over the last decades, melanoma has been considered an epidemic cancer in these areas. The aim of our study was to evaluate the utility of osteoprotegerin (OPG), osteopontin (OPN), epidermal growth factor (EGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF for the diagnosis and prognosis of melanoma. Patients and Methods: Overall, 322 individuals were assessed: 183 melanoma patients and 139 healthy individuals. Melanoma patients were divided into four subgroups according to the Breslow score. OPN, OPG, EGF, and VEGF were determined in each plasma sample. Results: The serum levels of the following biomarkers were statistically significantly higher in the melanoma group compared to the control group: OPG and, OPN (p<0.0001), EGF (p=0.0379). In the first stage, OPG (p=0.0236) and OPN (p=0.0327) showed a statistically significant increase. Concerning positive and negative sentinel node metastases a statistically significant change was observed in: OPN (p<0.0001), EGF (p=0.0114), VEGF (p=0.0114). Conclusion: OPG and OPN are promising biomarkers of early-stage melanoma. EGF and VEGF appear to be prognostic biomarkers.

TI  - Epidemiological trends in the diagnosis of melanoma in a Southern European population: analysis of a large database from a tertiary referral center
T2  - MELANOMA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to present the epidemiological, clinicopathological, and treatment characteristics of patients diagnosed and treated in a tertiary referral center and to analyze independent factors associated with these characteristics. In this cohort study, epidemiological, clinicopathological, and treatment characteristics of 1461 consecutive melanoma patients diagnosed and treated in a tertiary referral center in 1987-2015 were prospectively collected in a registry. All patients underwent resection of their melanoma lesion. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to examine independent correlations between characteristics. Internal validation of these correlations was performed by the bootstrap method. The median age of the patients was 53 years. Female sex had a slight predominance, whereas the majority were of Southern European origin. Superficial spreading melanoma was associated with younger age (P<0.001), whereas the nodular melanoma histological subtype was associated independently with indoor occupation (P=0.021) and diagnosis in the years 2004-2015 (P=0.002). Melanomas with Breslow thickness above 1.0mm were associated with skin type III-IV (P=0.021) and diagnosis in the years 1987-2003 (P=0.046). In addition, histological ulceration was associated with older age (P=0.004) and diagnosis in the years 1987-2003 (P<0.001), whereas histological regression was associated independently with older age (P=0.001). This study presented independent associations between epidemiological, histopathological, and treatment characteristics, which might help to better understand melanoma disease and treatment practices in Southern Europe.

TI  - Detection of Temporary Flooded Vegetation Using Sentinel-1 Time Series Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The C-band Sentinel-1 satellite constellation enables the continuous monitoring of the Earth's surface within short revisit times. Thus, it provides Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) time series data that can be used to detect changes over time regardless of daylight or weather conditions. Within this study, a time series classification approach is developed for the extraction of the flood extent with a focus on temporary flooded vegetation (TFV). This method is based on Sentinel-1 data, as well as auxiliary land cover information, and combines a pixel-based and an object-oriented approach. Multi-temporal characteristics and patterns are applied to generate novel times series features, which represent a basis for the developed approach. The method is tested on a study area in Namibia characterized by a large flood event in April 2017. Sentinel-1 times series were used for the period between September 2016 and July 2017. It is shown that the supplement of TFV areas to the temporary open water areas prevents the underestimation of the flood area, allowing the derivation of the entire flood extent. Furthermore, a quantitative evaluation of the generated flood mask was carried out using optical Sentinel-2 images, whereby it was shown that overall accuracy increased by 27% after the inclusion of the TFV.

TI  - Potential of Multi-Temporal ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 ScanSAR Data for Vegetation Height Estimation in Tropical Forests of Mexico
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on the spatial distribution of forest structure parameters (e.g., aboveground biomass, vegetation height) are crucial for assessing terrestrial carbon stocks and emissions. In this study, we sought to assess the potential and merit of multi-temporal dual-polarised L-band observations for vegetation height estimation in tropical deciduous and evergreen forests of Mexico. We estimated vegetation height using dual-polarised L-band observations and a machine learning approach. We used airborne LiDAR-based vegetation height for model training and for result validation. We split LiDAR-based vegetation height into training and test data using two different approaches, i.e., considering and ignoring spatial autocorrelation between training and test data. Our results indicate that ignoring spatial autocorrelation leads to an overoptimistic model's predictive performance. Accordingly, a spatial splitting of the reference data should be preferred in order to provide realistic retrieval accuracies. Moreover, the model's predictive performance increases with an increasing number of spatial predictors and training samples, but saturates at a specific level (i.e., at 12 dual-polarised L-band backscatter measurements and at around 20% of all training samples). In consideration of spatial autocorrelation between training and test data, we determined an optimal number of L-band observations and training samples as a trade-off between retrieval accuracy and data collection effort. In summary, our study demonstrates the merit of multi-temporal ScanSAR L-band observations for estimation of vegetation height at a larger scale and provides a workflow for robust predictions of this parameter.

TI  - Mapping Urban Growth and Its Relation to Seismic Hazards in Istanbul
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In Istanbul, one of the most densely populated cities of Turkey, the population has grown rapidly over the last 30 years. In addition to being one of the rapidly flourishing cities in Europe, the city is positioned on the seismically active North Anatolian Fault (NAF). The form and rate of Istanbul's fast urban growth has serious implications for seismic hazards. There have been some studies to map lateral urban growth for the city but they do not give satisfactory information about vertical urban growth and seismic hazards. We use DMSP night lights and Landsat data to map changes in land cover-land use in and around the city since 1984, and determine relations of these changes with the NAF. Changes in land use and intensity of development are identified by changes in night light brightness while changes in land cover are identified by changes in land surface reflectance. Aggregate changes in reflectance are represented as changes in subpixel mixtures of the most functionally and spectrally distinct spectral endmembers of land cover. Using standardized global endmembers, SVD composite images were produced for 1984, 2000 and 2011 and fraction change (delta SVD) maps were produced for the decadal intervals. The results show that most of the urban expansion has occurred near the NAF. This has serious implications for seismic hazards in the future if the progression of large earthquakes continues to move westward toward the city.

TI  - Assessing the availability of forest biomass for bioenergy by publicly available satellite imagery
T2  - IFOREST-BIOGEOSCIENCES AND FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest biomass is a renewable energy source, more climate-friendly than fossil fuels and widely available in Europe. The wood energy chain has been suggested as a means to re-activate forest management and improve the value of forest stands in marginalized rural areas. However, wall-to-wall estimates of forest biomass, needed to design the location and size of power and heat biomass plants in any given territory, are notoriously difficult to obtain. This paper tests an algorithm to predict forest biomass using publicly available Landsat satellite imagery in the Liguria region, northern Italy. We used regional forest inventory data to train and validate an artificial neural network (ANN) classifier that uses remotely-sensed information such as three principal components of Landsat-5 TM spectral bands, the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and topography, to retrieve aboveground live tree volume. Percent root mean square error was -9% and -23% for conifers and broadleaves respectively in the calibration dataset, and -27% and -24% in the validation dataset. The reconstructed volume map was updated to present day using current volume increment rates reported by the Italian National Forest Inventory. A wall-to-wall map of forest biomass from harvest residues was finally produced based on species-specific wood density, biomass expansion factors, volume logged for timber assortments, forest accessibility, and topography. Predicted aboveground forest volume ranged from 81 to 391 m(3) ha(-1) . In forests available for wood supply (70% of the total), planned volume removals averaged 25.4 m(3) ha(-1) , or 18.7% of the average standing stock across. Biomass available for bioenergy supply was 1.295.921 million Mg dry matter or 8.95 Mg ha(-1) . This analysis workflow can be replicated in all mountain regions with a predominant broadleaved coppice component.

TI  - Hydro- and sediment dynamics in the Gironde estuary (France): Sensitivi to seasonal variations in river inflow and sea level rise
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding estuarine hydrodynamics and sediment dynamics is of key importance to provide the foundation for sound management of these coastal systems. Turbidity maxima, which are zones of elevated suspended sediment concentration (SSC), are of particular interest as they control biogeochemical cycling and affect the overall environmental quality of the estuary. These turbidity maxima, however, are complex dynamic features that respond to changes in forcing conditions. In this study we use a 3D numerical model to investigate the response of hydrosedimentary dynamics to variations in river inflow and sea level rise in the Gironde estuary, which is one of the largest estuarine systems in Europe. Yearly simulations and comparisons with satellite data and measurements of salinity and SSC show that the model reproduces variations in salinity intrusion and the migration of the turbidity maximum driven by seasonal fluctuations in river inflow. Numerical experiments indicate that the formation of this dynamic turbidity maximum is mainly driven by tidal asymmetry. Density gradients play a secondary role by maintaining the stability of the suspended sediment mass. The model also simulates the presence of a secondary turbidity maximum which is more stable, consistent with observations. Evaluation of the sediment budget shows that sediment export mainly occurs during spring tides and when river discharge is high. Simulations including sea level rise suggest that salinity levels in the middle estuary will increase and rising water levels cause tidal amplification, strengthening of tidal currents and enhanced SSC levels in the upper estuary. On the other hand, the locations of the salinity front and the turbidity maximum remain relatively stable under rising water levels. Overall, our simulations suggest that decadal changes in river inflow can potentially have a larger effect on turbidity maximum dynamics than sea level rise.

TI  - Eddy Covariance fluxes versus satellite-based modelisation in a deficit irrigated orchard
T2  - ITALIAN JOURNAL OF AGROMETEOROLOGY-RIVISTA ITALIANA DI AGROMETEOROLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study describes a combined approach to determine actual evapotranspiration (ETa) fluxes in a deficit irrigated orchard in Sicily, Italy. Different ET models mostly based on satellite data (i.e., surface energy balance models: one source ET1S - two source ET2S, and vegetation indexes derived crop coefficient model, ETVI) were compared with both direct ET measurements obtained in situ by the Eddy Covariance (EC) technique (ETEC) and crop ET (ETc) calculated by FAO-56 approach. Results of the comparisons show a general overestimation of the latent heat flux (or ET) by the satellite models and estimated ETc, respect to the direct ET(EC)data. This discrepancy can be the consequence of the deficit irrigation regimes (i.e. ranging from a minimum reduction of about 15% to a maximum of 45% of ETc) applied at the experimental orange orchard, which may have caused a high source of sensible heat flux, driven by the temperature gradient between plant canopy-atmosphere continuum.

TI  - Assessment of Radiometric Resolution Impact on Remote Sensing Data Classification Accuracy
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Improved sensor characteristics are generally assumed to increase the potential accuracy of image classification and information extraction from remote sensing imagery. However, the increase in data volume caused by these improvements raise challenges associated with the selection, storage, and processing of this data, and with the cost-effective and timely analysis of the remote sensing datasets. Previous research has extensively assessed the relevance and impact of spatial, spectral and temporal resolution of satellite data on classification accuracy, but little attention has been given to the impact of radiometric resolution. This study focuses on the role of radiometric resolution on classification accuracy of remote sensing data through different classification experiments over three different sites. The experiments were carried out using fine and low scale radiometric resolution images classified through a bagging classification tree. The classification experiments addressed different aspects of the classification road map, including among others, binary and multiclass classification schemes, spectrally and spatially enhanced images, as well as pixel and objects as units of the classification. In addition, the impact of image radiometric resolution on computational time and the information content in fine- and low-resolution images was also explored. While in certain cases, higher radiometric resolution has led to up to 8% higher classification accuracies compared to lower resolution radiometric data, other results indicate that higher radiometric resolution does not necessarily imply improved classification accuracy. Also, classification accuracy of spectral indices and texture bands is not related so much to the radiometric resolution of the original remote sensing images but rather to their own radiometric resolution. Overall, the results of this study suggest that data selection and classification need not always adhere to the highest possible radiometric resolution.

T2  - BULLETIN OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To implement the World Health Organization's pandemic influenza severity assessment tool in Australia, using multiple sources of data to establish thresholds and measure influenza severity indicators.Methods We used data from four reliable sources: sentinel general practitioner surveillance, hospital surveillance, a public health hotline and an influenza-like illness survey system.We measured three influenza severity indicators (transmissibility, impact and disease seriousness) defined using pandemic influenza severity assessment guidelines. We used the moving epidemic method and a seriousness indicator-specific method to set thresholds for indicator parameters using 2012-2016 data. We then applied the thresholds to data from the 2017 influenza season.Findings We were able to measure and produce thresholds for each severity indicator. At least one laboratory-confirmed influenza parameter was used to measure each indicator. When thresholds were applied to the 2017 season, there was good agreement across all data sources in measuring activity for each indicator.The season was characterized as having high transmissibility and extraordinary impact Seriousness was characterized as moderate overall and in all age groups except those aged >= 65 years for whom it was high. This matched the description of the season produced by the Australian national influenza surveillance committee, based on expert opinion and historical ranges.Conclusion The pandemic influenza severity assessment and moving epidemic method provide a robust and flexible method to enable an evidence-based assessment of seasonal influenza severity across diverse data sources. This is useful for national assessment and will contribute to global monitoring and response to circulating influenza with pandemic potential.

TI  - Algal blooms detection in Colombian Caribbean Sea using MODIS imagery
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The current capacity in the Caribbean region to enhance the knowledge about algal blooms and harmful algal blooms has several logistical constraints. This work aimed to explore the detection of possible algal blooms using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Fluorescence Line Height (FLH) data in the Colombian Caribbean Sea between 2003 and 2013. Monthly FLH images with 4 km of spatial resolution were processed and classified. The relationship between the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and the FLH were explored using a Geographically Weighted Regression. The results showed three areas identified as having possible persistent blooms: the Uraba Gulf (UG), Magdalena Rivermouth (MRM), and Guajira Peninsula (GP). The SST does not have any considerable influence on the variation in the FLH. The supply of nutrients during the rainy season may be causing the frequent massive algae growth. MODIS fluorescence was useful as a screening tool to identify risk areas for potential algal blooms.

TI  - A Bayesian Procedure for Full-Resolution Quality Assessment of Pansharpened Products
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pansharpening regards the fusion of a high-spatial resolution panchromatic image with a low-spatial resolution multispectral image. One of the most debated topics about pansharpening is related to the quality assessment of fused products. Two main assessment procedures are usually exploited in the literature: the reduced resolution validation and the full-resolution (FR) validation. The former has the advantage to be accurate, but the hypothesis of invariance among scales has to be assumed. The latter overcomes this limitation but paying it with a lower accuracy. In this paper, we will focus on the FR assessment proposing an approach for estimating an overall quality index at FR by using multiscale FR measurements. The problem is recast into the sequential Bayesian framework exploiting a Kalman filter to find its solution. The proposed procedure for quality evaluation has been tested on four real data sets acquired by the Pleiades, the GeoEye-1, the WorldView-3, and the WorldView-4 sensors assessing the quality of 19 pansharpened methods. The proposed approach has demonstrated its superiority with respect to the benchmark consisting of state-of-the-art quality assessment procedures.

TI  - Assessment of the changes in the number of terrestrial vertebrates and habitat in Northeast China over the last 40 years.
T2  - Acta Ecologica Sinica
M3  - Article
AB  - Biodiversity is the basis for maintaining ecological balance and realizing ecological process and function. Northeast China is one of the most biodiverse areas in China and even the whole world. To understand the changes of the number and habitats changes of terrestrial vertebrates in the Northeast China, we combined long time-series species survey data and habitat remote sensing data, selected living planet index ( LPI), area and fragmentation index of ecosystem types in different years as indicators, assessed the variation trend of terrestrial vertebrates and habitats in Northeast China in recent 40 years. The study showed the number of terrestrial vertebrate reduced by 70.1% from 1970 to 2010 in this area. The number of forest species reduced by 80.9% and the number of grassland and desert species increased by 180.9% from 1970 to 2010. The number of wetland species reduced by 75.7% from 1980 to 2010. The area of farmland and urban development increased by 25.2% and 32.3% from 1980 to 2015, respectively. With the continuous erode of natural ecological space such as reclamation of agriculture and urbanization, about 6.1% of the natural habitats were converted to artificial habitats. As a result, the natural habitats continued to decrease with a total decrease of about 8.0% in the area. The landscape fragmentation index of the natural habitat overall showed an increasing trend during 1980-2015. In particular, the index of fragmentation of forest habitats increased by about 42.7%, but the rising trend was lower after 2005, which was consistent with the decreasing trend in the number of vertebrate populations after 2005. This study showed that the number of large mammals in Northeast China has decreased sharply in the past 40 years, and the main reasons for this change are the increase in fragmentation of natural ecosystems and the decline of habitat quality caused by deforestation, population growth, urbanization, and traffic construction.

TI  - Post-flood land use damage estimation using improved Normalized Difference Flood Index (NDFI<sub>3</sub>) on Landsat 8 datasets: December 2014 floods, Kelantan, Malaysia
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Floods in Malaysia have been increasing in frequency and magnitude as reflected in the Kelantan Flood event in 2014 that resulted in a huge loss of lives and properties. Whereas remote sensing (RS) and geographical information system (GIS) tools have been extensively applied in flood disaster management, there are few reports and studies on the impact of floods on the land use/land cover environment in a post-disaster assessment. In this study, an integrated modelling approach was developed that used Landsat 8 OLI TIRS (Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor) data, flood indexing and classification processes to estimate the impact of flood on the environment. The Normalized Difference Flood Index-3 (NDFI3) is an improvement on NDFI2 that takes into account the effects of cloud shadow in the images when extracting flood index areas. The flood model developed showed good agreement when compared with flooded areas shown in SAR (synthetic-aperture radar) image. The results of the flood extent as a proxy for damage estimation showed that the total flooded area was 502.34 km(2) for the Kelantan Flood event in 2014, with plantation and built-up area accounting for 43 and 34.6% respectively. The least affected land uses/land covers were deforested area and forest, which accounted for 12.2 and 10.2% respectively. The RS and GIS technique developed in this post-disaster damage assessment is effective, relatively inexpensive and simple to implement by local authorities in support of post-flood disaster planning and decision-making.

TI  - Ecological effect evaluation of water diversion in the Yellow River delta wetland
T2  - WATER POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological effect evaluation of water diversion is a difficult and long-term process requiring complex monitoring data and scientific evaluation method. Based on remote sensing data and the ecological investigation data of Yellow River delta, this study built a wetland ecology evaluation index system with the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) framework, which included 13 evaluation indices of three criteria as suitability, diversity, and functionality. Fuzzy-AHP comprehensive evaluation method was used to evaluate the ecological effect of water diversion at Diaokou River wetland restoration zone. The results show that the comprehensive evaluation index (CEI) of wetland ecology is 0.464 before water diversion, which belongs to the 'poor' level, while after five years of water diversion, the CEI increased to 0.737, which belongs to the 'fine' level. It represents that ecological water diversion has made prominent positive effects for the ecosystem of Diaokou River wetland restoration zone. The research result could give decision-makers a clear understanding about the ecological effect of wetland water diversion and provide scientific guidance for strategic decisions.

TI  - Assessment of schistosomiasis transmission risk after flood damage in Wuhan City.
T2  - Zhongguo Xuexichongbing Fangzhi Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To assess the schistosomiasis transmission risk after flood damage in Wuhan City. Methods Schistosomiasis epidemic villages in Wuhan City were selected by using probability proportional to size sampling (PPS). The field investigations of Oncomelania hupensis snails, the activity of people and cattle on marshland, water infectivity of schistosome, reservoir host infection and wild feces contamination were conducted. I-III levels of risk environments were assessed and treated with appropriate measures. Results A total of 90 schistosomiasis epidemic villages and 170 environments were monitored. Totally 9 811 snails were dissected but no Schistosoma japonicum infected snails were found. There were significant decreases in the density of snails and the survival rate of living snails after the flood ([chi]2 = 102.517, t = 4.724, both P < 0.01). Totally 289 pieces of wild feces were captured, and no eggs of S. japonicum were detected. A total of 11 surveillance and forecast sites were detected on water systems, and 221 sentinel mice were placed. After breeding, 219 sentinel mice survived (99.10%), and no schistosome infection was detected. In addition, 1 720 mouse traps were placed in 3 survey sites, and 66 Apodemus agrarius were captured, and no schistosome-infected ones were found. All of the environments were assessed as Grade III. Meanwhile, 5 key schistosomiasis control areas were determined, and no emergency happened after the implementation of comprehensive control interventions. Conclusion The risk of schistosomiasis transmission remains low in Wuhan City after the flood, but the potential epidemic risk cannot be ignored.

TI  - Surface-enhanced Raman scattering nanosensors for <i>in vivo</i> detection of nucleic acid targets in a large animal model
T2  - NANO RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Although nanotechnology has led to important advances in in vitro diagnostics, the development of nanosensors for in vivo detection remains very challenging. Here, we demonstrated the proof-of-principle of in vivo detection of nucleic acid targets using a promising type of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) nanosensor implanted in the skin of a large animal model (pig). The in vivo nanosensor used in this study involves the "inverse molecular sentinel" detection scheme using plasmonics-active nanostars, which have tunable absorption bands in the near infrared region of the "tissue optical window", rendering them efficient as an optical sensing platform for in vivo optical detection. Ex vivo measurements were also performed using human skin grafts to demonstrate the detection of SERS nanosensors through tissue. In this study, a new core-shell nanorattle probe with Raman reporters trapped between the core and shell was utilized as an internal standard system for self-calibration. These results illustrate the usefulness and translational potential of the SERS nanosensor for in vivo biosensing.

TI  - Spatial and temporal variations of suspended solid concentrations from 2000 to 2013 in Poyang Lake, China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Concentrations of suspended solids in lakes can affect the latter's primary productivity and reflect changes in sediment deposition. Determining the temporal and spatial distribution of suspended solid concentrations has important significance in lake water environmental management; this is particularly urgent for Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China. In this study, suspended solid concentration inversion models for Poyang Lake were created using a semi-empirical method with regression analysis between continuously measured suspended solid concentration data and multi-band moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer images for spring, summer, autumn, and winter from 2009 to 2012. The coefficient of determination (R-2) is from 0.6 to 0.9 and the average relative error for the accuracy verification was between 10 and 30%. The seasonal distributions of suspended solid concentrations in Poyang Lake from 2000 to 2013 were then obtained using optimal reversal models. The results showed that the seasonal variation in suspended solid concentrations had a "W" shape in which high spring and autumn and low summer and winter values. The suspended solid concentrations increased annually from 2000 to 2013 and were mainly distributed in the northern and central portions of the lake, with lower values along the shorelines. Further analysis indicated that the large difference in water level between the wet and dry seasons is an important factor in explaining these seasonal variations. Moreover, the suspended solid concentrations were poorly correlated with water temperature and chlorophyll-a concentration but more highly correlated with the deferred chlorophyll-a concentration.

TI  - Phenology Response to Climatic Dynamic across China's Grasslands from 1985 to 2010
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Because the dynamics of phenology in response to climate change may be diverse in different grasslands, quantifying how climate change influences plant growth in different grasslands across northern China should be particularly informative. In this study, we explored the spatiotemporal variation of the phenology (start of the growing season [SOS], peak of the growing season [POS], end of the growing season [EOS], and length of the growing season [LOS]) across China's grasslands using a dataset of the GIMMS3g normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI, 1985-2010), and determined the effects of the annual mean temperature (AMT) and annual mean precipitation (AMP) on the significantly changed phenology. We found that the SOS, POS, and EOS advanced at the rates of 0.54 days/year, 0.64 days/year, and 0.65 days/year, respectively; the LOS was shortened at a rate of 0.62 days/year across China's grasslands. Additionally, the AMT combined with the AMP explained the different rates (ER) for the significantly dynamic SOS in the meadow steppe (R-2 = 0.26, p = 0.007, ER = 12.65%) and typical steppe (R-2 = 0.28, p = 0.005, ER = 32.52%); the EOS in the alpine steppe (R-2 = 0.16, p < 0.05, ER = 6.22%); and the LOS in the alpine (R-2 = 0.20, p < 0.05, ER = 6.06%), meadow (R-2 = 0.18, p < 0.05, ER = 16.69%) and typical (R-2 = 0.18, p < 0.05, ER = 19.58%) steppes. Our findings demonstrated that the plant phenology in different grasslands presented discrepant dynamic patterns, highlighting the fact that climate change has played an important role in the variation of the plant phenology across China's grasslands, and suggested that the variation and relationships between the climatic factors and phenology in different grasslands should be explored further in the future.

TI  - Researches on mangrove forest monitoring methods based on multi-source remote sensing
T2  - Biodiversity Science
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests are ecological communities growing in the intertidal zone of tropical and subtropical coastlines. Due to their high productivity, mangrove forests are essential to persistence of biodiversity along coastlines and have high carbon sequestration ability. In this article we review aspects of monitoring mangrove forests using recent multi-source remote sensing data. First, we reviewed studies on monitoring mangrove dynamics. By integrating object-based and pixel-based classification, high spatial resolution images were used to classify different mangrove species. Landsat images were then used to monitor the dynamics of mangrove forests and analyze factors driving them. Second, we reviewed studies measuring structural parameters of mangroves. Specifically, unmanned aerial vehicle multispectral data and ground-based Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data were used to compute leaf area index of mangrove forests. Finally, we reviewed studies examining physiology and biochemistry parameters. These studies explored adaption of chlorophyll content in mangrove forests under different submergence conditions, whether the invasive species Spartina alterniflora affects the light use efficiency and changed the response of photochemical reflectance index (PRI) to LUE. Our review provides a useful reference for selecting appropriate analytical methods when extracting information of mangroves from remotely sensed data. We emphasize the effectiveness of remote sensing in studying mangrove spatiotemporal patterns, extracting structural parameters, monitoring biochemical parameters, thus aiding efforts to conserve mangrove ecosystems.

TI  - Scenario-Based Simulation of Tianjin City Using a Cellular Automata-Markov Model
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization is occurring throughout China, especially in megacities. Using a land use model to obtain future land use/cover conditions is an essential method to prevent chaotic urban sprawl and imbalanced development. This study utilized historical Landsat images to create land use/cover maps to predict the land use/cover changes of Tianjin city in 2025 and 2035. The cellular automata-Markov (CA-Markov) model was applied in the simulation under three scenarios: the environmental protection scenario (EPS), crop protection scenario (CPS), and spontaneous scenario (SS). The model achieved a kappa value of 86.6% with a figure of merit (FoM) of 12.18% when compared to the empirical land use/cover map in 2015. The results showed that the occupation of built-up areas increased from 29.13% in 2015 to 38.68% (EPS), 36.18% (CPS), and 47.94% (SS) in 2035. In this context, current urbanization would bring unprecedented stress on agricultural resources and forest ecosystems, which could be attenuated by implementing protection policies along with decelerating urban expansion. The findings provide valuable information for urban planners to achieve sustainable development goals.

TI  - Glacier anomaly over the western Kunlun Mountains, Northwestern Tibetan Plateau, since the 1970s
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Western Kunlun Mountain (WKM) glaciers show balanced or even slightly positive mass budgets in the early 21st century, and this is anomalous in a global context of glacier reduction. However, it is unknown whether the stability prevails at longer time scales because mass budgets have been unavailable before 2000. Here topographical maps, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission and Landsat data are used to examine the area and surface elevation changes of glaciers on the WKM since the 1970s. Heterogeneous glacier behaviors are observed not only in the changes of length and area, but also in the spatial distribution of surface elevation changes. However, on average, glacier area and elevation changes are not significant. Glaciers reduce in the area by 0.07 +/- 0.1% a(-1) from the 1970s to 2016. Averaged glacier mass loss is -0.06 +/- 0.13 m w.e. a(-1) from the 1970s to 1999. These findings show that the WKM glacier anomaly extends back at least to the 1970s.

TI  - Temporal and spatial variation relationship and influence factors on surface urban heat island and ozone pollution in the Yangtze River Delta, China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization has led to an obvious urban heat island (UHI) effect in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), China. The ozone (O-3) pollution in the YRD is getting worse. The UHI effect is a key factor that affects the O-3 level. Understanding the influences of the UHI effect on O-3 concentrations is necessary for improving air quality. In this study, the temporal and spatial relationship between UM and O-3 in the YRD during 2015 was investigated. The influence factors of UHI effect and O-3 are both natural and artificial. Multi-source remote sensing data, which include land cover, land surface temperature (CST), Normalization Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and digital elevation model (DEM) data, were used to extract surface landscape elements. The results showed that: (1) the average hourly O-3 concentration was 61.83 mu g/m(3) (30.92 ppb), the highest value was 105.32 mu g/m(3) (52.66 ppb) at 15:00 and the O-3 peak was 82.50 mu g/m(3) (41.25 ppb) in September. The O-3 concentrations and temperature have a similar variation trend both in diurnal and monthly. The O-3 concentrations in coastal stations are higher than those inland. (2) The average daytime UHI intensity was 124 degrees C, and the daytime O-3 concentration was 80.66 mu g/m(3) (40.33 ppb). There is a positive relationship between UHI and O-3 in the YRD. The relationship in the central developed cities is higher than that in the northern and southern cities. (3) The related factors influencing UHI and O-3 include surface landscape, topography and population. The LST and NDVI are most important among these factors. (4) Due to various geographical backgrounds, the UHI intensities and O-3 concentrations show obvious spatial differences. This study provides a reference with which to better understand the relationship among UHI, O-3 and related factors. Furthermore, the issues of atmospheric and energy transmission in this region deserve further study. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Remotely Sensed Analysis of Channel Bar Morphodynamics in the Middle Yangtze River in Response to a Major Monsoon Flood in 2002
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Channel bars are a major depositional feature in channels, and are considered as an important part of the morphodynamics of an alluvial river. The long-term morphodynamics of bars have been intensively investigated. However, relatively little is known about the response of channel bars to a major river flood, which is considered to be the predominant force in shaping bar morphology. This is especially the case for the monsoon-affected Yangtze River, where fluvial geomorphic work is largely carried out during monsoon floods. In this study, multi-temporal satellite images and river stage data were used to examine the morphodynamics of four large channel bars in the middle Yangtze River in response to a major monsoon flood in 2002. Based on bar surface areas estimated with Landsat images at different river stages, a rating curve was developed for each of the four bars, which was used to estimate bar volume through an integral process. Our study shows that two of the bars tended to be stable, while the other two experienced severe erosion during the flood. The results reveal that the flood caused a total bar surface area decrease of 1,655,100 m(2) (or 8.30%), and a total bar volume decline of 5.89 x 10(6) m(3) (or 6.10%) between the river stages of 20.81 m and 25.75 m. The volume decrease is equivalent to a sediment loss of approximately 8.25 x 10(6) metric tons, based on an average bulk density of 1.4 metric tons per cubic meter. The results imply that channel bars in the middle Yangtze River can also be large sediment sources rather than depositional areas during the flood. The decrease of sediment load in the middle of Yangtze River was found to be responsible for the dramatic morphodynamics of channel bars, which could last for a long period of time, depending on the operation of the Three Gorges Dam, which opened in 2003. Hence, we suggest making management efforts to protect the bars from further erosion.

TI  - Estimation of the width of the nearshore zone in Lake Michigan using eleven years of MODIS satellite imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The nearshore zone, that region of water directly influenced by its proximity to the coast, has received increasing attention in recent years. The extent of the nearshore zone has been defined by some constant descriptive feature: e.g., a specific depth or a particular distance offshore. This type of definition does not allow for the dynamic nature of the relationship between the land and water and how it may be influenced by local, seasonal, or transient effects. Here satellite observations examined evaluate how the width of the nearshore zone in Lake Michigan varies with position along the coastline and with time. Satellite-derived estimates of chlorophyll concentration along seventy-one shore-normal transects spaced approximately 10 km apart around the lake were used to determine the width of the nearshore zone, defined as the point at which the estimated chlorophyll concentration close to the shore approaches the more-uniform offshore concentration. Of a total of 23,807 transects extracted from MODIS observations made between 2003 and 2013, we successfully fit a bi-linear model relating chlorophyll concentration to distance offshore to 15,996. We found that the width of the nearshore zone is variable, both seasonally and spatially. Although the overall median width of 45 km (mean width 53 km) closely corresponds to the 5 km value used in a number of Great Lakes studies including Lake Michigan, 10% of the estimates are >8.9 km, likely representing times of enhanced mixing and transport of nearshore waters into the offshore.

AB  - In this present research, we assessed the performance of band algorithms in estimating chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration based on bands of two new sensors: Operational Land Imager onboancl Landsat-8 satellite (OLI/Landsat-8), and MultiSpectral Instrument onboard Sentinel-2A (MSI/Sentinel-2A). Band combinations designed for Thematic Mapper onboard Landsat-5 satellite (TM/Landsat-5) and MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer onboard Envisat platform (MERIS/Envisat) were adapted for OLI/Landsat-8 and MSUSentinel-2A bands. Algorithms were calibrated using in situ measurements collected in three field campaigns carried out in different seasons. The study area was the Barra Bonita hydroelectric reservoir (BBHR), a highly productive aquatic system. With exception of the three-band algorithm, the algorithms were spectrally few affected by sensors changes. On the other hands, algorithm perfonnance has been hampered by the bio-optical difference in the reservoir sections, drought in 2014 and pigment packaging.

TI  - Lymph Node Staging in Clinically Negative Groin Nodes
T2  - EUROPEAN UROLOGY SUPPLEMENTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction: Nodal involvement is the most important prognostic factor in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the penis (SCCp). However, optimal staging of regional lymph node remains controversial.Methods: The literature was reviewed to examine current management of regional lymph nodes in SCCp patients with clinically nonpalpable inguinal lymph nodes (cN0).Results: Radiological staging and selective risk-profile nomograms are unreliable in the detection of occult micrometastases in cN0 patients. Prophylactic inguinal lymph node dissection (ILND) is associated with significant morbidity and a high rate of postoperative complications. Dynamic sentinel lymph node biopsy (DSNB) is a reliable minimally invasive surgical staging technique for cN0 patients. Ipsilateral ILND is indicated only in inguinal basins with positive DSNB.Conclusions: DSNB has excellent performance characteristics in staging cN0 patients, with high sensitivity and a low morbidity rate.

TI  - Globally scalable alpine snow metrics
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Horizontal and altitudinal redistribution of snow by wind transport and avalanches can be important controls on small- and large-scale snow accumulation patterns that control meltwater supply in alpine environments. Redistribution processes control the spatial variability of snow accumulation, which not only controls meltwater supply, but also regulates snowmelt timing, duration, and rates, as well as snow-covered area depletion and the variable contributing area for meltwater runoff generation. However, most hydrological models and land surface schemes do not consider snow redistribution processes, and those that do are difficult to verify without spatially distributed snow depth measurements. These are rarely available in both high resolution and covering large scales. As an increased number of hydrological models include snow redistribution processes there is a need for additional snowcover metrics to verify snow redistribution schemes over large areas using readily available data.This study develops novel high-resolution (20 m), snowcover indices from remotely sensed imagery (Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2) to evaluate snow redistribution models over alpine areas without in-situ or airborne snow observations. A snowcover absence (SA) index, calculated from snow-free areas during the winter, identifies areas of wind erosion or avalanche source areas. A snowcover persistence (SP) index, calculated from snow-covered areas during the summer, identifies snow deposition in drifts and avalanche deposits.The snowcover indices captured the relative differences in surface observations of snow presence and absence between exposed and sheltered sites on an intensely instrumented ridge in the Canadian Rockies Hydrological Observatory. Within the Tuolumne River Basin in central California (1100 km(2)), the SP index captured roughly half of the spatial variability (R-2 = 0.49 to 0.56) in peak SWE as estimated from airborne LiDAR-derived snow depths. At the individual mountain ridge scale (similar to 800 m), variability in both ablation and snow redistribution controlled the SP patterns over 7979 ridges. Differences in shortwave irradiance explained 76% of the SP variance across ridges, but could not explain smaller-scale (similar to 100 m) SP peaks that are associated with snowdrifts and avalanche deposits. The snowcover indices can be used to evaluate snow redistribution models of the finer scale impacts of snow redistribution by wind and gravity as long as the larger scale influences of spatially variable solar irradiance effects are also simulated.

TI  - Predicting habitat quality of protected dry grasslands using Landsat NDVI phenology
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Dry grasslands are species rich and ecologically valuable habitats that have experienced a massive decline in Switzerland during the last century due to agricultural intensification and land abandonment. Appropriate management is a key factor in maintaining habitat quality of the remaining most valuable sites and should thus be an essential part of monitoring studies. However, information on management is often missing and fine-scale patterns are difficult to assess, especially over large areas and for past decades.The aim of this study was to predict habitat quality of protected dry grasslands in Switzerland. Using a nationwide in-situ vegetation data set with plot-based species lists, we derived six habitat quality indicators (management tolerance, light availability, nutrient content, moisture content and species richness). We then tested how well satellite-based phenology metrics, in combination with environmental and climate data, can predict these dry grassland habitat quality indicators. We expected that the seasonal pattern of vegetation activity, based on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), would represent local productivity and management patterns, two crucial indicators of dry grassland habitat quality. Linear regression analysis was conducted to assess the relative importance and ecological relationship of different NDVI metrics and other environmental and climate predictors for habitat quality. Variance partitioning was applied to assess model contributions of the three variable groups which represent different data sources for productivity and management.Accuracies for the habitat quality prediction models ranged between 34% and 57% and significant correlations with multiple NDVI metrics were found. Including NDVI phonology improved all models by 7-12%. Single contributions of NDVI phenology were highest for management tolerance and nutrient content. However, we found high variation of contributions between management types. NDVI metrics were highly informative for the habitat qualities of abandoned sites, but grazing and mowing reduced or even cancelled their predictive power. Moreover, our results demonstrate the limitation of single-date NDVI values in predicting habitat quality of dry grasslands; in particular pastures and meadows. For monitoring applications of dry grasslands, we propose using a combination of NDVI metrics, as our results showed that they greatly improve prediction results of essential habitat qualities. The Landsat legacy dataset facilitates the assessment of habitat changes during past decades and can be complemented in the future with higher resolution data, such as Sentinel-2, to increase the temporal and spatial resolution so analyses are more appropriate for the typically limited size of dry grassland habitat sites in Switzerland.

TI  - Expanding Implementation of ACOSOG Z0011 in Surgeon Practice
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of the ACOSOG Z0011 trial results 5 years after its publication. More than 300 patients treated over 1 year were examined. Only 8% of patients who were sentinel node-positive who met Z0011 criteria underwent axillary lymph node dissection, indicating incorporation of the trial into our institution's practice.Background: After publication of American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z0011, surgeons at our institution limited axillary surgery to sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) in 76% of patients meeting trial eligibility criteria. Our study objective was to assess incorporation of the trial data into practice 5 years later. Patients and Methods: Patients with clinical T1-2, N0 invasive breast cancer undergoing breast conserving surgery were included. Comparisons were made between patients who underwent axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) and those that had no further surgery. Results: A total of 396 patients were included. Twelve percent (48/396) had positive SLNs; ALND was performed in 8% (4/48). Patients who underwent ALND were more likely to have 2 positive SLNs (50%, 2/4 vs. 2%, 1/44; P = .02) and microscopic extranodal extension (75%, 3/4 vs. 18%, 8/44; P = .03) than those that did not undergo ALND. Patients who underwent ALND also had a higher nomogram-predicted probability of having additional positive non-SLNs (53%) than those who had SLND alone (22%) (P = .0002). No patients had intraoperative assessment of SLNs performed. Conclusions: The practice of omitting ALND in ACOSOG Z0011-eligible patients has expanded over 5 years. Clinicopathologic features continue to impact this decision. Intraoperative SLN assessment is no longer performed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - The Concept of the Scientist Practitioner and Its Extension to Behavior Analysis
T2  - EDUCATION AND TREATMENT OF CHILDREN
M3  - Article
AB  - The Scientist Practitioner model is a universal approach towards the education and preparation of doctoral students in psychology in general and behavior analysis in particular. Components of such an approach include a grounding in an empirical and scientific worldview, an investigatory approach towards the study of human behavior, training in evidenced-based treatment approaches, mastering research design, and conducting research in salient areas to inform intervention practice. Recently, there have been vocal criticisms of this approach, suggesting that graduates from this model do not typically stay engaged in research and may not require these skills for their professional careers. Concerns have also been raised that drift from science may produce clinicians who engage in intervention approaches that are not informed by science.This paper underscores the need for the continuance of and adherence to the scientist practitioner model in behavior analysis, in order to protect and advance the science.

TI  - Routine Axillary Ultrasound for Patients with T1-T2 Breast Cancer Does Not Increase the Rate of Axillary Lymph Node Dissection Based on Predictive Modeling
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Since publication of the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011 trial results, demonstrating that many patients with nonpalpable axillary lymph nodes and one or two positive sentinel nodes do not require axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), preoperative axillary ultrasound (AUS) has become controversial. Clinicians are concerned that AUS may lead to unnecessary ALND. The authors developed an algorithm (Algorithm 1) in which the number of AUS-suspicious nodes and tumor biology direct management. For estrogen receptor-positive (ER+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) breast cancer with a single AUS-suspicious node and a positive lymph node needle biopsy (LNNB), sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is performed with a specimen X-ray documenting retrieval of the clipped node. Other patients with positive LNNB receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The authors hypothesized that routine AUS and this algorithm could decrease ALND compared with a strategy of no preoperative AUS.Decision-tree analysis and Monte Carlo simulation were used to assess the expected number of ALNDs under two strategies (routine AUS vs no AUS). Probabilities were drawn from a literature review and an institutional database. The authors assumed nodal pathologic complete response rates as reported in the literature. Four additional algorithms were created to assess whether any other treatment model could decrease the rate of ALND.Using the routine AUS and the authors' algorithm, the predicted ALND rate was 9%, versus 10% for a strategy of no AUS, with overlapping uncertainty intervals. The remaining treatment algorithms showed similar results.Use of AUS may help to tailor patient care without leading to overutilization of ALND, as long as neoadjuvant chemotherapy is administered when appropriate.

TI  - Megacity-scale analysis of urban vegetation temperatures
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In cities, vegetation temperature is important for quantifying water use, microclimates, and water and energy fluxes, as demonstrated by urban climate models and in situ studies. Remote sensing is capable of observing land surface temperatures (LST) across a city; however, its ability to quantify vegetation canopy temperatures is limited because of LST variability resulting from urban surface heterogeneity, differences in vegetation fraction and non-vegetated material, and the coarse resolution of available thermal imagery. This study is a large-scale analysis of urban surface composition and temperature variability across the Los Angeles, USA, metropolitan area (4466 km(2)). Sub-pixel fractions of two plant functional types (tree and turfgrass) and four urban materials (impervious surface, commercial roof, non-photosynthetic vegetation, and soil) were quantified using hyperspectral imagery (Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer). Fractional cover gradients of plant types and non-vegetated materials were developed using 1.7 million pixels, from which we modeled LST changes using simultaneously collected thermal imagery (MODIS-ASTER Airborne Simulator). Vegetation LST variability was mapped by subtracting modeled LST from observed LST and investigated relative to building density and vegetation management. Overall, LST varied significantly among plant functional types and urban material types. Across heterogeneous mixtures, LST and vegetation fraction exhibited a negative, linear relationship, with the slopes of LST change showing significant differences between trees and turfgrass. The map of vegetation LST variability had a standard deviation of 3.5 degrees C, indicating significant variability across Los Angeles independent of vegetation type or fractional cover. Building density was observed to affect tree and turfgrass LST differently, while a negative relationship was observed between vegetation LST and irrigation (R-2 = 0.55). Our results show that an LST signal of vegetation function, distinct from that of vegetation fractional cover, can be observed and modeled at city-scales in fractional mixture analysis, indicating potential for improved understanding of urban microclimates.

TI  - A Long-Term Fine-Resolution Record of AVHRR Surface Temperatures for the Laurentian Great Lakes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Inland waters are warming at highly variable rates that often differ from regional air temperature trends. This variable warming is partially attributable to an individual lake's geographical and morphological characteristics. In very large lakes, significant intralake variability in long-term warming trends has also been observed. In light of this intralake and interlake heterogeneity of lake surface water temperature (LSWT) and LSWT trends, we revisit the 1.1 km Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) record for the Laurentian Great Lakes. In this work, we have assembled a long-term (1986-2016) and high-spatial-resolution (0.018 degrees) daily LSWT dataset using AVHRR record. Subtracting an empirically-determined mean diurnal cycle mitigates the effects of varying observation times. Adjustments in the georegistration of the images are made to reduce the impact of AVHRR navigational errors on the earlier platforms. Both the original daily composites, and a gap-filled product using locally weighted interpolation methods will be made available to support fine-scale physical and environmental research in the region.

TI  - Ecocentrism and criminal justice
T2  - THEORETICAL CRIMINOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecocentrism refers to valuing nature for its own sake. This ecophilosophical orientation requires that all social practices incorporate ecological sensitivities and heightened awareness of the intrinsic value of non-human entities. This article explores what ecocentrism means for criminal justice and how the core principles of an ecocentric worldview translate into concrete application. Trends within criminal justice that are broadly supportive or reflective of ecocentrism are summarized. The article also considers the limitations of ecocentrism, particularly in the context of criminal law and in regards to the prosecution of human subjects for environmental offences. A basic premise of the article is that for those interested in eco-justice and green criminology, it is vitally important to describe what an eco-just future might look like, and this includes recognition of and support for already existing ecocentric initiatives evident in some policies and practices across criminal justice institutions.

TI  - Contribution of sea ice microbial production to Antarctic benthic communities is driven by sea ice dynamics and composition of functional guilds
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Organic matter produced by the sea ice microbial community (SIMCo) is an important link between sea ice dynamics and secondary production in near-shore food webs of Antarctica. Sea ice conditions in McMurdo Sound were quantified from time series of MODIS satellite images for Sept. 1 through Feb. 28 of 2007-2015. A predictable sea ice persistence gradient along the length of the Sound and evidence for a distinct change in sea ice dynamics in 2011 were observed. We used stable isotope analysis (delta C-13 and delta N-15) of SIMCo, suspended particulate organic matter (SPOM) and shallow water (10-20m) macroinvertebrates to reveal patterns in trophic structure of, and incorporation of organic matter from SIMCo into, benthic communities at eight sites distributed along the sea ice persistence gradient. Mass-balance analysis revealed distinct trophic architecture among communities and large fluxes of SIMCo into the near-shore food web, with the estimates ranging from 2 to 84% of organic matter derived from SIMCo for individual species. Analysis of patterns in density, and biomass of macroinvertebrate communities among sites allowed us to model net incorporation of organic matter from SIMCo, in terms of biomass per unit area (g/m(2)), into benthic communities. Here, organic matter derived from SIMCo supported 39 to 71 per cent of total biomass. Furthermore, for six species, we observed declines in contribution of SIMCo between years with persistent sea ice (2008-2009) and years with extensive sea ice breakout (2012-2015). Our data demonstrate the vital role of SIMCo in ecosystem function in Antarctica and strong linkages between sea ice dynamics and near-shore secondary productivity. These results have important implications for our understanding of how benthic communities will respond to changes in sea ice dynamics associated with climate change and highlight the important role of shallow water macroinvertebrate communities as sentinels of change for the Antarctic marine ecosystem.

TI  - Systematic review of the impact of breast-conserving surgery on cancer outcomes of multiple ipsilateral breast cancers
T2  - BJS OPEN
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: The clinical effectiveness of treating ipsilateral multifocal (MF) and multicentric (MC) breast cancers using breast-conserving surgery (BCS) compared with the standard of mastectomy is uncertain. Inconsistencies relate to definitions, incidence, staging and intertumoral heterogeneity. The primary aim of this systematic review was to compare clinical outcomes after BCS versus mastectomy for MF and MC cancers, collectively defined as multiple ipsilateral breast cancers (MIBC).Methods; Comprehensive electronic searches were undertaken to identify complete papers published in English between May 1988 and July 2015, primarily comparing clinical outcomes of BCS and mastectomy for MIBC. All study designs were included, and studies were appraised critically using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The characteristics and results of identified studies were summarized.Results: Twenty-four retrospective studies were included in the review: 17 comparative studies and seven case series. They included 3537 women with MIBC undergoing BCS; breast cancers were defined as MF in 2677 women, MC in 292, and reported as MIBC in 568. Six studies evaluated MIBC treated by BCS or mastectomy, with locoregional recurrence (LRR) rates of 2-23 per cent after BCS at median follow-up of 59.5 (i.q.r.56-81) months. BCS and mastectomy showed apparently equivalent rates of TAR (risk ratio 0.94, 95 per cent c.i.0.65 to 1.36). Thirteen studies compared BCS in women with MIBC versus those with unifocal cancers, reporting LRR rates of 2-40 percent after BCS at a median follow-up of 64 (i.q.r. 57-73) months. One high-quality study reported 10-year actuarial LRR rates of 5.5 per cent for BCS in 300 women versus 6.5 per cent for mastectomy among 887 women.Conclusion: The available studies were mainly of moderate quality, historical and underpowered, with limited follow-up and biased case selection favouring BCS rather than mastectomy for low-risk patients. The evidence was inconclusive, weakening support for the St Gallen consensus and supporting a future randomized trial.

TI  - The French Exception: A Survey-by-Survey Account
T2  - POLITICS & POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The European Social Survey and the values theories of Shalom Schwartz provide a robust conceptual framework to compare values espoused in 21 European countries. The case of France sheds light on contemporary challenges to European Union (EU) policy, considering a mounting populist base that struggles for preserving national identity problematized by a changing employment market, globalization, and immigration headlines. In light of the European Social Survey's human values data for 21 European nations and other mainstream cross-cultural surveys, France is a striking example of a mature democracy confronted with core identity challenges, asserting one worldview in its macro-economic orientation but another in the street and public forum. France provides an interesting barometer within Europe, where antagonisms between the polity and the people exacerbate EU integration, challenging the priorities of political leadership in a struggle to modify historical arrangements that no longer prove feasible.

AB  - This review describes emerging techniques within the last 5years that employ ultrasound for detecting and staging malignancy, tracking metastasis, and guiding treatment. Ultrasound elastography quantifies soft tissue elastic properties that change as a tumor grows and proliferates. Hybrid imaging modalities that combine ultrasound with light or microwave energy provide novel contrast for mapping blood oxygen saturation, transport of particles through lymphatic vessels and nodes, and real-time feedback for guiding needle biopsies. Combining these methods with smart nanoparticles and contrast agents further promotes new paradigms for cancer imaging and therapy.

TI  - Planting of <i>Acacia decurrens</i> and Dynamics of Land Cover Change in Fagita Lekoma District in the Northwestern Highlands of Ethiopia
T2  - MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the magnitude and drivers of land cover change is key to designing effective natural resource management interventions and restoring degraded landscapes. We analyzed land cover change from 1995 to 2015 in Fagita Lekoma District in northwestern Ethiopia using Landsat images and found that forest cover increased by 1.2% per year, while areas covered by cropland decreased by 1% per year. The increase in forest cover is mainly attributable to increased planting of Acacia decurrens. The expansion of A. decurrens plantations could be attributed to its potential to provide short-term economic benefits. This indicates that economic activities that generate short-term benefits may strongly influence the selection of land uses in the study area. Planting of A. decurrens generates job opportunities for the landless and enables farmers to diversify their livelihoods. it rarely restricts other agricultural practices, as farmers are able to grow cereals between the trees in the first 2 years following the establishment of an A. decurrens plantation. This enhances the efficient utilization of farmlands and diversifies agricultural products. Providing training to farmers on silvicultural practices and presenting alternative tree species are crucial to enhance their benefits and sustain charcoal production in such mountainous regions. Studies are required to understand how the observed land cover change affects land productivity, landscape, and biodiversity.

TI  - Locating flood embankments using SAR time series: A proof of concept
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - River embankments limit flood risk, alter the flood peak, and change sediment deposition rates, but in many areas of the world embankment locations are not available in geodatabases. This lack of information reduces the accuracy of predicted flood extent within inundation models. The objective is therefore to determine the positional accuracy of embankments using time series of Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data with local gauge data. A new method is proposed to: (1) establish the relationship between stage and extent for river cross sections; with stage obtained from gauges and flood extent from SAR-derived flood images, and (2) infer embankment location from plateaus in these plots. The predicted embankment location was compared with airborne LiDAR data for two case studies: the One Hundred Foot Wash (UK) and the Yolo Bypass (Sacramento, USA). The median absolute error for cross sections located in low lying floodplains with low vegetation was 59 m and 110 m, respectively. This increased to 78 m and 197 m when vegetated and cross sections with high ground were included. Application of the method could provide key flood defence information to update geodatabases for locations where data are missing or not widely/freely available, and to improve inundation models up to global scales.

TI  - Thermal environment effects and interactions of reservoirs and forests as urban blue-green infrastructures
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Blue-green infrastructures, including reservoirs, lakes, forests and green spaces, play important roles in the microclimate environment. This study investigated the effects of blue-green infrastructures on the surface temperature adjacent to 12 reservoirs in the Pearl River Delta area, China. The temperature of each reservoir and its surrounding environment was retrieved by Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) remote sensing imagery. The relationship between the temperature fields around the reservoir and the influencing factors was analyzed with statistical analysis. The results showed that distance (D), underlying surface type, and reservoir capacity (V) had significant effects on the temperature fields around the reservoirs. The temperatures across distances of 0-100 m and 0-200 m away from the reservoir boundary had a linear relationship with distance. The effect of the reservoir on temperature gradually declined when the distance exceeded 200 m. In the 0-300 m range, a quadratic equation with an intercept best fitted the relationship between temperature and distance. Four types of underlying surfaces, including built-up land, bare land, sparse forest land and forest land, were quantified by the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Subsequently, a quadratic model expressing the correlation between temperature and the NDVI was obtained. Moreover, the surface temperature at the reservoir edge was negatively correlated to V. Finally, a multiple nonlinear regression equation was found to effectively describe the influence of D, NDVI and V on temperature fields around reservoirs. The influence of reservoir and vegetation (i.e., NDVI) on the field and their contributions were calculated by mathematical methods. The effects of the reservoir and vegetation on the peripheral temperature interacted with each other; the influence of the reservoir and the vegetation on temperature declined and increased, respectively, as distance increased. By addressing the influence of reservoirs and forests on temperature fields and cooling contribution rates, this study provides more insight into the role of blue-green infrastructure in the urban thermal environment.

TI  - Distinct Influences of Urban Villages on Urban Heat Islands: A Case Study in the Pearl River Delta, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Widely scattered urban villages (UVs) and increasingly serious urban heat islands (UHIs) are common urban problems in highly urbanized regions, especially in the developing countries. However, the influences of UVs on UHIs remain little understood. In this study, different methodologies are performed to retrieve land surface temperature (LST) from thermal bands and the nearest object-oriented method with spectral, texture, shape metrics using ZY-3 high-resolution satellite imagery, and road network data are used to extract UVs and other land-use types in the Guangzhou-Foshan (GF) core areas of Pearl River Delta (PRD). Moreover, the relationship between LST and land-use types is then analyzed on the multiple scales. The results show that five land-use types (vegetation, normal construction land (NCL), UVs, water, and unused land) extracted by the object-oriented method were qualified for subsequent analysis because of satisfactory overall accuracy (0.887) and the Kappa coefficient (0.863). In the GF core areas presenting the most outstanding UHI effect across the PRD region, about 60.5% of the total area is covered by the impervious surfaces, including NCL (50.4%) and UVs (10.1%). The average LST of UVs was 1.89-2.97 degrees C lower than that of NCL. According to the average contribution index of thermal effect and the Pearson's correlation coefficients, UVs present a relatively lower contribution to UHI and a weaker warming effect than NCL, but possess a higher contribution to UHI and a stronger warming effect than other land-use types, resulting in some slightly lower LST-valleys in the UVs adjacent to the NCL and distinct LST-peaks of UVs close to vegetation and water on the surface temperature profile lines. This work increases our understanding of the relationship between increasingly serious UHIs and widely distributed UVs, and would be valuable for local authorities to monitor and improve urban environment in metropolitan regions.

TI  - Crop Drought Identification Index for winter wheat based on evapotranspiration in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain, China
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Frequent occurrences of drought events can lead to winter wheat drought disasters. To prevent drought damage and reduce potential losses, it is important to establish an index to provide support for winter wheat drought monitoring, prevention, and mitigation, and further to understand the precise spatiotemporal characteristics of winter wheat droughts. In this study, meteorological factors, remote sensing products, disaster records, and phenophases of winter wheat in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain were integrated to establish a Crop Drought Identification Index for winter wheat drought disasters. The CDII was expressed as the ratio of actual evapotranspiration (ETa) and crop evapotranspiration under standard conditions (ELc), in which ETa was simulated through the Two Source Energy Balance (TSEB) model and ETc was calculated based on the Penman-Monteith method using daily meteorological data and MODIS remotely sensed products. The CDII for winter wheat at different developmental stages was formed by establishing the drought sample sequences and determining the thresholds based on a Lilliefors goodness-of-fit test and the upper threshold of a 95% confidence interval. Validation showed that the identification results by CDII corresponded with 86.2% drought records. The spatial distributions of drought characteristics for winter wheat in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain were mapped. The thresholds of the CDII at the before wintering stage, returning green-jointing stage, and heading stage were higher than that at the other two developmental stages. Drought frequency was higher across the whole Huang Huai-Hai Plain at the before wintering stage and returning green-jointing stage of winter wheat. The regions with higher drought frequency were concentrated in the northern part of the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain at the heading stage and in the mid-western Shandong Province at the milky ripening physiological maturity stage. This study took the drought distribution in the 2006-2007 growing season and heading stages from 2000 to 2013 as examples, the results indicated that the CDII could identify the actual drought of winter wheat reasonably. The findings indicate the CDII is useful for monitoring and assessing winter wheat drought disasters at a regional scale. It can also provide a new method for crop drought analysis.

TI  - Removing Stripe Noise From Infrared Cloud Images via Deep Convolutional Networks
T2  - IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - We propose a new deep network architecture for removing a stripe noise from a single meteorological satellite infrared cloud image In the proposed framework, a residual learning is utilized to directly reduce the mapping range from input to output, which speeds up the training process as well as boosts the destriping performance. Inspired by the wide inference networks, we use wider CNNs with more convolutions in the first part of the proposed network, which is helpful for learning the similar pixel-distribution features from noisy images. To further improve the performance, we propose a local-global combination structure model, which combines the representations of different layers for recovering the rich details of infrared cloud images. Moreover, we extend our method to remove rain streaks from single images, which provides a new idea for rain-removal task. In addition, we provide a new meteorological satellite infrared cloud image dataset for training and validating the proposed network. Final extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve both comparable restoration quality and computational efficiency with several state-of-the-art approaches.

TI  - Optical models for remote sensing of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption in Poyang Lake
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM), the key component in aquatic environment, plays an important role in biogeochemical processing. In this study, in situ reflectance and water samples were used to develop models for estimating CDOM absorption in a complex freshwater environment in Poyang Lake, China. The in situ water reflectance spectra, CDOM absorption spectra and other water-color parameters from 92 samples collected in four representative study areas between 2015 and 2016 were analysed. Band ratio models were established to estimate CDOM absorption coefficient at 355 nm [a(g)(355)] based on the correlation analysis between reflectance and a(g)(355). The results indicated that the models performed well for estimating a(g)(355) when the 92 samples were divided into two datasets with the threshold of concentration of total suspended matter (TSM) as 10 mg/L. The band ratios of R(689)/R(497) and R(767)/R(826) were selected to establish models for retrieval of a(g)(355) in clean water (TSM < 10 mg/L) and turbid water (TSM >= 10 mg/L), respectively. The determination coefficients (r(2)) of calibration models for clean and turbid water were 0.70 and 0.73, respectively. The percentage root-mean-square errors (%RSME) of validation models for clean and turbid water were 13.2% and 11.6%, respectively. The simulated Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 bands based on reflectance spectra were used to examine potential capability for retrieving CDOM using these sensors. The results indicated that Sentinel-2 performed better than Landsat-8 for estimating a(g)(355). The Sentinel-2 band ratio of B4/B2 or B5/B2 and B7/B8 or B7/B8A are effective for retrieval of CDOM in clean and turbid water of Poyang Lake, respectively.

TI  - Prelaunch Calibration and Radiometric Performance of the Advanced MERSI II on FengYun-3D
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The advanced MEdium Resolution Spectral Imager (MERSI II) is a major instrument onboard the Chinese FengYun 3D satellite, which was launched in November 2017. Extensive measurements were performed during MERSI II prelaunch testing to ensure effective characterization for on-orbit calibration. This paper gives a brief overview of the prelaunch performance testing conducted for MERSI II, as well as its improvements in terms of instrument design compared to MERSI I. The prelaunch calibration methodology and radiometric performance are detailed, including dynamic range, signal-to-noise ratio, noise equivalent differential temperature, linearity, and response uniformity. The assessment results indicate that mast bands perform effectively with mirror specification noncompliances in a few reflective solar bands (RSBs). In addition, investigation of the stability and uniformity of the spherical integrating source indicates that they have a critical impact on the performance assessment and prelaunch calibration of RSBs. The temperature-dependence features of thermal emissive bands' performances are also discussed in terms of their sensitivity to the operating temperature of the focal plane assembly and instrument circumstance. This paper also shows that the self-stability of the calibration source and the representation of the assessment methods are important as they affect the results of instrument performance evaluation.

TI  - Galileo satellite data contribution to GNSS solutions for short and long baselines
T2  - MEASUREMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - GALILEO (Europe's Global Navigation Satellite System) is going full speed ahead to achieve full constellation by 2020. Since GALILEO is currently an emerging system, the contribution of these satellites to GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) solutions needs to be investigated. For this purpose, GNSS data collected at three IGS (International GNSS Service) MGEX (Multi GNSS Experiment) stations are analyzed. For the analyses, GPS (Global Positioning System) only, GLONASS (Russia's Global Navigation Satellite System) only, GALILEO-only and combined solutions are tested and also effect of baseline length is examined. The results indicate that compared to GPS, GLONASS and ALL (GPS+GLONASS+GALILEO) solutions, GALILEO results vary greatly. When GALILEO observations are combined with other observations, the precision goes down. That is to say, for short baseline solution, GALILEO results fluctuate around 1 cm in the horizontal plane and in the vertical plane variations are mostly within 3-5 cm. For long baseline solution, GALILEO results are going up and down in the horizontal between 2 and 3 cm and in the vertical roughly 10 cm. In terms of accuracy, for short baseline solution, GALILEO-only solution is close to GPS-only solution; yet, we cannot say the same thing for long baseline solution.

TI  - On the Generation of Gapless and Seamless Daily Surface Reflectance Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The land surface reflectance data are indispensable to generate many other land products. Global land surface reflectance data have been routinely produced from remote sensing sensors aboard different satellite platforms. However, the original data, especially the daily data, suffer from a large number of spatial gaps, which result from atmospheric contamination and instrument deficiencies. This seriously limits their further applications. Many composite products with less spatial gaps have been generated to solve the above problem, but they easily sacrifice their temporal resolutions of original data. Even worse, they cannot he directly implemented in realistic applications because of the noise and composite seams. This paper proposes a temporal-spatial reconstruction method (TSRM) to generate daily gapless and seamless land surface reflectance data. The TSRM integrates both temporal and spatial information for recovering different land cover types using three processing steps. First, spatial gaps are coarsely filled with multiyear weighted average (Step1). After that, all the gaps that are not filled in the first step are interpolated by using harmonic analysis of time series with true value constraint (Step2). Finally, the reconstructed results in the last step are seamlessly processed using the Poisson image editing method, and the seamless daily reflectance data set is generated (Step3). The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer reflectance data set (MOD09GA and MYD09GA) on two testing areas is selected to verify the performance of the proposed TSRM. Experimental results show that the TSRM has good performance with regard to maintaining the temporal and spatial integrity of the daily land surface reflectance data. Results on different testing sites also demonstrate that the TSRM preserves spectral integrity with clear seasonal trends for each spectral band.

T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The correlation of spatial variation in land surface temperature with building height and density in Zhongshan District, Dalian, China, is investigated over the period 2003-2013. We utilize remote sensing data and multisource land-use data, which we evaluate using a combination of a single-window algorithm and correlation analysis. The results show that: 1) during 2003-2013, the number of high surface temperature regions increased by 4339 grid cells (out of a total of 53 601), with most of the high-temperature grid cells distributed along Jiefang Road and Zhongnan Road in the northern part of Zhongshan District. Ninety-eight percent of grid cells had temperature ranges of 293-309 K in July 2003, 296-310 K in August 2003, 295-308 K in July 2008, 296-311 K in August 2008, 305-314 K in July 2013, and 303-318 K in August 2013; 2) during 2003-2008, the number of low-rise buildings increased by 140%, and the number of multistory buildings increased by 100%. During 2008-2013, the number of buildings in all height categories remained relatively unchanged, with the exception of an 11% decrease in the number of low-rise buildings; 3) surface temperature showed weak correlation with building height (0.314, 0.346, and 0.361 in 2003, 2008, and 2013, respectively) but moderate correlationwith building density (0.511, 0.533, and 0.563, respectively).

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Super-Resolution Land Cover Mapping Based on Fuzzy C-Means Clustering
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Super-resolution land cover mapping (SRM) is a method that aims to generate land cover maps with fine spatial resolutions from the original coarse spatial resolution remotely sensed image. The accuracy of the resultant land cover map produced by existing SRM methods is often limited by the errors of fraction images and the uncertainty of spatial pattern models. To address these limitations in this study, we proposed a fuzzy c-means clustering (FCM)-based spatio-temporal SRM (FCM_STSRM) model that combines the spectral, spatial, and temporal information into a single objective function. The spectral term is constructed with the FCM criterion, the spatial term is constructed with the maximal spatial dependence principle, and the temporal term is characterized by the land cover transition probabilities in the bitemporal land cover maps. The performance of the proposed FCM_STSRM method is assessed using data simulated from the National Land Cover Database dataset and real Landsat images. Results of the two experiments show that the proposed FCM_STSRM method can decrease the influence of fraction errors by directly using the original images as the input and the spatial pattern uncertainty by inheriting land cover information from the existing fine resolution land cover map. Compared with the hard classification and FCM_SRM method applied to mono-temporal images, the proposed FCM_STSRM method produced fine resolution land cover maps with high accuracy, thus showing the efficiency and potential of the novel approach for producing fine spatial resolution maps from coarse resolution remotely sensed images.

In this study, the driving chemical species and the formation mechanisms of PM2.5 pollution were investigated to better understand the haze event. Hourly concentrations of PM2.5 organic and elemental carbon, water-soluble ions, and elemental constituents were measured at the air quality intensive monitoring station in Gwangju. The haze event occurred was attributed to a significant contribution (72.3%) of secondary inorganic species concentration to the PM2.5, along with the contribution of organic aerosols that were strongly attributed to traffic emissions over the study site. MODIS images, weather charts, and air mass backward trajectories supported the significant impact of long-range transportation (LTP) of aerosol particles from northeastern China on haze formation over Gwangju in October 2015. The driving factor for the haze formation was stagnant atmospheric flows around the Korean peninsula, and high relative humidity (RH) promoted the haze formation at the site. Under the high RH conditions, SO42- and NO3- were mainly produced through the heterogenous aqueous-phase reactions of SO2 and NO2, respectively. Moreover, hourly O-3 concentration during the study period was highly elevated, with hourly peaks ranging from 79 to 95 ppb, suggesting that photochemical reaction was a possible formation process of secondary aerosols. Over the PM2.5 pollution, behavior and formation of secondary ionic species varied with the difference in the impact of LTP. Prior to October 19 when the influence of LTP was low, increasing rate in NO3- was greater than that in NO2, but both SO2 and SO42- had similar increasing rates. While, after October 20 when the impact of haze by LTP was significant, SO42- and NO3- concentrations increased significantly more than their gaseous precursors, but with greater increasing rate of NO3-. These results suggest the enhanced secondary transformation of SO2 and NO2 during the haze event. Overall, the result from the study suggests that control of anthropogenic combustion sources including vehicle emissions is needed to reduce the high levels of nitrogen oxide and NO3- and the high PM2.5 pollution occurred over fall season in Gwangju.

TI  - Ocean warming-induced range-shifting of potential habitat for jumbo flying squid <i>Dosidicus gigas</i> in the Southeast Pacific Ocean off Peru
T2  - FISHERIES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate-induced ocean warming may have significant influences on abundance and geographic distribution of fish species and cause range shifts and/or expansions in their habitats. The jumbo flying squid Dosidicus gigas in the Eastern Pacific Ocean is an ecologically and commercially important species. With 1-year short lifespan, D. gigas is significantly affected by climatic and environmental variability. This study used the logbook data of the 2011-2015 Chinese squid-jigging fishery off Peruvian waters, coupled with sea surface temperature (SST) data, to explore the variations in seasonal habitat suitability and habitat distribution pattern for D. gigas in the Southeast Pacific Ocean under five scenarios: SST in recent years (2011-2015) and with 0.5 degrees C, 1.0 degrees C, 2.0 degrees C and 4.0*C increases in relation to the climate variability. A fishing effort-based habitat suitability index (HSI) model was developed to estimate habitat quality of D. gigas and spatial distribution of suitable and optimal habitats in relation to ocean warming. Results indicated that obvious seasonal variations were observed in the SST on the fishing ground of D. gigas with spatial variability. HSI modeling approach in this study essentially captured habitat characteristics of D. gigas from spring to winter during 2011-2015. SST increase scenarios revealed that seasonal habitat suitability of D. gigas significantly reduced, and the percentages of suitable (HSI >= 0.6) and optimal (HSI >= 0.8) habitats occupying the fishing ground dramatically decreased due to the rising SST. Moreover, an obvious southeastward movement was observed in gravity centers of D. gigas habitat under the above-mentioned five scenarios. Our findings suggested that ocean warming was likely to result in the shrinkage and southeastward range-shift in the potential high-quality habitats of D. gigas in the Southeast Pacific Ocean off Peruvian waters.

TI  - Spatial-temporal variation of ecosystem service values in Ebinur Lake Wetland National Natural Reserve from 1972 to 2016, Xinjiang, arid region of China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - National nature reserves in China protect ecosystem and well-being in its region while benefiting humans by providing ecosystem services. Land-use/cover changes result in changes in the landscape pattern and affect the provision of ecosystem service value (ESV). The monetary evaluation of spatial-temporal changes in landscape patterns and ecosystem services in the arid region of China has been inadequately studied. Therefore, the Ebinur Lake Wetland National Nature Reserve (ELWNNR) in the arid region of China was chosen as a study object to evaluate the spatial-temporal variation in ecosystem service values (ESVs) under changes in land use/cover. The research analysed land-use/cover change in ELWNNR using a Sankey diagram, the spatial-temporal variation in ELWNNR ESVs using ArcGIS. Meanwhile, it also analysed the landscape patterns and total ESVs of the core area, buffer area and experimental area of ELWNNR at a regional scale. Four Landsat data sets from 1972, 1998, 2007 and 2016 were chosen to estimate the changes in land-use/cover types and ESV in ELWNNR. Meanwhile, the sensitivity of ESV was also analysed to validate the estimation of ESV in ELWNNR. The results showed that the total ESV of ELWNNR was 3.12 x 10(9) CNY (USD$ 4.88 x 10(8)) in 1972 and dropped to 2.71 x 10(9) CNY (USD$ 4.24 x 10(8)) in 2016. The provision of total ESV in ELWNNR decreased by approximately 0.41 x 10(9) CNY (USD$ 6.42 x 10(7)) from 1972 to 2016, although there were fluctuations in 1998 and 2007. The core area possessed the highest ESV among all the areas, showing an increase in the provision of ESV in ELWNNR. All the areas of ELWNNR became highly fragmented, and the landscape patterns became more complex during this time period. The results of the study provide sufficient information about the ecosystem services in the region in the absence of complete data sets and contribute to conservation planning of national nature reserves.

TI  - A supervised approach for simultaneous segmentation and classification of remote sensing images
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Object-based image classification is recognized as one of the best strategies to analyze high spatial resolution remote sensing images. This process includes defining scale parameters to form regions sharing similar characteristics such as color, texture, or shape. Traditionally, in an object-based supervised classification setting the image is classified only after the segmentation process is completed. However, when the imaged objects on the ground are heterogeneous and of different sizes, some resulting segments can be appropriate for classification while others are over or under-segmented. This may cause partial failure of the subsequent classification. In this paper, we introduce a simultaneous approach based on the interception of the segmentation stage by provisional classification of under-growing segments. Our proposal is to optimize the classification process by iteratively updating the labels of previously generated regions only if the estimated posterior probabilities of the winning classes in the new segments increase. Experiments with three multispectral datasets acquired by Landsat-5 TM, QuickBird-II, and WorldView-3 in rural and urban areas compare traditional object-based approach based on region growing with the proposed method using well-established classifiers. Our results show that the proposed method becomes much less sensitive to the choice of segmentation parameters and reaches similar, or even better, classification accuracies.

TI  - Scenario modeling for spatial-temporal change detection of carbon storage and sequestration in a forested landscape in Northern Iran
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study was conducted, based on scenario modeling approach, in the Do-hezar and Se-hezar forested landscape in the Mazandaran Province in Northern Iran in order to detect spatial-temporal changes of carbon storage and sequestration in four different carbon pools, i.e., aboveground and belowground biomasses, dead organic matter, and organic soils. For this purpose, firstly, the changing trend of land use/land cover (LULC) was detected by analyzing and comparing remotely sensed data of the landscape during the period of 1984-2016. Then, the impacts of future LULC changes on carbon storage and sequestration were predicted and valued using the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs (InVEST) model under two future plausible scenarios of business as usual (BAU) and balanced development (BD). According to the results of BAU scenario, continuation of the current trend will lead to a significant reduction in the carbon sequestration and a huge amount of social cost due to the loss of carbon stored in the landscape and its release to the atmosphere. The BD scenario which refers to the principled and under control development of human settlements simultaneously with forest conservational and restoration activities, could potentially reverse the downtrend of carbon sequestration service and avoid future socioeconomic costs, hence add to the economic value of the forest landscape in terms of providing a better sink for carbon storage. The results of this research can facilitate the quantitative and accurate assessment of carbon storage and sequestration relying on more precise biophysical and economic data as well as provide insight for effective land-use planning.

TI  - Global Land Surface Modeling Including Lateral Groundwater Flow
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The groundwater system is an essential part of Earth's systems. However, most current land surface models (LSMs) for climate modeling do not explicitly account for the lateral groundwater flow process. In this study, schemes describing LSM-lateral groundwater flow module coupling, model resolution conversion, and parallel simulation were designed and implemented to incorporate a lateral groundwater flow module into the Community Land Model 4.5. The depth to less permeable bedrock also was included in the large-scale groundwater flow modeling. Model validation was performed using multiple observations from the 20-year continuous groundwater table depth measurements at 67 stations in 10 countries, 1.6 million worldwide time-averaged groundwater table depth measurements, previous knowledge about the locations of major aquifer systems, and inversed terrestrial water storage anomalies derived from satellite data. The simulated results show that the groundwater table pattern is a combined reflection of climatic and topographic factors across a range of spatial scales. Lateral groundwater flow significantly modified the equilibrium water table patterns in North Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, central Asia, and southern Australia, deepening the water tables by more than 6 m. The trend of deepening groundwater tables observed between 1970 and 2010, which was found to be 0.025 to 0.125 m/decade, was exacerbated by the lateral flow; however, the seasonal variability of the groundwater table depth was reduced by the buffering effect of the lateral flow.

TI  - Response of terrestrial evapotranspiration to Earth's greening
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Review
AB  - The greening of the Earth has been unequivocally observed in 30 years of satellite measurements from NOAA-AVHRR. Here, we review the recent literature on the response of terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET) to Earth's greening, including the contribution of greening to the global terrestrial ET change over recent decades and its role in the regulation by vegetation of changes in Earth's climate system. Although large uncertainties remain in the observation-based reconstructions of global terrestrial ET, all products established a significant increase in terrestrial ET over the past three decades (P < 0.05). The ensemble of all reconstructions over the period 1982-2011 provided a relatively robust estimate of 0.97 +/- 0.16 trillion tonnes per year per decade, or 7.65 +/- 1.26 mm per year per decade averaged over the terrestrial area. More than 50% of this global intensification of terrestrial ET was caused by the greening of the Earth, as evidenced by observation-based statistical analysis and observation-driven model simulations. Earth system model simulations further showed that this response is a key determinant of the complex feedback loops of Earth's greening with Earth's water and climate systems. These results highlight the need for much more accurate representation of vegetation dynamics and the sensitivity of ET to vegetation changes in Earth system models, which will ultimately improve the strategies developed for water resource management and climate change mitigation via ecosystem management.

TI  - Capability of crop water content for revealing variability of winter wheat grain yield and soil moisture under limited irrigation
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Winter wheat (Tridcum aestivum L.) is a major crop in the Guanzhong Plain, China. Understanding its water status is important for irrigation planning. A few crop water indicators, such as the leaf equivalent water thickness (EWT: g cm(-2)), leaf water content (LWC: %) and canopy water content (CWC: kg m(2)), have been estimated using remote sensing techniques for a wide range of crops, yet their suitability and utility for revealing winter wheat growth and soil moisture status have not been well studied. To bridge this knowledge gap, field-scale irrigation experiments were conducted over two consecutive years (2014 and 2015) to investigate relationships of crop water content with soil moisture and grain yield, and to assess the performance of four spectral process methods for retrieving these three crop water indicators. The result revealed that the water indicators were more sensitive to soil moisture variation before the jointing stage. All three water indicators were significantly correlated with soil moisture during the reviving stage, and the correlations were stronger for leaf water indicators than that of the canopy water indicator at the jointing stage. No correlation was observed after the heading stage. All three water indicators showed good capabilities of revealing grain yield variability in jointing stage, with R-2 up to 0.89. CWC had a consistent relationship with grain yield over different growing seasons, but the performances of EWT and LWC were growing-season specific. The partial least squares regression was the most accurate method for estimating LWC (R-2 = 0.72; RMSE = 3.6%) and comparable capability for EWT and CWC. Finally, the work highlights the usefulness of crop water indicators to assess crop growth, productivity, and soil water status and demonstrates the potential of various spectral processing methods for retrieving crop water contents from canopy reflectance spectrums.

TI  - Symmetric Double-Eye Structure in Hurricane <i>Bertha</i> (2008) Imaged by SAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Internal dynamical processes play a critical role in hurricane intensity variability. However, our understanding of internal storm processes is less well established, partly because of fewer observations. In this study, we present an analysis of the hurricane double-eye structure imaged by the RADARSAT-2 cross-polarized synthetic aperture radar (SAR) over Hurricane Bertha (2008). SAR has the capability of hurricane monitoring because of the ocean surface roughness induced by surface wind stress. Recently, the C-band cross-polarized SAR measurements appear to be unsaturated for the high wind speeds, which makes SAR suitable for studies of the hurricane internal dynamic processes, including the double-eye structure. We retrieve the wind field of Hurricane Bertha (2008), and then extract the closest axisymmetric double-eye structure from the wind field using an idealized vortex model. Comparisons between the axisymmetric model extracted wind field and SAR observed winds demonstrate that the double-eye structure imaged by SAR is relatively axisymmetric. Associated with airborne measurements using a stepped-frequency microwave radiometer, we investigate the hurricane internal dynamic process related to the double-eye structure, which is known as the eyewall replacement cycle (ERC). The classic ERC theory was proposed by assuming an axisymmetric storm structure. The ERC internal dynamic process of Hurricane Bertha (2008) related to the symmetric double-eye structure here, which is consistent with the classic theory, is observed by SAR and aircraft.

AB  - Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is an important indicator for measuring vegetation coverage, which is of great significance for evaluating vegetation dynamics and vegetation restoration. It can clearly analyze the suitable growth condition of vegetation by studying the relationship between meteorological factors, soil moisture and NDVI. Based on MODIS/NDVI data, the spatio-temporal characteristics of vegetation coverage in the Weihe River Basin (WRB) were analyzed by the trend analysis method. The relationship of NDVI with meteorological factors and NDVI with soil moisture simulated by the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) model was analyzed in this paper. The results show that NDVI values gradually change with an increase from north to south in the WRB. The maximum of the average monthly NDVI is 0.702 (August) and the minimum is 0.288 in February from 2000 to 2015. The results of the seven grades of NDVI trend line slope indicate that the improvement area of vegetation coverage accounts for 30.93% of the total basin, and the degradation area and basically unchanged area account for 23% and 42.9%, respectively. The annual mean soil moisture is 19.37% in the WRB. There was a strong correlation between NDVI and precipitation, temperature, evaporation and soil moisture, and the correlation coefficients were 0.78, 0.89, 0.71 and 0.65, respectively. The ranges of the most suitable growth conditions for vegetation are 80-145 mm (precipitation), 13-23 degrees C (temperature), 94-144 mm (evaporation) and 25-33% (soil moisture), respectively.

TI  - Comparative Analysis of Inundation Mapping Approaches for the 2016 Flood in the Brazos River, Texas
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely flood inundation maps serve as crucial information for hydrologists, first-responders, and decision makers of natural disaster management agencies. In this study, two modeling approaches are applied to estimate the inundation area for a large flooding event that occurred in May 2016 in the Brazos River: (1) Height Above the Nearest Drainage combined with National Hydrograph Dataset Plus (NHDPlus-HAND) and (2) International River Interface Cooperative Flow and Sediment Transport with Morphological Evolution of Channels (iRIC-FaSTMECH). The inundation extents simulated from these two modeling approaches are then compared against the observed inundation extents derived from a Landsat 8 satellite image. The simulated results from NHDPlus-HAND and iRIC-FaSTMECH show 56% and 70% of overlaps with the observed flood extents, respectively. A modified version of the NHDPlus-HAND model, considering networked catchment behaviors, is also tested with an improved fitness of 67%. This study suggests that NHDPlus-HAND has the potential for real-time continental inundation forecast due to its low computational cost and ease to couple with the National Water Model. Better performance of NHDPlus-HAND can be achieved by considering the inter-catchment flows during extreme riverine flood events. Overall, this study presents a comprehensive examination made of remote sensing compared with HAND-based inundation mapping in a region of complex topography.

TI  - Impacts of socioeconomic factors on cropland transition and its adaptation in Beijing, China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past decades, croplands in China experienced rapid losses as a result of nationwide urbanization, industrialization, socioeconomic development, and implementation of ecological projects. These developments were driven by continuous economic reforms and environmental protection policies. Croplands are precious land resources influenced by overpopulation in China. Cropland losses threaten national food security. This study analyzed spatial patterns of cropland changes, driving forces, and its adaptation. Object-based approach was adopted to accurately measure cropland changes using remote sensing data. Conversion matrix and statistical regression model were used to explore impacts of socioeconomic factors on cropland changes. A case study on Beijing revealed that cropland in Beijing decreased by 47% in the past 35 years. Primary driving forces in cropland loss included urban expansion, implementation of ecological projects, orchard plantation, and water resource protection. Increased migration and economic development resulted in urban expansion. To promote sustainable development and to meet demands of urban and environmental protection, cropland adaptation was performed by increasing value-added commercial crop plantation, improving crop yield, and reducing cultivation intensity for effective water consumption.

TI  - Mapping seasonal impervious surface dynamics in Wuhan urban agglomeration, China from 2000 to 2016
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerous methods have been successfully applied to estimate the regional impervious surface dynamics based on spectral or spatial information from remote sensing imagery. However, previous methods mainly focused on mapping impervious surfaces at annual or decadal time scales. Few studies have attempted to map impervious surface dynamics at finer time scales, such as on a seasonal time scale using temporal information. This study aims to map regional impervious surface dynamics on a seasonal time scale by using time series Landsat data. The semi-supervised support vector machine (SVM) algorithm was employed for classifying impervious surfaces based on temporal characteristics, which were derived from seasonal time series biophysical composition index (BCI) and seasonal time series modified normalized difference impervious surface index (NDISI). The proposed method was validated over the Wuhan urban agglomeration (WUA) in China from 2000 to 2016. The results showed that impervious surfaces in the Wuhan urban agglomeration increased from 903.24 km(2) in 2000 to 3989.49 km(2) in 2016, with an annual growth rate of 20.10%. Additionally, the proposed method yielded reasonable average overall classification accuracy (up to 88%). Our results demonstrated that the proposed method could accurately map seasonal impervious surface dynamics based on temporal characteristics. This study could enable the monitoring of time-intensive impervious surfaces at a regional scale using remote sensing data.

TI  - Soil Moisture Retrieval from the Chinese GF-3 Satellite and Optical Data over Agricultural Fields
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurate soil moisture information is of great importance in agricultural monitoring. The Gaofen-3 (GF-3) satellite, the first C-band multi-polarization synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) satellite in China, provides valuable data sources for soil moisture monitoring. In this study, a soil moisture retrieval algorithm was developed for the GF-3 satellite based on a backscattering coefficient simulation database. We adopted eight optical vegetation indices to determine the relationships between these indices and vegetation water content (VWC) by combining Landsat-8 data and field measurements. A backscattering coefficient database was built using an advanced integral equation model (AIEM). The effects of vegetation on backscattering coefficients were corrected using the water cloud model (WCM) to obtain the bare soil backscattering coefficient (sigma(soil)degrees). Then, soil moisture retrievals were obtained at HH, VV and HH+VV combination respectively by minimizing the observed bare soil backscattering coefficient (sigma(soil)degrees) and the AIEM-simulated backscattering coefficient (sigma(soil-simu)degrees ). Finally, the proposed algorithm was validated in agriculture region of wheat and corn in China using ground soil moisture measurements. The results showed that the normalized difference infrared index (NDII) had the best fit with measured VWC values (R = 0.885) among the eight vegetation water indices; thus, it was adopted to correct the effects of vegetation. The proposed algorithm using GF-3 satellite data performed well in soil moisture retrieval, and the scheme combining HH and VV polarization exhibited the highest accuracy, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.044 m(3)m(-3), followed by HH polarization (RMSE = 0.049 m(3)m(-3)) and VV polarization (RMSE = 0.053 m(3)m(-3)). Therefore, the proposed algorithm has good potential to operationally estimate soil moisture from the new GF-3 satellite data.

TI  - Missing Data Reconstruction in Remote Sensing Image With a Unified Spatial-Temporal-Spectral Deep Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Because of the internal malfunction of satellite sensors and poor atmospheric conditions such as thick cloud, the acquired remote sensing data often suffer from missing information, i.e., the data usability is greatly reduced. In this paper, a novel method of missing information reconstruction in remote sensing images is proposed. The unified spatial-temporal-spectral framework based on a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) employs a unified deep CNN combined with spatial-temporal-spectral supplementary information. In addition, to address the fact that most methods can only deal with a single missing information reconstruction task, the proposed approach can solve three typical missing information reconstruction tasks: 1) dead lines in Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer hand 6; 2) the Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus scan line corrector-off problem; and 3) thick cloud removal. It should he noted that the proposed model can use multisource data (spatial, spectral, and temporal) as the input of the unified framework. The results of both simulated and real-data experiments demonstrate that the proposed model exhibits high effectiveness in the three missing information reconstruction tasks listed above.

TI  - Monitoring of Urban Impervious Surfaces Using Time Series of High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images in Rapidly Urbanized Areas: A Case Study of Shenzhen
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of impervious surface changes is important for understanding the urban environment and human activity. Most of previous studies have investigated impervious surface change at a macro level (e.g., urban expansion) using medium resolution images but ignored the subtle changes within urban areas. High-resolution images have great potential to precisely monitor the detailed characteristics of impervious surfaces. However, very few studies focused on this issue using multitemporal high-resolution data. In this study, we aimed to resolve these problems and investigate the impervious surface characteristics using high-resolution time-series data. The experiments were performed on Shenzhen, a megacity in China that has experienced rapid urbanization over the past three decades. The images were acquired by QuickBird (2.4 m), WorldView-2 (2 m), andWorldView3 (1.2 m) at similar to 2-year intervals from 2003 to 2017. The presented method integrating multiple features was found to be effective in extracting impervious surfaces from the high-resolution images (kappa coefficient greater than 0.90), and the average accuracy of the change detection was 75%. Courtesy of the high-resolution imagery, it was revealed that the impervious surfaces can be converted back to pervious surfaces, and some regions have shown repeated changes due to the urban renewal planning. It was also found that impervious surfaces in Shenzhen gradually increased before 2012, but subsequently showed a decreasing tendency, reflecting the adjusted strategies for urban development. Our results demonstrate that high-resolution images are essential for precise impervious surface monitoring, and can provide deep insights into urban development patterns during the process of urbanization.

TI  - Mapping up-to-Date Paddy Rice Extent at 10 M Resolution in China through the Integration of Optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice is a staple food in East Asia and Southeast Asiaan area that accounts for more than half of the world's population, and 11% of its cultivated land. Studies on rice monitoring can provide direct or indirect information on food security, and water source management. Remote sensing has proven to be the most effective method for the large-scale monitoring of croplands, by using temporary and spectral information. The Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a cloud-based platform providing access to high-performance computing resources for processing extremely large geospatial datasets. In this study, by leveraging the computational power of GEE and a large pool of satellite and other geophysical data (e.g., forest and water extent maps, with high accuracy at 30 m), we generated the first up-to-date rice extent map with crop intensity, at 10 m resolution in the three provinces with the highest rice production in China (the Heilongjiang, Hunan and Guangxi provinces). Optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data were monthly and metric composited to ensure a sufficient amount of up-to-date data without cloud interference. To remove the common confounding noise in the pixel-based classification results at medium to high resolution, we integrated the pixel-based classification (using a random forest classifier) result with the object-based segmentation (using a simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) method). This integration resulted in the rice planted area data that most closely resembled official statistics. The overall accuracy was approximately 90%, which was validated by ground crop field points. The F scores reached 87.78% in the Heilongjiang Province for monocropped rice, 89.97% and 80.00% in the Hunan Province for mono- and double-cropped rice, respectively, and 88.24% in the Guangxi Province for double-cropped rice.

TI  - Predicting daily PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations in Texas using high-resolution satellite aerosol optical depth
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and objective: The regulatory monitoring data of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter <2.5 mu M (PM2.5) in Texas have limited spatial and temporal coverage. The purpose of this study is to estimate the ground-level PM2.5 concentrations on a daily basis using satellite-retrieved Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) in the state of Texas.Methods: We obtained the AOD values at 1-km resolution generated through the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm based on the images retrieved from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellites. We then developed mixed-effects models based on AODs, land use features, geographic characteristics, and weather conditions, and the day-specific as well as site-specific random effects to estimate the PM2.5 concentrations (mu g/m(3)) in the state of Texas during the period 2008-2013. The mixed-effects models' performance was evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R-2) and square root of the mean squared prediction error (RMSPE) from ten-fold cross-validation, which randomly selected 90% of the observations for training purpose and 10% of the observations for assessing the models' true prediction ability.Results: Mixed-effects regression models showed good prediction performance (R-2 values from 10-fold cross validation: 0.63-0.69). The model performance varied by regions and study years, and the East region of Texas, and year of 2009 presented relatively higher prediction precision (R-2:0.62 for the East region; R-2:0.69 for the year of 2009). The PM2.5 concentrations generated through our developed models at 1-km grid cells in the state of Texas showed a decreasing trend from 2008 to 2013 and a higher reduction of predicted PM2.5 in more polluted areas.Conclusions: Our findings suggest that mixed-effects regression models developed based on MAIAC AOD are a feasible approach to predict ground-level PM(2.5 )in Texas. Predicted PM2.5 concentrations at the 1-km resolution on a daily basis can be used for epidemiological studies to investigate short-and long-term health impact of PM2.5 in Texas.

TI  - Spatial-temporal fraction map fusion with multi-scale remotely sensed images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Given the common trade-off between the spatial and temporal resolutions of current satellite sensors, spatial-temporal data fusion methods could be applied to produce fused remotely sensed data with synthetic fine spatial resolution (FR) and high repeat frequency. Such fused data are required to provide a comprehensive understanding of Earth's surface land cover dynamics. In this research, a novel Spatial-Temporal Fraction Map Fusion (STFMF) model is proposed to produce a series of fine-spatial-temporal-resolution land cover fraction maps by fusing coarse-spatial-fine-temporal and fine-spatial-coarse-temporal fraction maps, which may be generated from multi-scale remotely sensed images. The STFMF has two main stages. First, FR fraction change maps are generated using kernel ridge regression. Second, a FR fraction map for the date of prediction is predicted using a temporal-weighted fusion model. In comparison to two established spatial-temporal fusion methods of spatial-temporal super-resolution land cover mapping model and spatial-temporal image reflectance fusion model, STFMF holds the following characteristics and advantages: (1) it takes account of the mixed pixel problem in FR remotely sensed images; (2) it directly uses the fraction maps as input, which could be generated from a range of satellite images or other suitable data sources; (3) it focuses on the estimation of fraction changes happened through time and can predict the land cover change more accurately. Experiments using synthetic multi-scale fraction maps simulated from Google Earth images, as well as synthetic and real MODIS-Landsat images were undertaken to test the performance of the proposed STFMF approach against two benchmark spatial-temporal reflectance fusion methods: the Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM) and the Flexible Spatiotemporal Data Fusion (FSDAF) model. In both visual and quantitative evaluations, STFMF was able to generate more accurate FR fraction maps and provide more spatial detail than ESTARFM and FSDAF, particularly in areas with substantial land cover changes. STFMF has great potential to produce accurate time-series fraction maps with fine-spatial-temporal-resolution that can support studies of land cover dynamics at the sub-pixel scale.& nbsp;

TI  - A Systematic Extraction Approach for Mapping Glacial Lakes in High Mountain Regions of Asia
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacial lakes are highly sensitive indicators of global climate change. The accurate extraction of glacial lakes from image data is of great importance to the evaluation of the hydrological environment in high mountain regions. This paper demonstrates a systematic approach-TSCV (threshold and simplified C-V)-that integrates the advantages of the threshold segmentation method and the active contour model to improve the effect of glacial lake extraction, by overcoming the problems involved in the efficient extraction of small, overlooked glacial lakes and in the removal of some mountain shadows. Three typical areas of glacial lake development in High Asia were selected for glacial lake extraction from Landsat-8 imagery and the results were then compared with those obtained using the threshold segmentation method and the fuzzy clustering method (FCM). The values of the kappa coefficient (KC) and average extraction accuracy (AEA) shows that the TSCV (KC = 0.895, AEA = 0.739) performed superior than other two methods, especially for the small glacial lakes, but also that the threshold segmentation method (KC = 0.869, AEA = 0.631) requires the least time and that the FCM (KC = 871, AEA = 0.663) has the lowest commission error. Our findings lead to a new approach to improve the accuracy of glacial lake extraction in situation where a large proportion of the lakes are small and with a potential for automated glacial lake mapping in rugged mountain areas at a large scale.

TI  - Linking Heat Source-Sink Landscape Patterns with Analysis of Urban Heat Islands: Study on the Fast-Growing Zhengzhou City in Central China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, the urban heat island (UHI) effect is a major problem which leads to urban residents suffering from adverse urban ecological environments and serious health risks. Understanding the impacts of urban landscape features on the thermal environment has been an important focus across various fields of research. The purpose of this study is to analyze the impacts of urban heat source-sink landscape patterns on urban heat islands, using the fast-growing Zhengzhou City in central China as the case study. Landsat data (captured in 1996, 2006, and 2014), various geospatial approaches, and correlation analysis were applied to facilitate the analysis. Based on the contributions of the urban landscape to land surface temperature (LST), we empirically identified the heat sources and heat sinks. Then, the composition and configurations of heat source and sink landscapes were estimated by a series of spatial metrics at the landscape and class levels. The results showed that the overall mean land surface temperature (LST) in the study area increased by 2.72 degrees C from 1996 to 2014. This observed increasing trend in overall mean LST is consistent with the process of rapid urbanization in the study area, which was evidenced by the dramatic increase in impervious surfaces and the substantial loss in vegetation cover. Generally, as observed, landscape composition has a stronger influence on LST than does landscape configuration. For heat sources, the proportion, size, aggregation, and density of patches have positive effects on LST, while adjusting the spatial distribution and abundance of urban landscape are effective ways to control the UHI effects. In contrast, the percentage, size, density, and aggregation of heat sink patches have negative effects on LST. Additionally, the effects of increasing total patch edges and shape complexity should be considered when mitigating the UHI effect. These findings are beneficial for furthering our understanding of how urban landscape patterns affect UHI, and they can help optimize urban landscape patterns to alleviate the UHI effect and enhance sustainable development in the study area.

TI  - Triangle Space-Based Surface Soil Moisture Estimation by the Synergistic Use of <i>In Situ </i>Measurements and Optical/Thermal Infrared Remote Sensing: An Alternative to Conventional Validations
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Together with the continuous development of passive microwave surface soil moisture (SSM) products from newly launched satellites, it is necessary to perform reliable validations to assess their accuracy. With this aim, a new "bottom-up" validation approach is proposed based on the synergistic use of in situ SSM measurements from the soil moisture measurement station network (REMEDHUS) of the University of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain, and optical/thermal infrared observations over 18 cloud-free days from Landsat-8. An SSM estimation method using the boundary information from the land surface temperature and normalized difference vegetation index triangle space was developed for regional SSM mapping. The retrieved SSM reached a relatively good performance (mean R 2 and rootmean-squared error of 0.64 and 0.033 ne/m(3), respectively). Then, the regional SSM was aggregated into the grid-cell scale of the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) L3 high-resolution (0.1 degrees /10 km) soil moisture product to validate it both at network and grid-cell levels. At the network level, the derived regional SSM showed a good agreement with the averaged in situ measurements over the network (R = 0.731). However, at the grid-cell level, small variations were observed for the cells over the network between the estimates and the AMSR2 product, with negative biases (-0.044 to -0.090 m(3)/m(3)) and positive correlations (R > 0.25) for most cells. In addition, it is shown that the descending product has a slightly better performance than does the ascending one. The preliminary assessments suggested that the proposed method provides new insights into the validation of passive microwave soil moisture products, while avoiding the common issue related to the big disparity in spatial scales between satellite observation and in situ measurements.

TI  - A spatial downscaling approach for the SMAP passive surface soil moisture product using random forest regression
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The low-resolution characteristic of passive microwave surface soil moisture (SSM) products greatly limits their application in many fields at regional or local scale. Aiming to overcome this limitation, a random forest (RF)-based downscaling approach was proposed in this study to disaggregate the Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) SSM product with the synergistic use of the Optical/Thermal infrared (TIR) observations from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) onboard the Terra and Aqua satellites. The Iberian Peninsula was selected as the study area during the period from 2015 to 2016.First, the performance of the RF-based approach in building the SSM relationship model with surface variables (surface temperature, vegetation index, leaf area index, albedo, water index, solar factor, and elevation) was compared with that resulting from a widely used polynomial-based relationship model. Good agreement was achieved for the RF-based method with a correlation coefficient (R) above 0.95 and a mean root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 0.009 m(3)/m(3).Next, four data combinations (AM + Terra, AM + Aqua, PM + Terra, and PM + Aqua) were generated according to the different overpass times of the SMAP and MODIS observations, and they were separately used to derive the spatially downscaled SSM with the proposed RF-based downscaling method. Validation was performed with the in situ measurements from the REMEDHUS network of the University of Salamanca in Spain. The results indicated that all combinations have similar good performances with an unbiased root-mean-square difference (ubRMSD) of 0.022 m(3)/m(3), and the downscaled SSM at 1-km spatial resolution presented better accuracy while showing higher spatial heterogeneity and more detailed temporal pattern.Finally, the temporal changing pattern of the downscaled SSM was assessed with the precipitation time series from eight meteorological stations in the study area, and the rainfall effect on the variation of SSM was well tracked from its temporal changes.Overall, this study suggests that the proposed RF-based downscaling method is able to capture the variation of SSM well, and it should be helpful to improve the resolution of passive microwave soil moisture data and facilitate their applications at small scales.

TI  - Automatic extraction of yardangs using Landsat 8 and UAV images: A case study in the Qaidam Basin, China
T2  - AEOLIAN RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Yardangs are ridge features of various scales indicating the direction of prevailing wind when they evolved. In this paper, we apply an integrated approach for the automatic extraction of yardangs in typical areas of the Qaidam Basin. Canny's edge detection algorithm is used for yardangs in 15-m Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data to acquire the spatial distribution patterns of yardangs, and ellipse-fitting algorithm is used to get the morphological parameters of yardangs in 1.7-m Digital Elevation Model (DEM) generated by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images. Both the spatial distribution patterns and morphological parameters can improve knowledge of yardangs. The experimental results illustrate the accuracy and feasibility of the proposed extraction approach for the spatial distribution patterns of yardangs with an average relative error no more than 10%. The statistical analysis shows that most of yardangs developed near anticlines and few in synclines; most yardangs are in Pliocene strata, and a few in lower and middle Pleistocene strata. For the automatically extracted morphological parameters, the relative error of each parameter is less than 6%, which is meaningful for the type identification of yardangs.

TI  - Pharmacovigilance in China: development and challenges
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background Rational drug use and drug safety are becoming increasingly important concerns in China with the increasing public access to drugs and the health-care system, and this has led to the development of pharmacovigilance in China. Aim of the review To provide a brief introduction about pharmacovigilance in China in terms of system development, utilization and challenges. Method Relevant studies on pharmacovigilance related to the study aim was undertaken through literature search to synthesize the extracted data. Results The creation and evolvement of China's pharmacovigilance system spans across 30years since 1989. The system consists of four progressing administrative layers: county, municipal, provincial and national levels. China has passed over 20 laws and regulations related to pharmacovigilance covering the processes of drug development, manufacture, distribution and use with the aim to guard drug safety. An online spontaneous self-reporting Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) Monitoring System was established in 2003. ADRs are mainly reported by medical institutions, pharmaceutical manufacturers, and drug distributors. Currently there is no mandatory ADR reporting requirement for pharmaceutical manufacturers, and a proposed regulation under public comment will likely change this. China has started to build active pharmacovigilance surveillance programs in addition to the passive ADR reporting system. The China Food and Drug Administration has established the intensive Safety Monitoring Program and the National Adverse Drug Reaction Monitoring Sentinel Alliance Program based on electronic health records to further the efforts of ADR reporting, monitoring and analysis. Conclusion The practice of ADR monitoring and pharmacovigilance in China have made great progress. More efforts are needed both in system building, and creation of laws and regulations to strengthen the safe use of medicines.

M3  - Article
AB  - This article deals with the narrative functions of metalepsis (in Gerard Genette's terms), a device that shows a transgression of the boundaries between the reality of characters and the reality of a narrator. It is devoted to the analysis of the "I-narration" fragments of mostly third-person narrated texts (so-called 'authorial intrusions'). The article suggests that the meanings of those fragments correlate with the concept of personality, worldview and narrative mode manifested in the work.Post-symbolist authors are always in search of new ways to influence their readers. The authorial position becomes a field of experiment (said experiments having various ideological, aesthetic and pragmatic reasons) as a part of a general concept of 'overcoming an aesthetic crisis'. The image of the creator represented in the narrative, relationships between the "I" and the "Other" (in Bakhtin's terms, "one's own words" and "alien words") appear to be questioned. Therefore, the intrigue of a post-symbolist work is centered around not only the lives of the characters but also the 'event of narration' and, in particular, interactions between the narrators. Such interactions can be studied via the analysis of metalepsis due to it being one of the most popular narratological categories describing the system of narrative levels.The research is based on the novels by Valentin Kataev, Konstantin Vaginov, and Boris Pasternak, which belong to different paradigms of literariness (socialist realism, avantgardism and neotraditionalism). Authorial intrusions of the novels, which belong to avantgarde aesthetics, fulfill the "natural" role (as described by Genette) of representing the game nature of the discourse. Socialist-realistic novels tend to include dialogues between the reader and the narrator as part of regulation of the narrated world. Here, authorial intrusions do not manifest the freedom of imagination, instead showing self-debasement in the face of the world order. In neotraditionalistic novels, authorial intrusions are the signs of a convergent nature of the narrative. These novels feature "double focalisation", a form of interaction between the narrator and the protagonist where they are no longer on the different sides of the dialogue but rather merge into a united narrative voice, a supernarrator.The article concludes with a statement that the semantic potential of a metalepsis (Ivanov and the self-esteeming narration, Kataev and the disappearing authorial "I", Pasternak and the convergence of the author's and the protagonist's consciousness) depends on the chosen narrative strategy (configuration of subject, object and addressee of discourse). Metalepsis is described as a strong way of representing the narrator's actions. It indexes the three main communicative models of post-symbolist fiction: "provocation", "agitation", "revelation".

TI  - Examining the Impacts of Urban Form on Air Pollution in Developing Countries: A Case Study of China's Megacities
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban form is increasingly being identified as an important determinant of air pollution in developed countries. However, the effect of urban form on air pollution in developing countries has not been adequately addressed in the literature to date, which points to an evident omission in current literature. In order to fill this gap, this study was designed to estimate the impacts of urban form on air pollution for a panel made up of China's five most rapidly developing megacities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Chongqing, and Guangzhou) using time series data from 2000 to 2012. Using the official Air Pollution Index (API) data, this study developed three quantitative indicators: mean air pollution index (MAPI), air pollution ratio (APR), and continuous air pollution ratio (CAPR), to evaluate air pollution levels. Moreover, seven landscape metrics were calculated for the assessment of urban form based on three aspects (urban size, urban shape irregularity, and urban fragmentation) using remote sensing data. Panel data models were subsequently employed to quantify the links between urban form and air pollution. The empirical results demonstrate that urban expansion surprisingly helps to reduce air pollution. The substitution of clean energy for dirty energy that results from urbanization in China offers a possible explanation for this finding. Furthermore, urban shape irregularity positively correlated with the number of days with polluted air conditions, a result could be explained in terms of the influence of urban geometry on traffic congestion in Chinese cities. In addition, a negative association was identified between urban fragmentation and the number of continuous days of air pollution, indicating that polycentric urban forms should be adopted in order to shorten continuous pollution processes. If serious about achieving the meaningful alleviation of air pollution, decision makers and urban planners should take urban form into account when developing sustainable cities in developing countries like China.

TI  - The Retrieval of 30-m Resolution LAI from Landsat Data by Combining MODIS Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is a critical vegetation structural parameter in biogeochemical and biophysical ecosystems. High-resolution LAI products play an essential role in regional studies. Empirical methods, which normally use field measurements as their training samples and have been identified as the most commonly used approaches to retrieve structural parameters of vegetation from high-resolution remote-sensing data, are limited by the quality of training samples. Few efforts have been made to generate training samples from existing global LAI products. In this study, two methods (a homogeneous and pure pixel filter method (method A) and a pixel unmixing method (method B)) were developed to extract training samples from moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectance and LAI products, and a support vector regression (SVR) algorithm trained by the samples was used to retrieve the high-resolution LAI from Landsat data at Baoding, situated in the Hebei Province in China, and Des Moines, situated in Iowa, United States. For the homogeneous and pure pixel filter method, two different sets of training samples were designed. One was composed of upscaled Landsat reflectance at the 500-m resolution and MODIS LAI products (dataset A1); the other was composed of MODIS reflectance and LAI products (dataset A2). With them, two inversion models were developed using SVR. For the pixel unmixing method, the training samples (dataset B) were extracted from unmixed MODIS surface reflectance and LAI products at 30-m resolution, and the third inversion model was obtained with them. LAI inversion results showed that good agreement with field measurements was achieved using these three inversion models. The R-2 (coefficient of determination) value and the root mean square error (RMSE) value were computed to assess the results. For all tests, the R-2 values are higher than 0.74 and RMSE values are less than 0.73. These tests showed that three models for the two methods combined with MODIS products can retrieve 30-m resolution LAI from Landsat data. The results of the pixel unmixing method was slightly better than that of the homogeneous and pure pixel filter method.

TI  - Multi-resolution networks for ship detection in infrared remote sensing images
T2  - INFRARED PHYSICS & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ship detection is a hot point of remote sensing image processing and analysis. Most current methods merely utilize a single resolution image and cannot take full advantage of registered multi-resolution images. In this paper, we proposed a novel ship detection method for multi-resolution infrared remote sensing images based on convolutional neural networks. With a specially designed layer of various size kernels, our net takes in registered multi-resolution images simultaneously, extracting more robust features and gives a more accurate detection result. Besides, as ship targets only occupy a few pixels in an infrared remote sensing image, to handle the extreme background-foreground imbalance problem in infrared remote sensing images, we introduce the focal loss to train our net. Compared with classical methods, experiments on visible bands and infrared bands of Landsat-8 satellite images demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

TI  - The diagnostic value of one step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) in differentiating lymph node metastasis of tumors: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: The aim of this study was clarify the diagnostic accuracy of one step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) for differentiating metastatic lymph nodes from non-metastatic ones in patients with tumors (not including breast cancer).Methods: A systematic literature search for original diagnostic studies was performed in PubMed. Findings were pooled by using combined effect models and hierarchic summary receiver operating characteristic curve models. Meta-regression analysis and threshold effect evaluating were performed to explore the sources of heterogeneity affected classification accuracy.Results: 19 studies (803 positive and 4594 negative lymph nodes) were analyzed, including 4 different tumor types (head and neck cancers, gastrointestinal cancers, lung cancer and gynecological malignancies). In the studies of head and neck cancers the pooled sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve (AUC) of the OSNA method were 0.85(0.79-0.89), 0.96(0.92-0.98) and 0.91 (0.88-0.93), respectively. Similarly, the corresponding values in the studies of gastrointestinal cancers were 0.90(0.85-0.94), 0.96(0.94-0.98) and 0.97 (0.96-0.99), respectively. Because of limited number of studies, the other two tumor types were inestimable in the subsequent meta-analyses.Conclusions: Pooled data suggest that the OSNA assay has a high diagnostic accuracy for the detection of lymph node metastases. For wide spread implementation, additional studies on other different types of tumors are warranted.

TI  - Spatial Characteristics of Rain Fields Associated with Tropical Cyclones Landfalling over the Western Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The western Gulf Coast and Caribbean coast are regions that are highly vulnerable to precipitation associated with tropical cyclones (TCs). Defining the spatial dimensions of TC rain fields helps determine the timing and duration of rainfall for a given location. Therefore, this study measured the area, dispersion, and displacement of light and moderate rain fields associated with 35 TCs making landfalls in this region and explored conditions contributing to their spatial variability. The spatial patterns of satellite-estimated rain rates are determined through hot spot analysis. Rainfall coverage is largest as TCs approach the western Caribbean coast, and smaller as TCs move over the Gulf of Mexico (GM) after making landfall over the Yucatan Peninsula. The rain fields are displaced eastward and northward over the western and central Caribbean Sea and the central GM. Rainfall fields have more displacement toward the west and south, which is over land, when TCs move over the southern GM, possibly as a result of the influence of Central American gyres. The area and dispersion of rainfall are significantly correlated with storm intensity and total precipitable water. The displacement of rainfall is significantly correlated with vertical wind shear. Over the Bay of Campeche, TC precipitation extends westward, which may be related to the convergence of moisture above the boundary layer from the Pacific Ocean and near-surface convergence enhanced by land. Additionally, half of the storms produce rainfall over land about 48 h before landfall. TCs may produce light rainfall over land for more than 72 h in this region.

TI  - Simultaneous determination of aerosol optica depth and exponent of the Junge power law from MODIS shortwave infrared bands over Qinghai Lake
T2  - APPLIED OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The water-leaving radiances for shortwave infrared (SWIR) channels can be negligible, and these channels also contain information on aerosol particle size. Therefore, the satellite-based data of SWIR channels can be used to estimate aerosol particle size over inland waters [Appl. Opt. 39, 887 (2000)]. Supposing the actual atmospheric aerosol size distribution is based on the Junge power law, in this paper an iterative algorithm is used to simultaneously determine the aerosol optical depth (AOD) and the exponent of the lunge power law from Aqua MODIS LIB reflectance data of channels 1.64 mu m and 2.13 mu m over Qinghai Lake. Whether using the constant or variable aerosol complex refractive index (ACRI), the retrieved exponent of the Junge power law is always larger than the product value. Supposing the product values are accurate, for the constant ACRI, there are 68.91% and 25.48% pixels of acceptable retrieval AOD and the exponent of the Junge power-law value, respectively. Likewise, there are 71.63% and 43.75% pixels for variable ACRI. Compared with the retrieval error under constant ACRI, there are 58.65% and 98.72% pixels, with a smaller AOD and Junge power-law index retrieval error under variable ACRIs, respectively. In addition, the precision of the AOD retrieved with variable ACRI is improved when the AOD product is less than 0.17. However, under the current environment with frequent aerosol particle pollution, the same ACRI for the ten wavelengths can achieve results with equivalent accuracy compared with variable ACRI.

TI  - Elastic scattering spectroscopy for early detection of breast cancer: partially supervised Bayesian image classification of scanned sentinel lymph nodes
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy is a standard diagnosis procedure to determine whether breast cancer has spread to the lymph glands in the armpit (the axillary nodes). The metastatic status of the sentinel node (the first node in the axillary chain that drains the affected breast) is the determining factor in surgery between conservative lumpectomy and more radical mastectomy including axillary node excision. The traditional assessment of the node requires sample preparation and pathologist interpretation. An automated elastic scattering spectroscopy (ESS) scanning device was constructed to take measurements from the entire cut surface of the excised sentinel node and to produce ESS images for cancer diagnosis. Here, we report on a partially supervised image classification scheme employing a Bayesian multivariate, finite mixture model with a Markov random field (MRF) spatial prior. A reduced dimensional space was applied to represent the scanning data of the node by a statistical image, in which normal, metastatic, and nonnodal-tissue pixels are identified. Our results show that our model enables rapid imaging of lymph nodes. It can be used to recognize nonnodal areas automatically at the same time as diagnosing sentinel node metastases with sensitivity and specificity of 85% and 94%, respectively. ESS images can help surgeons by providing a reliable and rapid intraoperative determination of sentinel nodal metastases in breast cancer.

TI  - An improved temporal mixture analysis unmixing method for estimating impervious surface area based on MODIS and DMSP-OLS data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Impervious surface area (ISA) is an important indicator for monitoring the intensity of human activity and ecological environment changes. Developing effective methods for estimation of ISA at different scales has thus been pursued by many scientists. The temporal mixture analysis (TMA), which is a variant of spectral mixture analysis that makes full use of the phenological information of different land cover types, is suitable for estimating the ISA fraction at a large scale. The existing TMA-based ISA fraction estimation methods rely on the assumption that pure pixels exist for all the endmembers, which, however, is not true in the case of coarse-resolution datasets. Moreover, the existing method cannot effectively differentiate bare soil from ISA effectively, which may lead to overestimation of the ISA fraction. To address these problems, we propose a new ISA estimation method based on TMA in this study, using a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) products, the GlobeLand30 product, and the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program-Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) data. The proposed method contains four major steps. First, the MODIS NDVI time-series datasets and GlobeLand30 land cover product were used to create an NDVI temporal profile subset for the TMA model. Second, a preliminary ISA fraction map was derived on the basis of optimized endmember temporal profiles, which were generated by unmixing the selected NDVI temporal profile subset through an improved spatial-spectral preprocessing non-negative matrix factorization algorithm (ISSPP-NMF). Then, the preliminary ISA fraction was further optimized by incorporating the EVI-adjusted night-time light index (EANTLI), which can mitigate both saturation problems and the blooming effect of the DMSP-OLS data. An effective threshold method was introduced in this step to reduce the impact of bare soil on the ISA estimation. Finally, the estimated fraction of ISA was evaluated through accuracy assessment. The proposed method was tested in two study areas, namely, Guangdong Province and the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) of China, to prove its applicability in different regions. Effectiveness of the proposed method was proven through the comparison between the proposed method with traditional TMA-based methods. The results from these analyses indicate that the proposed method outperforms the others in ISA estimation, with an overall root mean square error (RMSE) of 9.2% and a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.8872 in Guangdong and a RMSE of 8.9% and R-2 of 0.8923 in YRD. This study also proves that the ISSPP-NMF method can produce more appropriate endmembers regardless of the existence of pure pixels. The post-processing with the EANLTI procedure can effectively reduce the bare soil effect in TMA-based ISA estimation.

TI  - Alveolar Macrophages in the Resolution of Inflammation, Tissue Repair, and Tolerance to Infection
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Pathogen persistence in the respiratory tract is an important preoccupation, and of particular relevance to infectious diseases such as tuberculosis. The equilibrium between elimination of pathogens and the magnitude of the host response is a sword of Damocles for susceptible patients. The alveolar macrophage is the first sentinel of the respiratory tree and constitutes the dominant immune cell in the steady state. This immune cell is a key player in the balance between defense against pathogens and tolerance toward innocuous stimuli. This review focuses on the role of alveolar macrophages in limiting lung tissue damage from potentially innocuous stimuli and from infections, processes that are relevant to appropriate tolerance of potential causes of lung disease. Notably, the different anti-inflammatory strategies employed by alveolar macrophages and lung tissue damage control are explored. These two properties, in addition to macrophage manipulation by pathogens, are discussed to explain how alveolar macrophages may drive pathogen persistence in the airways.

TI  - Transport, properties, and life cycles of mesoscale eddies in the eastern tropical South Pacific
T2  - OCEAN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The influence of mesoscale eddies on the flow field and the water masses, especially the oxygen distribution of the eastern tropical South Pacific, is investigated from a mooring, float, and satellite data set. Two anticyclonic (ACE1/2), one mode-water (MWE), and one cyclonic eddy (CE) are identified and followed in detail with satellite data on their westward transition with velocities of 3.2 to 6.0 cm s(-1) from their generation region, the shelf of the Peruvian and Chilean upwelling regime, across the Stratus Ocean Reference Station (ORS; similar to 20 degrees S, 85 degrees W) to their decaying region far west in the oligotrophic open ocean. The ORS is located in the transition zone between the oxygen minimum zone and the well oxygenated South Pacific subtropical gyre. Velocity, hydrographic, and oxygen measurements at the mooring show the impact of eddies on the weak flow region of the eastern tropical South Pacific. Strong anomalies are related to the passage of eddies and are not associated with a seasonal signal in the open ocean. The mass transport of the four observed eddies across 85 degrees W is between 1.1 and 1.8 Sv. The eddy type-dependent available heat, salt, and oxygen anomalies are -8.1 x 10(18) J (ACE2), -1.0 x 10(18) J (MWE), and -8.9 x 10(18) J (CE) for heat; -25.2 x 10(10) kg (ACE2), -3.1 x 10(10) kg (MWE), and -41.5 x 10(10) kg (CE) for salt; and -3.6 x 10(16) mu mol (ACE2), -3.5 x 10(16) mu mol (MWE), and -6.5 x 10(16) mu mol (CE) for oxygen showing a strong imbalance between anticyclones and cyclones for salt transports probably due to seasonal variability in water mass properties in the formation region of the eddies. Heat, salt, and oxygen fluxes out of the coastal region across the ORS region in the oligotrophic open South Pacific are estimated based on these eddy anomalies and on eddy statistics (gained out of 23 years of satellite data). Furthermore, four profiling floats were trapped in the ACE2 during its westward propagation between the formation region and the open ocean, which allows for conclusions on lateral mixing of water mass properties with time between the core of the eddy and the surrounding water. The strongest lateral mixing was found between the seasonal thermocline and the eddy core during the first half of the eddy lifetime.

TI  - Spontaneous rupture of abdominal wall after breast reconstruction using deep inferior epigastric perforator flap following mastectomy for breast cancer
T2  - SURGICAL CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The demand for breast reconstruction after mastectomy is rising. The use of deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap in autologous reconstruction is a popular approach. There were some reports about abdominal complications after breast reconstruction. However, there was no report about spontaneous rupture of abdominal wall.Case presentation: A 46-year-old female patient was diagnosed with left breast cancer. Left mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed, and the breast was reconstructed using DIEP flap simultaneously. She suffered heavy abdominal pain and vomiting at postoperative day 4. Computed tomography showed bowel herniation into the subcutaneous tissue caused by left abdominal wall rupture. The abdominal wall was sutured and repaired using mesh by emergency surgery.Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case about spontaneous rupture of abdominal wall after breast reconstruction using DIEP flap to be reported in the English literature. DIEP flap on breast reconstructive surgery may cause spontaneous rupture of abdominal wall.

AB  - Using data from rural monitoring sites across the contiguous United States, we evaluated fine particulate matter (PM2.5) trends for 1988-2016. We calculate trends in the policy-relevant 98th quantile of PM2.5 using Quantile Regression. We use Kriging and Gaussian Geostatistical Simulations to interpolate trends between observed data points. Overall, we found positive trends in 98th quantile PM2.5 at sites within the Northwest United States (average 0.21 +/- 0.12 mu g.m(-3).y(-1); +/- 95% confidence interval). This was in contrast with sites throughout the rest of country, which showed a negative trend in 98th quantile PM2.5, likely due to reductions in anthropogenic emissions (average -0.66 +/- 0.10 mu g.m(-3).y(-1)). The positive trend in 98th quantile PM2.(5) is due to wildfire activity and was supported by positive trends in total carbon and no trend in sulfate across the Northwest. We also evaluated daily moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical depth (AOD) for 2002-2017 throughout the United States to compare with ground-based trends. For both Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) PM2.5 and MODIS AOD datasets, we found positive 98th quantile trends in the Northwest (1.77 +/- 0.68% and 2.12 +/- 0.81% per year, respectively) through 2016. The trend in Northwest AOD is even greater if data for the high-fire year of 2017 are included. These results indicate a decrease in PM2.5 over most of the country but a positive trend in the 98th quantile PM2.5 across the Northwest due to wildfires.

TI  - GF-1 and Landsat observed a 40-year wetland spatiotemporal variation and its coupled environmental factors in Yangtze River estuary
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are health indicators of aquatic ecosystems and also vulnerable to regional environmental and socioeconomic changes. For exploring wetland spatiotemporal variations in estuarine and coastal regions of the Yangtze River, we extracted wetland information from 40-year time-series images of Landsat, GF-1, and other satellites, using the classification method of decision tree. Potential environmental and socio-economic factors which may drive wetland variations were analyzed. Results show that the wetland area in Yangtze River estuary has increased 663 km(2), but it was only contributed by the increasing of human-made wetlands (767 km(2)), which were mostly caused by economic growth and constructions of human-made hydro-projects in Yangtze Delta. In comparison, natural wetlands, such as tidal flats and marshes, have decreased 163 km(2). Land reclamation has changed these natural wetlands into reservoirs, aquaculture ponds and paddy fields. Wetlands in Shanghai and Qidong urban regions were mainly affected by human activities, while wetland variations in Chongming Island were mainly controlled by natural factors such as the upstream discharge, precipitation, diurnal variation of tidal level and long-term sea level rising. The general trend is that the natural wetland was transformed into the human-made wetland, and the human-made wetland was transformed into construction land.

TI  - Long-term variability in vegetation productivity in relation to rainfall, herbivory and fire in Tswalu Kalahari Reserve
T2  - KOEDOE
M3  - Article
AB  - Exploring the long-term influence of climate and land use on vegetation change allows for a more robust understanding of how vegetation is likely to respond in the future. To inform management, this study investigated the relationship between vegetation productivity trends and potential drivers of change in the 110 000 ha of the Tswalu Kalahari Reserve between 2000 and 2015, using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI, MOD13Q1). Spatio-temporal variability of the EVI was mapped and then related to the historical records of precipitation, animal numbers and fire occurrences. Long-term trends in productivity were analysed by residual trend analysis (RESTREND). Significantly different EVI profiles were found between vegetation types, and this was related to the structure and function of the vegetation, as well as the effects of soil reflectance. The EVI time-series signalled spatial and temporal heterogeneity in plant productivity, which was strongly correlated with rainfall, although fire and especially herbivory had noteworthy localised effects on productivity. The RESTREND identified a significant positive trend in plant productivity in shrub-dominated vegetation types, providing evidence for the ongoing thickening of woody species. Significant negative trends in productivity were associated with artificial water points and more heavily stocked areas, leading to degradation.Conservation implications: The southern Kalahari has a highly variable rainfall regime, which is tied to a dynamic vegetation response. This variability should be taken into account when making management decisions. Field-based monitoring together with adaptive management approaches are needed in the face of an uncertain future in which significant warming is expected.

TI  - Assessing changes of mangrove forest in a coastal region of southeast China using multi-temporal satellite images
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves provide many ecological, economic, and social benefits to humans. In the Jiulong River Estuary of Fujian Province, China, many mangroves have been lost largely due to human activities and so artificial planting has been implemented. However, the spatial and temporal dynamics of mangrove forests are still largely unknown at this location. This study aimed to identify changes to mangrove distribution and aboveground biomass (AGB) in three periods (1995-2004, 2004-2014 and 1995-2014) in order to influence mangrove management. Landsat satellite imagery and the threshold value method were used to classify mangroves. Landsat satellite imagery, field-based biomass investigations, elevation data and an allometric biomass equation were employed to develop an AGB model using a multiple linear regression method. Both mangrove area and AGB increased from 1995 to 2014 with an increase rate of 5.5% and 7.2% for mangrove area and AGB, respectively. Mangrove expansion was the main cause for AGB and area increase. In addition, AGB increase due to the growth of mangroves without extending the area also has great potential in AGB increase. Similar to AGB, above-ground carbon increased from 57 t C/ha in 1995 to 79 t C/ha in 2014, which demonstrated that mangroves in this region can help to mitigate climate warming. However, a large-scale continuous decrease of mangrove forest in the JRE was observed, likely caused by growing human activities. Moreover, tidal range change during 2004-2014 resulted in a more adverse impact on mangroves.

TI  - Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) sentinel surveillance in the country of Georgia, 2015-2017
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundSevere Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) causes substantial mortality and morbidity worldwide. The country of Georgia conducts sentinel surveillance to monitor SARI activity and changes in its infectious etiology. This study characterizes the epidemiology of SARI in Georgia over the 2015/16 and 2016/17 influenza seasons, compares clinical presentations by etiology, and estimates influenza vaccine effectiveness using a test-negative design.MethodsSARI cases were selected through alternate day systematic sampling between September 2015 and March 2017 at five sentinel surveillance inpatient sites. Nasopharyngeal swabs were tested for respiratory viruses and Mycoplasma pneumoniae using a multiplex diagnostic system. We present SARI case frequencies by demographic characteristics, co-morbidities, and clinical presentation, and used logistic regression to estimate influenza A vaccine effectiveness.Results1,624 patients with SARI were identified. More cases occurred in February (28.7%; 466/1624) than other months. Influenza was the dominant pathogen in December-February, respiratory syncytial virus in March-May, and rhinovirus in June-November. Serious clinical symptoms including breathing difficulties, ICU hospitalization, and artificial ventilation were common among influenza A and human metapneumovirus cases. For influenza A/H3, a protective association between vaccination and disease status was observed when cases with unknown vaccination status were combined with those who were unvaccinated (OR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.30, 0.97).ConclusionsMulti-pathogen diagnostic testing through Georgia's sentinel surveillance provides useful information on etiology, seasonality, and demographic associations. Influenza A and B were associated with more severe outcomes, although the majority of the population studied was unvaccinated. Findings from sentinel surveillance can assist in prevention planning.

AB  - The present study was aimed at determining cell and tissue-level biomarkers and histopathological alterations in the green garden snail, Cantareus apertus (Born, 1778), exposed to different nominal dietary concentrations of Pb (25, 100 and 2500 mg Pb/kg), Cd (5, 10 and 100 mg Cd/Kg) and their combination (25 mg Pb + 5 mg Cd/Kg, 100 mg Pb + 10 mg Cd/Kg and 2500 mg Pb + 100 mg Cd/kg) for 1 and 8 weeks. Lead and Cd exerted histopathological effects on the digestive gland in a dose-dependent manner and related to lysosomal and tissue-level biomarkers. The biological responses observed included digestive cell vacuolisation and numerical atrophy, calcium cell hydropic degeneration, excretory cell hypertrophy, inflammatory responses, blood vessel congestion, and disruption of the blood vessel wall and the interstitial connective tissue. Lysosomal enlargement and transient intracellular accumulation of neutral lipids and lipofuscins were also observed, together with alterations in the cell type composition and thinning of the digestive gland epithelium and with diverticular distortion. This response profile fits well with the biological effects reported after metal exposure in gastropods from other regions, as well as with data obtained in parallel studies dealing with metal bioaccumulation and intralysosomal accumulation, mortality, feeding, growth, oxidative stress and neurotoxicity exerted elicited by Pb, Cd and their mixture in green garden snails under the present experimental conditions. Consequently, C. apertus seems to be a suitable model species for the biomarker-based assessment of the biological effects of Pb and Cd, alone or in combinations, thus providing a challenging opportunity to advance in identifying suitable sentinel species for metal pollution biomonitoring and ecosystem health assessment in soil ecosystems in Northern Africa.

TI  - Hybrid forward-selection method-based water-quality estimation via combining Landsat TM, ETM<SUP>+</SUP>, and OLI/TIRS images and ancillary environmental data
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - A simple approach to enable water-management agencies employing free data to create a single set of water quality predictive equations with satisfactory accuracy is proposed. Multiple regression-derived equations based on surface reflectance, band ratios, and environmental factors as predictor variables for concentrations of Total Suspended Solids (TSS) and Total Nitrogen (TN) were derived using a hybrid forward-selection method that considers both p-value and Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) in the forward-selection process. Landsat TM, ETM+, and OLI/TIRS images were jointly utilized with environmental factors, such as wind speed and water surface temperature, to derive the single set of equations. Through splitting data into calibration and validation groups, the coefficients of determination are 0.73 for TSS calibration and 0.70 for TSS validation, respectively. The coefficients of determination for TN calibration and validation are 0.64 and 0.37, respectively. Among all chosen predictor variables, ratio of reflectance of visible red (Band 3 for Landsat TM and ETM+, or Band 4 for Landsat OLI/TIRS) to visible blue (Band 1 for Landsat TM and ETM+, or Band 2 for Landsat OLI/TIRS) has a strong influence on the predictive power for TSS retrieval. Environmental factors including wind speed, remote sensing-derived water surface temperature, and time difference (in days) between the image acquisition and water sampling were found to be important in water-quality quantity estimation. The hybrid forward-selection method consistently yielded higher validation accuracy than that of the conventional forward-selection approach.

TI  - Geodetic Constraints of the 2017 M<sub>w</sub>7.3 Sarpol Zahab, Iran Earthquake, and Its Implications on the Structure and Mechanics of the Northwest Zagros Thrust-Fold Belt
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We reveal transient surface deformation following the 2017 M(w)7.3 Sarpol Zahab (Iran) earthquake using Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) measurements. Based on the coseismic interferograms derived from the Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2) data, the preferred slip model of the earthquake has a centroid depth of 14.5 +/- 4 km and suggests that a basement fault is most likely responsible for the 2017 earthquake in the northwest Zagros fold-thrust belt zone. Two slip asperities with a maximum slip of 6 m separated by 16 km are observed in the best fitting slip model. The accumulated afterslip in the first month after the mainshock determined from the Sentinel-1 postseismic interferograms reveals a slip distribution that lies immediately updip of the coseismic slip, implying that frictional properties of the fault vary along the rupture patch. The Bamo Mount in the earthquake area was uplifted by approximately 1m during the earthquake. We suggest that local topographic growth from both seismic and aseismic faulting behaviors is common within the Zagros fold-thrust belt zone based on our findings regarding the 2017 earthquake and other significant events in the region.

TI  - Coastal Sulfur Plumes off Peru During El Nino, La Nina, and Neutral Phases
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - For the first time, the impact of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on the surface sulfur plumes off the Peruvian upwelling system has been studied. The investigations demonstrated a strong correlation between the ENSO and the sulfur plumes in the coastal areas of Callao and Pisco. During the El Nino phases, the sulfur plumes disappeared almost completely because of equatorial remotely forced oxygenation episodes. The La Nina events were associated with strong oxygen deficiency over the Peruvian shelf, supporting the formation of hydrogen sulfide and, consequently, the occurrence of sulfur plumes. This impact was smaller at Callao, because the La Nina phases in this coastal area were interrupted by weak oxygenation events. During the neutral phases, oxygen-poor waters were also present in the Peruvian shelf areas, promoting the large size of sulfur plumes. However, they were not forced by the remotely driven processes resulting from ENSO phenomena.Plain Language Summary In the Peruvian coastal area, hydrogen sulfide outbreaks and their resulting coastal sulfur plumes influence the marine ecosystem and the fishing industry by their toxic properties. The relation between the sulfur plumes and the well-known El Nino and La Nina events was investigated. The sulfur plumes were detected in remotely sensed satellite data through their characteristic milky turquoise discoloration. The results demonstrated a strong correlation of the El Nino and La Nina events with the coastal sulfur plumes as well as their dependence on the oxygen supply in the Peruvian shelf area.

TI  - Evaluation of the performance of Suomi-NPP OMPS nadir mapper products using station measurements and OMI data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing technology provides the only viable means for global monitoring of atmosphere systems, such as ozone. The ozone mapping and profiler suite (OMPS) onboard Suomi-NPP satellite, which was launched in the year 2011, has a primary purpose of measuring ozone. Suomi-NPP has been on operation for more than 3 years, and it is crucial to keep the satellite data precise and trusted. By using 17 months of satellite and ground-based total ozone column (TOC) data, this study performs an evaluation of OMPS products. Ozone monitoring instrument (OMI) data generated from a similar satellite instrument were also used to compare with the OMPS TOC data, and both the TOC products were generated using TOMS version 8.5 (TOMS-V8.5) algorithm. The evaluation consists of intercomparisons with groundbased Brewer measurements, similar satellite instruments, and accuracy analysis as a function of time and solar zenith angle. Results show that after 3 years of operation, OMPS-derived TOC data still have good correlation (R-2 > 0.99, RMSE = 1.51%) with ground-based measurements. The results also give some evidence that the OMPS TOC data have better accuracy than those from OMI using the same algorithm. (c) 2018 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Solar-Induced Fluorescence Detects Interannual Variation in Gross Primary Production of Coniferous Forests in the Western United States
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying gross primary production (GPP), the largest flux of the terrestrial carbon cycle, remains difficult at the landscape scale. Evergreen needleleaf (coniferous) forests in the western United States constitute an important carbon reservoir whose annual GPP varies from year-to-year due to drought, mortality, and other ecosystem disturbances. Evergreen forest productivity is challenging to determine via traditional remote sensing indices (i.e., NDVI and EVI), because detecting environmental stress conditions is difficult. We investigated the utility of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) to detect year-to-year variation in GPP in four coniferous forests varying in species composition in the western United States (Sierra Nevada, Cascade, and Rocky Mountains). We show that annually averaged, satellite-based observations of SIF (retrieved from GOME-2) were significantly correlated with annual GPP observed at eddy covariance towers over several years. Further, SIF responded quantitatively to drought-induced mortality, suggesting that SIF may be capable of detecting ecosystem disturbance in coniferous forests.Plain Language Summary Understanding and quantifying how the productivity of coniferous forests responds to environmental change (e.g., drought and bark beetle-induced mortality) is important for the western United States, as these forests dominate the montane landscape. Often, carbon uptake by plants is tracked by measuring changes in light reflected from leaves, but these methods have proven problematic for evergreen forests. A new means of studying carbon uptake using solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (light emitted, rather than reflected, from sunlit leaves) is promising to study photosynthesis at the regional to global scales. We show that solar-induced fluorescence better tracks interannual variation of conifer productivity than reflectance-based methods. Further, we demonstrate that solar-induced fluorescence captures decreasing productivity associated with drought-induced forest mortality.

TI  - Headache in transient ischemic attacks
T2  - JOURNAL OF HEADACHE AND PAIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Headache is a common feature in acute cerebrovascular disease but no studies have evaluated the prevalence of specific headache types in patients with transient ischemic attacks (TIA). The purpose of the present study was to analyze all headaches within the last year and the last week before TIA and at the time of TIA.Methods: Eligible patients with TIA (n = 120, mean age 56.1, females 55%) had focal brain or retinal ischemia with resolution of symptoms within 24 h without presence of new infarction on MRI with DWI (n = 112) or CT (n = 8). All patients were evaluated within one day of admission by a single neurologist. As a control group we used patients (n = 192, mean age 58.7, females 64%) admitted with diagnoses "lumbago", "lumbar spine osteochondrosis" or "gastrointestinal ulcer".Results: One-year prevalence of migraine without aura was significantly higher in TIA patients than in controls: 20.8% and 7.8% respectively (p = 0.002, OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.6-6.2). 22 patients (18.3%) had sentinel or warning headache within the last week before TIA. At the time of TIA a new type of headache was observed in 16 patients (13.3%). No controls had a new type of headache. 12 of these 16 patients had migraine-like headache, 8 patients had tension-type-like headache and one patient thunderclap headache. Posterior circulation TIA was associated with headaches within last week before TIA and at the time of TIA much more frequently than anterior circulation TIA.Conclusions: The one year prevalence of migraine was significantly higher in TIA patients than in controls and so was the prevalence of headache within the last week before TIA and at the time of TIA. A previous headache that worsens and a new type of headache can be a warning of impending TIA.

TI  - Is There a Change From a Warm-Dry to a Warm-Wet Climate in the Inland River Area of China? Interpretation and Analysis Through Surface Water Balance
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Inland River Area of China (IRAC), being the most water-stressed region in the world, faced with increasingly severe ecological degradation risk and water shortage issue under global climate warming. Previous studies indicated that the climate of IRAC have changed from warm-dry to warm-wet, because both precipitation (P) and air temperature have increased. However, the analysis in this study, considering the effects of climate change on hydrologic cycle rather than simply on climate conditions, indicates that there has been no substantial change from a warm-dry to a warm-wet climate in the IRAC during 1948-2010. The Standardized Moisture Anomaly Index (SZI), which is a comprehensive multiscalar drought indicator, was used to identify the patterns of dry and wet weather. The Global Land Data Assimilation System 2 (GLDAS2) Noah model, based on advanced land surface modeling and data assimilation techniques, were used to provide input surface water-energy variables for calculating SZI. The results show that both the forcing data and the output of the GLDAS2 Noah model are in good agreement with different types of observations. The variabilities in SZI are more consistent with evidence of multiple droughts (including residual water/energy ratio, evapotranspiration deficit, and historical drought records) than the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). Based on SZI, it is known that increases in the water supply (P) are balanced by the increased water demand caused by significant climate warming; that is, terrestrial water storage has generally remained balanced over the past four decades.

TI  - The importance of surface reflectance anisotropy for cloud and NO<sub>2</sub> retrivals from GOME-2 and OMI
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The angular distribution of the light reflected by the Earth's surface influences top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance values. This surface reflectance anisotropy has implications for UV/V is satellite retrievals of albedo, clouds, and trace gases such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2). These retrievals routinely assume the surface to reflect light isotropically. Here we show that cloud fractions retrieved from GOME-2A and OMI with the FRESCO and OMCFDO2 algorithms have an east-west bias of 10 % to 50 %, which are highest over vegetation and forested areas, and that this bias originates from the assumption of isotropic surface reflection. To interpret the across-track bias with the DAK radiative transfer model, we implement the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) from the Ross-Li semi-empirical model. Testing our implementation against state-of-the-art RTMs LIDORT and SCIATRAN, we find that simulated TOA reflectance generally agrees to within 1 %. We replace the assumption of isotropic surface reflection in the equations used to retrieve cloud fractions over forested scenes with scattering kernels and corresponding BRDF parameters from a daily high-resolution database derived from 16 years' worth of MODIS measurements. By doing this, the east-west bias in the simulated cloud fractions largely vanishes. We conclude that across-track biases in cloud fractions can be explained by cloud algorithms that do not adequately account for the effects of surface reflectance anisotropy. The implications for NO2 air mass factor (AMF) calculations are substantial. Under moderately polluted NO2 and backward-scattering conditions, clear-sky AMFs are up to 20 % higher and cloud radiance fractions up to 40% lower if surface anisotropic reflection is accounted for. The combined effect of these changes is that NO2 total AMFs increase by up to 30 % for backward-scattering geometries (and decrease by up to 35 % for forward-scattering geometries), which is stronger than the effect of either contribution alone. In an unpolluted troposphere, surface BRDF effects on cloud fraction counteract (and largely cancel) the effect on the clear-sky AMF. Our results emphasise that surface reflectance anisotropy needs to be taken into account in a coherent manner for more realistic and accurate retrievals of clouds and NO2 from UV/V is satellite sensors. These improvements will be beneficial for current sensors, in particular for the recently launched TROPOMI instrument with a high spatial resolution.

TI  - Dynamic changes of wetland resources based on MODIS and Landsat image data fusion
T2  - EURASIP JOURNAL ON IMAGE AND VIDEO PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Given the seasonal dynamics of wetland ecosystem, limited available data, and technological method of wetland investigation, wetland evaluation cannot be accurately accessed. Although the remote sensing technology has been widely employed on wetland investigation and identification, changeable weather conditions especially cloud interference are the main barrier to acquire clear remote sensing image for wetland identification and information extraction. The combination and precision evaluation of remote sensing data with high temporal-spatial resolution ratio from moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat were conducted using the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM): a comprehensively temporal-spatial reflectance model was built the high-resolution image in the time series and Modified Normalized Difference Water Index were obtained. The main data obstacles in wetland resources monitoring were invalid. The typical wetland areas in Liaoning province of China were evaluated using combination algorithm and Landsat (Thematic Mapper) images. The results show that the MODIS and Landsat data can be combined well with high correlations in different wave ranges. The maximum Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) is 0.9678, followed by green wave (0.9630), near-infrared wave (0.9345), and blue wave (0.9018).The wetland seasonal change of Panjin was examined using the data combination method. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), and vegetation coverage index were extracted from combined images of Panjin from June 2016 to August 2016 and analyzed. Results showed that the NDVI was high in partial water area during the studied period indicating high chlorophyll contents.

TI  - Overview of three influenza seasons in Georgia, 2014-2017
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundInfluenza epidemiological and virologic data from Georgia are limited. We aimed to present Influenza Like Illness (ILI) and Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) surveillance data and characterize influenza viruses circulating in the country over three influenza seasons.MethodsWe analyzed sentinel site ILI and SARI data for the 2014-2017 seasons in Georgia. Patients' samples were screened by real-time RT-PCR and influenza viruses isolated were characterized antigenically by haemagglutination inhibition assay and genetically by sequencing of HA and NA genes.Results32% (397/1248) of ILI and 29% (581/1997) of SARI patients tested were positive for influenza viruses. In 2014-2015 the median week of influenza detection was week 7/2015 with B/Yamagata lineage viruses dominating (79%); in 2015-2016-week 5/2016 was the median with A/H1N1pdm09 viruses prevailing (83%); and in 2016-2017 a bimodal distribution of influenza activity was observed-the first wave was caused by A/H3N2 (55%) with median week 51/2016 and the second by B/Victoria lineage viruses (45%) with median week 9/2017. For ILI, influenza virus detection was highest in children aged 5-14 years while for SARI patients most were aged >15 years and 27 (4.6%) of 581 SARI cases died during the three seasons. Persons aged 30-64 years had the highest risk of fatal outcome, notably those infected with A/H1N1pdm09 (OR 11.41, CI 3.94-33.04, p<0.001). A/H1N1pdm09 viruses analyzed by gene sequencing fell into genetic groups 6B and 6B.1; N H3N2 viruses belonged to genetic subclades 3C.3b, 3C.3a, 3C.2a and 3C.2a1; B/Yamagata lineage viruses were of Glade 3 and B/Victoria lineage viruses fell in clade1A.ConclusionIn Georgia influenza virus activity occurred mainly from December through March in all seasons, with varying peak weeks and predominating viruses. Around one third of ILI/SARI cases were associated with influenza caused by antigenically and genetically distinct influenza viruses over the course of the three seasons.

AB  - A 36-year-old woman visited a local hospital suffering from acute onset dizziness. Brain MRI revealed multiple white matter lesions without gadolinium enhancement in the both hemispheres. Although she began to receive a treatment under a clinical diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, she developed newly emerging brain lesions and was referred to our hospital. Neurological examination detected intention tremor, right-sided dysdiadochokinesis, and gait ataxia. Both blood and cerebrospinal fluid tests were unremarkable but follow-up brain MRIs showed rapidly relapsing and remitting lesions. The first brain biopsy ended up showing non-specific changes but the second biopsy with five months interval confirmed primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). The patient was treated by chemotherapy and showed partial response. It is important to consider sequential brain biopsies if needed because PCNSL may present diverse brain lesions on MRI including non-neoplastic early lesions.

TI  - Characterization and correction of stray light in TROPOMI-SWIR
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The shortwave infrared (SWIR) spectrometer module of the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), on board the ESA Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite, is used to measure atmospheric CO and methane columns. For this purpose, calibrated radiance measurements are needed that are minimally contaminated by instrumental stray light. Therefore, a method has been developed and applied in an on-ground calibration campaign to characterize stray light in detail using a monochromatic quasi-point light source. The dynamic range of the signal was extended to more than 7 orders of magnitude by performing measurements with different exposure times, saturating detector pixels at the longer exposure times. Analysis of the stray light indicates about 4.4 % of the detected light is correctable stray light. An algorithm was then devised and implemented in the operational data processor to correct in-flight SWIR observations in near-real time, based on Van Cittert deconvolution. The stray light is approximated by a far-field kernel independent of position and wavelength and an additional kernel representing the main reflection. Applying this correction significantly reduces the stray-light signal, for example in a simulated dark forest scene close to bright clouds by a factor of about 10. Simulations indicate that this reduces the stray-light error sufficiently for accurate gas-column retrievals. In addition, the instrument contains five SWIR diode lasers that enable long-term, in-flight monitoring of the stray-light distribution.

TI  - Status of desertification in South India - assessment, mapping and change detection analysis
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Desertification is the transformation of productive land into a non-productive one due to poor resource management, and unfavourable biophysical and economical factors. Periodical assessment of desertification status is imperative for a suitable comprehensive and combating plan. In the present study, desertification status maps of Andhra Pradesh (AP), Karnataka and Telangana in South India have been prepared using remote sensing data for two time-frames (2003-2005 and 2011-2013) and change detection analysis has been carried out. The results reveal that 14.35%, 36.24% and 31.40% of the total geographical area in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Telangana were affected by desertification processes respectively, in 2011-2013. Among the desertification processes, vegetal degradation contributes 7.27% of total area in AP, followed by water erosion (4.93%) and waterlogging (0.83%), whereas in Karnataka water erosion (26.29%) is dominant followed by vegetal degradation (8.93%) and salinization (0.45%). Change detection analysis shows that desertification processes of AP and Karnataka have increased by 0.19% and 0.05% respectively, whereas in Telangana it has decreased by about 0.52% from 2003 to 2005 data. The present database will help the scientists, planners and stakeholders to prepare appropriate land reclamation measures to control the increasing trend of desertification.

TI  - Sentinel nurseries to assess the phytosanitary risks from insect pests on importations of live plants
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ornamental plants represent a major pathway of invasion for alien pests worldwide. Commodity risk analyses are carried out to assess the risk posed by a new trade in a commodity, but they are restricted by our limited knowledge of the pests carried by traded plants. We used the sentinel nursery technique to identify insects attacking woody plants imported into Europe. We established two sentinel nurseries in China, with five traded Asian plants. These nurseries were monitored for two years to obtain lists of insects that can be expected on these commodities. These records were compared with those obtained from literature surveys, which are usually the sources of information available to pest risk assessors. At each site, 105 insect species and host associations were found on sentinel plants and 90% of these associations had not been found in a previous literature survey of insect pests of the five plants. Nearly 80% of these associations were not found in an a posteriori literature survey. An assessment classified 9%, 7% and 84% of the insect records as presenting a high, moderate and low likelihood of introduction, respectively. These results show the benefit of sentinel nurseries to identify potential infestation of plant commodity imports.

TI  - Multiresidue determination of pesticides in market honey from northern India using QuEChERS approach and assessment of potential risks to consumers
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Honey has multiple beneficial properties but polluted environments have led to its contamination. Contaminated honey not only serves as a sentinel of environmental pollution, but can also pose potential risks to consumers' health. In the present study, QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe) method along with gas chromatography coupled to selective detectors (ECD/FTD/MS) was used for determining 24 pesticide residues and/or their metabolites in 150 honey samples collected from markets in Northern India. The method was optimized and validated according to the European Commission's guidelines. Residues of pesticides were detected in 12% of samples, of which a majority contained organophosphate residues. Assessment of human health risks suggests that contaminated honey at current levels has minimal contribution to toxicological risks. However, precautionary measures should always be taken considering the customary honey feeding in infants and cumulative effect of these chemicals in the foreseeable future. This study highlights the importance of continuous monitoring of pesticide residues, and consumer awareness towards certified products to safeguard public health.

TI  - Mapping the yearly extent of surface coal mining in Central Appalachia using Landsat and Google Earth Engine
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface mining for coal has taken place in the Central Appalachian region of the United States for well over a century, with a notable increase since the 1970s. Researchers have quantified the ecosystem and health impacts stemming from mining, relying in part on a geospatial dataset defining surface mining's extent at a decadal interval. This dataset, however, does not deliver the temporal resolution necessary to support research that could establish causal links between mining activity and environmental or public health and safety outcomes, nor has it been updated since 2005. Here we use Google Earth Engine and Landsat imagery to map the yearly extent of surface coal mining in Central Appalachia from 1985 through 2015, making our processing models and output data publicly available. We find that 2,900 km(2) of land has been newly mined over this 31-year period. Adding this more-recent mining to surface mines constructed prior to 1985, we calculate a cumulative mining footprint of 5,900 km(2). Over the study period, correlating active mine area with historical surface mine coal production shows that each metric ton of coal is associated with 12 m(2) of actively mined land. Our automated, open-source model can be regularly updated as new surface mining occurs in the region and can be refined to capture mining reclamation activity into the future. We freely and openly offer the data for use in a range of environmental, health, and economic studies; moreover, we demonstrate the capability of using tools like Earth Engine to analyze years of remotely sensed imagery over spatially large areas to quantify land use change.

TI  - Spaceborne synthetic aperture radar signal processing using field-programmable gate arrays
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery requires image reproduction through the successive signal processing of received data before browsing images and extracting information. The received signal data records of ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 are stored in the onboard mission data storage and transmitted to the ground. To compensate for storage usage and transmission data capacity through the mission data communication network, the operation duty of PALSAR-2 is limited. This balance strongly relies on network availability. The observation operations of current spaceborne SAR systems are rigorously planned by simulating the mission data balance, given conflicting user demands. This problem should be solved so that we need not compromise the operations and potential of next-generation spaceborne SAR systems. One of the solutions is to compress the SAR data through onboard image reproduction and information extraction from the reproduced images. This is also beneficial for fast delivery of information products and event-driven observations by constellation. The Emergence Studio (Sohatsu kobo in Japanese) of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency has been developing evaluation models of the image processing system with the field-programmable gate array for onboard SAR image reproduction. The first model called the "Fast L1 Processor (FLIP)" can reproduce a 10-m resolution, single-look complex image (level 1.1) from ALOS/PALSAR raw signal data (level 1.0). FLIP processing speed at 200 MHz results in processing about five times faster than CPU-based computing at 3.7 GHz, corresponding to 50% real-time processing capability for ALOS/PALSAR. The FLIP'S image is almost identical to the image reproduced by 32-bit simulation in MATLAB. (C) 2018 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Development of an enterprise risk inventory for healthcare
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The first phase of an enterprise risk management (ERM) program is the identification of risks. Accurate identification is essential to a proactive and effective ERM function. The authors identified a lack of such risk identification in the literature and in practical cases when interviewing the chief risk officers from healthcare organizations. A risk inventory specific to healthcare organizations that includes detailed risk scenarios and risk impacts currently does not exist. Thus, the objective of this research is to develop an enterprise risk inventory for healthcare organizations to create a common understanding of how each type of risk impacts a healthcare organization.Method: ERM guidelines and data from 15 interviews with chief risk officers were analyzed to create the risk inventory. The identified risks were confirmed through a survey of risk managers from a range of global healthcare organizations during the ASHRM conference in 2017. Descriptive statistics were developed and cluster analysis was performed using the survey results.Results: The risk inventory includes 28 risks and their specific risk scenarios. Cyberattack was ranked as the principal risk by the participants, followed by sentinel events and risks associated with human capital management (organizational culture, use of electronic medical records and physician wellness). The data analysis showed that the specific characteristics of the survey participants, such as the length of time working in risk management, the size of the organization, and the presence of a school of medicine, do not impact an individual's opinion of the importance of the risks identified. A personal background in risk management (clinical or enterprise) was a characteristic that showed a small difference in the perceived importance of the risks from the proposed risk inventory.Conclusions: In addition to defining specific risk scenarios, the enterprise risk inventory presented in this research can contribute to guiding the risk identification phase of an ERM program and thereby support the development of a risk culture. Patient data security in hospitals that operate with high levels of technology is fundamental to delivering high quality and safe care to patients. At the top of the risk ranking, the identification of cyberattacks reflects the importance that healthcare risk managers place on this risk by allocating time and other resources. Exploring opportunities to improve cyber risk management and evaluating the benefits of using the risk inventory at the beginning of the risk identification phase in an ERM program are suggestions for future studies.

TI  - Improving the validation of ecological niche models with remote sensing analysis
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological Niche models (ENMs) are tools that allow us to approximate the area of suitability for a species, thereby allowing elaboration of conservation strategies. The validation of these models in situ is not always possible due to costly access remote areas where conserved species are often found. The goal of our study was to provide a new validation concept for ENMs by applying remote sensing (SR) techniques, such as Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA), which enables mapping of large areas and provides detailed information on land use. To assess the GEOBIA validation technique, we selected the species Bertholletia excelsa (Brazil nut), a tree that has great importance as a non-timber forest product and is considered vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Models were built on the 'biomod2' package, and evaluation was conducted using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and True Skill Statistics (TSS) metrics. Images were obtained from the orbital Operational Land Imager (OLI) on board the Landsat-8 satellite and the thematic maps were evaluated using Kappa and Overall Accuracy Statistics. We calculated vegetation indices (EVI, SAVI, LAI, and NDVI) and applied them to the GEOBIA technique. A total of 693 possible sites of B. excelsa were detected. Of these, 25 accessible sites were used for validation, and 45 new records of B. excelsa were added in the study area. GEOBIA was demonstrated to have high potential for validating ENMs, as well as in the extraction of arboreal species from medium-resolution spatial images.

TI  - African volcanic emissions influencing atmospheric aerosols over the Amazon rain forest
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The long-range transport (LRT) of trace gases and aerosol particles plays an important role for the composition of the Amazonian rain forest atmosphere. Sulfate aerosols originate to a substantial extent from LRT sources and play an important role in the Amazonian atmosphere as strongly light-scattering particles and effective cloud condensation nuclei. The transatlantic transport of volcanic sulfur emissions from Africa has been considered as a source of particulate sulfate in the Amazon; however, direct observations have been lacking so far. This study provides observational evidence for the influence of emissions from the Nyamuragira-Nyiragongo volcanoes in Africa on Amazonian aerosol properties and atmospheric composition during September 2014. Comprehensive ground-based and airborne aerosol measurements together with satellite observations are used to investigate the volcanic event. Under the volcanic influence, hourly mean sulfate mass concentrations in the submicron size range reached up to 3.6 mu gm(3) at the Amazon Tall Tower Observatory, the highest value ever reported in the Amazon region. The substantial sulfate injection increased the aerosol hygroscopicity with kappa values up to 0.36, thus altering aerosol-cloud interactions over the rain forest. Airborne measurements and satellite data indicate that the transatlantic transport of volcanogenic aerosols occurred in two major volcanic plumes with a sulfate-enhanced layer between 4 and 5 km of altitude. This study demonstrates how African aerosol sources, such as volcanic sulfur emissions, can substantially affect the aerosol cycling and atmospheric processes in Amazonia.

TI  - Validation of Breast Cancer Models for Predicting the Nonsentinel Lymph Node Metastasis After a Positive Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in a Chinese Population
T2  - TECHNOLOGY IN CANCER RESEARCH & TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Over the years, completion axillary lymph node dissection is recommended for the patients with breast cancer if sentinel lymph node metastasis is found. However, not all of these patients had nonsentinel lymph node metastasis on final histology. Some predicting models have been developed for calculating the risk of nonsentinel lymph node metastasis. The aim of our study was to validate some of the predicting models in a Chinese population. Method: Two hundred thirty-six patients with positive sentinel lymph node and complete axillary lymph node dissection were included. Patients were applied to 6 models for evaluation of the risk of nonsentinel lymph node involvement. The receiver-operating characteristic curves were shown in our study. The calculation of area under the curves and false negative rate was done for each model to assess the discriminative power of the models. Results: There are 105 (44.5%) patients who had metastatic nonsentinel lymph node(s) in our population. Primary tumor size, the number of metastatic sentinel lymph node, and the proportion of metastatic sentinel lymph nodes/total sentinel lymph nodes were identified as the independent predictors of nonsentinel lymph node metastasis. The Seoul National University Hospital and Louisville scoring system outperformed the others, with area under the curves of 0.706 and 0.702, respectively. The area under the curve values were 0.677, 0.673, 0.432, and 0.674 for the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Tenon, Stanford, and Shanghai Cancer Hospital models, respectively. With adjusted cutoff points, the Louisville scoring system outperformed the others by classifying 26.51% of patients with breast cancer to the low-risk group. Conclusion: The Louisville and Seoul National University Hospital scoring system were found to be more predictive among the 6 models when applied to the Chinese patients with breast cancer in our database. Models developed at other institutions should be used cautiously for decision-making regarding complete axillary lymph node dissection after a positive biopsy in sentinel lymph node.

TI  - Lymphatic filariasis control in Tanzania: infection, disease perceptions and drug uptake patterns in an endemic community after multiple rounds of mass drug administration
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Lymphatic filariasis (LF) control in most countries of sub-Saharan Africa is based on annual mass drug administration (MDA) with a combination of ivermectin and albendazole, in order to interrupt transmission. However, attaining and maintaining high treatment coverage has been a challenge in many LF control programmes. This study was designed to elucidate reasons for continued transmission of LF in an endemic area of Tanga, northeastern Tanzania, where control activities based on MDA had been in place for eight years by the time of this study in 2012.Methods: A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted in three sentinel villages used for monitoring the impact of MDA on LF transmission. A total of 747 individuals were interviewed, out of which 172 (23.0%), 27 (3.6%) and 49 (6.5%) had been shown to have circulating filarial antigens (CFA), microfilaraemia (MF) and LF gross lesions, respectively, prior to the interviews.Results: The interviewed population had a mean age of 33.7 years and a male to female ratio of 0.8. Males, individuals aged 30 years and above, peasants/fishermen and recent immigrants to the study communities were significantly more affected (CFA, MF and/or LF gross lesions) than the other population groups. However, drug uptake rates were not significantly different between LF affected (those with CFA, MF and/or LF gross lesions) and non-affected individuals. Likewise, drug uptake rates were not significantly different across different demographic parameters of the study population, some of which differed significantly in the level of infection. Moreover, it was found that misconceptions on how LF can be acquired were still evident, linking its transmission to witchcraft, heredity and sexual behaviour.Conclusions: The findings indicated that misconceptions about LF and its transmission still existed despite eight years of control activities in the area. Improved communication on the rationale of MDA and an enhanced drug delivery strategy that is adapted to the local settings and targeting important demographic groups that serve as reservoir of infection will help in reaching the elimination target within a reasonable timeframe.

TI  - Parameterizing cloud top effective radii from satellite retrieved values, accounting for vertical photon transport: quantification and correction of the resulting bias in droplet concentration and liquid water path retrievals
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Droplet concentration (N-d) and liquid water path (LWP) retrievals from passive satellite retrievals of cloud optical depth (tau) and effective radius (r(e)) usually assume the model of an idealized cloud in which the liquid water content (LWC) increases linearly between cloud base and cloud top (i.e. at a fixed fraction of the adiabatic LWC). Generally it is assumed that the retrieved r(e) value is that at the top of the cloud. In reality, barring r(e) retrieval biases due to cloud heterogeneity, the retrieved r(e) is representative of smaller values that occur lower down in the cloud due to the vertical penetration of photons at the shortwave-infrared wavelengths used to retrieve r(e). This inconsistency will cause an overestimate of N-d and an underestimate of LWP (referred to here as the "penetration depth bias"), which this paper quantifies via a parameterization of the cloud top r(e) as a function of the retrieved r(e) and tau. Here we estimate the relative r(e) underestimate for a range of idealized modelled adiabatic clouds using bispectral retrievals and plane-parallel radiative transfer. We find a tight relationship between g(re) = r(e)(cloud) (tope)/r(e)(retrieved) and tau and that a 1-D relationship approximates the modelled data well. Using this relationship we find that g(re) values and hence N-d and LWP biases are higher for the 2.1 mu m channel r(e) retrieval (r(e2.1)) compared to the 3.7 mu m one (r(e3.7)). The theoretical bias in the retrieved N-d is very large for optically thin clouds, but rapidly reduces as cloud thickness increases. However, it remains above 20% for tau < 19 : 8 and tau < 7 , 7 for r(e2.1) and r(e3.7), respectively. We also provide a parameterization of penetration depth in terms of the optical depth below cloud top (d tau) for which the retrieved r(e) is likely to be representative.The magnitude of the N-d and LWP biases for climatological data sets is estimated globally using 1 year of daily MODIS (MODerate Imaging Spectroradiometer) data. Screening criteria are applied that are consistent with those required to help ensure accurate N-d and LWP retrievals. The results show that the SE Atlantic, SE Pacific and Californian stratocumulus regions produce fairly large overestimates due to the penetration depth bias with mean biases of 32-35% for r(e2.1) and 15-17% for r(e3.7). For the other stratocumulus regions examined the errors are smaller (24-28% for r(e2.1) and 10-12% for r(e3.7)). Significant time variability in the percentage errors is also found with regional mean standard deviations of 19-37% of the regional mean percentage error for r(e2.1) and 32-56% for r(e3.7). This shows that it is important to apply a daily correction to N-d for the penetration depth error rather than a time-mean correction when examining daily data. We also examine the seasonal variation of the bias and find that the biases in the SE Atlantic, SE Pacific and Californian stratocumulus regions exhibit the most seasonality, with the largest errors occurring in the December, January and February (DJF) season. LWP biases are smaller in magnitude than those for Nd (8 to 11% for r(e2.1) and 3 : 6 to 6 : 1% for r(e3.7)).In reality, and especially for more heterogeneous clouds, the vertical penetration error will be combined with a number of other errors that affect both the r(e) and tau, which are potentially larger and may compensate or enhance the bias due to vertical penetration depth. Therefore caution is required when applying the bias corrections; we suggest that they are only used for more homogeneous clouds.

A1  - Indian Intussusception Surveil
TI  - Safety monitoring of ROTAVAC vaccine and etiological investigation of intussusception in India: study protocol
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: ROTAVAC, an indigenous rotavirus vaccine, was introduced in the universal immunization program of India in four states in 2016 and expanded to five more states in 2017. The clinical trial on efficacy of ROTAVAC did not detect an increased risk of intussusception, but the trial was not large enough to detect a small risk. This protocol paper describes the establishment and implementation of a surveillance system to monitor the safety of rotavirus vaccine and investigate the potential infectious etiologies of intussusception.Methods: This is a multi-centric hospital-based active surveillance being conducted at 28 hospitals in nine states of India. Data gathered from surveillance will be used to assess the risk of intussusception after ROTAVAC administration and to determine the infectious etiologies of intussusception. For safety assessment of ROTAVAC vaccine, children aged less than two years with intussusception admitted at the sentinel hospitals are enrolled into surveillance, a case report form completed, and a copy of the vaccination card obtained. The risk of intussusception following rotavirus vaccination will be assessed using a self-controlled case-series design. The investigation for potential infectious etiologies of intussusception is through a matched case-control design. Children enrolled for the safety assessment serve as cases and for each case, an age, gender and location matched control is enrolled within 30 days of case enrollment. Stool specimens are obtained from cases and controls. All forms and specimens are sent to the referral laboratory for data entry, analysis, multiplexed molecular testing, and storage.Discussion: Anticipated public health benefits of this surveillance include the generation of information useful to national government on safety of vaccine and to make future decisions on vaccine use through risk-benefit analysis. Investigating infectious agents may help to determine the potential infectious etiologies of intussusception.

TI  - Human influence on the seasonal cycle of tropospheric temperature
T2  - SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - We provide scientific evidence that a human-caused signal in the seasonal cycle of tropospheric temperature has emerged from the background noise of natural variability. Satellite data and the anthropogenic "fingerprint" predicted by climate models show common large-scale changes in geographical patterns of seasonal cycle amplitude. These common features include increases in amplitude at mid-latitudes in both hemispheres, amplitude decreases at high latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere, and small changes in the tropics. Simple physical mechanisms explain these features. The model fingerprint of seasonal cycle changes is identifiable with high statistical confidence in five out of six satellite temperature datasets. Our results suggest that attribution studies with the changing seasonal cycle provide powerful evidence for a significant human effect on Earth's climate.

TI  - Correlative Detection of Isolated Single and Multi-Cellular Calcifications in the Internal Elastic Lamina of Human Coronary Artery Samples
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Histopathology protocols often require sectioning and processing of numerous microscopy slides to survey a sample. Trade-offs between workload and sampling density means that small features can be missed. Aiming to reduce the workload of routine histology protocols and the concern over missed pathology in skipped sections, we developed a prototype x-ray tomographic scanner dedicated to rapid scouting and identification of regions of interest in pathology specimens, thereby allowing targeted histopathology analysis to replace blanket searches. In coronary artery samples of a deceased HIV patient, the scanner, called Tomopath, obtained depth-resolved cross-sectional images at 15 mu m resolution in a 15-minute scan, which guided the subsequent histological sectioning and microscopy. When compared to a commercial tabletop micro-CT scanner, the prototype provided several-fold contrast-to-noise ratio in 1/11th the scan time. Correlated tomographic and histological images revealed two types of micro calcifications: scattered loose calcifications typically found in atherosclerotic lesions; isolated focal calcifications in one or several cells in the internal elastic lamina and occasionally in the tunica media, which we speculate were the initiation of medial calcification linked to kidney disease, but rarely detected at this early stage due to their similarity to particle contaminants introduced during histological processing, if not for the evidence from the tomography scan prior to sectioning. Thus, in addition to its utility as a scouting tool, in this study it provided complementary information to histological microscopy. Overall, the prototype scanner represents a step toward a dedicated scouting and complementary imaging tool for routine use in pathology labs.

TI  - Kruskal's algorithm combined to multinet Bayesian network classifier for mapping Algiers urban areas using ALSAT2-A imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Bayesian network classifiers (BNCs) are now among the most used supervised probabilistic methods for remote sensing image classification. Our contribution lies in two principal points. First, the investigation of the applicability of Kruskal's algorithm constructs the optimal tree structure of multinet Bayeisan network classifier (MBNC). Second, the focus on MBNC's advantages is over other classical BNCs, such as naive Bayes classifier (NBC), tree augmented naive Bayes classifier (TANC), forest augmented naive Bayes classifier (FANC), and state-of-the art competitor classifiers such as maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) and support vector machine (SVM) classifier. While classical BNCs have a mere network for all predefined classes, MBNC has as many local Bayesian networks as the predefined classes. Hence, through a statistical evaluation and a visual inspection, our objective is to emphasize the contribution of MBNC to enhance the accuracy of urban land cover map obtained by classification of remotely sensed image. Performances of developed BNCs (NBC, TANC, FANC, and MBNC) are experimentally assessed using a multispectral image acquired on July 12, 2010, by Alsat-2A Algerian satellite. Based on a confusion matrix, overall accuracy, and Kappa statistic, results indicate that MBNC largely outperforms classical BNCs (NBC, TANC, and FANC) and probabilistic MLC, but performs slightly better than an SVM classifier. Due to its specific-class local network, MBNC gives a powerful tool for a better discrimination between different correlated spectral classes.

TI  - Genetic variants in <i>SEC16B</i> are associated with body composition in black South Africans
T2  - NUTRITION & DIABETES
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The latest genome-wide association studies of obesity-related traits have identified several genetic loci contributing to body composition (BC). These findings have not been robustly replicated in African populations, therefore, this study aimed to assess whether European BC-associated gene loci played a similar role in a South African black population.Methods: A replication and fine-mapping study was performed in participants from the Birth to Twenty cohort (N = 1,926) using the Metabochip. Measurements included body mass index (BMI), waist and hip circumference, waist to-hip ratio (WHR), total fat mass, total lean mass and percentage fat mass (PFM).Results: SNPs in several gene loci, including SEC16B (P-adj < 9.48 x 10(-7)), NEGR1 (P-adj < 1.64 x 10(-6)), FTO (P-adj < 2.91 x 10(-5)), TMEM18 (P-adj < 2.27 x 10(-5)), and WARS2 (P-adj < 3.25 x 10(-5)) were similarly associated (albeit not at array-wide signficance (P <= 6.7 x 10(-7)) with various phenotypes including fat mass, PFM, WHR linked to BC in this African cohort, however the associations were driven by different sentinel SNPs. More importantly, DXA-derived BC measures revealed stronger genetic associations than simple anthropometric measures. Association signals generated in this study were shared by European and African populations, as well as unique to this African cohort. Moreover, sophisticated estimates like DXA measures enabled an enhanced characterisation of genetic associations for BC traits.Conclusion: Results from this study suggest that in-depth genomic studies in larger African cohorts may reveal novel SNPs for body composition and adiposity, which will provide greater insight into the aetiology of obesity.

TI  - Advantages of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry for landscape analysis compared with satellite data: A case study of postmining sites in Indonesia
T2  - COGENT GEOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents the advantages of detailed landscape analysis by UAV (drone hereafter) photogrammetry compared with satellite remote sensing data. First, satellite data are used for generating a coarse-scale land use/land-cover (LULC) map of the study region using conventional GIS techniques. The Advanced Land Observation Satellite-2 (ALOS-2) Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (PALSAR-2) L-Band backscattering data are processed with a multilayer perceptron (MLP) supervised classification for generating a categorical map. The satellite-derived classification map resulted in eight general land-cover types with a ground resolution of 7.5 m, providing a moderate-resolution representation of the island landscapes. Second, the drone's image data are used to collect ground survey information and microscale information of the local site by implementing a structure from motion (SfM) technique to develop mosaicked orthorectified images of the sites. The orthophoto and digital surface model (DSM) derived from the drone-based data had resolutions of 0.05 m and 0.1 m, respectively. The SAR-based LULC map showed an overall accuracy of 78.1%, and the drone-based LULC map had an overall average accuracy of 92.3%. The subset area of the SAR map was compared with the drone-based map and showed average Kappa statistics of 0.375, demonstrating that satellite data cause challenges in correctly delineating the local land environment. The terrain information generated by the SfM method provided a good representation of the topography showing the drastic changes in the environment. The results indicate the usefulness of drone-based landscape analysis for future land-use planning at a local village scale.

TI  - Circumpolar patterns of potential mean annual ground temperature based on surface state obtained from microwave satellite data
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Gap filling is required for temporally and spatially consistent records of land surface temperature from satellite data due to clouds or snow cover. Land surface state, frozen versus unfrozen conditions, can be, however, captured globally with satellite data obtained by microwave sensors. The number of frozen days per year has been previously proposed to be used for permafrost extent determination. This suggests an underlying relationship between number of frozen days and mean annual ground temperature (MAGT). We tested this hypothesis for the Northern Hemisphere north of 50 degrees N using coarse-spatial-resolution microwave satellite data (Metop Advanced SCATterometer - ASCAT - and Special Sensor Microwave Imager - SSM/I; 12.5 and 25 km nominal resolution; 2007-2012), which provide the necessary temporal sampling. The MAGT from GTN-P (Global Terrestrial Network for Permafrost) borehole records at the coldest sensor depth was tested for validity in order to build a comprehensive in situ data set for calibration and validation and was eventually applied. Results are discussed with respect to snow water equivalent, soil properties, land cover and permafrost type. The obtained temperature maps were classified for permafrost extent and compared to alternative approaches.An R-2 of 0.99 was found for correlation between and MAGT at zero annual amplitude provided in GTN-P meta-data and MAGT at the coldest sensor depth. The latter could be obtained with an RMSE of 2.2 degrees C from ASCAT and 2.5 degrees C from SSM/I surface state records using a linear model. The average deviation within the validation period is less than 1 degrees C at locations without glaciers and coastlines within the resolution cell in the case of ASCAT. The exclusion of snow melt days (available for ASCAT) led to better results. This suggests that soil warming under wet snow cover needs to be accounted for in this context. Specifically Scandinavia and western Russia are affected. In addition, MAGT at the coldest sensor depth was overestimated in areas with a certain amount of organic material and in areas of cold permafrost. The derived permafrost extent differed between the used data sets and methods. Deviations are high in central Siberia, for example. We show that microwave-satellite-derived surface state records can provide an estimation of not only permafrost extent but also MAGT without the need for gap filling. This applies specifically to ASCAT. The deviations among the tested data sets, their spatial patterns as well as in relation to environmental conditions, revealed areas which need special attention for modelling of MAGT.

TI  - The advantages of using drones over space-borne imagery in the mapping of mangrove forests
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite data and aerial photos have proved to be useful in efficient conservation and management of mangrove ecosystems. However, there have been only very few attempts to demonstrate the ability of drone images, and none so far to observe vegetation (specieslevel) mapping. The present study compares the utility of drone images (DJI-Phantom-2 with SJ4000 RGB and IR cameras, spatial resolution: 5cm) and satellite images (Pleiades-1B, spatial resolution: 50cm) for mangrove mapping-specifically in terms of image quality, efficiency and classification accuracy, at the Setiu Wetland in Malaysia. Both object- and pixel-based classification approaches were tested (QGIS v.2.12.3 with Orfeo Toolbox). The object-based classification (using a manual rule-set algorithm) of drone imagery with dominant land-cover features (i.e. water, land, Avicennia alba, Nypa fruticans, Rhizophora apiculata and Casuarina equisetifolia) provided the highest accuracy (overall accuracy (OA): 94.0 +/- 0.5% and specific producer accuracy (SPA): 97.0 +/- 9.3%) as compared to the Pleiades imagery (OA: 72.2 +/- 2.7% and SPA: 51.9 +/- 22.7%). In addition, the pixel-based classification (using a maximum likelihood algorithm) of drone imagery provided better accuracy (OA: 90.0 +/- 1.9% and SPA: 87.2 +/- 5.1%) compared to the Pleiades (OA: 82.8 +/- 3.5% and SPA: 80.4 +/- 14.3%). Nevertheless, the drone provided higher temporal resolution images, even on cloudy days, an exceptional benefit when working in a humid tropical climate. In terms of the user-costs, drone costs are much higher, but this becomes advantageous over satellite data for long-term monitoring of a small area. Due to the large data size of the drone imagery, its processing time was about ten times greater than that of the satellite image, and varied according to the various image processing techniques employed (in pixel-based classification, drone >50 hours, Pleiades <5 hours), constituting the main disadvantage of UAV remote sensing. However, the mangrove mapping based on the drone aerial photos provided unprecedented results for Setiu, and was proven to be a viable alternative to satellite-based monitoring/management of these ecosystems. The improvements of drone technology will help to make drone use even more competitive in the future.

TI  - The impacts of recent drought on fire, forest loss, and regional smoke emissions in lowland Bolivia
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In the southern Amazon relationships have been established among drought, human activities that cause forest loss, fire, and smoke emissions. We explore the impacts of recent drought on fire, forest loss, and atmospheric visibility in lowland Bolivia. To assess human influence on fire, we consider climate, fire, and vegetation dynamics in an area largely excluded from human activities since 1979, Noel Kempff Mercado National Park (NK) in northeastern Bolivia. We use data from five sources: the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Collection 6 active fire product (2001-2015) (MODIS C6), Global Fire WEather Database (GFWED) data (1982-2015), MODIS land cover data (2001-2010), MODIS forest loss data (2000-2012), and the regional extinction coefficient for the southwestern Amazon (i.e., B-ext), which is derived from horizontal visibility data from surface stations at the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) level (1973-2015). The B-ext is affected by smoke and acts as a proxy for visibility and regional fire emissions. In lowland Bolivia from 2001 to 2015, interannual Drought Code (DC) variability was linked to fire activity, while from 1982 to 2015, interannual DC variability was linked to B-ext. From 2001 to 2015, the B-ext and MODIS C6 active fire data for lowland Bolivia captured fire seasonality, and covaried between low-and high-fire years. Consistent with previous studies, our results suggest B-ext can be used as a longer-term proxy of regional fire emissions in southwestern Amazonia. Overall, our study found drought conditions were the dominant control on interannual fire variability in lowland Bolivia, and fires within NK were limited to the Cerrado and seasonally inundated wetland biomes. Our results suggest lowland Bolivian tropical forests were susceptible to human activities that may have amplified fire during drought. Human activities and drought need to be considered in future projections of southern Amazonian fire, in regard to carbon emissions and global climate.

TI  - Correction of CCI cloud data over the Swiss Alps using ground-based radiation measurements
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The validation of long-term cloud data sets retrieved from satellites is challenging due to their worldwide coverage going back as far as the 1980s. A trustworthy reference cannot be found easily at every location and every time. Mountainous regions present a particular problem since ground-based measurements are sparse. Moreover, as retrievals from passive satellite radiometers are difficult in winter due to the presence of snow on the ground, it is particularly important to develop new ways to evaluate and to correct satellite data sets over elevated areas.In winter for ground levels above 1000m (a.s.l.) in Switzerland, the cloud occurrence of the newly released cloud property data sets of the ESA Climate Change Initiative Cloud_cci Project (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer afternoon series (AVHRR-PM) and Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua series) is 132 to 217% that of surface synoptic (SYNOP) observations, corresponding to a rate of false cloud detections between 24 and 54 %. Furthermore, the overestimations increase with the altitude of the sites and are associated with particular retrieved cloud properties.In this study, a novel post-processing approach is proposed to reduce the amount of false cloud detections in the satellite data sets. A combination of ground-based downwelling longwave and shortwave radiation and temperature measurements is used to provide independent validation of the cloud cover over 41 locations in Switzerland. An agreement of 85% is obtained when the cloud cover is compared to surface synoptic observations (90% within +/- 1 okta difference). The validation data are then co-located with the satellite observations, and a decision tree model is trained to automatically detect the over estimations in the satellite cloud masks. Crossvalidated results show that 62 +/- 13% of these overestimations can be identified by the model, reducing the systematic error in the satellite data sets from 14.4 +/- 15.5% to 4.3 +/- 2.8 %. The amount of errors is lower, and, importantly, their distribution is more homogeneous as well. These corrections happen at the cost of a global increase of 7 +/- 2% of missed clouds. Using this model, it is possible to significantly improve the cloud detection reliability in elevated areas in the Cloud_cci AVHRR-PM and MODIS-Aqua products.

TI  - CALIPSO lidar level 3 aerosol profile product: version 3 algorithm design
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations) level 3 aerosol profile product reports globally gridded, quality-screened, monthly mean aerosol extinction profiles retrieved by CALIOP (the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization). This paper describes the quality screening and averaging methods used to generate the version 3 product. The fundamental input data are CALIOP level 2 aerosol extinction profiles and layer classification information (aerosol, cloud, and clearair). Prior to aggregation, the extinction profiles are quality-screened by a series of filters to reduce the impact of layer detection errors, layer classification errors, extinction retrieval errors, and biases due to an intermittent signal anomaly at the surface. The relative influence of these filters are compared in terms of sample rejection frequency, mean extinction, and mean aerosol optical depth (AOD). The "extinction QC flag" filter is the most influential in preventing highbiases in level 3 mean extinction, while the "misclassified cirrus fringe" filter is most aggressive at rejecting cirrus misclassified as aerosol. The impact of quality screening on monthly mean aerosol extinction is investigated globally and regionally. After applying quality filters, the level 3 algorithm calculates monthly mean AOD by vertically integrating the monthly mean quality-screened aerosol extinction profile. Calculating monthly mean AOD by integrating the monthly mean extinction profile prevents a low bias that would result from alternately integrating the set of extinction profiles first and then averaging the resultant AOD values together. Ultimately, the quality filters reduce level 3 mean AOD by 24 and 31% for global ocean and global land, respectively, indicating the importance of quality screening.

TI  - Zika in travellers 1947-2017: a systematic review
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAVEL MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction: Travellers contributed substantially to the rapid spread of Zika virus (ZIKV). They act as sentinel and may unmask ongoing ZIKV transmission in countries where outbreaks have not yet been reported. Our objectives were to (i) describe the burden of ZIKV infections in international travellers over time; (ii) estimate the proportion of birth defects as a result of maternal ZIKV infection in travellers; (iii) track the extent of sexual transmission; (iv) summarize ZIKV infections in returning travellers as reported by the GeoSentinel network; and (v) identify countries without reports on local ZIKV transmission where travellers served as sentinel.Methods: We performed a systematic review from 1947 to April 2017 on travel-associated ZIKV infections. We also compared published reports on autochthonous ZIKV transmission in Asia with published reports on exportations from travellers in Asia.Results: Of 314 papers that fit the inclusion criteria, 61 were eligible for final analysis. There was an exponential increase in the number of reported ZIKV infected travellers from the years 2013 to 2016, which declined in 2017. Amongst pregnant women with ZIKV infection, (5%) resulted in a fetus or infant with ZIKV-associated birth defects. An estimated 1% of the total number of ZIKV cases reported in the USA and Europe were acquired through sexual transmission. Through the GeoSentinel network, five countries (Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Cameroon) were identified as sentinel markers where ZIKV was exported despite the absence of reported local transmission.Conclusions: Mobility patterns and travel volumes can help to identify the most likely origin of importation, and also in predicting further propagation. Studies on pregnant returning travellers have contributed to a better understanding of the risk estimates of congenital Zika syndrome/microcephaly as a result of maternal ZIKV infection, and the relative contribution of sexual transmisison.

TI  - Statistical anisotropies in temperature and polarization fluctuations from a scale-dependent trispectrum
T2  - PHYSICAL REVIEW D
M3  - Article
AB  - We study statistical anisotropies generated in the observed two-point function of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) fluctuations if the primordial statistics are non-Gaussian. Focusing on the dipole modulations of the anisotropies, we find that the hemispherical power asymmetry observed in the CMB temperature fluctuations can be modeled by a local-type trispectrum with amplitude tau(NL) (k(p) = 0.05 Mpc(-1)) approximate to 2 x 10(4) and a large red tilt n approximate to -0.68. We numerically evaluate the non-Gaussian covariance of the modulation estimators for both temperature and E-mode polarization fluctuations and discuss the prospects of constraining the model using Planck satellite data. We then discuss other effects of the scale-dependent trispectrum that could be used to distinguish this scenario from other explanations of the power asymmetry: higher-order modulations of the two-point function and the non-Gaussian angular power spectrum covariance. As an important consequence of the non-Gaussian power spectrum covariance, we discuss how the CMB-inferred spectral index of primordial scalar fluctuations can be significantly biased in the presence of a scale-dependent local-type trispectrum.

TI  - Evaluation of Warm-Core Structure in Reanalysis and Satellite Data Sets Using HS3 Dropsonde Observations: A Case Study of Hurricane Edouard (2014)
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Using National Aeronautics and Space Administration Hurricane and Severe Storm Sentinel (HS3) dropsonde observations in the eye of Hurricane Edouard (2014), its warm-core structure in reanalysis/analysis and satellite data sets are evaluated. All of the data sets generally underestimate the warm-core strength of Edouard. Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-A shows the smallest error in the upper troposphere but the largest error in the lower troposphere. Its successor, Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder, significantly improves the representation of low-level warming while maintaining its performance in the middle and upper troposphere. Two versions of the Global Forecast System analysis at different resolutions and Climate Forecast System Reanalysis version 2 show better performance than the other reanalyses. Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Application (MERRA)-2, Japanese 55-year Reanalysis, and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Interim Reanalysis could represent the vertical warm-core structure, but they markedly underestimate the warm-core strength. MERRA and North American Regional Reanalysis (especially North American Regional Reanalysis) have the worst skills when reproducing warm cores. MERRA-2 considerably outperforms its predecessor, MERRA. The warm-core evolution of Edouard in six reanalysis/analysis data sets is diagnosed and compared. Different physical processes such as diabatic heating and vertical and horizontal advection may be responsible for warm-core generation at different stages during its lifetime. The inaccurate representation of these physical processes in the reanalyses/analyses results in errors in the warm-core strength and height. It is suggested that vortex relocation/bogusing, assimilation of tropical cyclone (TC) observation data, and model parameterizations are important to adequately represent warm cores in terms of strength and three-dimensional structure. This study can shed some light on the selection of suitable data sets for estimating the real-time warm-core strength or for TC-related climate studies. The need for better observations of TCs and model improvements is also highlighted.

TI  - Anomalous Glacier Changes in the Southeast of Tuomuer-Khan Tengri Mountain Ranges, Central Tianshan
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Central Tianshan (CTS) plays a prominent role in maintaining the vulnerable ecosystem in Central Asia. Rivers originating from it have high proportions of the runoffs contributed by glacier meltwater. In this study, the glacier mass balance in the catchments of Muzart and Karayulun rivers, CTS, was estimated by a geodetic method based on Advanced Land Observing Satellite/Panchromatic Remote-sensing Instrument for Stereo Mapping images and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM). The results revealed that at the west and east glacial centers in the study area, the 2000-2011 mass loss rates were -0.030.17 and -0.060.17m w.e./a, respectively, considerably lower than other CTS zones. In order to ascertain this stable glacier state, we also performed a geodetic measurement based on TerraSAR-X add-on for Digital Elevation Measurement (TanDEM-X) images and SRTM DEM (2000-2012), and the results are similar (0.010.17 and -0.040.17m w.e./a, respectively). The glacier thickness change around the regional snowline was close to zero. The strong capability of cold storage and the temperature drop in the early 21st century may account for the anomalous mass changes. Despite slight overall mass changes, obvious thinning was observed on many exposed glacier feet. This study indicates that the glacier melting can be effectively controlled if the rising trend of temperatures is reversed; furthermore, the land surface hydrological model should be calibrated with geodetic glacier mass balance measurement when it is used to simulate the streamflow trend in the headwater basin.

TI  - Increases in Land Surface Temperature in Response to Fire in Siberian Boreal Forests and Their Attribution to Biophysical Processes
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfire is the most prevalent natural disturbance in boreal forests and impacts climate through biogeochemical (e.g., greenhouse gas emission from biomass burning) and biophysical (e.g., albedo [ET], evapotranspiration [ET], and roughness) processes. We used satellite observations to investigate the immediate (i.e., 1 year after fire) biophysical effects of fire in Siberian boreal forests. We found that boreal forest fires have a net annual warming effect (0.0728 to 0.325K) due to strong summer warming and weak winter cooling. Fires also increased the diurnal temperature range and seasonal amplitude. These effects are strongest in summer and significantly higher in evergreen than in deciduous coniferous forests. Decreases in ET contributed to warming effects in summer, and increases in contributed to cooling in winter. Our results suggest that the increase in observed land surface temperature immediately following fires in boreal ecosystems is most likely due to reduced ET leading to a strong positive feedback on the surface radiative budget.Plain Language Summary When wildfire burns forests, it affects local climate by changing the surface energy budget and distribution because of changes in albedo (alpha) and evapotranspiration (ET). Albedo (alpha) determines the solar energy absorbed by the land surface, with darker surfaces (e.g., forest) absorbing more energy than lighter surfaces (e.g., snow). ET is the energy used to release water from plant leaves and therefore cools the land surface. We used satellite observations to investigate how land surface temperature (LST) changes 1 year after wildfire and how this response relates to and ET in Siberian boreal forests. We found that burned forested areas have a higher annual LST and variability than adjacent unburned forested areas, as a result of strong summer warming and weak winter cooling. A strong decrease in summer ET is the main mechanism for the increase in LST in burned forests. Additionally, the LST response is different between boreal forest types. Our results suggest that boreal forest fires result in increased surface warming primarily due to decreases in evaporative cooling in summer.

TI  - Improving Greenland Surface Mass Balance Estimates Through the Assimilation of MODIS Albedo: A Case Study Along the K-Transect
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating the Greenland ice sheet surface mass balance (SMB) is an important component of current and future projections of sea level rise. Given the lack of in situ information, imperfect models, and underutilized remote sensing data, it is critical to combine the available observations with a physically based model to better characterize the spatial and temporal variation of the Greenland ice sheet SMB. This work proposes a data assimilation framework that yields SMB estimates that benefit from a state-of-the-art snowpack model (Crocus) and a 16-day albedo product. Comparison of our results against in situ SMB measurements from the Kangerlussuaq transect shows that assimilation of 16-day albedo product reduces the root-mean-square error of the posterior estimates of SMB from 1,240 millimeter water equivalent per year (mmWE/yr) to 230 mmWE/yr and reduces the bias from 1,140 mmWE/yr to -20 mmWE/yr.Plain Language Summary Diagnosing the surface mass balance (SMB) of the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) is a critical objective, which, despite its importance, continues to contain large uncertainties from significant errors in modeled precipitation as well as errors related to subgrid process representation. This work uses a data assimilation framework (which has not been used in estimations of the GrIS SMB) and a satellite-derived 16-day albedo product to improve the estimates of the SMB on the southern GrIS. We used the Kangerlussuaq transect (K-transect) point-scale SMB measurements to validate our results over the 2009-2010 hydrological year. The data assimilation technique (i.e., particle batch smoother) reduces the spatial root-mean-square error of SMB over the K-transect stations by 82% from 1,240 millimeter water equivalent (mmWE) to 231 mmWE and bias of the estimates by 98% from 1,142 mmWE to -20 mmWE. It was shown that this methodology has the potential to resolve the spatial variability of the surface processes along the K-transect stations and surface albedo that is not resolved by the model at a resolution of 25 km. The modularity of the algorithm makes it possible to combine nearly any land surface model with different satellite-based or ground-based measurements.

TI  - Preliminary results of official influenza and acute respiratory infection surveillance in two towns of Burkina Faso, 2013-2015
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In 2010, influenza, influenza-like illness (ILI) and acute respiratory infection (ARI) surveillance was established by the government of Burkina Faso. We provide preliminary descriptive results from this surveillance activity.Methods: The study period was 2013 through 2015. Two primary healthcare facilities in Bobo-Dioulasso district reported ILI in outpatients. Influenza virology, using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), was available for a proportion of ILI patients. One hospital, in the capital Ouagadougou, reported ARI in both outpatients and inpatients (hospitalized). Inpatients admitted with ARI were considered severe ARI (SARI). We estimated the proportion of primary care outpatient visits that were ILI, and the proportion of those that were due to influenza, by age. We estimated the proportion of hospital outpatient visits that were ARI and the proportion of those that were SARI, by age.Results: Among combined outpatient visits in the Bobo-Dioulasso facilities, 19.6% were for ILI. One half (49.9%) of outpatient visits in infants and 30.9% in 1-4 year-olds were ILI. Among ILI outpatient visits 14.8% were due to influenza virus and, of these, 58.5% were type A and 41.5% type B. At the Ouagadougou hospital, 6.7% of outpatient visits were ARI, and 22.3% of those were SARI. The highest proportions of ARI were among infants (19. 8%) and 1-4 year-olds (16.0%). The proportion of ARI that was SARI was highest among >= 15 year-olds (31.5%) followed by 1-4 year-olds (22.4%). Overall, 4.1% of SARI patients died.Conclusions: These preliminary data indicate the importance of respiratory infections among health care attendances in Burkina Faso, and influenza may be an important contributor to these.

T2  - WORLD ALLERGY ORGANIZATION JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Collecting data on the localization of users is a key issue for the MASK (Mobile Airways Sentinel network: the Allergy Diary) App. Data anonymization is a method of sanitization for privacy. The European Commission's Article 29 Working Party stated that geolocation information is personal data.To assess geolocation using the MASK method and to compare two anonymization methods in the MASK database to find an optimal privacy method.Methods: Geolocation was studied for all people who used the Allergy Diary App from December 2015 to November 2017 and who reported medical outcomes. Two different anonymization methods have been evaluated: Noise addition (randomization) and k-anonymity (generalization).Results: Ninety-three thousand one hundred and sixteen days of VAS were collected from 8535 users and 54,500 (58. 5%) were geolocalized, corresponding to 5428 users. Noise addition was found to be less accurate than k-anonymity using MASK data to protect the users' life privacy.Discussion: k-anonymity is an acceptable method for the anonymization of MASK data and results can be used for other databases.

TI  - Eddy Tracking in the Northwestern Indian Ocean During Southwest Monsoon Regimes
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The northwestern Indian Ocean exhibits a relatively highly energetic eddy field during the southwest monsoon season between June and September. This study analyzes the seasonal and interannual variability of the eddy characteristics and their trajectories in the northwestern Indian Ocean using altimetric sea surface height observations from 1993 to 2014. Although the highest number of eddies is found in the Arabian Peninsula coastal region, the strongest eddies, characterized by large radii, amplitudes, and eddy kinetic energies are found along the Somali Current. Trajectories of anticyclonic and cyclonic eddies are investigated to provide insight on the generation and propagation of eddies of varying amplitudes. The largest annual eddy in the Somali Current system corresponds to the Great Whirl, for which the year-to-year variability with respect to shape, size, generation, and propagation was examined, as was the development of these characteristics over the Great Whirl's lifetime.Plain Language Summary The ocean is full of highly energetic quasi-circular features known as mesoscale eddies having typical radii of 10-100 km. Eddies are significant transporters of global heat and ocean characteristics (like salinity and biodiversity). They are best observed by using satellite observations of fluctuations in sea surface height. In this study, we apply an algorithm to sea surface height satellite data in the northwestern Indian Ocean to better understand how and where eddies develop during the summer monsoon season, when eddies are strongest. We determined that though more eddies develop in the northern northwestern Indian Ocean, eddies with largest radii and amplitudes are found along the Somali Current region. These eddies in the Somali Current are also the most energetic, associated with stronger surface currents. The largest eddy observed in the Somali Current during the summer months is referred to as the Great Whirl. This research traces the location where the Great Whirl develops and propagates for each year from 1993 to 2014 and shows significant variability.

TI  - Updates of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer on-orbit calibration uncertainty assessments
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments have successfully operated for more than 18 and 16 years, respectively, on-board the NASA's Earth Observing System Terra and Aqua spacecraft. Both Terra and Aqua MODIS have significantly contributed to the advance of global Earth remote sensing applications with a broad range of science products that have been continuously produced since the beginning of each mission and freely distributed to users worldwide. MODIS collects data in 20 reflective solar bands (RSB) and 16 thermal emissive bands (TEB), covering wavelengths from 0.41 to 14.4 mu m. Its level IB (L1B) data products, which provide the input for the MODIS high-level science products, include the top of the atmosphere reflectance factors for the RSB, radiances for both the RSB and TEB, and associated uncertainty indices (UI) at a pixel-by-pixel level. This paper provides a brief review of MODIS L1B calibration algorithms, including a number of improvements made in recent years. It presents an update of sensor calibration uncertainty assessments with a focus on several new contributors resulting from on-orbit changes in sensor characteristics, approaches developed to address these changes, and the impact due to on-orbit changes on the L1B data quality. Also discussed are remaining challenges and potential improvements to be made to continuously maintain sensor calibration and data quality, particularly those related to the quality of MODIS LIB uncertainty.

TI  - Extraction of digital elevation model from Chinese GF-3 C-band synthetic aperture radar data with a step-wise method focusing on facilitating phase unwrapping
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - GaoFen-3 (GF-3) is the first fully polarimetric C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite in China. Interferometric observation is an important capability of GF-3. However, the long temporal baseline is a great challenge for repeat-pass interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) processing, especially over mountainous areas. Phase noise and complex topography make phase unwrapping difficult. This paper proposes a step-wise approach for high-resolution InSAR data processing focusing on facilitating phase unwrapping. First, the coarse GF-3 digital elevation model (DEM) is reconstructed by InSAR processing with multilooking of large looks, which is used to suppress phase noise. Second, the coarse GF-3 DEM is used to remove the terrain phase from the InSAR phase with multilooking of small looks, which can reduce phase gradient and improve the accuracy of phase unwrapping. After several iterations, the GF-3 DEM is finally inversed with multilooking of 2 looks, which is of high resolution and high accuracy. The performance of GF-3 C-band InSAR data on the extraction of DEM is examined over a deciduous forested area with the proposed method. The root-mean-square error of the extracted GF-3 DEM is 3.78 m in comparison with the LiDAR DEM. (C) 2018 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

TI  - Impact of soil surface and subsurface properties on soil saturated hydraulic conductivity in the semi-arid Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed, Arizona, USA
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - The estimation of saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) is of high relevance to correctly reproduce water fluxes, such as infiltration rates or surface runoff in hydrological simulations. Yet, estimation of Ks is challenging especially in semi-arid regions with particular soil surface characteristics like crusting and sealing. This study presents results of a field campaign in the semi-arid Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed, Arizona (US), where surface and subsurface Ks measurements were undertaken across the watershed. Data of saturated hydraulic conductivity on crust covered and crust-free surfaces was collected and compared to results of commonly used methods to retrieve spatially distributed Ks data. Results reveal that methods typically used for estimating Ks, such as exponential decay functions or pedo-transfer functions (PTFs), can be inadequate in such regions. The analysis shows that in our study area the presence of surface crust is the dominating factor for determining the spatial distribution of Ks. Furthermore, the results reveal that remote sensing data can provide useful information for estimating surface Ks values as it could be successfully applied for the spatial detection of surface crust characteristics.

TI  - The combined use of chemical and biochemical markers in <i>Rutilus rutilus</i> to assess the effect of dredging in the lower course of the Ebro River
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The lower course of the Ebro River is polluted with high concentrations of organochlorine compounds dumped by a chloro-alkali plant during the last century. A remediation plan, including building of a protective wall, removal and disposal of polluted sediments started in 2012. With the aim of assessing the effects of dredging of contaminated sediments and potential alterations of water quality, areas located upstream (RR) and downstream (BE, A) the chemical plant (FL) were monitored prior (October 2012) and during dredging (June 2013) using roach (Rutilus milli's) as sentinel organisms. Concentrations of organochlorine compounds (OCs) in fish muscle and biliary levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), galaxolide (HHCB) and alkyphenols (APEs) were determined together with selected enzymatic activities (7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), 7-benzyloxy-4-trifluoromethyl-coumarin O-debenzyloxylase (BFCOD) and UDP-glucuronyltransferase (UGT)) in the liver. The obtained results proved the effectiveness of the wall retaining suspended particles and avoiding further contamination of downstream sites as fish sampled at downstream sites showed up to 9-fold higher concentrations of OCs in muscle during wall construction than during dredging. EROD and UGT activities were induced in fish from downstream sites; however, no clear response to the observed pollution gradient was detected.

TI  - Surface properties and surficial deposits on Venus: New results from Magellan radar altimeter data analysis
T2  - ICARUS
M3  - Article
AB  - Microwave remote sensing data acquired with Magellan Venus orbiter are the main source of information about the surface of the planet. We analyze variability of the backscattering function (dependence of radar cross-section on incidence angle) for steep incidence angles 0.25-4.75 in the 75 N-55 S latitude zone with data from the Magellan radar altimeter at 12.6 cm wavelength. We show that all variability of the backscattering function can be described by three parameters, describing (1) surface reflectivity, (2) relative proportion of horizontal facets, and (3) general roughness. Analysis of maps of these parameters revealed that surficial deposits, for example, microdune fields, are abundant on Venus even in places, where they are not readily seen in the synthetic aperture radar images. Properties of surficial deposits rather than original volcanic flow roughness define the shape of the backscattering function on the majority of regional plains. A large radar-dark flow in Bereghinia Planitia has anomalously high proportion of horizontal facets, which is consistent with it being formed by a relatively recent plain-forming volcanic episode. Some crater-associated radar-dark diffuse features and splotches are also characterized by increased proportion of horizontal faces, which indicate the presence of mantles deposited from fluidized granular material. The backscattering functions of the anomalous radar-bright material of mountaintops are more consistent with the strong internal scattering hypothesis rather than the exotic surficial material hypothesis. Obtained maps can be useful for planning future lander missions to sites with access to surface material with known provenance. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Intelligent video surveillance for real-time detection of suicide attempts
T2  - PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Suicide by hanging is a sentinel event and a major cause of death in prisons, with an increasing frequency over recent years. The rapid detection of suicidal behavior can reduce the mortality rate and increase the odds of survival for the suicide victim. Significant efforts have been made to develop technologies for preventing hanging attempts, but most of them use cumbersome devices, or they are mainly depending on human attention and intervention. In this paper, we propose a vision-based method to automatically detect suicide by hanging. Our intelligent video surveillance system operates using depth streams provided by an RGB-D camera, regardless of illumination conditions. The proposed algorithm is based on the exploitation of the body joints'positions to model suicidal behavior. Both dynamic and static pose characteristics are calculated in order to efficiently capture the body joints'movement and model suicidal behavior. Results from the experiments on realistic video sequences, show that our system achieves a high accuracy in detecting suicide attempts, while meeting real-time requirements.

TI  - Analyses of biomass burning contribution to aerosol in Zhengzhou during wheat harvest season in 2015
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Ambient PM2.5 samples were collected in suburban area of Zhengzhou, China to investigate the impact of straw open burning on local aerosol during wheat harvest season in 2015. Secondary formation and accumulation processes were found under unfavorable meteorological conditions through the chemical composition analysis in PM2.5. And spatial and temporal variation of the agricultural activities were observed through MODIS fire spots data combined with back trajectory analysis. Results showed elevated levoglucosan was affected directly during biomass burning episodes and transportation periods. In order to estimate the contribution, levoglucosan/K+ combined with levoglucosan/mannosan were analyzed to identify biomass burning sources. And the results showed that levoglucosan were emitted from straw burning mixing with softwood combustion during the study period, emphasizing that wood combustion for households was non-negligible which consists part of the levoglucosan background in Zhengzhou aerosol. Based on emission factors (levoglucosan/OC or levoglucosan/PM2.5) summarized by laboratory simulation experiments, the study period was divided into 7 depending on the former characteristics to estimate the contribution of biomass burning to aerosol, and the average contributions of biomass burning emission to OC and PM2.5 were 46% and 13% relatively, indicating biomass burning have a significant impact on ambient aerosol levels during harvest season.

TI  - 1984 Ivanovo tornado outbreak: Determination of actual tornado tracks with satellite data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The 1984 Ivanovo tornado outbreak is one of the most fatal tornado events in Europe with previously unspecified tornado track characteristics. In this paper, we used Landsat images to discover tornado-induced forest disturbances and restore actual characteristics of tornadoes during the outbreak. We defined boundaries of tornado-induced windthrows by visual comparison of satellite images and specified them with Normalized Difference Infrared Index. We confirmed the occurrence of eight tornadoes during the outbreak and determined their location, path width and length. Other tornadoes occurrence during the outbreak was discussed. Fujita-scale intensity of confirmed tornadoes was estimated based on the related literature corpus including previously omitted sources. In addition, information on tornado path lengths and widths was used to estimate minimal tornado intensity for those tornadoes that passed no settlements. In total, the Ivanovo outbreak includes 8-13 tornadoes with F-scale rating mean ranges from 1.8-2.5 and has adjusted Fujita length around 540 km, which makes the outbreak one the strongest in Europe and places it within the upper quartile of U.S. outbreaks. Characteristics of certain tornadoes within the Ivanovo outbreak are exceptional for Russia. The widest tornado path during the Ivanovo outbreak is 1740 m; the longest is from 81.5-85.9 km. With the example of the Ivanovo outbreak, we showed that existing databases on historical Russian tornadoes tend to overestimate tornado path length (for very long tornadoes) and underestimate maximum tornado path width.

TI  - Estimating terrestrial gross primary productivity in water limited ecosystems across Africa using the Southampton Carbon Flux (SCARF) model
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The amount of carbon uptake by vegetation is an important component to understand the functioning of ecosystem processes and their response /feedback to climate. Recently, a new diagnostic model called the Southampton Carbon Flux (SCARF) Model driven by remote sensing data was developed to predict terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP) and successfully applied in temperate regions. The model is based on the concept of quantum yield of plants and improves on the previous diagnostic models by (i) using the fraction of photosynthetic active radiation absorbed by the photosynthetic pigment (FAPAR(ps)) and ( ii) using direct quantum yield by classifying the vegetation into C-9 or C-4 classes. In this paper, we calibrated and applied the model to evaluate GPP across various ecosystems in Africa. The performance of the model was evaluated using data from seven eddy covariance flux tower sites. Overall, the modelled GPP values showed good correlation (R- 059, p < 0.0001) with estimated flux tower GPP at most sites (except at a tropical rainforest site, R = 0.38, p = 0.02) in terms of their seasonality and absolute values. Mean daily GPP across the investigated period varied significantly across sites depending on the vegetation types from a minimum of 044 g Cm-2 day at the semi-arid and sub-humid savanna grassland sites to a maximum of 936 g C m(2) day 1 at the woodland and tropical rain forest sites. Generally, strong correlation is observed in savanna woodlands and grasslands where vegetation follows a prescribed seasonal cycle as determined by changes in canopy chlorophyll content and leaf area index, finally, the mean annual GPP value for Africa predicted by the model was 35.25 Pg C yr(-1). The good performance of the SCARF model in water-limited ecosystems across Africa extends its potential for global application. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Improving the Heliosat-2 method for surface solar irradiation estimation under cloudy sky areas
T2  - SOLAR ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to improve global horizontal irradiation (GHI) estimates under cloudy sky conditions using the Heliosat-2 method (Rigollier et al., 2004) calibrated with Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite images (GOES) (Albarelo et al., 2015). The Heliosat-2 method using GOES images as input (GOES_H2) was coupled with a cloudy sky radiative transfer parameterisation (RTP) (RTP: radiative transfer parameterisation) to better account for local cloud properties. The key element of this parameterisation is the cloud absorption coefficient, which was the only element to be computed. The GHI estimates obtained when using GOES_H2 coupled with a RTP (RTP_H2) were compared against GHI measurements from six meteorological stations in French Guiana over four years. We used root mean square error (RMSE), mean bias error (MBE), correlation coefficient, and the Kolmogorov Smimov test integral to assess GHI estimates accuracy. RTP_H2 obtained estimates were also compared with GOES_H2 estimates. Our results show an improvement in the GHI estimates under cloudy, clear, and all sky conditions. Under cloudy skies, the RMSE and MBE of our method RTP_H2 ranged from 43% to 63% and -2% to -22%, respectively, whereas those of GOES_H2 method ranged from 66% to 87% and -48% to -65%, respectively. Another effect of the new method was the improvement in clear sky GHI estimates: the RMSE and MBE ranged from 16% to 24% and -20% to -8%, respectively, while those of GOES_H2 ranged from 19% to 28% and -23% to -10%, respectively. The improvement in GHI estimates under cloudy sky conditions led to better GHI estimates under all sky conditions: the RMSE and MBE of RTP_H2 ranged from 19% to 26% and -7% to -2%, respectively, while the corresponding values for GOES_H2 ranged from 22% to 32% and -15% to -8%, respectively. The suggested cloudy sky RTP offers the advantages of simple implementation and good computation speed. This method requires only one parameter; users need to configure a cloud absorption coefficient suitable for their local conditions. We conclude that coupling the Heliosat-2 method with a cloudy sky RTP improves GHI estimates in French Guiana and reduces discrepancies between satellite-derived irradiation and ground measurements in areas with high cloudiness.

Currently, some cloud detection methods based on Random Forest (RF) model have been proposed but they do not consider both spectral and textural characteristics of the image. Furthermore, they have not been tested in the presence of snow/ice. In this paper, we introduce two RF based algorithms, Feature Level Fusion Random Forest (FLFRF) and Decision Level Fusion Random Forest (DLFRF) to incorporate visible, infrared (IR) and thermal spectral and textural features (FLFRF) including Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and Robust Extended Local Binary Pattern (RELBP_CI) or visible, IR and thermal classifiers (DLFRF) for highly accurate cloud detection on remote sensing images. FLFRF first fuses visible, IR and thermal features. Thereafter, it uses the RF model to classify pixels to cloud, snow/ice and background or thick cloud, thin cloud and background. DLFRF considers visible, IR and thermal features (both spectral and textural) separately and inserts each set of features to RF model. Then, it holds vote matrix of each run of the model. Finally, it fuses the classifiers using the majority vote method. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, 10 Terra MODIS and 15 Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS images with different spatial resolutions are used in this paper. Quantitative analyses are based on manually selected ground truth data. Results show that after adding RELBP_CI to input feature set cloud detection accuracy improves. Also, the average cloud kappa values of FLFRF and DLFRF on MODIS images (1 and 0.99) are higher than other machine learning methods, Linear Discriminate Analysis (LDA), Classification And Regression Tree (CART), K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) (0.96). The average snow/ice kappa values of FLFRF and DLFRF on MODIS images (1 and 0.85) are higher than other traditional methods. The quantitative values on Landsat 8 images show similar trend. Consequently, while SVM and K-nearest neighbor show overestimation in predicting cloud and snow/ice pixels, our Random Forest (RF) based models can achieve higher cloud, snow/ice kappa values on MODIS and thin cloud, thick cloud and snow/ice kappa values on Landsat 8 images. Our algorithms predict both thin and thick cloud on Landsat 8 images while the existing cloud detection algorithm, Fmask cannot discriminate them. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our algorithms have acquired higher average cloud and snow/ice kappa values for different spatial resolutions. (C) 2018 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Change Evolution of PM<sub>2.5</sub> in Typical Regions of China in 45 Recent 20 Years
T2  - Huanjing Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - Two decades of PM2.5 pollution has seriously hindered China's sustainable development. However, relevant research of PM2.5 has been hindered because of the lack of long-term historical monitoring data. Therefore, ground observations of PM2.5 concentration from 2013 to 2016 in four typical regions of China and the MODIS aerosol optical thickness data, boundary layer height, temperature, and other meteorological data from 2000 to 2016 were used as the basic data. A combined simulation model was constructed by combining the two algorithms of backward artificial neural network and support vector regression and obtains the PM2.5 concentration history for the past 20 years using geospatial analysis technology. The results demonstrate that the combination model is better than the single model, with lower error and higher generalization ability. The spatial-temporal analysis results show that the concentration of PM2.5 continued to increase in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and in the three northeastern provinces of China, the PM2.5 concentration decreased slowly in the Pearl River Delta, the pollution range of PM2.5 in three of the research areas showed an expanding trend, and the PM2.5 concentration and pollution range remained stable in the Yangtze River Delta. In 2012, the concentration of PM2.5 in the four study areas decreased and the pollution range narrowed, but the PM2.5 concentration rose slightly after that decline and the high pollution range narrowed during 2013-2016, which with the country to take PM2.5 regional defense and other governance measures.

TI  - SO<sub>2</sub> emissions, plume heights and magmatic processes inferred from satellite data: The 2015 Calbuco eruptions
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying time-series of sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions during explosive eruptions provides insight into volcanic processes, assists in volcanic hazard mitigation, and permits quantification of the climatic impact of major eruptions. While volcanic SO2 is routinely detected from space during eruptions, the retrieval of plume injection height and SO2 flux time-series remains challenging. Here we present a new numerical method based on forward- and backward-trajectory analysis which enable such time-series to be determined.Using this method applied to GOME-2 satellite imagery we investigate the SO2 emissions from two sub-Plinian eruptions of Calbuco, Chile, produced in April 2015. Our results show a mean injection height of 15 km for the two eruptions, with overshooting tops reaching 20 km. We calculate a total of 0.295 +/- 0.045 Tg of SO2 emitted, with 0.140 +/- 0.033 Tg produced by the first eruption and 0.155 +/- 0.031 Tg by the second one. Using standard models we convert plume heights to mass eruption rates (MER). Comparing gas flux and MER we discover quite different volcanic processes driving the two eruptions, with the first eruption producing an SO2 flux three times higher than the second one, while they both had similar MERs. We propose that this difference reflects different exsolved volatile contents before the onset of the two eruptions, with the first eruption richer in pre-exsolved gas than the second one. This hypothesis is supported by melt inclusion measurements of sulfur concentrations in plagioclase phenocrysts and groundmass glass of tephra samples through electron microprobe analysis. Combining the satellite and petrological analysis, we propose that the overpressure caused by the preexsolved volatile phase (not only SO2, but also probably H2O and CO2) may have triggered the eruption.These results demonstrate that our new methodology produces constraints on SO2 flux and plume height time-series permitting new insights into sub-surface processes using satellite SO2 data.

TI  - Assessing reanalysis quality with early sounders Nimbus-4 IRIS (1970) and Nimbus-6 HIRS (1975)
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper revisits the data collected by early sounders Nimbus-4 IRIS (1970) and Nimbus-6 HIRS (1975), after recovery of ageing tapes by NASA GES DISC. New quality controls are proposed to screen out erroneous or suspicious mission data, based on instrument health status data records and other inspection of the data. Radiative transfer coefficients are derived for the fast computation of clear sky radiative transfer simulations. Atmospheric profiles from ERA-40 and ERA-20C reanalyses are used in input. These spatiotemporally complete datasets are interpolated to each sounding location, using the closest estimate in time. A modern cloud detection method derived for current hyperspectral sounders is applied to IRIS and yields maps of cloud cover that are in line with current knowledge of cloud climatology. For clear scenes, the standard deviation of brightness temperature differences between IRIS observations and simulations from ERA-20C is around 1 K for the lower-peaking temperature channels of the 15 mu m CO2 band, and lower than 1 K for simulations from ERA-40. The IRIS and HIRS instrumental data records are projected in a common sub-space to alleviate issues with different field-of-view resolutions and spectral resolutions. A proxy cloud detection scheme screens out clouds in the same manner in both data records. Considering the month of August, common to both missions, a detailed analysis of the departures from observations suggests that ERA-40 suffers from spurious tropospheric warming, possibly caused by changes in the observation input during the 1970s including a known error in ERA-40 radiance assimilation bias correction. This result, confirmed by considering a climate model integration, demonstrates that it is possible to exploit early sounder data records to derive detailed insight from reanalyses, such as attempting to qualify separately random and systematic errors in reanalyses, even at times when few other independent observation data are available.

TI  - Epidemiological investigation of tattoo-like skin lesions among bottlenose dolphins in Shark Bay, Australia
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Bottlenose dolphins are excellent bioindicators of ocean ecosystem health for three reasons: (a) as long-lived apex predators they accumulate biotoxins and contaminants; (b) they are visible, routinely appearing at the water's surface in coastal areas, often coming into close contact with humans; and, (c) they exhibit a range of pathogenic lesions attributable to environmental degradation. In this study, we analyzed tattoo-like skin lesions in a population of Tuisiops aduncus studied for 30+ years in Shark Bay, Australia, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. We provide important baseline data by documenting epidemiological patterns of tattoo-like skin lesions in a healthy, free-ranging population that builds on the previous data of tattoo skin disease (TSD) derived from free ranging, stranded, and dead dolphins. Individual dolphins were classified as symptomatic with tattoo-like skin disease if at least one photograph showed a lesion similar to TSD. The average age of infection was 26.6 months (+/- 34.8 months) with the symptomatic period lasting 137 +/- 29.8 days. Overall prevalence of tattoo-like skin disease in the population was 19.4%. Age, but not sex, was significant, with yearlings (1-2 years) exhibiting tattoo-like lesions more than younger and older calves. Tattoo-like lesions were rare among juvenile and adult dolphins (N = 68 calves, 4 juveniles, and 3 adults). We hypothesize that the lower prevalence in youngest calves (<1 year) is due to maternal immunity, while older individuals (>2 years) have infection-acquired immunity, as reported for other small cetaceans. The low prevalence of tattoo-like lesions in Shark Bay compared to other populations with poxvirus is consistent with reproductive and demographic viability analyses. Furthermore, by documenting the demography of the disease, we can monitor changes in the prevalence of tattoo-like lesions as a sentinel indicator of ecosystem health. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Predicting risk of trace element pollution from municipal roads using site-specific soil samples and remotely sensed data
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies of environmental processes exhibit spatial variation within data sets. The ability to derive predictions of risk fromfield data is a critical path forward in understanding the data and applying the information to land and resource management. Thanks to recent advances in predictivemodeling, open source software, and computing, the power to do this is within grasp. This article provides an example of howwe predicted relative trace element pollution risk fromroads across a region by combining site specific trace element data in soils with regional land cover and planning information in a predictive model framework. In the Kenai Peninsula of Alaska, we sampled 36 sites (191 soil samples) adjacent to roads for trace elements. We then combined this site specific data with freely-available land cover and urban planning data to derive a predictive model of landscape scale environmental risk. We used six different model algorithms to analyze the dataset, comparing these in terms of their predictive abilities and the variables identified as important. Based on comparable predictive abilities (mean R2 from30 to 35% and mean root mean square error from 65 to 68%), we averaged all six model outputs to predict relative levels of trace element deposition in soils-given the road surface, traffic volume, sample distance from the road, land cover category, and impervious surface percentage. Mapped predictions of environmental risk from toxic trace element pollution can show land managers and transportation planners where to prioritize road renewal or maintenance by each road segment's relative environmental and human health risk.

TI  - Thermal conductivity of lunar regolith simulant JSC-1A under vacuum
T2  - ICARUS
M3  - Article
AB  - Many air-less planetary bodies, including the Moon, asteroids, and comets, are covered by regolith. The thermal conductivity of the regolith is an essential parameter controlling the surface temperature variation. A thermal conductivity model applicable to natural soils as well as planetary surface regolith is required to analyze infrared remote sensing data. In this study, we investigated the temperature and compressional stress dependence of the thermal conductivity of the lunar regolith simulant JSC-1A, and the temperature dependence of sieved JSC-1A samples under vacuum conditions. We confirmed that a series of the experimental data for JSC-1A are fitted well by our analytical model of the thermal conductivity (Sakatani et al., 2017). Comparison with the calibration data of the sieved samples with those for original JSC-1A indicates that the thermal conductivity of natural samples with a wide grain size distribution can be modeled as mono-sized grains with a volumetric median size. The calibrated model can be used to estimate the volumetric median grain size from infrared remote sensing data. Our experiments and the calibrated model indicates that uncompressed JSC-1A has similar thermal conductivity to lunar top surface materials, but the lunar subsurface thermal conductivity cannot be explained only by the effects of the density and self-weighted compressional stress. We infer that the nature of the lunar subsurface regolith grains is much different from JSC-1A and lunar top-surface regolith, and/or the lunar subsurface regolith is over-consolidated and the compressional stress higher than the hydrostatic pressure is stored in the lunar regolith layer.

TI  - The influence of landscape's dynamics on the Oriental Migratory Locust habitat change based on the time-series satellite data
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Landscape structure and vegetation coverage are important habitat conditions for Oriental Migratory Locust infestation in East Asia. Characterizing the landscape's dynamics of locust habitat is meaningful for reducing the occupation of locusts and limiting potential risks. To better understand causes and consequences of landscape pattern and locust habitat, it is not enough to simply detect locust habitat of each year. Rather, landcover transitions causing the change of locust habitat area must also be explored. This paper proposes an integrated implement to quantify the influence of landscape's dynamics on locust habitat changes based on three tenets: 1) temporal context can provide insight into the land cover transitions, 2) the detection of locust habitat area is operated on patches rather than pixels with full consideration of landscape's ecology, 3) the modeling must be flexible and unsupervised. These ideas have not been previously explored in demonstrating the possible role of changes in landscape characteristics to drive locust habitat transitions. The case study focuses on the Dagang district, a hot spot of locust infestation of China, from 2000 to 2015. Firstly, the seasonal characteristics of typical landcovers in NDVI, TVI, and LST were extracted from fused Landsat-MODIS surface reflectance imagery. Subsequently, a landscape membership-based random forest (LMRF) algorithm was proposed to quantify the landscape structure and hydrological regimen of locust habitat at the patch level. Finally, we investigated the correlations between the specific landcover transitions and habitat changes. Within the 16 years observations, our findings suggest that the sparse reeds and weeds in the vicinity of beach land, riverbanks, and wetlands are the dominant landscape structure associated with locust habitat change (R-2 > 0.68), and the fluctuation in the water level is a key ecological factor to facilitate the locust habitat change (R-2 > 0.61). These results are instrumental for developing precision pesticide use to reduce environmental degradation, and providing positive perspectives for ecological management and transformation of locust habitats.

TI  - Risk Factors for Locoregional Disease Recurrence After Breast-Conserving Therapy in Patients With Breast Cancer Treated With Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy: An International Collaboration and Individual Patient Meta-Analysis
T2  - CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several studies have reported a high risk of local disease recurrence (LR) and locoregional disease recurrence (LRR) in patients with breast cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT) and breast-conserving therapy (BCT). The objective of the current study was to identify potential risk factors for LR and LRR after NCT and BCT. METHODS: Individual patient data sets from 9 studies were pooled. The outcomes of interest were the occurrence of LR and/or LRR. A 1-stage meta-analytic approach was used. Cox proportional hazards regression models were applied to identify factors that were predictive of LR and LRR, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 9 studies (4125 patients) provided their data sets. The 10-year LR rate was 6.5%, whereas the 10-year LRR rate was 10.3%. Four factors were found to be associated with a higher risk of LR: 1) estrogen receptor-negative disease; 2) cN+disease; 3) a lack of pathologic complete response in axilla (pN0); and 4) pN2 to pN3 disease. The predictive score for LR determined 3 risk groups: a low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk group with 10-year LR rates of 4.0%, 7.9%, and 20.4%, respectively. Two additional factors were found to be associated with an increased risk of LRR: cT3 to cT4 disease and a lack of pathologic complete response in the breast. The predictive score for LRR determined 3 risk groups; a low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk group with 10-year LRR rates of 3.2%, 10.1%, and 24.1%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: BCT after NCT appears to be an oncologically safe procedure for a large percentage of patients with breast cancer. Two easy-to-use clinical scores were developed that can help clinicians to identify patients at higher risk of LR and LRR after NCT and BCT and individualize the postoperative treatment plan and follow-up.

TI  - High resolution mapping of soil organic carbon stocks using remote sensing variables in the semi-arid rangelands of eastern Australia
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Efficient and effective modelling methods to assess soil organic carbon (SOC) stock are central in understanding the global carbon cycle and informing related land management decisions. However, mapping SOC stocks in semi-arid rangelands is challenging clue to the lack of data and poor spatial coverage. The use of remote sensing data to provide an indirect measurement of SOC to inform digital soil mapping has the potential to provide more reliable and cost-effective estimates of SOC compared with field-based, direct measurement. Despite this potential, the role of remote sensing data in improving the knowledge of soil information in semi-arid rangelands has not been fully explored. This study firstly investigated the use of high spatial resolution satellite data (seasonal fractional cover data; SFC) together with elevation, lithology, climatic data and observed soil data to map the spatial distribution of SOC at two soil depths (0-5 cm and 0-30 cm) in semi-arid rangelands of eastern Australia. Overall, model performance statistics showed that random forest (RF) and boosted regression trees (BRT) models performed better than support vector machine (SVM). The models obtained moderate results with R-2 01 032 for SOC stock at 0-5 cm and 044 at 0-30 cm, RMSE of 3.51 Mg C ha(-1) at 0-5 cm and 9.16 Mg C ha(-1) at 0-30 cm without considering SEC covariates. In contrast, by including SEC, the model accuracy for predicting SOC stock improved by 7.4-12.7% at 0-5 cm, and by 2.8-5.9% at 0-30 cm, highlighting the importance of including SEC to enhance the performance of the three modelling techniques. Furthermore, our models produced a more accurate and higher resolution digital SOC stock map compared with other available mapping products for the region. The data and high-resolution maps from this study can be used for future soil carbon assessment and monitoring. (C) 2018 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved.

TI  - High performance of chlorophyll-<i>a</i> prediction algorithms based on simulated OLCI Sentinel-3A bands in cyanobacteria-dominated inland waters
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this research, we have investigated whether the chlorophyll-a (chl a) retrieval algorithms based on OLCI Sentinel-3A bands are suitable for cyanobacteria-dominated waters. Phytoplankton assemblages model optical properties of the water, influencing the performance of bio-optical algorithms. Understanding these processes is important to improve the prediction of photoactive pigments in order to use them as a proxy for trophic state and harmful algal bloom. So that, both empirical and semi-analytical approaches designed for different inland waters were tested. In addition, empirical models were tuned based on dataset collected in situ. The study was conducted in the Funil hydroelectric reservoir, where chl a ranged from 2.33 to 208.68 mg m(-3) in May 2012 (austral fall) and 4.37 to 306.03 mg m(-3) in October 2012 (austral spring). OLCI Sentinel-3A bands were tested in existing algorithms developed for other sensors and new band combinations were compared to analyze the errors produced. Normalized Difference Chlorophyll Index (NDCI) exhibited the best performance, with a Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) of 9.30%. Result showed that wavelength at 665 nm is adequate to estimate chl a, although the maximum pigment absorption band is shifted due to phycocyanin fluorescence at approximately 650 nm.

TI  - Inverted stream channels in the Western Desert of Egypt: Synergistic remote, field observations and laboratory analysis on Earth with applications to Mars
T2  - ICARUS
M3  - Article
AB  - Inverted relief landforms occur in numerous regions on Mars, ranging in age from Noachian to more recent Amazonian periods (<3.0 Ga). A better understanding of the conditions in which inverted fluvial channel features on Earth form, and the geologic records they preserve in arid settings, can yield insights into the development of inverted landforms on Mars. Inverted channel landforms in the Western Desert of Egypt are well represented across an area of similar to 27,000 km(2). We investigated inverted channel features at seven sites using remotely-sensed data, field observations, and lab analysis. Inverted channel features in the Western Desert record fluvial environments of differing scales and ages. They developed mainly via inversion of cemented valley floor sediment, but there is a possibility that inverted fluvial landforms in the Dakhla Depression might have been buried, lithified, and exhumed. A few examples, in the southeastern part of the Western Desert, record, instead, a resistance to erosion caused by surface armouring of uncemented valley floor sediment. We show that the grain-size distribution for investigated and reviewed inverted channels is highly variable, with boulders that are commonly 0.35-1 m in size; large particles provide high porosity that influences the cementation mechanism. The studied inverted channel sediments are mainly cemented with ferricrete, calcrete, gyperete, and silcrete. Inverted channels are valuable for the reconstruction of paleoclimate cycles or episodes on Earth and Mars; observations from the Western Desert, when offered as analogs, add to the growing list of Earth examples that provide suites of observables relevant to reconstruction of paleoenvironmental conditions on Mars.

TI  - Evaluation and hydrological application of satellite-based precipitation datasets in driving hydrological models over the Huifa river basin in Northeast China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based precipitation estimates with high spatial and temporal resolution and large areal coverage have provided hydrologists a potential alternative source for hydrological applications since the last few years, especially for ungauged regions. This study evaluates five satellite-based precipitation datasets, namely, Fengyun, TRMM 3B42, TRMM 3B42RT, CMORPHBLD and CMORPH RAW, against gauge observations for streamflow simulation with a distributed hydrological model (SWAT) over the Huifa river basin, Northeast China. Results show that, by comparing the statistical indices (MA, MSP, STDE, ME, BIAS and CC) and inter annual precipitation, it is demonstrated that Fengyun TRMM 3B42 and CMORPH_BLD show better agreement with gauge precipitation data than CMORPH RAW and TRMM 3B42RT. When the SWAT model for each dataset calibrated and validated individually, satisfactory model performances (defined as: NS > 0.5) are achieved at daily scale for Fengyun, TRMM 3B42 and gauge-driven model, and very good performances (defined as: NS > 0.75) are achieved at monthly scale for Fengyun and gauge-driven model, respectively. The CMORPHBLD forced daily simulations also yield higher values of NS and R-2 than CMORPH RAW and TRMM 3B42RT at daily and monthly step. From the uncertainty results, variations of P-factor values and frequency distribution curves of NS suggest that the simulation uncertainty increase when operating the Fengyun, 3B42RT, CMORPH_BLD and CMORPH RAW-driven model with best fitted parameters for rain gauge SWAT model. The results also indicate that the influence of parameter uncertainty on model simulation results may be greater than the effect of input data accuracy. It is noted that uncertainty analysis is necessary to evaluate the hydrological applications of satellite-based precipitation datasets.

TI  - Sea-surface dimethylsulfide (DMS) concentration from satellite data at global and regional scales
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The marine biogenic gas dimethylsulfide (DMS) modulates climate by enhancing aerosol light scattering and seeding cloud formation. However, the lack of time-and space-resolved estimates of DMS concentration and emission hampers the assessment of its climatic effects. Here we present DMSSAT, a new remote sensing algorithm that relies on macroecological relationships between DMS, its phytoplanktonic precursor dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSPt) and plankton light exposure. In the first step, planktonic DMSPt is estimated from satellite-retrieved chlorophyll a and the light penetration regime as described in a previous study (Gali et al., 2015). In the second step, DMS is estimated as a function of DMSPt and photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) at the sea surface with an equation of the form: log(10)DMS = alpha + beta log(10)DMSPt + gamma PAR. The two-step DMSSAT algorithm is computationally light and can be optimized for global and regional scales. Validation at the global scale indicates that DMSSAT has better skill than previous algorithms and reproduces the main climatological features of DMS seasonality across contrasting biomes. The main shortcomings of the global-scale optimized algorithm are related to (i) regional biases in remotely sensed chlorophyll (which cause underestimation of DMS in the Southern Ocean) and (ii) the inability to reproduce high DMS = DMSPt ratios in late summer and fall in specific regions (which suggests the need to account for additional DMS drivers). Our work also highlights the shortcomings of interpolated DMS climatologies, caused by sparse and biased in situ sampling. Time series derived from MODIS-Aqua in the subpolar North Atlantic between 2003 and 2016 show wide interannual variability in the magnitude and timing of the annual DMS peak(s), demonstrating the need to move beyond the classical climatological view. By providing synoptic time series of DMS emission, DMSSAT can leverage atmospheric chemistry and climate models and advance our understanding of plankton-aerosol-cloud interactions in the context of global change.

TI  - Potential geography and productivity of "Hass" avocado crops in Colombia estimated by ecological niche modeling
T2  - SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE
M3  - Article
AB  - Variation in environmental suitability across the geographic range of a species is common, with consequences for population health and production. Ecological niche modeling (ENM) is an effort to estimate environmental requirements of species based on associations between known geographic occurrences and environmental conditions at those sites, to allow estimation of the potential distribution of the species. We developed an ENM for Hass avocado production fields in Colombia, in which we related the distribution of avocado production lots to environmental information derived from multitemporal MODIS satellite imagery and digital elevation models. Models were calibrated using maximum entropy approaches, using likelihood and information content metrics to optimize model selection; model performance was measured in terms of omission error with respect to independent testing data. Two models were selected that presented best combinations of high information content, significance, and performance based on lower values of Akaike Information Criterion (AICc), partial receiver operating characteristic (partialROC), and low omission of independent testing data records. Suitability values from those models were compared to Hass avocado production; models were able to identify both novel areas with potential for cultivation, and sites where this crop has been planted in relatively unsuitable areas. A statistically significant positive relationship existed between suitability values from the models and avocado production, with different relationships for three technological levels. ENM approaches thus offer a useful and novel tool for exploring and designing sustainable agriculture systems, identifying areas with environmental potential in Colombia and currently not planted with Hass avocado.

TI  - Trend differences in lower stratospheric water vapour between Boulder and the zonal mean and their role in understanding fundamental observational discrepancies
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Trend estimates with different signs are reported in the literature for lower stratospheric water vapour considering the time period between the late 1980s and 2010. The NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) frost point hygrometer (FPH) observations at Boulder (Colorado, 40.0 degrees N, 105.2 degrees W) indicate positive trends (about 0.1 to 0.45 ppmvdecade(-1)). On the contrary, negative trends (approximately -0.2 to -0.1 ppmvdecade(-1)) are derived from a merged zonal mean satellite data set for a latitude band around the Boulder latitude. Overall, the trend differences between the two data sets range from about 0.3 to 0.5 ppmvdecade(-1), depending on altitude. It has been proposed that a possible explanation for these discrepancies is a different temporal behaviour at Boulder and the zonal mean. In this work we investigate trend differences between Boulder and the zonal mean using primarily simulations from ECHAM/MESSy (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Hamburg/Modular Earth Submodel System) Atmospheric Chemistry (EMAC), WACCM (Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model), CMAM (Canadian Middle Atmosphere Model) and CLaMS (Chemical Lagrangian Model of the Stratosphere). On shorter timescales we address this aspect also based on satellite observations from UARS/HALOE (Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite/Halogen Occultation Experiment), Envisat/MIPAS (Environmental Satellite/Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding) and Aura/MLS (Microwave Limb Sounder). Overall, both the simulations and observations exhibit trend differences between Boulder and the zonal mean. The differences are dependent on altitude and the time period considered. The model simulations indicate only small trend differences between Boulder and the zonal mean for the time period between the late 1980s and 2010. These are clearly not sufficient to explain the discrepancies between the trend estimates derived from the FPH observations and the merged zonal mean satellite data set. Unless the simulations underrepresent variability or the trend differences originate from smaller spatial and temporal scales than resolved by the model simulations, trends at Boulder for this time period should also be quite representative for the zonal mean and even other latitude bands. Trend differences for a decade of data are larger and need to be kept in mind when comparing results for Boulder and the zonal mean on this timescale. Beyond that, we find that the trend estimates for the time period between the late 1980s and 2010 also significantly differ among the simulations. They are larger than those derived from the merged satellite data set and smaller than the trend estimates derived from the FPH observations.

TI  - Monitoring and predicting land use and land cover changes using remote sensing and GIS techniques-A case study of a hilly area, Jiangle, China
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover change research has been applied to landslides, erosion, land planning and global change. Based on the CA-Markov model, this study predicts the spatial patterns of land use in 2025 and 2036 based on the dynamic changes in land use patterns using remote sensing and geographic information system. CA-Markov integrates the advantages of cellular automata and Markov chain analysis to predict future land use trends based on studies of land use changes in the past. Based on Landsat 5 TM images from 1992 and 2003 and Landsat 8 OLI images from 2014, this study obtained a land use classification map for each year. Then, the genetic transition probability from 1992 to 2003 was obtained by IDRISI software. Based on the CA-Markov model, a predicted land use map for 2014 was obtained, and it was validated by the actual land use results of 2014 with a Kappa index of 0.8128. Finally, the land use patterns of 2025 and 2036 in Jiangle County were determined. This study can provide suggestions and a basis for urban development planning in Jiangle County.

TI  - The Google Earth Engine Digitisation Tool (GEEDiT) and the Margin change Quantification Tool (MaQiT) - simple tools for the rapid mapping and quantification of changing Earth surface margins
T2  - EARTH SURFACE DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in margins derived from satellite imagery are quantitative indicators of the environmental processes and drivers acting on the Earth's surface, for example retreating ice margins or coastal changes with rising sea level. However, the large-scale rapid visualisation and analysis of the satellite record is often impractical due to factors such as computer processing power, software availability, internet connection speed and/or user expertise in remote sensing. Here are presented three new, freely accessible tools that together can be used to process, visualise and review data from the full Landsat 4-8 and Sentinel 1-2 satellite records in seconds, enabling efficient mapping (through manual digitisation) and automated quantification of margin changes. These tools are highly accessible for users from a range of remote-sensing expertise (from academics to high school students), with minimal computational, licensing and knowledge-based barriers to access. The Google Earth Engine Digitisation Tool (GEEDiT) allows users to define a point anywhere on the planet and filter data from each satellite for user-defined time frames, maximum acceptable cloud cover extent, and options of predefined or custom image band combinations via a simple graphical user interface (GUI). GEEDiT allows georeferenced vectors to be easily and rapidly mapped from each image, with image metadata and user notes automatically appended to each vector, which can then be exported for subsequent analysis. The GEEDiT Reviewer tool allows users to quality control their own/others' data and also filter existing datasets based on the spatial/temporal requirements for their particular research question. The Margin change Quantification Tool (MaQiT) is complementary to GEEDiT and GEEDiT Reviewer, allowing the rapid quantification of these margin changes by utilising two well-established methods that have previously been used to measure glacier margin change and two new methods via a similarly simple GUI. A case study of the lake-terminating glacier Breioamer-kuijokull, Iceland, is used to demonstrate the complementary functionality of GEEDiT, GEEDiT Reviewer and MaQiT, though it should be noted that MaQiT is also suitable for the (re-)analysis of existing datasets not generated by GEEDiT. MaQiT has been developed with the original aim of quantifying tidewater glacier terminus change, though the methods included within the tool have potential for wide applications in multiple areas of Earth surface science (e.g. coastal and vegetation extent change). It is hoped that these tools will allow a wide range of researchers and students across the geosciences to efficiently map, analyse and access volumes of data that would have previously proven prohibitive.

TI  - Exploring systematic offsets between aerosol products from the two MODIS sensors
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term measurements of global aerosol loading and optical properties are essential for assessing climate-related questions. Using observations of spectral reflectance and radiance, the dark-target (DT) aerosol retrieval algorithm is applied to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer sensors on both Terra (MODIS-T) and Aqua (MODIS-A) satellites, deriving products (known as MOD04 and MYD04, respectively) of global aerosol optical depth (AOD at 0.55 mu m) over both land and ocean, and an angstrom ngstrom exponent (AE derived from 0.55 and 0.86 mu m) over ocean. Here, we analyze the overlapping time series (since mid-2002) of the Collection 6 (C6) aerosol products. Global monthly mean AOD from MOD04 (Terra with morning overpass) is consistently higher than MYD04 (Aqua with afternoon overpass) by similar to 13% (similar to 0.02 over land and similar to 0.015 over ocean), and this offset (MOD04 -MYD04) has seasonal as well as long-term variability. Focusing on 2008 and deriving yearly gridded mean AOD and AE, we find that, over ocean, the MOD04 (morning) AOD is higher and the AE is lower. Over land, there is more variability, but only biomass-burning regions tend to have AOD lower for MOD04. Using simulated aerosol fields from the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS-5) Earth system model and sampling separately (in time and space) along each MODIS-observed swath during 2008, the magnitudes of morning versus afternoon offsets of AOD and AE are smaller than those in the C6 products. Since the differences are not easily attributed to either aerosol diurnal cycles or sampling issues, we test additional corrections to the input reflectance data. The first, known as C6+, corrects for long-term changes to each sensor's polarization sensitivity and the response versus the scan angle and to cross-calibration from MODIS-T to MODIS-A. A second convolves the detrending and cross-calibration into scaling factors. Each method was applied upstream of the aerosol retrieval using 2008 data. While both methods reduced the overall AOD offset over land from 0.02 to 0.01, neither significantly reduced the AOD offset over ocean. The overall negative AE offset was reduced. A collection (C6.1) of all MODIS Atmosphere products was released, but we expect that the C6.1 aerosol products will maintain similar overall AOD and AE offsets. We conclude that (a) users should not interpret global differences between Terra and Aqua aerosol products as representing a true diurnal signal in the aerosol. (b) Because the MODIS-A product appears to have an overall smaller bias compared to ground-truth data, it may be more suitable for some applications. However (c), since the AOD offset is only similar to 0.02 and within the noise level for single retrievals, both MODIS products may be adequate for most applications.

TI  - Phytoplankton size class in the East China Sea derived from MODIS satellite data
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The distribution and variation of phytoplankton size class (PSC) are key to understanding ocean biogeochemical processes and ecosystems. Remote sensing of the PSC in the East China Sea (ECS) remains a challenge, although many algorithms have been developed to estimate PSC. Here based on a local dataset from the ECS, a regional model was tuned to estimate the PSC from the spectral features of normalized phytoplankton absorption (a(ph)) using a principal component analysis approach. Before applying the refined PSC model to MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data, reconstructing satellite remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) at 412 and 443 nm was critical through modeling them from R-rs between 469 and 555 nm using multiple regression analysis. Satellite-derived PSC results compared well with those derived from pigment composition, which demonstrated the potential of satellite ocean color data to estimate PSC distributions in the ECS from space. Application of the refined PSC model to the reconstructed MODIS data from 2003 to 2016 yielded the seasonal distributions of the PSC in the ECS, suggesting that the PSC distributions were heterogeneous in both temporal and spatial scales. Micro-phytoplankton were dominant in coastal waters throughout the year, especially in the Changjiang estuary. For the middle shelf region, the seasonal shifts from the dominance of micro- and nano-phytoplankton in the winter and spring to the dominance of nano-and pico-phytoplankton in the summer and autumn were observed. Pico-phytoplankton were especially dominant in the Kuroshio region in the spring, summer, and autumn. The seasonal variations of the PSC in the ECS were probably affected by a combination of the water column stability, upwelling, sea surface temperature, and the Kuroshio. Additionally, human activity and riverine discharge might also influence the PSC distribution in the ECS, especially in the coastal region.

TI  - Melting and fragmentation laws from the evolution of two large Southern Ocean icebergs estimated from satellite data
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The evolution of the thickness and area of two large Southern Ocean icebergs that have drifted in open water for more than a year is estimated through the combined analysis of altimeter data and visible satellite images. The observed thickness evolution is compared with iceberg melting predictions from two commonly used melting formulations, allowing us to test their validity for large icebergs. The first formulation, based on a fluid dynamics approach, tends to underestimate basal melt rates, while the second formulation, which considers the thermodynamic budget, appears more consistent with observations. Fragmentation is more important than melting for the decay of large icebergs. Despite its importance, fragmentation remains poorly documented. The correlation between the observed volume loss of our two icebergs and environmental parameters highlights factors most likely to promote fragmentation. Using this information, a bulk model of fragmentation is established that depends on ocean temperature and iceberg velocity. The model is effective at reproducing observed volume variations. The size distribution of the calved pieces is estimated using both altimeter data and visible images and is found to be consistent with previous results and typical of brittle fragmentation processes. These results are valuable in accounting for the freshwater flux constrained by large icebergs in models.

TI  - Mapping of peanut crops in Queensland, Australia, using time-series PROBA-V 100-m normalized difference vegetation index imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping of peanut crops is essential in supporting peanut production, yield prediction, and commodity forecasting. While ground-based surveys can be used over small areas, the development of remote-sensing technologies could provide rapid and inexpensive crop area estimates with high accuracy over large regions. Some of these recent earth observation satellite systems, such as the Project for On-Board Autonomy Vegetation (PROBA-V), have the advantage of increased spatial and temporal resolution. With a study area located in the South Burnett region, Queensland, Australia, the primary aim of this study was to assess the ability of time-series PROBA-V 100-m normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for peanut crop mapping. Two datasets, i.e., PROBA-V NDVI time-series imagery and the corresponding phenological parameters generated from TIMESAT data analysis technique, were classified using maximum likelihood classification, spectral angle mapper, and minimum distance classification algorithms. The results show that among all methods used, the application of MLC in PROBA-V NDVI time series produced very good overall accuracy, i.e., 92.75%, with producer and user accuracy of each class <= 78.79%. For all algorithms tested, the mapping of peanut cropping areas produced satisfactory classification results, i.e., 75.95% to 100%. Our study confirmed that the use of finer resolution 100 m of PROBA-V imagery (i.e., relative to MODIS 250-m data) has contributed to the success of mapping peanut and other crops in the study area.

TI  - Remotely sensed soil moisture to estimate savannah NDVI
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is a common data source for monitoring regional and global ecosystem properties. In dry lands it has contributed to estimation of inter-annual and seasonal vegetation dynamics and phenology. However, due to the spectral properties of NDVI it can be affected by clouds which can introduce missing data in the time series. Remotely sensed soil moisture has in contrast to NDVI the benefit of being unaffected by clouds due to the measurements being made in the microwave domain. There is therefore a potential in combining the remotely sensed NDVI with remotely sensed soil moisture to enhance the quality and estimate the missing data. We present a step towards the usage of remotely sensed soil moisture for estimation of savannah NDVI. This was done by evaluating the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) soil moisture and three of its individual products with respect to their relative performance. The individual products are from the advance scatterometer (ASCAT), Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS), and the Land Parameter Retrieval Model-Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (LPRM-AMSR-E). Each dataset was used to simulate NDVI, which was subsequently compared to remotely sensed NDVI from MODIS. Differences in their ability to estimate NDVI indicated that, on average, CCI soil moisture differs from its individual products by showing a higher average correlation with measured NDVI. Overall NDVI modelled from CCI soil moisture gave an average correlation of 0.81 to remotely sensed NDVI which indicates its potential to be used to estimate seasonal variations in savannah NDVI. Our result shows promise for further development in using CCI soil moisture to estimate NDVI. The modelled NDVI can potentially be used together with other remotely sensed vegetation datasets to enhance the phenological information that can be acquired, thereby, improving the estimates of savannah vegetation phenology.

TI  - Greenland Ice Mapping Project: ice flow velocity variation at sub-monthly to decadal timescales
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - We describe several new ice velocity maps produced by the Greenland Ice Mapping Project (GIMP) using Landsat 8 and Copernicus Sentinel 1A/B data. We then focus on several sites where we analyse these data in conjunction with earlier data from this project, which extend back to the year 2000. At Jakobshavn Isbrae and Koge Bugt, we find good agreement when comparing results from different sensors. In a change from recent behaviour, Jakobshavn Isbrae began slowing substantially in 2017, with a midsummer peak that was even slower than some previous winter minima. Over the last decade, we identify two major slowdown events at Koge Bugt that coincide with short-term advances of the terminus. We also examined populations of glaciers in north-west and south-west Greenland to produce a record of speed-up since 2000. Collectively these glaciers continue to speed up, but there are regional differences in the timing of periods of peak speed-up. In addition, we computed trends in winter flow speed for much of the south-west margin of the ice sheet and find little in the way of statistically significant changes over the period covered by our data. Finally, although the consistency of the data is generally good over time and across sensors, our analysis indicates that substantial differences can arise in regions with high strain rates (e.g. shear margins) where sensor resolution can become a factor. For applications such as constraining model inversions, users should factor in the impact that the data's resolution has on their results.

TI  - Bright lights, big city: Causal effects of population and GDP on urban brightness
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Cities are arguably both the cause, and answer, to societies' current sustainability issues. Urbanization is the interplay between a city's physical growth and its socio-economic development, both of which consume a substantial amount of energy and resources. Knowledge of the underlying driver(s) of urban expansion facilitates not only academic research but, more importantly, bridges the gap between science, policy drafting, and practical urban management. An increasing number of researchers are recognizing the benefits of innovative remotely sensed datasets, such as nighttime lights data (NTL), as a proxy to map urbanization and subsequently examine the driving socio-economic variables in cities. We further these approaches, by taking a trans-pacific view, and examine how an array of socio-economic ind0icators of 25 culturally and economically important urban hubs relate to long term patterns in NTL for the past 21 years. We undertake a classic econometric approach-panel causality tests which allow analysis of the causal relationships between NTL and socio-economic development across the region. The panel causality test results show a contrasting effect of population and gross domestic product (GDP) on NTL in fast, and slowly, changing cities. Information derived from this study quantitatively chronicles urban activities in the pan-Pacific region and potentially offers data for studies that spatially track local progress of sustainable urban development goals.

TI  - Relation between the coupling and tremor rates in the transition zone around the Shikoku region
T2  - EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - We examine the spatiotemporal distributions of the interplate couplings and the tremor count rate in the Shikoku region, which is located in the western part of the Nankai subduction zone in Japan, from July 2007 to June 2015 by comparing the results of static geodetic inversion using onshore global navigation satellite system data and the published tremor catalog. We observe that the temporal fluctuations in these two rates correlated well at a few spotlike points in the tremor-occurrence zone at a deeper location next to the strongly coupled area. The well-correlated points are densely distributed around the long-term slow slip area in the Bungo Channel and are randomly dispersed in the central and eastern portions. The correlation coefficients of the well-correlated points differ from point to point; however, at some points, zero tremor counts can be expected when the coupling rates reach the plate convergence rate. This indicates that tremors occur on the plate interface and that the tremor count rates can be used as proxies for monitoring the small fluctuations in interplate coupling.

TI  - Three-phase Evolution of a Coronal Hole. I. 360° Remote Sensing and In Situ Observations
T2  - ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigate the evolution of a well-observed, long-lived, low-latitude coronal hole (CH) over 10 solar rotations in the year 2012. By combining extreme ultraviolet (EUV) imagery from the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatories (STEREO-A/B) and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), we are able to track and study the entire evolution of the CH having a continuous 360 degrees coverage of the Sun. The remote sensing data are investigated together with in situ solar wind plasma and magnetic field measurements from STEREO-A/B, the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE), and WIND. From this, we obtain how different evolutionary states of the CH as observed in the solar atmosphere (changes in EUV intensity and area) affect the properties of the associated highspeed stream measured at 1 au. Most distinctly pronounced for the CH area, three development phases are derived: (a) growing, (b) maximum, and (c) decaying phase. During these phases the CH area (a) increases over a duration of around three months from about 1 . 10(10) km(2) to 6 . 10(10) km(2), (b) keeps a rather constant area for about one month of > 9 . 10(10) km(2), and (c) finally decreases in the following three months below 1 . 10(10) km(2) until the CH cannot be identified anymore. The three phases manifest themselves also in the EUV intensity and in in situ measured solar wind proton bulk velocity. Interestingly, the three phases are related to a different range in solar wind speed variations, and we find for the growing phase a range of 460-600 km. s(-1), for the maximum phase 600-720 km. s(-1), and for the decaying phase a more irregular behavior connected to slow and fast solar wind speeds of 350-550 km. s(-1).

TI  - An analysis of the cloud environment over the Ross Sea and Ross Ice Shelf using CloudSat/CALIPSO satellite observations: the importance of synoptic forcing
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We use the 2B-GEOPROF-LIDAR R04 (2BGL4) and R05 (2BGL5) products and the 2B-CLDCLASS-LIDAR R04 (2BCL4) product, all generated by combining CloudSat radar and CALIPSO lidar satellite measurements with auxiliary data, to examine the vertical distribution of cloud occurrence around the Ross Ice Shelf (RIS) and Ross Sea region. We find that the 2BGL4 product, used in previous studies in this region, displays a discontinuity at 8.2 km which is not observable in the other products. This artefact appears to correspond to a change in the horizontal and vertical resolution of the CALIPSO dataset used above this level. We then use the 2BCL4 product to examine the vertical distribution of cloud occurrence, phase, and type over the RIS and Ross Sea. In particular we examine how synoptic conditions in the region, derived using a previously developed synoptic classification, impact the cloud environment and the contrasting response in the two regions. We observe large differences between the cloud occurrence as a function of altitude for synoptic regimes relative to those for seasonal variations. A stronger variation in the occurrence of clear skies and multi-layer cloud and in all cloud type occurrences over both the Ross Sea and RIS is associated more with synoptic type than seasonal composites. In addition, anomalies from the mean joint histogram of cloud top height against thickness display significant differences over the Ross Sea and RIS sectors as a function of synoptic regime, but are near identical over these two regions when a seasonal analysis is completed. However, the frequency of particular phases of cloud, notably mixed phase and water, is much more strongly modulated by seasonal than synoptic regime compositing, which suggests that temperature is still the most important control on cloud phase in the region.

TI  - Data Descriptor: FRY, a global database of fire patch functional traits derived from space-borne burned area products
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Vegetation fires are intrinsic ecosystem disturbances of the Earth system. Global burned area products have been delivered from several space-borne instruments, and have recently provided pixel-level information underpinning fire spread processes. Here we present FRY, a global database of fire patches with morphology-based functional traits reconstructed from pixel-based burned areas derived from the MODIS and MERIS imagery using a flood-fill algorithm. Each fire patch is characterized by the geo-location of its center, area, perimeter, the features of the ellipse fitted over its pixel's spatial distribution, and different indices of patch complexity. We obtained a consistent spatial distribution of global fire patch functional traits between the MCD64A1 Collection 6 and the MERIS fire_cci v4.1 datasets during their overlap period (2005-2011), confirming the robustness of the applied algorithm and the consistency between both products. This database is relevant to a broad spectrum of fire-related applications such as local to global functional pyrodiversity, fire emissions quantification, and the benchmarking of fire modules embedded in dynamic global vegetation models.

TI  - Review article: Detection of inundation areas due to the 2015 Kanto and Tohoku torrential rain in Japan based on multi-temporal ALOS-2 imagery
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Torrential rain triggered by two typhoons hit the Kanto and Tohoku regions of Japan from 9 to 11 September 2015. Due to the record-breaking amount of rainfall, several riverbanks were overflowed and destroyed, causing floods over wide areas. The PALSAR-2 sensor on board the ALOS-2 satellite engaged in emergency observations of the affected areas during and after the heavy rain. Two pre-event and three co-event PALSAR-2 images were employed in this study to extract flooded areas in the city of Joso, Ibaraki Prefecture. The backscattering coefficient of the river water was investigated first using the PALSAR-2 intensity images and a land-cover map with a 10m resolution. The inundation areas were then extracted by setting threshold values for backscattering from water surfaces in the three temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. The extracted results were modified by considering the land cover and a digital elevation model (DEM). Next, the inundated built-up urban areas were extracted from the changes in SAR backscattering. The results were finally compared with those from visual inspections of airborne imagery by the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan (GSI), and more than 85% of the maximum inundation areas were extracted successfully.

TI  - Seasonal behaviour of upper ocean freshwater content in the Bay of Bengal: synergistic approach using model and satellite data
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Any change in precipitation, evaporation and river discharge, by virtue of its impact on the distribution of ocean salinity, leaves its inevitable signature on the freshwater content (FWC) in the oceans. In this study, synergistic use of satellite data and numerical ocean circulation model is explored to examine the seasonality of FWC of the upper 30 m water column of the Bay of Bengal (BoB). For this purpose, first the sea surface salinity (SSS) from Aquarius is assimilated into a model of the Indian Ocean. Strength of assimilation is judged by comparing simulated SSS with satellite and Argo datasets. An overall improvement of 39% is observed in SSS over free run of the model without data assimilation. Next, the focus is shifted to the spatial and temporal variability of FWC of the upper 30 m of BoB in relation to the different components of freshwater forcing. A delay of three months in the peak of FWC is observed with respect to the peak of net freshwater influx for BoB as a whole. However, the nature of the response of FWC to the total freshwater input forcing in the major river-dominated regions of BoB is different from that for the whole BoB. The relative role of river influx in controlling FWC in these regions is well brought out in the study. For the Ganga-Brahmaputra region, river run-off is observed to be a crucial parameter in regulating FWC, whereas for both Irrawaddy river region and central BoB, precipitation dominates the response. The response of salinity in the uppermost part of the northern BoB to the total freshwater input is much more rapid than in the other regions.

AB  - Corbett National Park (CNP), Uttarakhand, India is currently facing pressure of encroachments from human settlements around the buffer zone leading to increasing human and animal conflicts. In the present study, we have analysed the extent of land-use/land-cover (LULC) changes between 1976 and 2011 using medium-spatial-resolution satellite data in and around CNP. Future projections have also been generated using CA-Markov and agent-based SaarS model. The study highlights that unlike in the past decades, the projected LULC may undergo restricted growth in built-up area agriculture.

TI  - Remote Sensing Inversion of Soil Organic Matter Based on Broad Band and Narrow Band Comprehensive Spectral Index
T2  - LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Comparing the soil organic matter (SOM) prediction model based on the broad and narrow bands and the difference in spatial pattern distribution, we validate the feasibility of using satellite remote sensing data to monitor soil basic ecological parameters by ground hyperspectral measurement and analysis of soil. Taking the soil of Tianshan as the research object, we calculate comprehensive spectral index of the broad and narrow band, respectively, using correlation analysis and principal component analysis in the organic matter of unmanned interference area, human interference area, and choosing the comprehensive spectral index with better correlation coefficient and characteristic vector value as the independent variables, using multivariate linear regression model (MLR) and partial least squares regression model (PLSR) to establish respectively the hyperspectral prediction model of SOM in broad and narrow band of unmanned interference area and human interference area. The validation, the comparison and selection the model arc carried out. Finally, we analyze and inverse the spatial pattern of SOM content based on the best model of research area. Results show that, through the correlation analysis and principal component analysis of the organic matter and salinity index, vegetation index to establish the MLR and PLSR of organic matter component, we pick out the salinity index 2 (SI2), salinity index 3 (SI3) and ratio vegetation index (RVI), normalized difference vegetation index (NOVI) of narrow band, and the SI1, SI2, RVI, NOVI of broad band in unmanned interference area; we pick out SI1, SI3, RVI and NII)V1 of narrow band, and SI1, SI2, RVI and renormalized difference vegetation index (RDVI) of broad band. Taking these parameters as independent variables, we build MLR and PLSR models of soil organic matter. By comparing the precision of the models, we find that the PLSR model with narrow band has high precision in human or unmanned interference areas, and determinable coefficient and relative percent deviation arc 0.753, 2.01 and 0.819 and 2.14, respectively. Spatial inversion and analysis of SOM in research area arc carried out based on the best model above. The mass fraction of organic matter in unmanned interference area is concentrated in less than 10X 10(-3), and presents the trend of low in middle and high in around. The mass fraction of organic matter in human interference is 10X 10(-3)-15X 10(-3), presents the trend of low in southwest and northeast, and high around middle north region.

TI  - Absence of Detectable Precursory Deformation and Velocity Variation Before the Large Dome Collapse of July 2015 at Volcan de Colima, Mexico
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Improving the ability to foresee volcanic eruption is one of the main objectives of volcanologists. For this purpose, it is essential to better detect eruption forerunners and to understand their relationship with eruptive processes. The evaluation of the performance of the forecasting methods partly relies on the estimation of the frequency of occurrence of the various precursory phenomena. Possible lack of precursor before some events must also be carefully documented and analyzed. In this study, we check for the existence of detectable precursors before the large dome collapse event of Volcan de Colima, which occurred in July 2015, leading to the emplacement of more than 10 km long Pyroclastics Density Currents and the opening of a large breach in the crater. Based on volumes of emitted magma, the 2015 eruption is the largest event recorded at Volcan de Colima since the 1913 Plinian eruption. Surface displacements in the summit cone area are quantified over the period November 2014-June 2015 based on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images acquired by Sentinel-1 satellite. Velocity variations are investigated by coda wave interferometry. Daily cross-correlation functions of seismic noise recorded at 5 broadband stations are calculated for the period January 2013-April 2017 and apparent velocity variations are obtained by applying the stretching method. We show that no significant surface deformation can be measured by the SAR images over an area reaching 5 km from the summit, such that the volume of emitted magma cannot have been accommodated elastically in the 6 months preceding the eruption at a depth shallower than 5 km. The time series of apparent velocity variations display fluctuations of the order of 0.05% with characteristic time shorter than 1 month. Sharp velocity decreases of up to 0.2% are associated with strong regional tectonic earthquakes. However, no velocity change with amplitude larger than the noise level is observed before the July 2015 eruption. The behavior of the surface deformation and the velocity variation is consistent with the relative quiescence of the volcano-tectonic and low-frequency seismic activities observed before this large eruptive event. This situation could be frequent in case of so called open systems, where additional magma input is directly transferred to the surface, producing dome modification, without significant pressurization of the plumbing system.

TI  - Underway spectrophotometry in the Fram Strait (European Arctic Ocean): a highly resolved chlorophyll <i>a</i> data source for complementing satellite ocean color
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing of chlorophyll a concentration (Chl-a) in the Arctic Ocean is spatially and temporally limited and needs to be supplemented and validated with substantial volumes of in situ observations. Here, we evaluated the capability of obtaining highly resolved in situ surface Chl-a using underway spectrophotometry operated during two summer cruises in 2015 and 2016 in the Fram Strait. Results showed that Chl-a measured using high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) was well related (R-2 = 0.90) to the collocated particulate absorption line height at 676 nm obtained from the underway spectrophotometry system. This enabled continuous surface Chl-a estimation along the cruise tracks. When used to validate Chl-a operational products as well as to assess the Chl-a algorithms of the aqua moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS-A) and Sentinel-3 Ocean Land Color Imager (OLCI) Level 2 Chl-a operational products, and from OLCI Level 2 products processed with Polymer atmospheric correction algorithm (version 4.1), the underway spectrophotometry based Chl-a data sets proved to be a much more sufficient data source by generating over one order of magnitude more match-ups than those obtained from discrete water samples. Overall, the band ratio (OCI, OC4) Chl-a operational products from MODIS-A and OLCI as well as OLCI C2RCC products showed acceptable results. The OLCI Polymer standard output provided the most reliable Chl-a estimates, and nearly as good results were obtained from the OCI algorithm with Polymer atmospheric correction method. This work confirms the great advantage of the underway spectrophotometry in enlarging in situ Chl-a data sets for the Fram Strait and improving satellite Chl-a validation and Chl-a algorithm assessment over discrete water sample analysis in the laboratory.

M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVES This study investigated differences between transcatheter heart valve (THV) types and regarding debris captured by a cerebral embolic protection system (Claret Medical Sentinel, Santa Rosa, California).BACKGROUND Differences of THV types and cerebral injury after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) are not welt understood.METHODS A total of 246 patients pooled from 2 prospective studies (SENTINEL [Cerebral Protection in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement] trial, N = 100; SENTINEL-H [Histopathology of Embolic Debris Captured During Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement] trial, N = 146) were included in the analysis. Histopathologic assessment and histomorphometric analyses of debris were compared with THV types. Analyses were differentiated by particle size (>= 150, >= 500, and >= 1,000 mu m), particle count, total particle area, and maximum of largest dimension. Only commercially available THVs were included: 16% Evolut R (EvR), 15% Lotus, 59% SAPIEN 3 (53), and 10% SAPIEN XT (XT).RESULTS Particles were captured in 99% of patients. There was a significantly higher amount of debris related to the vascular bed (valve tissue, arterial watt, calcification) in EvR patients compared with S3 patients; 53% of all patients irrespective of valve type had at least 1 particle >= 1 mm. Larger particles (>= 500 and >= 1,000 mu m) were significantly more frequent in EvR than XT and S3 patients. Lotus patients with particles >= 1,000 mu m were significantly more frequent than in S3 patients. Particle count, total particle area, and maximum of largest dimension were significantly higher in both Lotus and EvR patients compared with S3 and XT.CONCLUSIONS Debris was captured in 99% of patients, of whom 53% had at least 1 particle of debris >1 mm. The number and size of particles captured during a procedure in which EvR or Lotus THV was used were higher and larger than with a Sapien THV. Regardless, embolic debris, including large particles, is universal across valve types and provides mechanistic support for the potential benefit of using cerebral embolic protection in all TAVR procedures.

TI  - Using CDOM optical properties for estimating DOC concentrations and <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> in the Lower Amazon River
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is one of the major contributors to the absorption budget of most freshwaters and can be used as a proxy to assess non-optical carbon fractions such as dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)). Nevertheless, riverine studies that explore the former relationships are still relatively scarce, especially within tropical regions. Here we document the spatial-seasonal variability of CDOM, DOC and pCO(2), and assess the potential of CDOM absorption coefficient (a(CDOM)(412)) for estimating DOC concentration and pCO(2) along the Lower Amazon River. Our results revealed differences in the dissolved organic matter (DOM) quality between clearwater (CW) tributaries and the Amazon River mainstream. A linear relationship between DOC and CDOM was observed when tributaries and mainstream are evaluated separately (Amazon River: N = 42, R-2 = 0.74, p<0.05; CW: N = 13, R-2 = 0.57, p<0.05). However, this linear relationship was not observed during periods of higher rainfall and river discharge, requiring a specific model for these time periods to be developed (N = 25, R-2 = 0.58, p<0.05). A strong linear positive relation was found between a(CDOM)(412) and pCO(2)(N = 69, R-2 = 0.65, p<0.05) along the lower river. pCO(2) was less affected by the optical difference between tributaries and mainstream waters or by the discharge conditions when compared to CDOM to DOC relationships. Including the river water temperature in the model improves our ability to estimate pCO(2) (N = 69; R-2 = 0.80, p<0.05). The ability to assess both DOC and pCO(2) from CDOM optical properties opens further perspectives on the use of ocean colour remote sensing data for monitoring carbon dynamics in large running water systems worldwide.

TI  - Sensitivity of biogenic volatile organic compound emissions to leaf area index and land cover in Beijing
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Beijing area has suffered from severe air pollution in recent years, including ozone pollution in the summer. In addition to the anthropogenic emissions inventory, understanding local ozone pollution requires a reliable biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emission inventory. Forest coverage rose from 20.6 to 35.8% from 1998 to 2013 in Beijing according to the National Forest Resource Survey (NFRS), and accurate representations of land cover for recent years is crucial for estimating BVOC emissions and their impacts on air quality. In this study, we established a high-resolution BVOC emission inventory in Beijing using the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN) v2.1 with three independent leaf area index (LAI) products and three independent land cover products. Various combinations of the Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS), Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MCD15, and GEOland (GEO) v2 LAI datasets and the Finer Resolution Observation and Monitoring of Global Land Cover (FROM-GLC), MODIS MCD12Q1 plant functional type (PFT) products, and Climate Change Initiative Land Cover (CCI LC) products are used in five model sensitivity experiments (E1-E5), and the experiment using the FROM-GLC with the highest spatial resolution of 30m and GLASS LAI products was treated as the baseline. These sensitivity calculations were driven by hourly, 3 km meteorological fields from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The following results were obtained: (1) according to the baseline estimate, the total amount of BVOC emissions is 75.9 Gg for the Beijing area, and isoprene, monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and other VOCs account for 37.6, 14.6, 1.8 and 46% of the total, respectively. Approximately three-quarters of BVOC emissions occur in the summer. (2) According to the sensitivity experiments, the LAI input does not significantly affect the BVOC emissions. Using MODIS MCD15Q1 and GEO v2 LAI led to slight declines of 2.6 and 1.4 %, respectively, of BVOC emissions in the same area. (3) The spatial distribution of PFTs from different inputs strongly influenced the spatial distribution of BVOC emissions. Furthermore, the cross-walking table for converting land cover classes to PFTs also has a strong impact on BVOC emissions; the sensitivity experiments showed that the estimate of BVOC emissions by CCI LC ranged from 42.1 to 70.2 Gg depending on the cross-walking table used.

TI  - Purification and identification of two novel antioxidant peptides from perilla (<i>Perilla frutescens</i> L. Britton) seed protein hydrolysates
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Proteins were extracted from perilla (Penile frutescens L. Britton) seed by-products and hydrolyzed with an alkaline protease. Antioxidant peptides were purified from the hydrolysate by size-exclusion chromatography and RP-HPLC. Two peptides with strong antioxidant activity were identified as Tyr-Leu (YL) and Phe-Tyr (FY) with the molecular mass of 294.33 Da and 328.33 Da, respectively. Synthesized YL and FY efficiently quenched free radicals (DPPH, ABTS and hydroxyl radicals) and showed high oxygen radical absorbance capacity. The two peptides also inhibited lipid peroxidation in the rat liver. Furthermore, YL and FY could protect HepG-2 cells against hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative damage without cytotoxicity. Based on the structure-activity analysis, the Tyr residue was crucial for the antioxidant activity of YL and FY. The results indicate that the protein hydrolysate from perilla seed by-products possessed potent biological activity and can be utilized to develop health-related nutraceutical ingredients.

AB  - A study of the properties of clouds at different levels within a front has been carried out by means of Meteosat images in the thermal infrared (IR) band. To do this, we define appropriate thresholds Brightness Temperature (TB) that allow delimit the area covered by clouds of different origin. First, the extensive area with brightness temperature less than 248 K, which is identified as a front, and on the other, the area of temperatures below 221 K associated with clouds of vertical development. The centers of the convective clouds obtained from the geographical position of the centers of gravity, have a remarkable alignment that it has been characterized by linear regression. It compares the alignment of the cumulus with the orientation of the front itself, as the main direction of it. This let us to develop a methodology for the comparative analysis of cloud structures of different origins, as well as improved knowledge of their properties and developments in the movement of synoptic systems, relative on the geographic parallels.

T2  - Huan jing ke xue= Huanjing kexue
M3  - English Abstract
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Two decades of PM2.5 pollution has seriously hindered China's sustainable development. However, relevant research of PM2.5 has been hindered because of the lack of long-term historical monitoring data. Therefore, ground observations of PM2.5 concentration from 2013 to 2016 in four typical regions of China and the MODIS aerosol optical thickness data, boundary layer height, temperature, and other meteorological data from 2000 to 2016 were used as the basic data. A combined simulation model was constructed by combining the two algorithms of backward artificial neural network and support vector regression and obtains the PM2.5 concentration history for the past 20 years using geospatial analysis technology. The results demonstrate that the combination model is better than the single model, with lower error and higher generalization ability. The spatial-temporal analysis results show that the concentration of PM2.5 continued to increase in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and in the three northeastern provinces of China, the PM2.5 concentration decreased slowly in the Pearl River Delta, the pollution range of PM2.5 in three of the research areas showed an expanding trend, and the PM2.5 concentration and pollution range remained stable in the Yangtze River Delta. In 2012, the concentration of PM2.5 in the four study areas decreased and the pollution range narrowed, but the PM2.5 concentration rose slightly after that decline and the high pollution range narrowed during 2013-2016, which with the country to take PM2.5 regional defense and other governance measures.

TI  - Transboundary ozone pollution across East Asia: daily evolution and photochemical production analysed by IASI+GOME2 multispectral satellite observations and models
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We characterise a transboundary ozone pollution outbreak transported across East Asia in early May 2009 using new multispectral satellite observations of lowermost tropospheric ozone (located below 3 km altitude) in synergy with other satellite data and models. Our analysis is focused on the daily evolution of ozone pollution plumes initially formed over the North China Plain (NCP) and their transport pathways over northern China, Korea, Japan and the surrounding seas. A main aspect of the study is an estimation of the contribution of photochemical production of ozone during transport using the ratio of ozone to carbon monoxide enhancements with respect to background levels derived from satellite data and also from chemistry-transport models.A key contribution of the analysis is the use of new satellite data offering unprecedented skills to observe the horizontal distribution of lowermost tropospheric ozone over East Asia on a daily basis, with a multispectral approach called IASI + GOME2 (combining Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer observations in the IR and Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 measurements in the UV). These satellite observations are in good agreement with ozonesondes, with low mean biases (3 %), a precision of about 16 %, a correlation coefficient of 0.85 and practically the same standard deviation for a comparison based on 2 years of data from 46 launching stations distributed worldwide, during all seasons. A similar agreement is also found over East Asia. Moreover, IASI + GOME2 offers a unique capacity for observing the evolution of near-surface ozone during pollution outbreaks (with 5% bias and 0.69 correlation), according to a comparison with surface in situ measurements during two major ozone events over several Japanese islands. Single-band ozone retrievals, such as those from IASI in the thermal infrared, do not capture such variability.Using IASI + GOME2, we show that (i) ozone pollution plumes are transported by an anticyclonic circulation around the Yellow Sea from the NCP to northern China, Korea and Japan, collocated with carbon monoxide plumes; (ii) over northern China the plume splits into two pollution filaments with one mixing with freshly emitted pollutants; and (iii) ozone is produced every day of the event, accounting for an enhancement in concentration during transport across East Asia of up to similar to 84% with respect to that produced over NCP. This estimation is done according to monotonically increasing values during 7 days of the ratio of ozone to carbon monoxide enhancements within the transported pollution plumes from about similar to 0.25 over the NCP to similar to 0.46 over the Pacific south of Japan.

TI  - Observational constraint on cloud susceptibility weakened by aerosol retrieval limitations
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol-cloud interactions remain a major uncertainty in climate research. Studies have indicated that model estimates of cloud susceptibility to aerosols frequently exceed satellite estimates, motivating model reformulations to increase agreement. Here we show that conventional ways of using satellite information to estimate susceptibility can serve as only a weak constraint on models because the estimation is sensitive to errors in the retrieval procedures. Using instrument simulators to investigate differences between model and satellite estimates of susceptibilities, we find that low aerosol loading conditions are not well characterized by satellites, but model clouds are sensitive to aerosol perturbations in these conditions. We quantify the observational requirements needed to constrain models, and find that the nighttime lidar measurements of aerosols provide a better characterization of tenuous aerosols. We conclude that observational uncertainties and limitations need to be accounted for when assessing the role of aerosols in the climate system.

TI  - Canine seroprevalence to <i>Orientia</i> species in southern Chile: A cross-sectional survey on the Chiloe A Island
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundScrub typhus is a potentially life-threatening vector- borne infection caused by Orientia species. It occurs mainly in the Asian-Pacific region, where it causes significant morbidity and mortality. Recently, an endemic focus of scrub typhus has been described in South America, on Chiloe A Island in southern Chile. Dogs have been used as sentinel hosts to determine the presence and spatial distribution of various vector-borne infections. Their suitability to gain insight into human exposure to Orientia tsutsugamushi has been suggested in studies from Asia.MethodologyIn January 2016, we conducted a cross-sectional study, which included the two main cities on Chiloe A Island. Canine blood samples were obtained in households, chosen by double stratified random sampling in urban and by convenience in rural locations. Specimens were tested by ELISA for IgG antibodies against whole-cell antigen preparations from three strains of O. tsutsugamushi. Data were further analyzed for factors associated with seropositivity including spatial clustering.ResultsSerum samples from 202 dogs (104 urban, 98 rural) were tested for IgG against O. tsutsugamushi, of which 43 (21.3%) were positive. Seroprevalence rates were higher in rural than in urban settings (p<0.01) and in older compared to younger dogs (p<0.01). Spatial analysis by LISA indicated the presence of four localities of highly grouped cases.ConclusionsThe detected seroprevalence supports the endemicity of scrub typhus in southern Chile and suggests a wide exposure of household dogs to the infected, yet unknown vector(s). The spatial data will be used for future research identifying further human cases as well as the local vector(s)/reservoirs for scrub typhus in southern Chile. The study reinforces that dogs are useful sentinels for Orientia spp. in regions of uncertain endemicity and distribution.

AB  - Objective: To analyze the hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) enterovirus 71 (EV-A71) infection epidemic characteristics of Guangdong Province from 2011 to 2015. Methods: We colleted data on common cases of hand-foot-mouth disease infected with EV-A71 reported from eight sentinel hospitals in Guangdong Province from January 2011 to December 2015, through the "Guangdong Province Acute Infectious Disease Surveillance Information Platform System" , including the age and incidence of cases. Time and etiological data, etc.We also collected data on the number of reported cases of HFMD disease and the number of laboratory-confirmed cases, through the "China Disease Prevention and Control Information System" , including data on common cases of HFMD disease, data on epidemics of severe cases and deaths, and the age, onset time, and pathogens of cases. Learning data, etc.The data from two sources were used to estimate the incidence of HFMD in EV-A71 and describe its distribution characteristics.Chi-square test was used to compare the positive rate of HF-A71 infection in hand-foot-mouth disease and the difference in estimated incidence among different age groups and months. Results: Eight sentinel hospitals from 2011 to 2015 reported a total of 1 855 common cases of EV-A71 infection, of which the highest was in 2014 (31.6%, 605/1 916) and the lowest was in 2015 (6.8%, 134/1 971) (chi(2)=521.85, P<0.001).According to the Disease Surveillance Reporting Information System, 1 772 516 cases of HFMD disease were reported from 2011 to 2015 in Guangdong Province, and 1 902 cases of severe and fatal cases of EV-A71 infection.The composition ratio of EV-A71 infected was 72.6% (1 775/2 444) and 97.0% (127/131) of severe HFMD disease in Guangdong province during 2011-2015.The average annual incidence of HF-A71 infection in all age groups showed a decreasing trend with age (chi(2trend)=990 273.20, P<0.001), and it was the highest in the 1-year-old group, which was 1 697.67/100 000, and the lowest in the 4-year-old group, which was 705.46/100 000. The difference of monthly average incidence of EV-A71 infection in HF-A71 in each month was statistically significant (chi(2)=401.23, P<0.001), the highest in May at 15.51 per 100 000, and the lowest in July at 9.42 per 100 000. Conclusion: EV-A71 infection rate of ordinary HFMD varies in different years. The most severe and death cases of HFMD were EV-A71 infected. 1 year old children were the high-risk group of infected with EV-A71 HFMD. April was the epidemic months of EV-A71 HFMD infection.

TI  - Comparing OMI-based and EPA AQS in situ NO<sub>2</sub> trends: towards understanding surface NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> emission changes
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - With the improved spatial resolution of the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) over earlier instruments and more than 10 years of service, tropospheric NO2 retrievals from OMI have led to many influential studies on the relationships between socioeconomic activities and NOx emissions. Previous studies have shown that the OMI NO2 data show different relative trends compared to in situ measurements. However, the sources of the discrepancies need further investigations. This study focuses on how to appropriately compare relative trends derived from OMI and in situ measurements. We retrieve OMI tropospheric NO2 vertical column densities (VCDs) and obtain the NO2 seasonal trends over the United States, which are compared with coincident in situ surface NO2 measurements from the Air Quality System (AQS) network. The Mann-Kendall method with Sen's slope estimator is applied to derive the NO2 seasonal and annual trends for four regions at coincident sites during 2005-2014. The OMI-based NO2 seasonal relative decreasing trends are generally biased low compared to the in situ trends by up to 3.7% yr(-1), except for the underestimation in the US Midwest and Northeast during December, January, and February (DJF). We improve the OMI retrievals for trend analysis by removing the ocean trend, using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) albedo data in air mass factor (AMF) calculation. We apply a lightning flash filter to exclude lightning-affected data to make proper comparisons. These data processing procedures result in close agreement (within 0.3% yr(-1)) between in situ and OMI-based NO2 regional annual relative trends. The remaining discrepancies may result from inherent difference between trends of NO2 tropospheric VCDs and surface concentrations, different spatial sampling of the measurements, chemical nonlinearity, and tropospheric NO2 profile changes. We recommend that future studies apply these procedures (ocean trend removal and MODIS albedo update) to ensure the quality of satellite-based NO2 trend analysis and apply the lightning filter in studying surface NOx emission changes using satellite observations and in comparison with the trends derived from in situ NO2 measurements. With these data processing procedures, we derive OMI-based NO2 regional annual relative trends using all available data for the US West (-2.0% +/- 0.3 yr(-1)), Midwest (-1.8% +/- 0.4 yr(-1)), Northeast (-3.1% +/- 0.5 yr(-1)), and South (-0.9% +/- 0.3 yr(-1)). The OMI-based annual mean trend over the contiguous United States is -1.5% +/- 0.2 yr(-1). It is a factor of 2 lower than that of the AQS in situ data (-3.9% +/- 0.4 yr(-1)); the difference is mainly due to the fact that the locations of AQS sites are concentrated in urban and suburban regions.

TI  - Synergy of AERONET and MODIS AOD products in the estimation of PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations in Beijing
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) is widely used to estimate particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <= 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) mass concentrations. Polar orbiting satellite retrieval 1-2 times each day is frequently affected by cloud, snow cover or misclassification of heavy pollution. Novel methods are therefore required to improve AOD sampling. Sunphotometer provides much more AODs than satellite at a fixed point. Furthermore, much of the aerosol pollution is regional. Both factors indicate that sunphotometer has great potential for PM2.5 concentration estimation. The spatial representativeness of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) AOD at Beijing site is investigated by linear regression analysis of 13-year daily paired AODs at each grid from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on Aqua and Beijing AERONET. The result suggests a good correlation for the whole Beijing Administrative region, with regional mean correlation coefficient exceeding 0.73. Pixel AODs are then estimated from AERONET AOD using linear equations, which are verified to have the same accuracy as that of MODIS AOD. Either AOD from MODIS retrieval or estimation from AERONET AOD in the absence of MODIS pixel AOD is finally used to predict PM2.5 concentration. Daily AOD sampling in average is enhanced by 59% in winter when MODIS AODs are very limited. More importantly, synergy of AERONET and MODIS AOD is able to improve the estimation of regional mean PM2.5 concentrations, which indicates this method would play a significant role in monitoring regional aerosol pollution.

TI  - 3-<i>O</i>-Acetyloleanolic acid inhibits VEGF-A-induced lymphangiogenesis and lymph node metastasis in an oral cancer sentinel lymph node animal model
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph node metastasis is a common and early event in the metastatic process of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and is the most powerful prognostic factor for survival of HNSCC patients. 3-O-acetyloleanolic acid (3AOA), a pentacyclic triterpenoid compound isolated from seeds of Vigna sinensis K, has been reported to have potent anti-angiogenesis and anti-tumor activities. However, its effects on tumor-related lymphangiogenesis and lymph node metastasis are not yet understood.Methods: The in vitro inhibitory effects of 3AOA on VEGF-A-induced lymphangiogenesis were investigated via in vitro experiments using mouse oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCCVII) cells and human lymphatic microvascular endothelial cells (HLMECs). The in vivo inhibitory effects of 3AOA on VEGF-A-induced lymphangiogenesis and sentinel lymph node metastasis were investigated in an oral cancer sentinel lymph node (OCSLN) animal model.Results: 3AOA inhibited tumor-induced lymphangiogenesis and sentinel lymph node metastasis in an OCSLN animal model, and reduced expression of VEGF-A, a lymphangiogenic factor in hypoxia mimetic agent CoCl2- treated SCCVII cells. 3AOA inhibited proliferation, tube formation, and migration of VEGF-A-treated HLMECs. The lymphatic vessel formation that was stimulated in vivo in a by VEGF-A Matrigel plug was reduced by 3AOA. 3AOA suppressed phosphorylation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFR) -1 and - 2 receptors that was stimulated by VEGF-A. In addition, 3AOA suppressed phosphorylation of the lymphangiogenesis-related downstream signaling factors PI3K, FAK, AKT, and ERK1/2. 3AOA inhibited tumor growth, tumor-induced lymphangiogenesis, and sentinel lymph node metastasis in a VEGF-A-induced OCSLN animal model that was established using VEGF-A overexpressing SCCVII cells.Conclusion: 3AOA inhibits VEGF-A-induced lymphangiogenesis and sentinel lymph node metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. The anti-lymphangiogenic effects of 3AOA are probably mediated via suppression of VEGF-A/VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 signaling in HLMECs, and can be a useful anti-tumor agent to restrict the metastatic spread of oral cancer.

TI  - Object-based deep convolutional autoencoders for high-resolution remote sensing image classification
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep learning has been applied to many fields due to its capability for unsupervised feature learning. However, it is unsuitable for remote sensing image classification of deep convolutional networks due to the regular and fixed shape of receptive fields in current methods, which cannot freely adapt for ground objects with various shapes and scales. To tackle this problem, we propose object-based deep convolutional autoencoders (ODCAEs) to encode high-resolution remote sensing image features automatically. The receptive fields of deep convolutional autoencoders were designed based on a fractal net evolution approach to adapt for various ground objects in images, retaining category purity while providing adequate information. We collected 109,333 samples of seven classes from high-resolution satellite images over various locations to train the ODCAE, which encoded high level features automatically, coupled with a support vector machine for classification. We assessed the classification results using two WorldView-II image locations. The proposed ODCAE approach achieved higher accuracy than three manual design feature systems. Thus, the proposed ODCAE approach is useful and efficient for feature learning problems for high-resolution remote sensing images. (C) 2018 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Efficacy of two artemisinin-based combinations for the treatment of malaria in pregnancy in India: a randomized controlled trial
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In India, the recommended first-line treatment for malaria in the second and third trimester of pregnancy is artesunate + sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (AS+SP). However, data on safety and efficacy of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) in pregnancy is limited. This study assessed the safety and efficacy of AS+SP and artesunate + mefloguine (AS+MQ) for treatment of Plasmodium falciparum in pregnancy in India.Methods: This open-label, randomized clinical trial was conducted from October 2010 to December 2013 at three sites in India (Ranchi and Jamshedpur in Jharkhand state, and Rourkela in Odisha state). Pregnant women in the second or third trimester who had P. falciparum mono-infection of any parasite density with or without fever were randomized to receive AS+SP or AS+MQ. Blood slides and filter paper samples for Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) were collected on days 0,1,2,3,14,21,28,42 and 63 post treatment Women were followed up at delivery and at day 42 postpartum.Findings: Two hundred and forty-eight women of 7064 pregnant women (3.5%) who were screened at monthly antenatal clinics had a P. falciparum mono-infection and were randomized to receive AS+SP (125) or AS+MQ (123) and all of these women were included in the intention to treat (ITT) analysis. The primary endpoint of an adeguate clinical and parasite response (ACPR) on day 63 was not available for 9 women who were counted as treatment failure in the ITT analysis. In the ITT population, the ACPR was 121/125 (96.8%, 95% Confidence interval (CI) 92.0-99.1%) in the AS+SP group and 117/123 (95.1%, 95% CI 89.7-98.2) in the AS+MQ group. Among the 239 women (121 from the AS+SP arm and 118 from the AS+MQ arm) who completed the day 63 follow up (per protocol analysis) the ACPR was 100% in the AS+SP group and 99.2% (117/118) in the AS+MQ group. There were five serious adverse events (SAE) among pregnant women (4 in the AS+SP group and 1 in the AS+MQ group) and 13 fetal/neonatal SAEs (7 in the AS+SP group and 6 in the AS+MQ) but none of them were related to the study drugs. A higher proportion of women in the AS+MQ arm reported vomiting within 7 days post-treatment than did women in the AS+SP arm (6.9 vs 1.6%, p = 0.001).Conclusion: Both AS+SP and AS+MQ are safe and effective for treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in pregnancy in India.

TI  - Determination of the TROPOMI-SWIR instrument spectral response function
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) is the single instrument on board the ESA Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite. TROPOMI is a nadir-viewing imaging spectrometer with bands in the ultraviolet and visible, the near infrared and the short-wave infrared (SWIR). An accurate instrument spectral response function (ISRF) is required in the SWIR band where absorption lines of CO, methane and water vapor overlap. In this paper, we report on the determination of the TROPOMI-SWIR ISRF during an extensive on-ground calibration campaign. Measurements are taken with a monochromatic light source scanning the whole detector, using the spectrometer itself to determine the light intensity and wavelength. The accuracy of the resulting ISRF calibration key data is well within the requirement for trace-gas retrievals. Long-term in-flight monitoring of SWIR ISRF is achieved using five on-board diode lasers.

TI  - Global water cycle and remote sensing big data: overview, challenge, and opportunities
T2  - BIG EARTH DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Earth's water cycle involves energy exchange and mass movement in the hydrosphere and thus sustains the dynamic balance of global hydrologic cycle. All water cycle variables on the Earth are closely interconnected with each other through the process of energy and water circulation. Observing, understanding and predicting the storage, movement, and quality of water remains a grand challenge for contemporary water science and technology, especially for researches across different spatio-temporal scales. The remote sensing observing platform has a unique advantage in acquiring complex water information and has already greatly improved observing, understanding, and predicting ability of the water cycle. Methods of obtaining comprehensive water cycle data are also expanded by new remote sensing techniques, and the vast amount of data has become increasingly available and thus accelerated a new Era: the Remote Sensing Big Data Study of Global Water Cycle. The element inversion, time and space reconstruction, and scale conversion are three key scientific issues for remote sensing water cycle in such Era. Moreover, it also presents a huge opportunity of capitalizing the combinations of Remote Sensing and Big Data to advance and improve the global hydrology and water security research and development, and uncork the new bottlenecks.

TI  - Quantifying coal power plant responses to tighter SO<sub>2</sub> emissions standards in China
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - We evaluate the impact of China's new air pollution standards on sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions by comparing newly available data from Continuous Emissions Monitoring Systems (CEMS) at coal power plants with satellite measures. First, we show that following the July 2014 deadline for implementing tighter emissions standards, stack concentrations of SO2 reported by CEMS declined by 13.9%. Second, on average the ratios of the declines of SO2 measures in the satellite data and the CEMS data are about 0.5. However, the degree of correspondence between the two data sources varies by policy stringency, with weak correspondence found in key regions facing the toughest new limits. Third, large plants achieved compliance earlier than small (typically) power and heat cogeneration plants. To achieve continued air quality improvement, our results suggest a need for increased scrutiny of emissions data quality and monitoring practices and clear long-term targets.

TI  - Comparison of AOD from CALIPSO, MODIS, and Sun Photometer under Different Conditions over Central China
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) provides three-dimensional information on aerosol optical properties across the globe. However, the performance of CALIPSO aerosol optical depth (AOD) products under different air quality conditions remains unclear. In this research, three years of CALIPSO level 2 AOD data (November 2013 to December 2017) were employed to compare with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) level 2 columnar AOD products and ground-based sun photometer measurements for the same time period. To investigate the effect of air quality on AODs retrieved from CALIPSO, the AODs obtained from CALIPSO, MODIS, and sun photometer were inter-compared under different air quality conditions over Wuhan and Dengfeng. The average absolute bias of AOD between CALIPSO and sun photometer was 0.22 +/- 0.21, 0.11 +/- 0.07, and 0.14 +/- 0.13 under clean, moderate, and polluted weather, respectively. The result indicates that the CALIPSO AOD were more reliable under moderate and polluted days. Moreover, the deviation of AOD between CALIPSO and sun photometer was largest (0.23 +/- 0.21) in the autumn season, and lowest (0.13 +/- 0.12) in the winter season. The results show that CALIPSO AOD products were more applicable to regions and seasons with high aerosol concentrations.

TI  - Molecular Imaging of endometrial sentinel lymph nodes utilizing fluorescent-labeled Tilmanocept during robotic-assisted surgery in a porcine model
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Molecular imaging with a fluorescent version of Tilmanocept may permit an accurate and facile detection of sentinel nodes of endometrial cancer. Tilmanocept accumulates in sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) by binding to a cell surface receptor unique to macrophages and dendritic cells. Four female Yorkshire pigs underwent cervical stromal injection of IRDye800-Tilmanocept, a molecular imaging agent tagged with near-infrared fluorescent dye and radiolabeled with gallium-68 and technetium-99m. PET/CT scans 1.5 hours post-injection provided preoperative SLN mapping. Robotic-assisted lymphadenectomy was performed two days after injection, using the FireFly imaging system to identify nodes demonstrating fluorescent signal. After removal of fluorescent nodes, pelvic and periaortic node dissections were performed. Nodes were assayed for technetium-99m activity, and SLNs were established using the "10%-rule", requiring that the radioactivity of additional SLNs be greater than 10% of the "hottest" SLN. Thirty-four nodal samples were assayed ex vivo for radioactivity. All the SLNs satisfying the "10%-rule" were detected using the FireF/ysystem. Five fluorescent nodes were detected, corresponding with preoperative PET/CT scan. Three pigs had one SLN and one pig had two SLNs, with 100% concordance between fluorescence and radioactivity. Fluorescent-labeled Tilmanocept permits real-time intraoperative detection of SLNs during robotic-assisted lymphadenectomy for endometrial cancer in a porcine model. When radiolabeled with gallium-68, Tilmanocept allows for preoperative localization of SLNs using PET/CT, and shows specificity to SLNs with persistent fluorescent signal, detectable using the FireF/ysystem, for two days post-injection. In conclusion, these findings suggest that a phase I trial in human subjects is warranted, and that a long-term goal of an intra-operative administration of non-radioactive fluorescent-labeled Tilmanocept is possible.

TI  - Assessment of a multiresolution snow reanalysis framework: a multidecadal reanalysis case over the upper Yampa River basin, Colorado
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - A multiresolution (MR) approach was successfully implemented in the context of a data assimilation (DA) framework to efficiently estimate snow water equivalent (SWE) over a large head water catchment in the Colorado River basin (CRB), while decreasing computational constraints by 60 %. A total of 31 years of fractional snow cover area (fSCA) images derived from Landsat TM, ETM+, and OLI sensor measurements were assimilated to generate two SWE reanalysis datasets, a baseline case at a uniform 90mspatial resolution and another using the MR approach. A comparison of the two showed negligible differences in terms of snow accumulation, melt, and timing for the posterior estimates (in terms of both ensemble median and coefficient of variation). The MR approach underestimated the baseline peak SWE by less than 2% and underestimated day of peak and duration of the accumulation season by a day on average. The largest differences were, by construct, limited primarily to areas of low complexity, where shallow snowpacks tend to exist. The MR approach should allow for more computationally efficient implementations of snow data assimilation applications over large-scale mountain ranges, with accuracies similar to those that would be obtained using similar to 100m simulations. Such uniform resolution applications are generally infeasible due to the computationally expensive nature of ensemble-based DA frameworks.

TI  - Urothelial bladder cancer may suppress perforin expression in CD8<SUP>+</SUP> T cells by an ICAM-1/TGFβ2 mediated pathway
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The immune system plays a significant role in urothelial bladder cancer (UBC) progression, with CD8(+) T cells being capable to directly kill tumor cells using perforin and granzymes. However, tumors avoid immune recognition by escape mechanisms. In this study, we aim to demonstrate tumor immune escape mechanisms that suppress CD8(+) T cells cytotoxicity. 42 patients diagnosed with UBC were recruited. CD8(+) T cells from peripheral blood (PB), sentinel nodes (SN), and tumor were analyzed in steady state and in vitro-stimulated conditions by flow cytometry, RT-qPCR, and ELISA. Mass spectrometry (MS) was used for identification of proteins from UBC cell line culture supernatants. Perforin was surprisingly found to be low in CD8(+) T cells from SN, marked by 1.8-fold decrease of PRF1 expression, with maintained expression of granzyme B. The majority of perforin-deficient CD8(+) T cells are effector memory T (T-EM) cells with exhausted Tc2 cell phenotype, judged by the presence of PD-1 and GATA-3. Consequently, perforin-deficient CD8(+) T cells from SN are low in T-bet expression. Supernatant from muscle invasive UBC induces perforin deficiency, a mechanism identified by MS where ICAM-1 and TGF beta 2 signaling were causatively validated to decrease perforin expression in vitro. Thus, we demonstrate a novel tumor escape suppressing perforin expression in CD8(+) T cells mediated by ICAM-1 and TGF beta 2, which can be targeted in combination for cancer immunotherapy.

TI  - Quantitative Remote Sensing at Ultra-High Resolution with UAV Spectroscopy: A Review of Sensor Technology, Measurement Procedures, and Data Correction Workflows
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - In the last 10 years, development in robotics, computer vision, and sensor technology has provided new spectral remote sensing tools to capture unprecedented ultra-high spatial and high spectral resolution with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). This development has led to a revolution in geospatial data collection in which not only few specialist data providers collect and deliver remotely sensed data, but a whole diverse community is potentially able to gather geospatial data that fit their needs. However, the diversification of sensing systems and user applications challenges the common application of good practice procedures that ensure the quality of the data. This challenge can only be met by establishing and communicating common procedures that have had demonstrated success in scientific experiments and operational demonstrations. In this review, we evaluate the state-of-the-art methods in UAV spectral remote sensing and discuss sensor technology, measurement procedures, geometric processing, and radiometric calibration based on the literature and more than a decade of experimentation. We follow the journey' of the reflected energy from the particle in the environment to its representation as a pixel in a 2D or 2.5D map, or 3D spectral point cloud. Additionally, we reflect on the current revolution in remote sensing, and identify trends, potential opportunities, and limitations.

TI  - Minimizing labeling ambiguity during classification process of the geological units covering the central part of the Suez Canal Corridor, Egypt using their radar scattering response
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Deriving information about the geometrical and dielectrical characteristics of objects using optical and radar satellite sensors is valuable for delineating and classifying surficial sediments. In the present study, unsupervised and supervised classifications of the Landsat-8 and the full-polarimetric Radarsat-2 data were used to map the different geological units and to reduce labeling ambiguity during classification processes. The study covers the central part of the Suez Canal Corridor in northeast Egypt. The full-polarimetric Radarsat-2 image was decomposed, filtered and geo-referenced to extract the scattering response of the different land cover and geological units covering the study area. In addition, polarimetric target decomposition and Wishart unsupervised classification with 5 classes were performed. The extracted polarization signatures show significant correlation with the obtained classes in terms of their geometrical (surface roughness) and dielectrical (mineral composition) characteristics. These characteristics are related to physical properties and to some extent, to the grain size and degree of weathering. The results show that the integration between the radar scattering responses and the optical reflectance information of the classified land cover and rock units is appropriate for precise objects discrimination.

TI  - Atmospheric Column Water Vapor Retrieval From Hyperspectral VNIR Data Based on Low-Rank Subspace Projection
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The knowledge of atmospheric column water vapor concentration is crucial for compensating water absorption effects in remote sensing data. Several algorithms for the estimation of such a parameter were proposed in the past. One of the most effective algorithms is the atmospheric precorrected differential absorption (APDA) technique. APDA relies on a simplified radiative transfer model (RTM) that does not account for the spatial variability of the adjacency effects. In this paper, we study the impact of the simplified RTM assumption on the performance of the algorithm by exploiting a more realistic and well-established RTM. Starting from such a model, we derive a new water retrieval algorithm called low-rank subspace projection-based water estimator. It exploits the high degree of spectral correlation experienced in the reflectances of most of the existing materials. An extensive experimental analysis is carried out on simulated data in order to assess and compare the performance of the two algorithms. Simulation results allow the critical analysis of the two algorithms by highlighting their strengths and drawbacks.

TI  - Seasonality of vegetation types of South America depicted by moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) time series
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The development, implementation and enforcement of policies involving the rational use of the land and the conservation of natural resources depend on an adequate characterization and understanding of the land cover, including its dynamics. This paper presents an approach for monitoring vegetation dynamics using high-quality time series of MODIS surface reflectance data by generating fraction images using Linear Spectral Mixing Model (LSMM) over South America continent. The approach uses physically-based fraction images, which highlight target information and reduce data dimensionality. Further dimensionality was also reduced by using the vegetation fraction images as input to a Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The RGB composite of the first three PCA components, accounting for 92.9% of the dataset variability, showed good agreement with the main ecological regions of South America continent. The analysis of 21 temporal profiles of vegetation fraction values and precipitation data over South America showed the ability of vegetation fractions to represent phenological cycles over a variety of environments. Comparisons between vegetation fractions and precipitation data indicated the close relationship between water availability and leaf mass/chlorophyll content for several vegetation types. In addition, phenological changes and disturbance resulting from anthropogenic pressure were identified, particularly those associated with agricultural practices and forest removal. Therefore the proposed method supports the management of natural and non-natural ecosystems, and can contribute to the understanding of key conservation issues in South America, including deforestation, disturbance and fire occurrence and management.

TI  - Remote Sensing Intertidal Flats with TerraSAR-X. A SAR Perspective of the Structural Elements of a Tidal Basin for Monitoring the Wadden Sea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial distribution and dynamics of intertidal habitats are integral elements of the Wadden Sea ecosystem, essential for the preservation of ecosystem functions and interlocked with geomorphological processes. Protection and monitoring of the Wadden Sea is mandatory and remote sensing is required to survey the extensive, often inaccessible tidal area. Mainly airborne techniques are carried out for decades. High-resolution satellite-borne sensors now enable new possibilities with satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) offering high availability of acquisitions during low water time due to independence from daylight and cloud cover. More than 100 TerraSAR-X images from 2009 to 2016 were used to examine the reproduction of intertidal habitats and macrostructures from the flats south of the island of Norderney and comparative areas in the Lower Saxony Wadden Sea. As a non-specific, generic approach to distinguish various and variable surface types continuously influenced by tidal dynamics, visual analysis was chosen which was supported by extensive in situ data. This technically unsophisticated access enabled us to identify mussel beds, fields of shell-detritus, gully structures, mud fields, and bedforms, the latter detected in the upper flats of every East Frisian island. Based on the high frequency of TerraSAR-X recordings for the Norderney area, a bedform shift was observed in a time-series from 2009 to 2015. For the same period, the development of a mud field with an adjoining depression was traced. Beside seasonal variations of the mud field, the formation of a mussel bed settling in the depression was imaged over the years. This study exemplifies the relevance of TerraSAR-X imagery for Wadden Sea remote sensing. Further development of classification methods for current SAR data together with open access availability should contribute to large-scale surveys of intertidal surface structures of geomorphic or biogenic origin and improve monitoring and long-term ecological research in the Wadden Sea and related tidal areas.

TI  - "Bhakti" or "love" in the school of Ramanuja and Mawlana
T2  - REVISTA DE CULTURA TEOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - In the mystical worldview, the word "love" denotes a broad and multilayered concept. Most mystics from different nations regard love as one of the basic principles and lessons in the world of mysticism. Many of them have pledged underlying conditions in the path of conduct and achievement to the position of knowledge and certainty of majesty of God to the elixir of love. In the school of Mowlana, love has a high status, and human perfection is possible by recognizing the Imam or leader in the combination of love. On the other hand, most Indian schools were influenced by "Bhakti Marga", which was more prominently displayed in the Ramanuja School, as it grew in the works of South India and Tamil, and as the "New Age" movement continued. Therefore, in this article, we are going to examine the comparative approach of this concept based on Rumi's poems and the teachings of Ramanuja In fact, our aim is to analyze the mutual and different views of both mystics on love and its nature.

TI  - Performance Assessment of MOD16 in Evapotranspiration Evaluation in Northwestern Mexico
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is the second largest component of the water cycle in arid and semiarid environments, and, in fact, more than 60% of the precipitation on earth is returned to the atmosphere through it. MOD16 represents an operational source of ET estimates with adequate spatial resolution for several applications, such as water resources planning, at a regional scale. However, the use of these estimates in routine applications will require MOD16 evaluation and validation using accurate ground-based measurements. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of the MOD16A2 product by comparing it with eddy covariance (EC) systems. Additional objectives were the analysis of the limitations, uncertainties, and possible improvements of the MOD16-estimated ET. The EC measurements were acquired for five sites and for a variety of land covers in northwestern Mexico. The indicators used for the comparison were: root mean square error (RMSE), bias (BIAS), concordance index (d), and determination coefficient (R-2) of the correlation, comparing measured and modelled ET. The best performance was observed in Rayon (RMSE = 0.77 mm.day(-1), BIAS = 0.46 mm.day(-1), d = 0.88, and R-2 = 0.86); El Mogor and La Paz showed errors and coefficients of determination comparable to each other (RMSE = 0.39 mm.day(-1), BIAS = 0.04 mm.day(-1), R-2 = 0.46 and RMSE = 0.42 mm.day(-1), BIAS = 0.18 mm.day(-1), R-2 = 0.45, respectively). In most cases, MOD16 underestimated the ET values.

TI  - Soil moisture remote-sensing applications for identification of flood-prone areas along transport infrastructure
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The expected increase in precipitation and temperature in Scandinavia, and especially short-time heavy precipitation, will increase the frequency of flooding. Urban areas are the most vulnerable, and specifically, the road infrastructure. The accumulation of large volumes of water and sediments on road-stream intersections gets severe consequences for the road drainage structures. This study integrates the spatial and temporal soil moisture properties into the research about flood prediction methods by a case study of two areas in Sweden, Vastra Gotaland and Varmland, which was affected by severe flooding in August 2014. Soil moisture data are derived from remote-sensing techniques, with a focus on the soil moisture-specific satellites ASCAT and SMOS. Furthermore, several physical catchments descriptors (PCDs) are analyzed and the result shows that larger slopes and drainage density, in general, mean a higher risk of flooding. The precipitation is the same; however, it can be concluded that more precipitation in most cases gives higher soil moisture values. The lack, or the dimensioning, of road drainage structures seems to have a large impact on the flood risk as more sediment and water can be accumulated at the road-stream intersection. The results show that the method implementing soil moisture satellite data is promising for improving the reliability of flooding.

TI  - Oil Spill Detection in Synthetic Aperture Radar Images Using Lipschitz-Regularity and Multiscale Techniques
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This research adapts an effective change detection approach originally applied to mapping fire scar from a stationary synthetic aperture radar (SAR) scene to the problem of oil spills from SAR data. The method presented here combines several advanced image processing techniques to mitigate some of the common performance limitations of SAR-based oil spill detection. Principally among these limitations are the following. First, the radar cross section of the areas affected by an oil spill strongly depends on wind and wave effects, and is, therefore, highly variable. Second, the radar cross section of oil covered water is often indistinguishable from other dark ocean features such as low wind areas, which leads to errors and uncertainties in oil spill detection. In this paper, we introduce a multi-image analysis, the Lipschitz regularity (LR), and wavelet transforms as a combined approach to mitigate these performance limitations. We show that the LR parameter is much less sensitive to variations of wind and waves in an oil spill SAR imagery, lending itself well for normalizing and suppressing ocean background using image ratio processing. We combine LR processing with a multiscale technique based on the wavelet transform to additionally achieve high-quality noise suppression. To describe the performance of this approach under controlled conditions, we applied our method to simulated SAR data of wind-driven oceans with oil spills and low wind areas. We also applied our method to several real-world oil spill data acquired during the 2010 Deep Water Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico.

AB  - Neuroendocrine carcinoma of the breast is a rare tumor subtype comprising less than 1% of breast cancers in the United States. Merkel cell features within this rare subtype are even rarer. We report a neuroendocrine breast carcinoma with Merkel cell features. The patient underwent breast conservation therapy and a sentinel lymph node biopsy. Unfortunately, the tumor was extremely aggressive and at 5 weeks postoperatively she presented with widely metastatic disease. Due to the aggressive nature of this tumor, we reviewed the literature and treatment options for this rare variant of a rare subtype.

TI  - A comparative study of ALOS-2 PALSAR and landsat-8 imagery for land cover classification using maximum likelihood classifier
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines ALOS-2 PALSAR L-band dual-polarization (HH and HV) SAR data and Landsat-8 optical imagery for land cover classification. The SAR data has been preprocessed first, which included radiometric calibration, geocoding, and speckle filtering. The HH/HV band ratio has been used to create the third band, and thus a synthetic RGB SAR image was created. The Landsat-8 data was also preprocessed for the classification process. For land cover classification of both SAR and optical datasets, the supervised maximum likelihood classifier was used. Training samples were selected from the Landsat-8 optical imagery with the support of information available in Google Earth; the same pixel locations of training data were used to extract training data from SAR image as well. The Landsat-8 optical imagery was classified and also used for visual assessment of the SAR land cover classification results. Accuracy assessment has been done for both the results of SAR and Landsat-8 data. The SAR classified output gives us accuracy of 93.15% and the Landsat-8 classified map accuracy was 91.34%, while the Kappa coefficient for SAR and Landsat-8 classified images is 0.92 and 0.89, respectively. Classification limitations exist in some cases, such as roads being merged in vegetation areas and some of the barren land is merged in settlements. The land cover classification can be expected to be further improved using polarimetric decomposition methods and fusion of SAR data with optical data.

M3  - Article
AB  - We perform synthetic aperture radar interferometry using data acquired between 2004 and 2016 by the Envisat, and ALOS-2 satellite missions to measure transient deformation at the Raft River geothermal field in Cassia County in Southern Idaho where geothermal production began in late 2007. Time-series analysis of multiple interferometric pairs indicates uplift at an exponentially decaying rate, over an similar to 8 km-by-5 km area centered near three injection wells that recycle produced brine. Similarly, subsidence at an exponentially decaying rate is observed in a 4 km-by-4 km area west of the production wells. These two signatures remain in the same location in all of the well-correlated Envisat interferometric pairs spanning the time interval between 2007 and 2010. The boundary separating the uplifting and subsiding areas is associated with the steeply dipping Bridge fault zone. Using two-dimensional numerical models, we explore first-order, bi-directional coupling between hydrological and mechanical processes. Our results suggest that: (i) most of the deformation occurs due to pore pressure changes following the start of geothermal production, (ii) the rate of deformation decays to zero over a time scale on the order of similar to 5 years as the system reaches steady state, and (iii) a reservoir-scale permeability of the order of similar to 1E-14 m(2) is required to explain the transient deformation.

TI  - A New Technique for Remote Sensing Image Classification Based on Combinatorial Algorithm of SVM and KNN
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PATTERN RECOGNITION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In remote sensing image classification, distance measurements and classification criteria are equally important; and less accuracy of either would affect classification accuracy. Remote sensing image classification was performed by combining support vector machine (SVM) and k-nearest neighbor (KNN). This was based on the separability of classes using SVM and the spatial and spectral characteristics of remote sensing data. Moreover, a distance formula is proposed as the measure criterion that considers both luminance and direction of the vectors. First, the SVM is trained and the support vectors (SVs) are obtained for each class. In the testing phase, newly tested samples were entered, and average distance between the test samples and SVs for each class are calculated using the distance formula. Finally, decisions are made to classify the test samples into the class with minimal average distance. This procedure is repeated until all test samples are classified. In the combinatorial algorithm, the nearest neighbor classifier is used to classify a testing sample, i.e. the average Euclidean distance between the testing data point to each set of SVs from different categories is calculated and the nearest neighbor classifier identifies the category with minimum distance. The proposed combinatorial algorithm has advantages over the conventional KNN for eliminating the k parameter selection problem and reducing heavy learning time. A comparison is carried out with SVM, KNN and Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) classification using ALOS/PALSAR and PSM images, and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated.

TI  - Long-Term Peatland Condition Assessment via Surface Motion Monitoring Using the ISBAS DInSAR Technique over the Flow Country, Scotland
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite Earth Observation (EO) is often used as a cost-effective method to report on the condition of remote and inaccessible peatland areas. Current EO techniques are primarily limited to reporting on the vegetation classes and properties of the immediate peat surface using optical data, which can be used to infer peatland condition. Another useful indicator of peatland condition is that of surface motion, which has the potential to report on mass accumulation and loss of peat. Interferometic SAR (InSAR) techniques can provide this using data from space. However, the most common InSAR techniques for information extraction, such as Persistent Scatterers' Interferometry (PSI), have seen limited application over peat as they are primarily tuned to work in areas of high coherence (i.e., on hard, non-vegetated surfaces only). A new InSAR technique, called the Intermittent Small BAseline Subset (ISBAS) method, has been recently developed to provide measurements over vegetated areas from SAR data acquired by satellite sensors. This paper examines the feasibility of the ISBAS technique for monitoring long-term surface motion over peatland areas of the Flow Country, in the northeast of Scotland. In particular, the surface motions estimated are compared with ground data over a small forested area (namely the Bad a Cheo forest Reserve). Two sets of satellite SAR data are used: ERS C-band images, covering the period 1992-2000, and Sentinel-1 C-band images, covering the period 2015-2016. We show that the ISBAS measurements are able to identify surface motion over peatland areas, where subsidence is a consequence of known land cover/land use. In particular, the ISBAS products agree with the trend of surface motion, but there are uncertainties with their magnitude and direction (vertical). It is concluded that there is a potential for the ISBAS method to be able to report on trends in subsidence and uplift over peatland areas, and this paper suggests avenues for further investigation, but this requires a well-resourced validation campaign.

TI  - An Exploration of Terrain Effects on Land Surface Phenology across the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau Using Landsat ETM plus and OLI Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detecting spatial patterns of land surface phenology (LSP) with high spatial and temporal resolutions is crucial for accurately estimating phenological response and feedback to climate change and biogeochemical cycles. Numerous studies have revealed LSP across the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) using a variety of coarse-resolution satellite data. However, detailed phenological spatial patterns along with changes of mountain topography remain poorly understood, which greatly limits efforts to predict the impacts of climate change on vegetation growth and ecosystem productivity in complex terrain regions. Combining Landsat 7 ETM+ (Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus) and Landsat 8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) observations in overlapping zones of adjacent images, this study detected Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)-based LSP metrics at a spatial resolution of 30 m, and explored how LSP varied with topographic factors along a 2600 km belt transect of the central QTP. The results show that the greenup onset date showed a delayed tendency with the increase of elevation at a mean rate of 1.52 days/100 m, while the dormancy onset date indicated an advanced tendency at a mean rate of -0.59 days/100 m. In general, greenup onset date was later but dormancy onset date was earlier on shaded slopes than on sunlit slopes in the meadow area. By contrast, greenup onset date did not significantly depend on aspect in the steppe area, while dormancy onset date indicated a similar response to aspect in the steppe area with that in the meadow area. With regard to the effect of slope on vegetation phenology in the meadow area, greenup onset date was significantly delayed but dormancy onset date significantly advanced with the increase of slope on both north and south slopes. In the steppe area, however, the influence pattern of slope on vegetation phenology was the opposite. Essentially, effects of topographical parameters on LSP were controlled by temperature and moisture combinations in complex terrain.

TI  - Satellite and Proximal Sensing to Estimate the Yield and Quality of Table Grapes
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Table grapes are a crop with high nutritional value that need to be monitored often to achieve high yield and quality. Non-destructive methods, such as satellite and proximal sensing, are widely used to estimate crop yield and quality characteristics, and spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) are commonly used to present site specific information. The aim of this study was the assessment of SVIs derived from satellite and proximal sensing at different growth stages of table grapes from veraison to harvest. The study took place in a commercial table grape vineyard (Vitis vinifera cv. Thompson Seedless) during three successive cultivation years (2015-2017). The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI) were calculated by employing satellite imagery (Landsat 8) and proximal sensing (Crop Circle ACS 470) to assess the yield and quality characteristics of table grapes. The SVIs exhibited different degrees of correlations with different measurement dates and sensing methods. Satellite-based GNDVI at harvest presented higher correlations with crop quality characteristics (r = 0.522 for berry diameter, r = 0.537 for pH, r = 0.629 for berry deformation) compared with NDVI. Proximal-based GNDVI at the middle of veraison presented higher correlations compared with NDVI (r = -0.682 for berry diameter, r = -0.565 for berry deformation). Proximal sensing proved to be more accurate in terms of table grape yield and quality characteristics compared to satellite sensing.

M3  - Case Reports
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe a case of congenital syphilis with a late diagnosis and identify missed opportunities at diverse phases/levels of healthcare, which led to late diagnosis.CASE DESCRIPTION: Boy, 34 days of life, referred from a basic healthcare unit to a tertiary hospital due to enlarged abdominal volume and progressive jaundice for 2 weeks, fecal hypocholia, hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, low platelet count and elevated liver enzymes. At physical examination, the infant presented with erythematous-exfoliative lesions on the palms and soles, macular rash in the inguinal region, ascitis, palpable liver 5 cm below the right costal margin and a palpable spleen 3 cm from the left costal margin. Infant serology: reactive CMIA (chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay), VDRL (Venereal Diseases Research Laboratory) 1:1024 and reactive TPHA (Treponema pallidum Hemagglutination). Maternal serology: reactive CMIA and TPHA, VDRL 1:256. Radiography of the long bones showed symmetric periostitis, periosteal thickening, and lucent bands in the femur, humerus, ulna and tibia. After treatment with crystalline penicillin, the infant showed clinical and laboratory improvement, receiving hospital discharge at the 18th hospitalization day.COMMENTS: This case shows that congenital syphilis is occasionally diagnosed late as a result of failed strategies to prevent this disease, both in the basic and secondary/tertiary levels of care. The application of interventions recommended by the Ministry of Health and identification of the situation in which there is ineffective implementation of these measures are important to assess routine care in all levels of healthcare and diverse units responsible for newborn and infant health care.

TI  - Dual-Polarized L-Band SAR Imagery for Temporal Monitoring of Marine Oil Slick Concentration
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - SAR sensors are usually used in the offshore domain to detect marine oil slicks which allows the authorities to guide cleanup operations or prosecute polluters. As radar imagery can be used any time of day or year and in almost any weather conditions, the use and programming of such remote sensing data is usually favored over optical imagery. Nevertheless, images collected in the optical domain provide access to key information not accessible today by SAR instruments, such as the thickness or the amount of pollutant. To address this knowledge gap, a methodology based on the joint use of a scattering model (U-WCA) and remote sensing data collected by a low frequency (e.g., L-band) imaging radar over controlled release of mineral oil spill is reported in this paper. The proposed method allows estimation of the concentration of pollutant within an oil-in-water mixture as well as the temporal variation of this quantity due to weathering processes.

TI  - Efficient Phase Estimation for Interferogram Stacks
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Signal decorrelation poses a limitation to multipass SAR interferometry. In pursuit of overcoming this limitation to achieve high-precision deformation estimates, different techniques have been developed, with short baseline subset, SqueeSAR, and CAESAR as the overarching schemes. These different analysis approaches raise the question of their efficiency and limitation in phase and consequently deformation estimation. This contribution first addresses this question and then proposes a new estimator with improved performance, called Eigendecomposition-based Maximum-likelihood-estimator of Interferometric phase (EMI). The proposed estimator combines the advantages of the state-of-the-art techniques. Identical to CAESAR, EMI is solved using eigendecomposition; it is therefore computationally efficient and straightforward in implementation. Similar to SqueeSAR, EMI is a maximumlikelihood-estimator; hence, it retains estimation efficiency. The computational and estimation efficiency of EMI renders it as an optimum choice for phase estimation. A further marriage of EMI with the proposed Sequential Estimator by Ansari et al. provides an efficient processing scheme tailored to the analysis of Big InSAR Data. EMI is formulated and verified in relation to the state-of-the-art approaches via mathematical formulation, simulation analysis, and experiments with time series of Sentinel-1 data over the volcanic island of Vulcano, Italy.

TI  - Teleconnections and Interannual Transitions as Observed in African Vegetation: 2015-2017
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) teleconnections present a hemispheric dipole pattern in both rainfall and vegetation between eastern and southern Africa. We analyze precipitation and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) departures during the 2015-2017 ENSO cycle; with one of the strongest warm events (El Nino) on record followed by a short and weak cold event (La Nina). Typically, southern (eastern) Africa is associated with dry (wet) conditions during El Nino, and wet (dry) conditions during La Nina. In general, the temporal and spatial evolution of vegetation responses show the expected dipole pattern during the 2015-2016 El Nino and following 2016-2017 La Nina. However, in 2015-2016 the eastern African impacts were displaced to the west and south of the canonical pattern. Composites of seasonal vegetation anomalies highlight the magnitude and position of impacts. Further investigation through empirical orthogonal teleconnections and spatial correlation analysis confirms the similar, but opposite, teleconnection impacts in eastern and southern Africa. The diametrically opposed patterns have particular implications for agricultural production and the availability of fodder and forage, especially in the pastoral communities of the two regions.

TI  - Use of remote sensing to identify areas at risk of degradation in the semi-arid region
T2  - REVISTA CIENCIA AGRONOMICA
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the most effective procedures in the evaluation of degraded areas has been the use of remote sensing. The aim of this work was to evaluate the temporal dynamics of the NDVI and rainfall in detecting the degradation of natural resources in a semi-arid region of Brazil. The area under study is located to the west of the district of Taud, in the State of Ceara, with a predominance of shrub-like caatinga forest. Rainfall data was obtained from FUNCEME. Ten images (dry season) were acquired from a 27-year historical series (1985-2011) from the TM/LANDSAT5 sensor, later converted to surface reflectance using the FLAASH/ENVI extension; NDVI indices were obtained and divided into six classes corresponding to land usage and occupation. The mean values of the NDVI classes were submitted to statistical analysis and compared by T-test (p<0.05) and the Pearson correlation matrix. It was found that in the years with rainfall above the historical average (1985-1993 and 19962004) there was a significant increase in degraded areas, represented by low values for the NDVI (between 0 and 0.4), due to more land being used for subsistence farming. However, during periods of drought (1993-1996 and 2004-2011), the opposite behaviour was seen, characterised by the natural regeneration of the woody stratum due to agricultural areas being abandoned; behaviour that was evidenced by increases of up to 1,807% in the moderately high class of the NDVI (between 0.6 and 0.8). The spatial and temporal dynamics of the NDVI and the rainfall therefore played a part in detecting evidence of the process of degradation of the caatinga biome in an area of the district of Taud, in the State of Ceara.

TI  - CropPhenology: An R package for extracting crop phenology from time series remotely sensed vegetation index imagery
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed vegetation indices to measure crop growth through phenological metrics have a high potential for use in agricultural management. However, implementing the analytical routines from remote sensing data acquisition to relating vegetation index information to in-situ plant development and management is complex to even the most experienced user. We present the CropPhenology package, a free, easy to use package designed in the R environment that enables flexibility and interoperability that allows users to progress from downloading remote sensing images to crop phenology analysis and visualisation with only minor processing steps. Furthermore, this environment allowing users to easily incorporate other R packages to form a seamless chain of functions to undertake more complex pre or post image processing and analysis. The package computes 15 phenological metrics based on satellite-based NDVI measurements over the season which can be easily visualised and used for successive spatio-temporal analysis. The metrics are theoretically related to Zadoks growth stages which explicitly characterise cereal crop growth conditions, including new leaf emergence, flowering, ripening, and yield. These metrics provide a systematic understanding of characterisation of the plant-soil-climate interactions. We present examples that illustrate the utility of our package in a Southern Australian broad-acre, rain-fed cereal cropping region.

TI  - Reimagining Discipleship: The Lisu Life-Rhythm of Shared Christian Practices
T2  - INTERNATIONAL BULLETIN OF MISSION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Lisu people of southwest China have reimagined Christian discipleship to emphasize various shared practices. Lisu Christian practices, such as singing hymns together, attending Christian festivals, abstaining from smoking and drinking alcohol, interceding for one another in prayer, and greeting one another with the traditional salutation and handshake, are less personal and more communal, less inward and more outward, less emotional and more embodied. Embedded in every practice are meaning, significance, and worldview; the practices are not empty. This article shows how Lisu Christians have transformed their faith into a life rhythm of practice-oriented discipleship appropriate for the agrarian context of this communal people.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, land-use/land-cover (LULC) change in the Ardabil, Namin, and Nir counties, in the Ardabil province in the northwest of Iran, was detected using an object-based method. Landsat images including Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), and Operational Land Imager (OLI) were used. Preprocessing methods, including geometric and radiometric correction, and topographic normalization were performed. Image processing was conducted according to object-based image analysis using the nearest neighbor algorithm. An accuracy assessment was conducted using overall accuracy and Kappa statistics. Results show that maps obtained from images for 1987, 2002, and 2013 had an overall accuracy of 91.76, 91.06, and 93.00%, and a Kappa coefficient of 0.90, 0.83, and 0.91, respectively. Change detection between 1987 and 2013 shows that most of the rangelands (97,156.6 ha) have been converted to dry farming; moreover, residential and other urban land uses have also increased. The largest change in land use has occurred for irrigated farming, rangelands, and dry farming, of which approximately 3539.8, 3086.9, and 2271.9 ha, respectively, have given way to urban land use for each of the studied years.

M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of MR lymphography with interstitial injection of a gadolinium-based contrast agent for identifying sentinel lymph nodes in patients with oral cavity cancer and clinically negative neck. Methods: Pretreatment MR lymphography with a differential subsampling with cartesian ordering (DISCO) sequence was performed in 26 patients with resectable oral cavity cancer and clinically negative neck, after peritumoral injection of 1-mL diluted gadobutrol. The accuracy of sentinel lymph node identification by MR lymphography was assessed and compared with the final histopathological results. Results: The MR lymphography consistently visualized the 44 sentinel lymph nodes in all 26 patients. In all but 1 patient with pathologically positive neck, assumed sentinel lymph nodes revealed metastatic involvement. Conclusion: Pretreatment MR lymphography is a safe and feasible imaging technique that can help clinicians identify sentinel lymph nodes with a high risk of occult metastases in patients with oral cavity cancer, enabling focused preoperative biopsy in these high-risk patients.

TI  - Lake Caviahue: an extreme environment as a potential sentinel for nutrient deposition in Patagonia
T2  - HYDROBIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine if extreme acidic Lake Caviahue could be used as a sentinel of atmospheric deposition hypothesizing that the physiological state of algae will be the indicator parameter. The lake was sampled from 2000 to 2015 in order to determine chlorophyll concentration, algae abundance and phytoplankton in vivo fluorescence as a way to evaluate the physiological state of algae. Development and physiological state of phytoplankton in different seasons was related to concentration and dynamics of nutrients in the lake. Laboratory experiments of Keratococcus rhaphidiodes to nitrogen (N) enrichment confirmed that an increase in nutrient content enabled a better physiological state of algae (e.g. higher chlorophyll per cell). Therefore, under the projected scenarios of climate change, the increase of available N through the increase in deposition and the increase of dissolved inorganic carbon, as consequence of higher atmospheric CO2, will compensate the natural nutrient constraints observed in the phytoplankton of the lake. The effect that the atmospheric CO2 has on the DIC, and this on algal development, as well as the influence that N has on algal growth, make Lake Caviahue an interesting sentinel of nutrient deposition at regional level.

TI  - Groundwater vulnerability assessment in karstic aquifers using COP method
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Access to safe and reliable drinking water is amongst the important indicators of development in each society, and water scarcity is one of the challenges and limitations affecting development at national and regional levels and social life and economic activity areas. Generally, there are two types of drinking water sources: the first type is surface waters, including lakes, rivers, and streams and the second type is groundwaters existing in aquifers. Amongst aquifers, karst aquifers play an important role in supplying water sources of the world. Therefore, protecting these aquifers from pollution sources is of paramount importance. COP method is amongst the methods to investigate the intrinsic vulnerability of this type of aquifers, so that areas susceptible to contamination can be determined before being contaminated and these sources can be protected. In the present study, COP method was employed in order to spot the regions that are prone to contamination in the region. This method uses the properties of overlying geological layers above the water table (0 factor), the concentration of flow (C factor), and precipitation (P factor) over the aquifer, as the parameters to assess the intrinsic vulnerability of groundwater resources. In this regard, geographical information system (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) were utilized to prepare the mentioned factors and the intrinsic vulnerability map was obtained. The results of COP method indicated that the northwest and the west of the region are highly and very vulnerable. This study indicated that regions with low vulnerability were observed in eastern areas, which accounted for 15.6% of the area. Moderate vulnerability was 40% and related to the northeast and southeast of the area. High vulnerability was 38.2% and related to western and southwestern regions. Very high vulnerability was 6.2% and related to the northwest of the area. By means of the analysis of sensitivity of the model, it was determined that the focus factor of the flow has the greatest impact on the creation of vulnerability in the region. Also, these results were validated through electrical conductivity and discharge time series of the regional springs that are located in the vulnerable zones.

TI  - Inversion of Surface Deformation Data for Rapid Estimates of Source Parameters and Uncertainties: A Bayesian Approach
T2  - GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - New satellite missions (e.g., the European Space Agency's Sentinel-1 constellation), advances in data downlinking, and rapid product generation now provide us with the ability to access space-geodetic data within hours of their acquisition. To truly take advantage of this opportunity, we need to be able to interpret geodetic data in a prompt and robust manner. Here we present a Bayesian approach for the inversion of multiple geodetic data sets that allows a rapid characterization of posterior probability density functions (PDFs) of source model parameters. The inversion algorithm efficiently samples posterior PDFs through a Markov chain Monte Carlo method, incorporating the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, with automatic step size selection. We apply our approach to synthetic geodetic data simulating deformation of magmatic origin and demonstrate its ability to retrieve known source parameters. We also apply the inversion algorithm to interferometric synthetic aperture radar data measuring co-seismic displacements for a thrust-faulting earthquake (2015 M-w 6.4 Pishan earthquake, China) and retrieve optimal source parameters and associated uncertainties. Given its robustness and rapidity in estimating deformation source parameters and uncertainties, our Bayesian framework is capable of taking advantage of real-time geodetic measurements. Thus, our approach can be applied to geodetic data to study magmatic, tectonic, and other geophysical processes, especially in rapid-response operational settings (e.g., volcano observatories). Our algorithm is fully implemented in a MATLAB (R)-based software package (Geodetic Bayesian Inversion Software) that we make freely available to the scientific community.

TI  - Volcanic impacts on modern glaciers: A global synthesis
T2  - EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - Volcanic activity can have a notable impact on glacier behaviour (dimensions and dynamics). This is evident from the palaeo-record, but is often difficult to observe for modem glaciers. However, documenting and, if possible, quantifying volcanic impacts on modem glaciers is important if we are to predict their future behaviour (including crucial ice masses such as the West Antarctic Ice Sheet) and to monitor and mitigate glacio-volcanic hazards such as floods (including jokulhlaups) and lahars. This review provides an assessment of volcanic impacts on the behaviour of modem glaciers (since AD 1800) by presenting and summarising a global dataset of documented examples. The study reveals that shorter-term (days-to-months) impacts are typically destructive, while longer-term (years-to-decades) are more likely protective (e.g., limiting climatically driven ice loss). However, because these events are difficult to observe, particularly before the widespread availability of global satellite data, their frequency and importance are likely underestimated. The study also highlights that because the frequency and nature of volcano-glacier interactions may change with time (e.g., glacier retreat may lead to an increase in explosive volcanic activity), predicting their future importance is difficult. Fortunately, over coming years, continued improvements in remotely sensed data will increase the frequency, and enhance the quality, of observations of volcanic impacts on glaciers, allowing an improved understanding of their past and future operation.

M3  - Article
AB  - The study aims to relate the variations in local temperatures in the central district of Naranjo. Ala-juela, through the use of Landsat 8 images and Geographic Information Systems. A vectorization of the soil cover was carried out, and the areas of the different coverings were compared with the areas of the temperature ranges obtained, showing a relationship between high temperatures and urban areas and low temperatures and areas with vegetation. Showing the relationship between coverage and temperature is important to establish effective mitigation and adaptation measures in the face of climate changes and thus to avoid effects associated with urban areas such as the heat islands.

TI  - Soil Moisture from Fusion of Scatterometer and SAR: Closing the Scale Gap with Temporal Filtering
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is a key environmental variable, important to e.g., farmers, meteorologists, and disaster management units. We fuse surface soil moisture (SSM) estimates from spatio-temporally complementary radar sensors through temporal filtering of their joint signal and obtain a kilometre-scale, daily soil water content product named SCATSAR-SWI. With 25 km Metop ASCAT SSM and 1 km Sentinel-1 SSM serving as input, the SCATSAR-SWI is globally applicable and achieves daily full coverage over operated areas. We employ a near-real-time-capable SCATSAR-SWI algorithm on a fused 3 year ASCAT-Sentinel-1-SSM data cube over Italy, obtaining a consistent set of model parameters, unperturbed by coverage discontinuities. An evaluation of a therefrom generated SCATSAR-SWI dataset, involving a 1 km Soil Water Balance Model (SWBM) over Umbria, yields comprehensively high agreement with the reference data (median R = 0.61 vs. in situ; 0.71 vs. model; 0.83 vs. ASCAT SSM). While the Sentinel-1 signal is attenuated to some extent, the ASCAT's signal dynamics are fully transferred to the SCATSAR-SWI and benefit from the Sentinel-1 parametrisation. Using the SM2RAIN approach, the SCATSAR-SWI shows excellent capability to reproduce 5 day-accumulated rainfall over Italy, with R = 0.89 against observed rainfall. The SCATSAR-SWI is currently in preparation towards operational product dissemination in the Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS).

TI  - First nationwide antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance for <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i> in Brazil, 2015-16
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANTIMICROBIAL CHEMOTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Gonorrhoea and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Neisseria gonorrhoeae are major public health concerns globally. Enhanced AMR surveillance for gonococci is essential worldwide; however, recent quality-assured gonococcal AMR surveillance in Latin America, including Brazil, has been limited. Our aims were to (i) establish the first nationwide gonococcal AMR surveillance, quality assured according to WHO standards, in Brazil, and (ii) describe the antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical gonococcal isolates collected from 2015 to 2016 in all five main regions (seven sentinel sites) of Brazil.Methods: Gonococcal isolates from 550 men with urethral discharge were examined for susceptibility to ceftriaxone, cefixime, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, benzylpenicillin and tetracycline using the agar dilution method, according to CLSI recommendations and quality assured according to WHO standards.Results: The levels of resistance (intermediate susceptibility) to tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, benzylpenicillin and azithromycin were 61.6%(34.2%), 55.6%(0.5%), 37.1% (60.4%) and 6.9% (8.9%), respectively. All isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone and cefixime using the US CLSI breakpoints. However, according to the European EUCAST cefixime breakpoints, 0.2% (n= 1) of isolates were cefixime resistant and 6.9% (n = 38) of isolates had a cefixime MIC bordering on resistance.Conclusions: This study describes the first national surveillance of gonococcal AMR in Brazil, which was quality assured according to WHO standards. The high resistance to ciprofloxacin (which promptly informed a revision of the Brazilian sexually transmitted infection treatment guideline), emerging resistance to azithromycin and decreasing susceptibility to extended-spectrum cephalosporins necessitate continuous surveillance of gonococcal AMR and ideally treatment failures, and increased awareness when prescribing treatment in Brazil.

TI  - Use of satellite remote sensing as a monitoring tool for land and water resources development activities in an Indian tropical site
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - With the availability of satellite data from free data domain, remote sensing has increasingly become a fast-hand tool for monitoring of land and water resources development activities with minimal cost and time. Here, we verified construction of check dams and implementation of plantation activities in two districts of Tripura state using Landsat and Sentinel-2 images for the years 2008 and 2016-2017, respectively. We applied spectral reflectance curves and index-based proxies to quantify these activities for two time periods. A subset of the total check dams and plantation sites was chosen on the basis of site condition, nature of check dams, and planted species for identification on satellite images, and another subset was randomly chosen to validate identification procedure. The normalized difference water index (NDWI) derived from Landsat and Senitnel-2 were used to quantify water area evolved, qualify the water quality, and influence of associated tree shadows. Three types of check dams were observed, i.e., full, partial, and fully soil exposed on the basis of the presence of grass or scrub on the check dams. Based on the nature of check dam and site characteristics, we classified the water bodies under 11-categories using six interpretation keys (size, shape, water depth, quality, shadow of associated trees, catchment area). The check dams constructed on existing narrow gullies totally covered by branches or associated plants were not identified without field verification. Further, use of EVI enabled us to approve the plantation activities and adjudge the corresponding increase in vegetation vigor. The plantation activities were established based on the presence and absence of existing vegetation. Clearing on the plantation sites for plantation shows differential increase in EVI values during the initial years. The 403 plantation sites were categorized into 12 major groups on the basis of presence of dominant species and site conditions. The dominant species were Areca catechu, Musa paradisiaca, Ananas comosus, Bambusa sp., and mix plantation of A. catechu and M. paradisiaca. However, the highest maximum increase in average EVI was observed for the pine apple plantation sites (0.11), followed by Bambussa sp. (0.10). These sites were fully covered with plantation without any exposed soil. The present study successfully demonstrates a satellite-based survey supplemented with ground information evaluating the changes in vegetation profile due to plantation activities, locations of check dams, extent of water bodies, downstream irrigation, and catchment area of water bodies.

TI  - MATERIALS COLLECTED BY THE SUBPOLAR ETHNOGRAPHIC PARTY (SIBERIAN BRANCH OF THE USSR ACADEMY OF SCIENCES) OF 1984 IN A.M. SAGALAEV'S ARCHIVE: THE MANSI OF THE LOWER OB
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper presents the first generalized results of the historical source study in relation to the materials collected by the Subpolar Ethnographic Party (Siberian Branch of the USSR Academy of Sciences) of 1984, which are stored in the personal archive of Andrey Markovich Sagalaev (1953-2002), a Russian ethnologist who participated in this party. The party worked among the Mansi in the north of Western Siberia, in the basin of the Severnaya Sosva River (left tributary of the Malaya Ob River; the area of the modern Beryozovsky District of the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug - Yugra). The ethnographers traveled to the study area from Novosibirsk by boat along the Ob River for three weeks. Then, the party continued its journey along the rivers of the Severnaya Sosva basin by boat. Field studies were conducted under the guidance of I.N. Gemuev, researcher at the Institute of History, Philology and Philosophy (since 2001 - the Institute of Archeology and Ethnography, Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences). Other members of the party included A.M. Sagalaev (junior research fellow), A.A. Alexeev (art student), and Andris Slapins, director and cameraman of the Riga Film Studio. Important findings are reflected in publications, including monographs, and a documentary film "The Gods and Heroes of the Mansi People" (1985). However, the general content of field sources from the expedition of 1984 was neither clarified nor published. The gap is partially filled in this paper. The author structured all identified materials from A.M. Sagalaev's archive of 1984 into separate archival documents (40 in total). They were divided into three types: cartographic documents (2), texts (5), photographs (32) and an audiovisual source (one film). Each document was provided with a brief description, including its origin and content, qualitative and quantitative characteristics, etc. Maps contain information about the ways in which the expedition of 1984 organized its activities. Text documents include evidence about Mansi sanctuaries collected from informants, notations of their music, as well as plans of archaeological excavations and data on ethnographic funds of the Beryozovsky Museum of Local Lore. Almost all photographic materials (black-and-white and color negative and positive slides; photographs) were taken by A.M. Sagalaev using film cameras. Although attributing them was the most difficult and time-consuming part of the source study, the result proved its worth: a representative collection of visual sources that have been completely digitized. The collection consists of 380 photographs (or 365 individual photo landscapes). In general, the materials of the Subpolar Ethnographic Party of 1984 contain unique information about the Mansi worldview, including guardian spirits of individual families and settlements, characters of the common Mansi pantheon, as well as about their everyday life. These materials significantly expand the source base concerning ethnic phenomena in the northern part of Western Siberia in the 20th century.

TI  - Forecasting of Cereal Yields in a Semi-arid Area Using the Simple Algorithm for Yield Estimation (SAFY) Agro-Meteorological Model Combined with Optical SPOT/HRV Images
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In semi-arid areas characterized by frequent drought events, there is often a strong need for an operational grain yield forecasting system, to help decision-makers with the planning of annual imports. However, monitoring the crop canopy and production capacity of plants, especially for cereals, can be challenging. In this paper, a new approach to yield estimation by combining data from the Simple Algorithm for Yield estimation (SAFY) agro-meteorological model with optical SPOT/High Visible Resolution (HRV) satellite data is proposed. Grain yields are then statistically estimated as a function of Leaf Area Index (LAI) during the maximum growth period between 25 March and 5 April. The LAI is retrieved from the SAFY model, and calibrated using SPOT/HRV data. This study is based on the analysis of a rich database, which was acquired over a period of two years (2010-2011, 2012-2013) at the Merguellil site in central Tunisia (North Africa) from more than 60 test fields and 20 optical satellite SPOT/HRV images. The validation and calibration of this methodology is presented, on the basis of two subsets of observations derived from the experimental database. Finally, an inversion technique is applied to estimate the overall yield of the entire studied site.

M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we highlight the importance of high-resolution wind data on the application of multicriteria evaluation technique to colocate offshore wind farms and open-water mussel cultivations. An index of colocation sustainability (SI), based on an environmental information, is constructed using remote sensing data and taking into account both physical constraints (i.e., water depth and wind speed) and environmental data (i.e., chlorophyll-a, sea surface temperature anomaly, and particulate organic carbon). To verify the proposed methodology, five showcases are presented, where SI is evaluated considering potential installation sites in Kattegat, Denmark, using both low-resolution (LR) wind reanalysis maps related to the Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Application data set and fine-resolution wind maps obtained by processing synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. Experimental results show that the availability of a reliable fine-resolution wind information is of great importance in coastal areas where the presence of the land and the isles limits the use of LR wind data.

TI  - An Outbreak of <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i> in a Mental Health Facility: Advantage of Well-Timed Whole-Genome Sequencing Over <i>emm</i> Typing
T2  - INFECTION CONTROL AND HOSPITAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE. We report the utility of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) conducted in a clinically relevant time frame (ie, sufficient for guiding management decision), in managing a Streptococcus pyogenes outbreak, and present a comparison of its performance with emm typing.SETTING. A 2,000-bed tertiary-care psychiatric hospital.METHODS. Active surveillance was conducted to identify new cases of S. pyogenes. WGS guided targeted epidemiological investigations, and infection control measures were implemented. Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based genome phylogeny, emm typing, and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) were performed. We compared the ability of WGS and emm typing to correctly identify person-to-person transmission and to guide the management of the outbreak.RESULTS. The study included 204 patients and 152 staff. We identified 35 patients and 2 staff members with S. pyogenes. WGS revealed polyclonal S. pyogenes infections with 3 genetically distinct phylogenetic clusters (C1-C3). Cluster C1 isolates were all emm type 4, sequence type 915 and had pairwise SNP differences of 0-5, which suggested recent person-to-person transmissions. Epidemiological investigation revealed that cluster C1 was mediated by dermal colonization and transmission of S. pyogenes in a male residential ward. Clusters C2 and C3 were genomically diverse, with pairwise SNP differences of 21-45 and 26-58, and emm 11 and mostly emm 120, respectively. Clusters C2 and C3, which may have been considered person-to-person transmissions by emm typing, were shown by WGS to be unlikely by integrating pairwise SNP differences with epidemiology.CONCLUSIONS. WGS had higher resolution than emm typing in identifying clusters with recent and ongoing person-to-person transmissions, which allowed implementation of targeted intervention to control the outbreak.

TI  - Consideration of Radiometric Quantization Error in Satellite Sensor Cross-Calibration
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The radiometric resolution of a satellite sensor refers to the smallest increment in the spectral radiance that can be detected by the imaging sensor. The fewer bits that are used for signal discretization, the larger the quantization error in the measured radiance. In satellite inter-calibration, a difference in radiometric resolution between a reference and a target sensor can induce a calibration bias, if not properly accounted for. The effect is greater for satellites with a quadratic count response, such as the Geostationary Meteorological Satellite-5 (GMS-5) visible imager, where the quantization difference can introduce non-linearity in the inter-comparison datasets, thereby affecting the cross-calibration slope and offset. This paper describes a simulation approach to highlight the importance of considering the radiometric quantization in cross-calibration and presents a correction method for mitigating its impact. The method, when applied to the cross-calibration of GMS-5 and Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors, improved the absolute calibration accuracy of the GMS-5 imager. This was validated via radiometric inter-comparison of GMS-5 and Multifunction Transport Satellite-2 (MTSAT-2) imager top-of-atmosphere (TOA) measurements over deep convective clouds (DCC) and Badain Desert invariant targets. The radiometric bias between GMS-5 and MTSAT-2 was reduced from 1.9% to 0.5% for DCC, and from 7.7% to 2.3% for Badain using the proposed correction method.

TI  - Inland Water Atmospheric Correction Based on Turbidity Classification Using OLCI and SLSTR Synergistic Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric correction is an essential prerequisite for obtaining accurate inland water color information. An inland water atmospheric correction algorithm, ACbTC (Atmospheric Correction based on Turbidity Classification), was proposed in this study by using OLCI (Ocean and Land Color Instrument) and SLSTR (Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer) synergistic observations for the first time. This method includes two main steps: (1) water turbidity classification by the GRA index (GRAdient of the spectrum index); and (2) atmospheric correction by synergistic use of OLCI and SLSTR images. The algorithm was validated with 72 in situ sampling sites in Lake Erhai, Lake Hongze, and Lake Taihu, and compared with other atmospheric correction methods, i.e., C2RCC (Case 2 Regional Coast Colour processor), MUMM (Management Unit of the North Seas Mathematical Models), FLAASH (Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Hypercubes), POLYMER (POLYnomial based algorithm applied to MERIS), and BPAC (Bright Pixel Atmospheric Correction). The results show that (1) the GRA index performed better than the proposed turbidity classification indices, i.e., the Diff (spectral difference index) and the Tind (turbid index), in inland lakes by using the reflectance peak at 1020 nm in clean water; (2) the synergistic use of OLCI and SLSTR performed feasibly for atmospheric correction, and the ACbTC algorithm achieved full-band average values of the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) = 29.55%, mean relative percentage error (MRPE) = 13.98%, and the root mean square of error (RMSE) = 0.0039 sr(-1), which were more reliable than C2RCC, MUMM, FLAASH, POLYMER, and BPAC; and (3) the synergistic use of the 17th band (865 nm) on OLCI and the 5th band (1613 nm) on SLSTR are suitable for clean inland lakes, while both the 5th band (1613 nm) and 6th band (2250 nm) on SLSTR are advisable for the turbidity.

TI  - Binding Leaders to the Community: The Ethics of Bolivia's Organic Grassroots
T2  - JOURNAL OF LATIN AMERICAN AND CARIBBEAN ANTHROPOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Bolivia's largest social movement organizations-including its labor unions, rural communities, and neighborhood organizations-are bound together by a hierarchical organizational structure and a countervailing ethic that subordinates leaders to the grassroots bases from which they emerge. This worldview separates an enduring, morally legitimate world of community organization (the organic) from a corrupt world of political parties, staffed by self-advancing, individualist politicians who engage in transactional, corrupt practices (the political). The organic grassroots ethic, by constructing itself as the heir to both the ayllu (Andean rural community) and the worker-led revolution, generates a deeply felt moral economy that both mobilizes mass participation and guides leadership. It valorizes ethical principles of complementarity, solidarity, anti-individualism, and obligatory participation, blending ethical and political life. Focusing on individual life histories, this article explores the moral boundaries and social expectations that organic grassroots ethics impose on leaders, who must perform selflessness and subordination to community in their political actions.

TI  - The Volume of Lava Erupted During the 2014 to 2015 Eruption at Holuhraun, Iceland: A Comparison Between Satellite- and Ground-Based Measurements
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The 31 August 2014 to 27 February 2015 eruption at Holuhraun created the largest lava flow field in Iceland since the 1783-1784 Laki eruption. Emplacement of a basaltic flow field of this magnitude onto an effectively flat surface (<0.1 degrees) is a rare occurrence. Lava discharge rate, a fundamental variable that controls flow field emplacement, allows us to estimate the total volume of lava erupted when integrated over time. Thus, discharge rate data are important for volcano monitoring and lava flow modeling. Here we compare discharge rates estimated using data from National Aeronautics and Space Administration's MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the method of Harris et al. (1997a, ; 1997b, ; 2007, ), with estimates of discharge rates derived from comparing intermittent ground-based measurements of flow field volume. The time-averaged discharge rates (TADR) reveal a pulsed increase in the first few days of the eruption. Although the trends of the satellite- and ground-based discharge rates are similar, the ground-based estimates are systematically higher than the satellite-derived estimates (about 2 to 3 times higher) in the first 30days of the eruption, and relatively close (within 30%) for the next 20 days. Conversely, during the final 130days, the satellite-based estimates are systematically higher than the ground-based estimates (about 2 times higher). This difference likely arises from the assumption of the lava flow surface temperature used in the space-based calculation, which may not be entirely representative of this uniquely large and intense basaltic eruption. However, the satellite-based technique yields a total erupted volume of about 1.21km(3) in good agreement with the 1.2km(3) (84km(2)) derived from field observations and mapping.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Dependency of NDVI Satellite Imagery in Predicting Bird Diversity over France
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuous-based predictors of habitat characteristics derived from satellite imagery are increasingly used in species distribution models (SDM). This is especially the case of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) which provides estimates of vegetation productivity and heterogeneity. However, when NDVI predictors are incorporated into SDM, synchrony between biological observations and image acquisition must be questionned. Due to seasonal variations of NDVI during the year, landscape patterns of habitats are revealed differently from one date to another leading to variations in models' performance. In this paper, we investigated the influence of acquisition time period of NDVI to explain and predict bird community patterns over France. We examined if the NDVI acquisition period that best fit the bird data depends on the dominant land cover context. We also compared models based on single time period of NDVI with one model built from the Dynamic Habitat Index (DHI) components which summarize variations in vegetation phenology throughout the year from the fraction of radiation absorbed by the canopy (fPAR). Bird species richness was calculated as response variable for 759 plots of 4 km(2) from the French Breeding Bird Survey. Bird specialists and generalists to habitat were considered. NDVI and DHI predictors were both derived from MODIS products. For NDVI, five time periods in 2010 were compared, from late winter to begin of autumn. A climate predictor was also used and Generalized Additive Models were fitted to explain and predict bird species richness. Results showed that NDVI-based proxies of dominant habitat identity and spatial heterogeneity explain more bird community patterns than DHI-based proxies of annual productivity and seasonnality. We also found that models' performance was both time and context-dependent, varying according to the bird groups. In general, best time period of NDVI did not match with the acquisition period of bird data because in case of synchrony, differences in habitats are less pronounced. These findings suggest that the most powerful approach to estimate bird community patterns is the simplest one. It only requires NDVI predictors from a single appropriate time period, in addition to climate, which makes the approach very operational.

TI  - The Classification of Noise-Afflicted Remotely Sensed Data Using Three Machine-Learning Techniques: Effect of Different Levels and Types of Noise on Accuracy
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed data are often adversely affected by many types of noise, which influences the classification result. Supervised machine-learning (ML) classifiers such as random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and back-propagation neural network (BPNN) are broadly reported to improve robustness against noise. However, only a few comparative studies that may help investigate this robustness have been reported. An important contribution, going beyond previous studies, is that we perform the analyses by employing the most well-known and broadly implemented packages of the three classifiers and control their settings to represent users' actual applications. This facilitates an understanding of the extent to which the noise types and levels in remotely sensed data impact classification accuracy using ML classifiers. By using those implementations, we classified the land cover data from a satellite image that was separately afflicted by seven-level zero-mean Gaussian, salt-pepper, and speckle noise. The modeling data and features were strictly controlled. Finally, we discussed how each noise type affects the accuracy obtained from each classifier and the robustness of the classifiers to noise in the data. This may enhance our understanding of the relationship between noises, the supervised ML classifiers, and remotely sensed data.

T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study set out to determine the suitability of the nematode Steinernema feltiae as a bioindicator for heavy metal pollution, specifically chromium VI. Nematodes were introduced into sand contaminated with concentrations of Cr VI+, in a range between 10 and 100 ppm, in increments of 10. Reproductive potential, development times and infectivity vs exposure times to Cr VI were employed as endpoints. It was observed that infective juveniles (IJ) from this nematode can survive and successfully infect host insects in the presence of Cr VI for as much as 13 days, and that the nematode increases its reproductive potential at concentrations up to 100 ppm Cr VI+. Conversely, development times (time in days taken for progeny to emerge after larval host death) and IJ infectivity rates were observed to reduce with increasing concentrations of Cr VI. The ability of this nematode to survive in the presence of high concentrations of Cr VI, and its ability to increase progeny numbers at the early stages of Cr VI exposure may provide a survival advantage for this nematode at contaminated sites. It may also demonstrate potential for development as a model species for toxicological assessment in in-situ field sampling.

TI  - Imaging Multi-Age Construction Settlement Behaviour by Advanced SAR Interferometry
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper focuses on the application of Advanced Satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (A-DInSAR) to subsidence-related issues, with particular reference to ground settlements due to external loads. Beyond the stratigraphic setting and the geotechnical properties of the subsoil, other relevant boundary conditions strongly influence the reliability of remotely sensed data for quantitative analyses and risk mitigation purposes. Because most of the Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) measurement points (Persistent Scatterers, PSs) lie on structures and infrastructures, the foundation type and the age of a construction are key factors for a proper interpretation of the time series of ground displacements. To exemplify a methodological approach to evaluate these issues, this paper refers to an analysis carried out in the coastal/deltaic plain west of Rome (Rome and Fiumicino municipalities) affected by subsidence and related damages to structures. This region is characterized by a complex geological setting (alternation of recent deposits with low and high compressibilities) and has been subjected to different urbanisation phases starting in the late 1800s, with a strong acceleration in the last few decades. The results of A-DInSAR analyses conducted from 1992 to 2015 have been interpreted in light of high-resolution geological/geotechnical models, the age of the construction, and the types of foundations of the buildings on which the PSs are located. Collection, interpretation, and processing of geo-thematic data were fundamental to obtain high-resolution models; change detection analyses of the land cover allowed us to classify structures/infrastructures in terms of the construction period. Additional information was collected to define the types of foundations, i.e., shallow versus deep foundations. As a result, we found that only by filtering and partitioning the A-DInSAR datasets on the basis of the above-mentioned boundary conditions can the related time series be considered a proxy of the consolidation process governing the subsidence related to external loads as confirmed by a comparison with results from a physically based back analysis based on Terzaghi's theory. Therefore, if properly managed, the A-DInSAR data represents a powerful tool for capturing the evolutionary stage of the process for a single building and has potential for forecasting the behaviour of the terrain-foundation-structure combination.

TI  - Monitoring Forest Phenology and Leaf Area Index with the Autonomous, Low-Cost Transmittance Sensor PASTiS-57
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land Surface Phenology (LSP) and Leaf Area Index (LAI) are important variables that describe the photosynthetically active phase and capacity of vegetation. Both are derived on the global scale from optical satellite sensors and require robust validation based on in situ sensors at high temporal resolution. This study assesses the PAI Autonomous System from Transmittance Sensors at 57 degrees (PASTiS-57) instrument as a low-cost transmittance sensor for simultaneous monitoring of LSP and LAI in forest ecosystems. In a field experiment, spring leaf flush and autumn senescence in a Dutch beech forest were observed with PASTiS-57 and illumination independent, multi-temporal Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) measurements in five plots. Both time series agreed to less than a day in Start Of Season (SOS) and End Of Season (EOS). LAI magnitude was strongly correlated with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.98. PASTiS-57 summer and winter LAI were on average 0.41 m(2)m(-2) and 1.43 m(2)m(-2) lower than TLS. This can be explained by previously reported overestimation of TLS. Additionally, PASTiS-57 was implemented in the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) Radiative Transfer Model (RTM) model for sensitivity analysis. This confirmed the robustness of the retrieval with respect to non-structural canopy properties and illumination conditions. Generally, PASTiS-57 fulfilled the CEOS LPV requirement of 20% accuracy in LAI for a wide range of biochemical and illumination conditions for turbid medium canopies. However, canopy non-randomness in discrete tree models led to strong biases. Overall, PASTiS-57 demonstrated the potential of autonomous devices for monitoring of phenology and LAI at daily temporal resolution as required for validation of satellite products that can be derived from ESA Copernicus' optical missions, Sentinel-2 and -3.

TI  - Dis/Integrating cultural difference in practice and communication: A qualitative study of host and migrant Registered Nurse perspectives from New Zealand
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NURSING STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Several earlier studies have provided evidence of the difficulties nurses have had adapting to foreign workplaces, however few have considered wider perspectives of the workplace communication environment.Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the viewpoints and experience of both New Zealand qualified nurses and internationally qualified nurses in managing communication within teams and the clinical practice context in an increasingly diverse healthcare workplace in New Zealand.Design: Interviews with 53 nurses currently employed in the New Zealand healthcare sector were carried out over a period of 15 weeks to gain insight into their intercultural experiences and how they responded. The transcripts of the interviews were analysed thematically.Setting: The interviews were all held outside working hours in venues and at times nominated by respondents.Participants: There were 53 participants (17 New Zealand registered nurses and 36 internationally qualified nurses) in the study. Respondents were nurses working in the health care sector who answered a call for participation in the study from an advertisement in the national nursing journal Kai TiakiMethods: A structured interview schedule was developed from the literature. The questions focused on cultural challenges and benefits, sources of learning, value-based differences accompanied by a description of critical incidents that were reflective of those events.Results: Qualitative thematic analysis of the data resulted in three primary themes: a polarized workplace (loss and learning); ethnocentrism 'othering' and empathy; and value based conflict. The results were discussed with a focus group of available respondents to verify the findings.Conclusion: All nurses in this study struggled with a care-rationed work environment, complicated by increasing diversity in both patients and staff. Despite evidence of conflict and misunderstanding, nurses also appeared willing to learn to adapt to enhance their practice. However, this process requires opportunities and resources to facilitate mutual understanding and accommodation to occur. The alternative of maintaining the status-quo will remain costly in terms of retention problems, the extent to which teams collaborate, and the contribution of insider-outsider divisions to sentinel events.

TI  - Metaphors of Transformation: Change in Male Batterers
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY OF MEN & MASCULINITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: People use language to construct, frame, and give meaning to life experiences. Metaphors are a common means of representing and expressing experiences. They create a space for the interpretation and extension of their meaning, thus serving both a revelatory function and as a force for change. This article analyzes how male batterers use metaphors after having received intervention to understand their experiences and changes. Method: We use a pooled sample combining 4 qualitative studies based on in-depth semistructured interviews with 62 male batterers, aged 26 to 66 years, who underwent therapy for intimate partner violence in Israel. Results: Two pivotal thematic axes emerge from the interviews. The first is the axis of metaphors portraying the construction of a self-reflexive process that enables abusive men to understand stressful emotions and behaviors, thus attaining self-control. Aligned along the second axis are metaphors that reflect changes in the experience and understanding of the gendered-self and the gendered power relationship that manifest in the dynamics of abusive men's violence. Discussion and implications: Male batterers use metaphors to describe the changes in their worldview, attitudes, and relationships and in their emotional and gendered-selves. Metaphors are powerful indicators of how male batterers construct their reality and can be useful as a heuristic instrument for understanding and evaluating batterers' changes as a result of professional intervention.

TI  - A novel framework for the use of remote sensing for monitoring catchments at continental scales
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Historical ecology can teach us valuable lessons on the processes and drivers of environmental change that can inform future monitoring priorities and management strategies. Environmental data to study environmental history, however, is often absent or of low quality. Even when studying changes occurring during the last few decades, monitoring efforts are scarce due to logistical and cost limitations, leaving large areas unassessed. The aim of this study is to evaluate the use of estuarine water colour as an indicator of historical environmental change in catchments. Water colour change was assessed in estuaries in Australia from 1987 to 2015 using satellite remote sensing. Random points were selected for each estuary and applied to the Australian Geoscience Data Cube (based on Landsat images) to obtain reflectance data through time. We propose a framework where (i) water colour is used to detect historical changes in catchments using generalised additive models, (ii) possible stressors and pressures driving those changes are evaluated using other available historical data, and (iii) lessons learned inform appropriate monitoring and management actions. This framework represents a novel approach to generate historical data for large-scale assessments of environmental change at catchment level, even in poorly studied areas. (C) 2018 The Authors.

TI  - Recent Surface Water Extent of Lake Chad from Multispectral Sensors and GRACE
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Consistent observations of lakes and reservoirs that comprise the majority of surface freshwater globally are limited, especially in Africa where water bodies are exposed to unfavorable climatic conditions and human interactions. Publicly available satellite imagery has increased the ability to monitor water bodies of various sizes without much financial hassle. Landsat 7 and 8 images were used in this study to estimate area changes around Lake Chad. The Automated Water Extraction Index (AWEI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were compared for the remote sensing retrieval process of surface water. Otsu threshold method was used to separate water from non-water features. With an overall accuracy of similar to 96% and an inter-rater agreement (kappa coefficient) of 0.91, the MNDWI was a better indicator for mapping recent area changes in Lake Chad and was used to estimate the lake's area changes from 2003-2016. Extracted monthly areas showed an increasing trend and ranged between similar to 1242 km(2) and 2231 km(2) indicating high variability within the 13-year period, 2003-2016. In addition, we combined Landsat measurements with Total Water Storage Anomaly (TWSA) data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites. This combination is well matched with our estimated surface area trends. This work not only demonstrates the importance of remote sensing in sparsely gauged developing countries, it also suggests the use of freely available high-quality imagery data to address existing lake crisis.

T2  - PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - High concentrations of suspended solids in coastal waters directly affect numerous processes. In the case of the marine region influenced by the Guadalquivir estuary, turbidity is one of the primary factors affecting this complex ecosystem and its adjacent coastal region. Ten-year (2002-2012) ocean color observations from the MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) at 300 m are used to assess the variability of turbidity and chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl) in this region. The combination of high-frequency data from automated sensors in addition to synoptic imagery results in an excellent complement to better study water quality parameters. Turbidity plumes detected using the backscattering characteristics of the surface waters with Remote Sensing Reflectance at wavelength 665 nm (Rrs665) reveal the effects of physical processes governing both the spatial and temporal turbidity distribution. The results exhibit seasonal and interannual fluctuations driven by rainfall, freshwater discharges from Alcala del Rio dam, and the North Atlantic Oscillation index (NAO), with maximum turbidity levels in late autumn and winter. In addition, the temporal 1-month lag of Chl maximum and peak turbidity suggests a coupling between sediment resuspension and blooms, whereas extreme turbidity is limiting light availability for photosynthesis. Furthermore, turbidity varies on fortnightly scales, presenting lower intensity during neap tide and vice versa during spring tide. An asymmetric behavior of plume signals in connection with the semidiurnal tidal cycle is found, with maximum values during low tide. Both fortnightly and semidiurnal regimes appear to be superimposed on the large time-scale variability and occur throughout the year. Chl concentrations are dominated by the fortnightly-driven turbidity features throughout the year with minimum Chl during spring tides. This study evidences the main mechanisms influencing plume patterns and Chl, characterizing for the first time their variability in relation with tidal forcing, and therefore advancing the understanding of sediment dynamics and its relevant impact on the regulation of the pelagic ecosystem of the basin. The information obtained is critical for supporting scientists, stakeholders and ecosystem policy-makers for the challenging sustainable coastal management of the Eastern Gulf of Cadiz and its resources.

TI  - Evaluation of the First Year of Operational Sentinel-2A Data for Retrieval of Suspended Solids in Medium- to High-Turbidity Waters
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we apply high-resolution Sentinel-2A imagery to assist in the monitoring of the southwestern Spanish coast during its first year of data. The aim is to test suitability of MultiSpectral Imager (MSI) at higher resolution (10 m) for mapping Total Suspended Solids (TSS). Several field campaigns are carried out to collect TSS at three different sites in the Guadalquivir estuary, Cadiz Bay and Conil port. A regional multi-conditional remote sensing algorithm with a switching method that automatically selects the most sensitive TSS vs. water reflectance relationship is developed to estimate TSS concentration while avoiding saturation effects. An existing semi-analytical algorithm is calibrated by means of a cross-validation procedure based on both red 664 nm (r = 0.8, NRMSE of 25.06%) and near-infrared (NIR) 865 nm (r = 0.98, NRMSE of 10.28%) parts of the spectrum, showing the MSI sensor's great potential to estimate TSS even though it was not designed for aquatic remote sensing. The first year of data reveals improved monitoring along the coastal region at unprecedented resolution with accuracy to detect the Estuarine Turbidity Maximum (ETM). ACOLITE and POLYMER Atmospheric Correction strategies are applied over this coastal region (no in-situ data on water reflectance). The results confirm that the flexible POLYMER algorithm can address intense sun-glint effects. These findings encourage further research of water quality studies relying on both operational Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B, with great implications to improve the understanding of turbid coastal and inland water environments.

T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - The dispersal and parasitism abilities of Diachasmimorpha longicaudata, reared on the larval hosts Ceratitis capitata and Anastrepha fraterculus, were evaluated in a guava orchard. Eleven releases of approximately 3000 parasitoids were conducted in a 15-ha orchard and wasp dispersal was monitored from 6 to 272 m away from a central release point. At each monitoring point, larvae of C. capitata and A. fraterculus were offered as hosts for the parasitoids. In five releases, parasitoids were offered only one host species, and in six releases, they were given a choice. In total, 10,351 parasitoids were recovered from these hosts, all of which were D. longicaudata. Both parasitoid strains dispersed in all directions, but showed a slight bias towards the east. Both strains of the parasitoid survived and parasitized larvae of A. fraterculus and C. capitata for up to 15 days after release, with maximum activity during the first 7 days, but more individuals of the Anastrepha strain were recovered after 15 days. Although the highest rates of parasitism by both wasp strains occurred close to the release point, the Anastrepha strain parasitized more hosts at greater distances from the release point, whereas the Ceratitis strain parasitized more hosts close to release points. Releases of the Anastrepha strain of D. longicaudata are therefore recommended, as this strain yields high rates of parasitism further away from release points and appears to survive longer in the field.

TI  - Red blood cell alloimmunization in sickle cell disease: assessment of transfusion protocols during two time periods
T2  - TRANSFUSION
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUNDPrevention of red blood cell (RBC) alloimmunization in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) focuses on phenotypic RBC matching. We assessed alloimmunization among transfused patients with SCD after implementing leukoreduction and prophylactic antigen matching (PAM).STUDY DESIGN AND METHODSRetrospective review of transfusion and medical records for SCD patients 18 months to 81 years of age was performed covering two 5-year periods: Period 1, no PAM, occasional leukoreduction, and Period 2, consistent leukoreduction and extended PAM (Rh, Kell, S, Fy, Jk) for patients already alloimmunized. Patients transfused in Period 1 were excluded from Period 2.RESULTSA total of 293 patients were transfused in Period 1 and 183 in Period 2. Median time between first sample and last type and screen after transfusion was 2.12 years in Period 1 and 1.03 years in Period 2. Initial alloimmunization prevalence was lower in Period 2 (26.2%) versus Period 1 (37.5%) and after subsequent transfusions in Period 2 (23.8%) versus Period 1 (45.7%), although without significant difference after adjusting for number of units transfused, percentage of leukoreduced RBCs, sex, and age. Alloimmunized patients received more nonleukoreduced RBCs in Period 1 than nonalloimmunized. Patients transfused during inflammatory conditions were not significantly more likely to become alloimmunized.CONCLUSIONSThe prevalence of initial and subsequent RBC alloimmunization in Period 2 was lower than that in Period 1; however, overall prevalence remained high. We recommend leukoreduced, hemoglobin S-negative Rh and Kell PAM RBCs for transfusion of patients with SCD. Component and recipient factors affecting alloimmunization should be studied further.

TI  - Diffuse Attenuation Coefficient Retrieval in CDOM Dominated Inland Water with High Chlorophyll-<i>a</i> Concentrations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The k(d)(490) is a vertical light attenuation coefficient and an important parameter for water quality. The k(d) estimates are often based on empirical and semi-analytical algorithms, designed for oceanic and coastal waters. However, there is a lack of information about the performances of these models to inland waters dominated by chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM). Therefore, to contribute to this investigation, nine empirical models based on the blue-to-green and blue-to-red ratios and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration were evaluated, as well as three semi-analytical models using bands from the Operational Land Imager (OLI)/Landsat-8. The errors (mean absolute percentage error, MAPE > 80%) presented by the empirical models confirmed that the blue-to-green ratio failed in retrieving k(d)(490) in an environment dominated by CDOM. Similar failures occurred with the models using the Chl-a concentration (MAPE similar to 60%) as input. A semi-analytical approach showed the lowest error (MAPE = 41.04%) in the estimate of the inherent optical properties for complex waters in order to reduce the errors above. After retrieval of k(d)(490) using the semi-analytical model, seasonal patterns were observed, and high values of k(d)(490) were detected in the dry season possibly due to the increase of the concentration of the optically-significant substances (OSS).

TI  - Downscaling hydrodynamics features to depict causes of major productivity of Sicilian-Maltese area and implications for resource management
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll-a (CHL-a) and sea surface temperature (SST) are generally accepted as proxies for water quality. They can be easily retrieved in a quasi-near real time mode through satellite remote sensing and, as such, they provide an overview of the water quality on a synoptic scale in open waters. Their distributions evolve in space and time in response to local and remote forcing, such as winds and currents, which however have much finer temporal and spatial scales than those resolvable by satellites in spite of recent advances in satellite remote-sensing techniques. Satellite data are often characterized by a moderate temporal resolution to adequately catch the actual sub-grid physical processes. Conventional pointwise measurements can resolve high-frequency motions such as tides or high-frequency wind-driven currents, however they are inadequate to resolve their spatial variability over wide areas. We show in this paper that a combined use of near-surface currents, available through High-Frequency (HF) radars, and satellite data (e.g., TERRA and AQUA/MODIS), can properly resolve the main oceanographic features in both coastal and open-sea regions, particularly at the coastal boundaries where satellite imageries fail, and are complementary tools to interpret ocean productivity and resource management in the Sicily Channel.

TI  - Evaluation of the US Food and Drug Administration sentinel analysis tools in confirming previously observed drug-outcome associations: The case of clindamycin and Clostridium difficile infection
T2  - PHARMACOEPIDEMIOLOGY AND DRUG SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: The Food and Drug Administration's Sentinel System developed parameterized, reusable analytic programs for evaluation of medical product safety. Research on outpatient antibiotic exposures, and Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) with non-user reference groups led us to expect a higher rate of CDI among outpatient clindamycin users vs penicillin users. We evaluated the ability of the Cohort Identification and Descriptive Analysis and Propensity Score Matching tools to identify a higher rate of CDI among clindamycin users.Methods: We matched new users of outpatient dispensings of oral clindamycin or penicillin from 13 Data Partners 1:1 on propensity score and followed them for up to 60 days for development of CDI. We used Cox proportional hazards regression stratified by Data Partner and matched pair to compare CDI incidence.Results: Propensity score models at 3 Data Partners had convergence warnings and a limited range of predicted values. We excluded these Data Partners despite adequate covariate balance after matching. From the 10 Data Partners where these models converged without warnings, we identified 807 919 new clindamycin users and 8 815 441 new penicillin users eligible for the analysis. The stratified analysis of 807 769 matched pairs included 840 events among clindamycin users and 290 among penicillin users (hazard ratio 2.90, 95% confidence interval 2.53, 3.31).Conclusions: This evaluation produced an expected result and identified several potential enhancements to the Propensity Score Matching tool. This study has important limitations. CDI risk may have been related to factors other than the inherent properties of the drugs, such as duration of use or subsequent exposures.

World Christianity is normative Christianity, Walls argues, a portable religion for people on the move. Walls also addresses what it means to be a scholar of missions and world Christianity. The work demands humility because it addresses missions, an activity long thought marginal. It calls for extraordinary scholarly range and diligence, and it addresses questions and data long neglected by other disciplines. Even so, the study of world Christianity is critical to the renewal of Christianity in our time.

TI  - Persistent Hot Spot Detection and Characterisation Using SLSTR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Gas flaring is a disposal process widely used in the oil extraction and processing industry. It consists in the burning of unwanted gas at the tip of a stack and due to its thermal characteristic and the thermal emission it is possible to observe and to quantify it from space. Spaceborne observations allows us to collect information across regions and hence to provide a base for estimation of emissions on global scale. We have successfully adapted the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Nightfire algorithm for the detection and characterisation of persistent hot spots, including gas flares, to the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) observations on-board the Sentinel-3 satellites. A hot event at temperatures typical of a gas flare will produce a local maximum in the night-time readings of the shortwave and mid-infrared (SWIR and MIR) channels of SLSTR. The SWIR band centered at 1.61 mu m is closest to the expected spectral radiance maximum and serves as the primary detection band. The hot source is characterised in terms of temperature and area by fitting the sum of two Planck curves, one for the hot source and another for the background, to the radiances from all the available SWIR, MIR and thermal infra-red channels of SLSTR. The flaring radiative power is calculated from the gas flare temperature and area. Our algorithm differs from the original VIIRS Nightfire algorithm in three key aspects: (1) It uses a granule-based contextual thresholding to detect hot pixels, being independent of the number of hot sources present and their intensity. (2) It analyses entire clusters of hot source detections instead of individual pixels. This is arguably a more comprehensive use of the available information. (3) The co-registration errors between hot source clusters in the different spectral bands are calculated and corrected. This also contributes to the SLSTR instrument validation. Cross-comparisons of the new gas flare characterisation with temporally close observations by the higher resolution German FireBIRD TET-1 small satellite and with the Nightfire product based on VIIRS on-board the Suomi-NPP satellite show general agreement for an individual flaring site in Siberia and for several flaring regions around the world. Small systematic differences to VIIRS Nightfire are nevertheless apparent. Based on the hot spot characterisation, gas flares can be identified and flared gas volumes and pollutant emissions can be calculated with previously published methods.

TI  - Does response to neo-adjuvant chemotherapy impact breast reconstruction?
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is administered in breast cancer treatment for downstaging of disease. Here, we determined the impact of response to NAC on breast reconstruction uptake. A prospective NAC and mastectomy database with or without reconstruction were reviewed with IRB approval. Univariable analyses were conducted using Kruskal-Wallis or Fisher's exact tests. Multivariable logistic regression was used to adjust for potential confounders. We identified 271 patients with unilateral breast cancer receiving NAC and either unilateral or bilateral mastectomy from 9/2013 to 5/2016. Seventy patients (25.8%) had a pCR to NAC. One hundred and seventy-five patients (64.6%) had immediate reconstruction (IR), and 96 had no IR. On univariable analysis, younger age (P < .001), lower T-stage at presentation (P<.001), bilateral versus unilateral mastectomy (P<.001) and HR-negative tumor subtype (P=.006) were significantly associated with higher IR rates. On multivariable analysis, pCR (P=.792) and tumor subtype (P=0.061) were not significantly associated with IR; T-stage was significantly associated with IR (P < .001), such that patients with T4 tumors at presentation had lower odds of IR (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.02-0.50), even when accounting for response to NAC. One hundred and seventy-three patients (63.8%) received adjuvant radiation therapy; this was associated with lower IR frequency (P=.048) but was not associated with reconstruction type (tissue expander versus autologous, P=1.0) among 175 patients who had IR. In patients who have mastectomy after NAC, IR is influenced by age, T-stage at presentation, and choice of bilateral mastectomy, but not by response to NAC. A subset of patients who are young, with earlier T-stage and pCR, is more likely to proceed with bilateral mastectomy.

AB  - We propose an exploration of the levels of violence in the pieces of Rulfo, detained in the family ties (father-mother-son), in the community and in their authorities (people, neighbors, institutions). Violence, an irrational and anti-civilization concept, behaves in the worldview's Rulfo as a descriptor of a mode of order that makes it natural. Through a descriptive-analytical reading, to move to the symbolic interpretation, we distinguish the constant action of a type of immanent violence that does not submit to the statement of the enlightened idea of justice. The critical discourse of literature declares a pre-historical determinism that invalidates the official story.

TI  - A Bead-Based Flow Cytometric Assay for Monitoring <i>Yersinia</i> <i>pestis</i> Exposure in Wildlife
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Yersinia pestis is the causative agent of plague and is considered a category A priority pathogen due to its potential for high transmissibility and the significant morbidity and mortality it causes in humans. Y. pestis is endemic to the western United States and much of the world, necessitating programs to monitor for this pathogen on the landscape. Elevated human risk of plague infection has been spatially correlated with spikes in seropositive wildlife numbers, particularly rodent-eating carnivores, which are frequently in contact with the enzootic hosts and the associated arthropod vectors of Y. pestis In this study, we describe a semiautomated bead-based flow cytometric assay developed for plague monitoring in wildlife called the F1 Luminex plague assay (F1-LPA). Based upon Luminex/Bio-Plex technology, the F1-LPA targets serological responses to the F1 capsular antigen of Y. pestis and was optimized to analyze antibodies eluted from wildlife blood samples preserved on Nobuto filter paper strips. In comparative evaluations with passive hemagglutination, the gold standard tool for wildlife plague serodiagnosis, the F1-LPA demonstrated as much as 64x improvement in analytical sensitivity for F1-specific IgG detection and allowed for unambiguous classification of IgG status. The functionality of the F1-LPA was demonstrated for coyotes and other canids, which are the primary sentinels in wildlife plague monitoring, as well as felids and raccoons. Additionally, assay formats that do not require species-specific immunological reagents, which are not routinely available for several wildlife species used in plague monitoring, were determined to be functional in the F1-LPA.

TI  - Extraction and Spatial-Temporal Evolution of Urban Fringes: A Case Study of Changchun in Jilin Province, China
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - An urban fringe area, depicted as a typical ecotone, is a region where both social and environmental problems are concentrated. Identifying and evaluating the spatial-temporal characteristics of urban fringe areas is significant for future development. On the basis of the land use data extracted from remote sensing data, the Shannon diversity index (SHDI) of each unit can be calculated, and identifying the urban fringe area by the breakpoint method is reliable. By using the rapidly growing Changchun as example, this study identifies the urban fringe of Changchun in 1995, 2005, and 2015 by applying the breakpoint method. The expansion amount, change mode, direction of expansion, landscape, and influence factors are evaluated. Policy and planning are the main factors influencing the development direction of the Changchun fringe area. The urban fringe area of Changchun City is extended to the east, southeast, and north. From 1995 to 2005, the outlying expansion was the dominant type. The main change mode was the infilling type due to the reduction of available land, from 2005 to 2015. In accordance with the landscape metrics, the landscape within the urban fringe transformed from fragmentation to regularization. The development of the urban fringe also transformed from a disorderly to an orderly manner.

TI  - Spatio-temporal differentiation and influencing factors of vegetation net primary productivity using GIS and CASA: A case study in Yuanyang County, Yunnan
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - To clarify the changes and driving mechanism of the net primary productivity (NPP) in Yuanyang, Yunnan Province, we simulated the spatio-temporal distribution of vegetation NPP in Yuanyang from 2005 to 2015 based on the improved light energy utilization model ( CASA) and MODIS-NDVI data. The correlations between NPP and climate factors or land use types were analyzed. From 2005 to 2015, the spatial distribution of NPP was significantly different in Yuan yang, increasing from the northeast to southwest, with an annual average of 380.57 g C . m(-2) a(-1). The vegetation NPP differed among land use types. The monthly and inter-annual NPP showed substantial variation. The uneven distribution of solar radiation had greater influence on NPP than that of precipitation during the year. The annual NPP presented a fluctuant increasing trend during the past decade, with an increment amplitude of 0-37 g C . m(-2) . a(-1.) The overall annual NPP was increased slightly, with an annual growth rate of 29600 kg C . a(-1). With the implementation of returning farmland to forest and grassland, the area of cultivated region with NPP of 200-300 g C . m(-2) . a(-1) was decreased, and that of the woodland and grassland with NPP of 300-400 g C . m(-2) . a(-1) showed an increasing trend. The change trends of NPP in different areas of Yuanyang could be classified as significant increase (P < 0.01), slight increase (P < 0.05), and no significant change, of which 29.5% of the area increased significantly, and 16.3% of the area increased slightly. The trend of NPP increasing varied across different vegetation types. The proportions of areas with significantly increasing NPP were 58.1% for woodland, 19.2% for grassland, 17.4% for arable land, 11.4% for construction land, and 8% for garden. The changes of NPP were influenced by natural factors and human factors. The correlation coefficient between NPP and temperature or solar radiation was higher than that of precipitation. The large-scale increase of NPP was a result of heat and energy coupling. The comprehensive influence of vegetation characteristics in forested area and human activities including returning farmland to forest and grassland resulted in the greatest seasonal variability of vegetation NPP in forest, which was the main land-use type with significant changes of NPP. Our results provide valuable reference for land use, resources management, and ecosystem reconstruction.

TI  - Improvement of regional-scale winter wheat growth modeling with sub-pixel information
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - To find a solution to the mismatch between remote sensing observation at regional scale and crop modeling at local scale and to improve the accuracy of crop growth modeling, we simulated the growth of winter wheat in Hebi, Henan during 2013-2017 based on the WheatSM crop model integrated with retrieval of leaf area index (LAI) derived from remote sensing data. The remote sensing data included MODIS and Landsat 8 Operational Land Image (OLI) data. Research methods included the reconstruction of LAI process line during the winter wheat growth period, extraction of sub-pixel information, and Ensemble Kalman Filter. Results showed that LAI values after the reconstruction of MODIS LAI process line and extraction of sub-pixel information from pure pixels with winter wheat over 80% were close to the measured LAI with RMSE of 0.69 during two key growing seasons. Compared with actual regional yield during 2013 to 2017, RMSE was 6.73x10(8) kg for simulation without any assimilation process, 8.24x10(8) kg for simulation assimilating original LAI, and lowered to 3.48x10(8) kg for simulation with assimilating MODIS LAI processed with process line reconstruction and sub-pixel information extraction. Our results suggested that the accuracy of crop model at regional scale can be improved when LAI process line is reconstructed and sub-pixel information is extracted to match the spatial scale of crop model.

TI  - Detection of Cropland Change Using Multi-Harmonic Based Phenological Trajectory Similarity
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate information on cropland changes is critical for food production and security, sustainable cropland management, and global change studies. The common change detection methods bi-temporal based, using remotely sensed imagery easily generate pseudo changes due to phenological or seasonal differences. Cropland exhibits a distinctive phenological trajectory that has strong periodic characteristics and seasonal paths. This paper proposes the use of phenological trajectory similarity to search for the overall changes between two time-series images instead of single change events between two dates of imagery. Due to the complex spectral-temporal characteristic of cropland, a phenological trajectory was constructed using a multi-harmonic model for capturing intra-annual variations. Then, phenological trajectory similarity was measured using coefficient vector difference (CVD), and used for detecting change/no-change areas when considering both the amplitude and phase difference. Finally, instead of the traditional classification method based on original images, we used the coefficient ratio vector (CRV) as the input for change type discrimination. The distance between the coefficient ratio vector (CRV) of the change pixel and of the reference change type was calculated to identify the exactly changed types. The performance of this proposed approach was tested using two sets of Landsat time-series images from 2010 and 2015. Moreover, the change area detection results of three other methods, namely, the continuous change detection and classification (CCDC), change vector analysis (CVA), and post-classification comparison (PCC), were also calculated for comparison and analysis. The results indicated that the proposed approach acquired the highest accuracy with an overall accuracy of 98.58% and a kappa coefficient of 0.82, which demonstrated that the method provides the capacity to detect real changes and estimate pseudo changes caused by season differences.

TI  - Sentinel-1 InSAR Measurements of Elevation Changes over Yedoma Uplands on Sobo-Sise Island, Lena Delta
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Yedoma-extremely ice-rich permafrost with massive ice wedges formed during the Late Pleistocene-is vulnerable to thawing and degradation under climate warming. Thawing of ice-rich Yedoma results in lowering of surface elevations. Quantitative knowledge about surface elevation changes helps us to understand the freeze-thaw processes of the active layer and the potential degradation of Yedoma deposits. In this study, we use C-band Sentinel-1 InSAR measurements to map the elevation changes over ice-rich Yedoma uplands on Sobo-Sise Island, Lena Delta with frequent revisit observations (as short as six or 12 days). We observe significant seasonal thaw subsidence during summer months and heterogeneous inter-annual elevation changes from 2016-17. We also observe interesting patterns of stronger seasonal thaw subsidence on elevated flat Yedoma uplands by comparing to the surrounding Yedoma slopes. Inter-annual analyses from 2016-17 suggest that our observed positive surface elevation changes are likely caused by the delayed progression of the thaw season in 2017, associated with mean annual air temperature fluctuations.

TI  - Applying Genetic Algorithm Combining Operation Tree to Predict Algae of Techi Reservoir Using Landsat 8 Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes genetic algorithm combining operation tree (GAOT) and applies it to estimate the bacillariophyta algae of Techi reservoir using Landsat 8 data. GAOT is a data mining method, used to automatically discover the relationships among nonlinear systems. The main advantage of GAOT is to optimize appropriate types of function and their associated coefficients simultaneously. In the case study, this GAOT described above combining with Landsat 8 seven bands was employed. These results are then verified with in situ algae data of Techi reservoir. The results show that the GAOT generates accurate equation and has better performance than linear regression method.

TI  - A Preliminary Evaluation of the GaoFen-3 SAR Radiation Characteristics in Land Surface and Compared With Radarsat-2 and Sentinel-1A
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The first evaluation of GaoFen-3 SAR radiation characteristics and its potential for quantitative parameter estimation in land surface is presented in this letter. Based on two triangle corner reflectors, five impulse response property parameters are calculated to assess image quality of GaoFen-3 SAR, and results show that the peak sidelobe ratio is superior to system specification and the integrated sidelobe ratio cannot be assessed by misconduct in the field campaign mainly for strong background scattering (not low enough). Five distributed target parameters are extracted from three categories and compared with Radarsat-2 and Sentinel-1A quasi-synchronous images in two days. The results indicate good radiometric resolution (RR) of 3 dB and good equivalent number of looks closed to 1 for GaoFen-3 single-look complex product, which proves GaoFen-3 SAR image is at the same quality level with the other two C-band SAR images and its RR meets system design of 3.5 dB. Then, the backscatter coefficient of these three SAR images is compared at bare soil area after GaoFen-3's incidence angle being normalized to 43 degrees by Oh2004 empirical model, and the results reveal the problem of several decibels lower for GaoFen-3 in absolute radiometric calibration. Finally, the capability of surface parameter estimation is justified by statistical relation of GaoFen-3 co-polarization backscatter coefficient and bare soil moisture content, indicating its good potential for quantitative applications in land after solving the problem in calibration.

TI  - Matching Multi-Sensor Remote Sensing Images via an Affinity Tensor
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Matching multi-sensor remote sensing images is still a challenging task due to textural changes and non-linear intensity differences. In this paper, a novel matching method is proposed for multi-sensor remote sensing images. To establish feature correspondences, an affinity tensor is used to integrate geometric and radiometric information. The matching process consists of three steps. First, features from an accelerated segment test are extracted from both source and target images, and two complete graphs are constructed with their nodes representing these features. Then, the geometric and radiometric similarities of the feature points are represented by the three-order affinity tensor, and the initial feature correspondences are established by tensor power iteration. Finally, a tensor-based mismatch detection process is conducted to purify the initial matched points. The robustness and capability of the proposed method are tested with a variety of remote sensing images such as Ziyuan-3 backward, Ziyuan-3 nadir, Gaofen-1, Gaofen-2, unmanned aerial vehicle platform, and Jilin-1. The experiments show that the average matching recall is greater than 0.5, which outperforms state-of-the-art multi-sensor image-matching algorithms such as SIFT, SURF, NG-SIFT, OR-SIFT and GOM-SIFT.

TI  - A Novel Cloud Removal Method Based on IHOT and the Cloud Trajectories for Landsat Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud removal is a prerequisite for the application of Landsat datasets, as such satellite images are invariably contaminated by clouds. Clouds affect the transmission of radiation signal to different degrees because of their different thicknesses, shapes, heights and distributions. Existing methods utilize pixel replacement to remove thick clouds and pixel correction techniques to rectify thin clouds in order to retain the land surface information in contaminated pixels. However, a major limitation of these methods refers to their deficiency in retrieving land surface reflectance when both thick clouds and thin clouds exist in the images, as the two types of clouds differ in the transmission of radiation signal. As most remotely sensed images show rather complex cloud contamination patterns, an efficient method to alleviate both thin and thick cloud effects is in need of development. To this end, the paper proposes a new method to rectify cloud contamination based on the cloud detection of iterative haze-optimized transformation (IHOT) and the cloud removal of cloud trajectory (IHOT-Trajectory). The cloud trajectory is able to take consideration of signal transmission for different levels of cloud contamination, which characterizes the spectral response of a certain type of land cover under increasing cloud thickness. Specifically, this method consists in four steps. First, the cloud thicknesses of contaminated pixels are estimated by the IHOT. Second, areas affected by cloud shadows are marked. Third, cloud trajectories are fitted with the aid of neighboring similar pixels under different cloud thickness. Last, contaminated areas are rectified according to the relationship between the land surface reflectance and the IHOT. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach is able to effectively remove both the thin and thick clouds and erase the cloud shadows of Landsat images under different scenarios. In addition, the proposed method was compared with the dark object subtraction (DOS), the modified neighborhood similar pixel interpolator (MNSPI) and the multitemporal dictionary learning (MDL) methods. Quantitative assessments show that the IHOT-Trajectory method is superior to the other cloud removal methods overall. For specific spectral bands, the proposed method performs better than other methods in visible bands, whereas it does not necessarily perform better in infrared bands.

TI  - Feasibility of using negative ultrasonography results of axillary lymph nodes to predict sentinel lymph node metastasis in breast cancer patients
T2  - CANCER MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of the pathology of axillary lymph nodes (ALN) in breast cancer patients is critical for determining their treatment. Ultrasound is the best noninvasive evaluation for the ALN status. However, the correlation between negative ultrasound results and the sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) pathology remains unknown. To test the hypothesis that negative ultrasound results of ALN predict the negative pathology results of SLN in breast cancer patients, we assessed the association between ALN ultrasonography-negative results and the SLN pathology in 3115 patients with breast cancer recruited between October 2010 and April 2016 from a single cancer center, prospective database. Of these patients who met the inclusion criteria, 2317 (74.4%) had no SLN pathological metastasis. In the univariate analysis, other 798 patient with positive SLN tended to be under age 40 and premenopausal, having large tumor sizes (>2cm), higher histological grade of primary tumor, positive hormone receptors, and negative HER-2 status (P<.05 for all). In the multivariate analysis, menstrual status, tumor size, ER status and histological types of primary tumor remained to be independent predictors for SLN pathological metastasis. The area under curve (AUC) was 0.658 (95% CI=0.637-0.679), P>.05. In conclusion, only a 74.4% consistency between ALN ultrasonography-negative results and negative pathological SLN results, although menstrual status, tumor size, histologic subtypes of primary tumor and ER status were found to be statistically independent predictors of positive SLN among patients negative for ALN ultrasonography. Therefore, the present study suggests that negative ultrasound results of ALN do not adequately predict the negative pathology results of SLN in breast cancer patients.

TI  - Mapping croplands, cropping patterns, and crop types using MODIS time-series data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The importance of mapping regional and global cropland distribution in timely ways has been recognized, but separation of crop types and multiple cropping patterns is challenging due to their spectral similarity. This study developed a new approach to identify crop types (including soy, cotton and maize) and cropping patterns (Soy Maize, Soy-Cotton, Soy-Pasture, Soy-Fallow, Fallow-Cotton and Single crop) in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series data for 2015 and 2016 and field survey data were used in this research. The major steps of this proposed approach include: (1) reconstructing NDVI time series data by removing the cloud-contaminated pixels using the temporal interpolation algorithm, (2) identifying the best periods and developing temporal indices and phenological parameters to distinguish croplands from other land cover types, and (3) developing crop temporal indices to extract cropping patterns using NDVI time-series data and group cropping patterns into crop types. Decision tree classifier was used to map cropping patterns based on these temporal indices. Croplands from Landsat imagery in 2016, cropping pattern samples from field survey in 2016, and the planted area of crop types in 2015 were used for accuracy assessment. Overall accuracies of approximately 90%, 73% and 86%, respectively were obtained for croplands, cropping patterns, and crop types. The adjusted coefficients of determination of total crop, soy, maize, and cotton areas with corresponding statistical areas were 0.94, 0.94, 0.88 and 0.88, respectively. This research indicates that the proposed approach is promising for mapping large-scale croplands, their cropping patterns and crop types.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Landscapes of Plain and Mountain Catchments in the Altai Region During the Last 40 Years
T2  - GEOGRAPHY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatiotemporal dynamics of land covers of representative catchments of the Altai region (Altai Krai and Republic of Altai) was analyzed using remote sensing data and GIS techniques. The following key areas were used: the adjacent basins of Lake Gor'koe and the Kasmala and Barnaulka rivers on the Ob Plateau (Altai krai) were used for the inland drainage area of the Ob-Irtysh interfluve and the left bank of the Upper Ob; the Bol'shaya Rechka basin on the Biisk-Chumysh Upland and ancient Ob terraces (Altai krai), for the right bank of the Upper Ob; the Belaya river basin (Altai krai) for the low mountains and middle mountains of the Northwestern province of Russian Altai, and the Maima river basin (Republic of Altai) for the low mountains and middle mountains of the Northern and Northeastern Altai provinces. The algorithm for analyzing the actual state of land covers and identifying the main vectors of their transformation was adapted to the study area. A series of multitemporal Landsat images for three time slices was used. It is found that the plain catchments of the steppe and forest-steppe zones are characterized by a smaller amplitude of land cover change as compared to the mountain zones. For the inland drainage area of the Ob-Irtysh interfluve and the left bank of the Upper Ob, a reduction of the arable land and a high natural dynamics of water bodies are most indicative. The right bank of the Ob is characterized by the lowest dynamics of all types of land cover and a significant dynamics of artificial water bodies. In the mountain basins, a noticeable decrease in the forest areas largely in favor of natural grass communities was caused by the economic activities. It is also shown that the directions of changes and transitions of different types of land covers can differ greatly for different groups of landscapes.

TI  - Simulating spatial distribution of coastal soil carbon content using a comprehensive land surface factor system based on remote sensing
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface soil carbon content (SCC) in coastal area is affected by complex factors, and revealing the SCC spatial distribution is considerably significant for judging the quantity of stored carbon and identifying the driving factors of SCC variation. A comprehensive land surface factor system (CLSFS) was established; it utilized the ecological significances of remote sensing data and included four-class factors, namely, spectrum information, ecological indices, spatial location, and land cover. Different simulation algorithms, including single-factor regression (SFR), multiple-factor regression (MFR), partial least squares regression (PLSR), and back propagation neural network (BPNN), were adopted to conduct the surface (0-30 cm) SCC mapping in the Yellow River Delta in China, and a 10-fold cross validation approach was used to validate the uncertainty and accuracy of the algorithms. The results indicated that the mean simulated standard deviations were all <0.5 g/kg and thus showed a low uncertainty; the mean root mean squared errors based on the simulated and measured SCC were 3.88 g/kg (SFR), 3.85 g/kg (PLSR), 3.67 g/kg (MFR), and 2.78 g/kg (BPNN) with the BPNN exhibiting a high accuracy compared to similar studies. The mean SCC was 17.40 g/kg in the Yellow River Delta with distinct spatial heterogeneity; in general, the SCC in the alongshore regions, except for estuaries, was low, and that in the west of the study area was high. The mean SCCs in farmland (18.31 g/kg) and wetland vegetation (17.98 g/kg) were higher than those in water area (16.07 g/kg), saltem (15.61 g/kg), and bare land (14.71 g/kg). Land-sea interaction and human activity jointly affected the SCC spatial distribution. The CLSFS was proven to have good applicability, and can be widely used in simulating the SCC spatial distribution in coastal areas. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - BackgroundInformation on the burden, characteristics and seasonality of non-influenza respiratory viruses is limited in tropical countries.ObjectivesDescribe the epidemiology of selected non-influenza respiratory viruses in Thailand between June 2010 and May 2014 using a sentinel surveillance platform established for influenza.MethodsPatients with influenza-like illness (ILI; history of fever or documented temperature 38 degrees C, cough, not requiring hospitalization) or severe acute respiratory infection (SARI; history of fever or documented temperature 38 degrees C, cough, onset <10days, requiring hospitalization) were enrolled from 10 sites. Throat swabs were tested for influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), metapneumovirus (MPV), parainfluenza viruses (PIV) 1-3, and adenoviruses by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR.ResultsWe screened 15369 persons with acute respiratory infections and enrolled 8106 cases of ILI (5069 cases <15years old) and 1754 cases of SARI (1404 cases <15years old). Among ILI cases <15years old, influenza viruses (1173, 23%), RSV (447, 9%), and adenoviruses (430, 8%) were the most frequently identified respiratory viruses tested, while for SARI cases <15years old, RSV (196, 14%) influenza (157, 11%) and adenoviruses (90, 6%) were the most common. The RSV season significantly overlapped the larger influenza season from July to November in Thailand.ConclusionsThe global expansion of influenza sentinel surveillance provides an opportunity to gather information on the characteristics of cases positive for non-influenza respiratory viruses, particularly seasonality, although adjustments to case definitions may be required.

TI  - Dynamics of soil salinity and vegetation in a reclaimed area in Saemangeum, Republic of Korea
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - The dynamics of soil salinity and vegetation in a reclaimed area in Saeamangeum were analyzed. The soil salinity, as measured by electric conductivity (EC) was monitored from 2014 (4 years after the tidal flat became land) to 2016. The average EC decreased during the three years (3.99, 2.85 and 1.92). The spatial distribution of EC was modeled using the Matern isotropic model. The partial sill, the variance that can be modeled by a spatial model, decreased during the three years. The smoothness parameter that determined the shape of the variogram changed from 0.3 to 0.7 to 2 for the years studied. The results show that the spatial structure of soil salinity can be monitored more precisely using the Matern model due to its flexibility. The relationship between vegetation indices and the EC for the three years was tested to figure out the effect of time lag on the relationship. The variation of vegetation indices was better explained by the EC of the previous year than of the year in which the image was taken. It takes a year for plants to colonize the desalinized area. Thus, the estimation using remote sensing data could be misleading if the time lag is not considered, particularly in a place where the environment changes rapidly.

TI  - Radial scar on image-guided breast biopsy: is surgical excision necessary?
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Radial scar's stellate appearance may mimic carcinoma mammographically and histologically. Management of radial scar (RS) found on breast core needle biopsies (CNB) ranges from excision to clinical observation due to the variation in reported upgrades to malignancy at surgical excision. We examined the upgrade rate in patients with RS detected on CNB at our institution and reviewed the current literature.A retrospective study was conducted of all cases with RS diagnosed on CNB between December 2006 and March 2017 at our institution. Inclusion criteria were patients with "pure" RS and RS associated with high-risk lesions (HRL). Upgrade was defined as invasive or non-invasive cancer in the excisional biopsy.157 cases were identified with RS on CNB, and 122 cases met inclusion criteria. Of these 122 cases, 91 (75%) had pure RS on CNB while 31 (25%) had associated atypia or HRL. 81 (66%) of patients proceeded to excisional biopsy and 41 (34%) did not. Two patients (1.6% of total) were found to have a low-grade invasive ductal carcinoma (0.6 and 0.8 cm) upon surgical excision. None of the remaining 120 patients developed an ipsilateral breast cancer with a mean of 32.3-month follow-up.We found a very low upgrade rate to breast cancer when RS was found on CNB with or without associated HRL. Our results are consistent with other reported series. Our data do not support surgical excision for RS but rather close clinical follow-up for patients with RS on CNB.

TI  - The deterioration of materials as a result of air pollution as derived from satellite and ground based observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Dose Response Functions (DRFs) are widely used in estimating corrosion and/or soiling levels of materials used in building constructions and cultural monuments. These functions quantify the effects of air pollution and environmental parameters on different materials through ground based measurements of specific air pollutants and climatic parameters. Here, we propose a new approach where available satellite observations are used instead of ground-based data. Through this approach, the use of DRFs is expanded to cover situations where there are no in situ measurements, introducing also a totally new field where satellite data can be shown to be very helpful. In the present work satellite observations made by MODIS (MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) on board Terra and Aqua, OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) on board Aura and AIRS (Atmospheric Infrared Sounder) on board Aqua have been used.

TI  - Composite Impact of Global Hawk Unmanned Aircraft Dropwindsondes on Tropical Cyclone Analyses and Forecasts
T2  - MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - The impacts of Global Hawk (GH) dropwindsondes on tropical cyclone (TC) analyses and forecasts are examined over a composite sample of missions flown during the NASA Hurricane and Severe Storm Sentinel (HS3) and the NOAA Sensing Hazards with Operational Unmanned Technology (SHOUT) field campaigns. An ensemble Kalman filter is employed to assimilate the dropwindsonde observations at the vortex scale. With the assimilation of GH dropwindsondes, TCs generally exhibit fewer position and intensity errors, a better wind-pressure relationship, and improved representation of integrated kinetic energy in the analyses. The resulting track and intensity forecasts with all the cases generally show a positive impact when GH dropwindsondes are assimilated. The impact of GH dropwindsondes is further explored with cases stratified by intensity change and presence of crewed aircraft data. GH dropwindsondes demonstrate a larger impact for nonsteady-state TCs [non-SS; 24-h intensity change larger than 20 kt (similar to 10 m s(-1))] than for steady-state (SS) TCs. The relative skill from assimilating GH dropwindsondes ranges between 25% and 35% for either the position or intensity improvement in the final analyses overall, but only similar to 5%-10% for SS cases alone. The resulting forecasts for non-SS cases show higher skill for both track and intensity than SS cases. In addition, the GH dropwindsonde impact on TC forecasts varies in the presence of crewed aircraft data. An increased intensity improvement at long lead times is seen when crewed aircraft data are absent. This demonstrates the importance of strategically designing flight patterns to exploit the sampling strengths of the GH and crewed aircraft in order to maximize data impacts on TC prediction.

TI  - 3-D Morphological Change Analysis of a Beach with Seagrass Berm Using a Terrestrial Laser Scanner
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Along many Mediterranean coasts, the detached seagrass material of Posidonia oceanica creates seagrass berms that control the structure and morphodynamics of sandy beaches. Here, we show how Terrestrial Laser Scanner remote sensing data allows analyzing the 3-D morphologic change of beaches where this characteristic geomorphic structure is present. We propose a methodology for estimating accretion/erosion (almost 200 m(3) in our study) by considering the sand dominated and seagrass berms as two independent elements. For this purpose, two different sampling dates (named scenarios A and B, before and after an erosive heavy storms period, respectively) recorded in a microtidal pocket-beach (300 m(2)) with these characteristic geomorphic structures have been modeled in 3-D. The present approach constitutes a cost-efficient, accurate, and quick tool to survey the sand volume in natural and artificial replenished beaches. The innovative approach, which can be considered as a conceptual and methodological starting point, can be useful to examine long-term and high-precision data sets in future studies of the morphodynamic evolution of these characteristic Mediterranean beaches.

TI  - Response diversity, functional redundancy, and post-logging productivity in northern temperate and boreal forests
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of efficient ecosystem resilience indicators was identified as one of the key research priorities in the improvement of existing sustainable forest management frameworks. Two indicators of tree diversity associated with ecosystem functioning have recently received particular attention in the literature: functional redundancy (FR) and response diversity (RD). We examined how these indicators could be used to predict post-logging productivity in forests of Quebec, Canada. We analysed the relationships between pre-logging FR and RD, as measured with sample plots, and post-logging productivity, measured as seasonal variation in enhanced vegetation index obtained from MODIS satellite imagery. The effects of the deciduous and coniferous tree components in our pre-disturbance diversity assessments were isolated in order to examine the hypothesis that they have different impacts on post-disturbance productivity. We also examined the role of tree species richness and species identity effects. Our analysis revealed the complementary nature of traditional biodiversity indicators and trait-based approaches in the study of biodiversity-ecosystem-functioning relationships in dynamic ecosystems. We report a significant and positive relationship between pre-disturbance deciduous RD and post-disturbance productivity, as well as an unexpected significant negative effect of coniferous RD on productivity. This negative relationship with post-logging productivity likely results from slower coniferous regeneration speeds and from the relatively short temporal scale examined. Negative black-spruce-mediated identity effects were likely associated with increased stand vulnerability to paludification and invasion by ericaceous shrubs that slow down forest regeneration. Response diversity outperformed functional redundancy as a measure of post-disturbance productivity most likely due to the stand-replacing nature of the disturbance considered. To the best of our knowledge, this is among the first studies to report a negative significant relationship between a component of RD and ecosystem functioning, namely coniferous RD and forest ecosystem productivity after a stand-replacing disturbance.

TI  - Variability of urban surface temperatures and implications for aerodynamic energy exchange in unstable conditions
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sensible heat flux (Q(H)) is a critical driver of surface and boundary layer meteorological processes, especially in urban areas. Aerodynamic resistance methods (ARM) for modelling Q(H) are promising because, in principle, all that is needed is surface temperature (T-0), air temperature (T-A) and an aerodynamic resistance term (r(H)). There are significant challenges in urban areas, however, due to uncertainties in satellite-derived land surface temperatures (LST), logistical challenges in obtaining high-resolution air temperatures, and a limited understanding of spatial and temporal variability of r(H) and associated variables (e.g. thermal roughness length). This work uses an extensive LST dataset covering 6years (2011-2016) in central London and a long-term in situ observation network to analyse the variability of LST and r(H) variables. Results show that LST is spatially correlated with building and vegetation land cover with coherent thermal structures at length scales less than 500-1,000m. Additionally, satellite-observed LST varies with average building height (up to 10% cooler in areas with tall buildings). The r(H) term and associated variables are observed to vary on daily and seasonal cycles, and findings are used to model Q(H) using five variations of an ARM-based approach on a 100m pixel basis. Modelled Q(H) is compared to observations from three scintillometer paths and an eddy covariance flux tower. We find generally good agreement between observations and models, although there is uncertainty in all methods (mean absolute error ranges from 58.1-129.3W/m(2)) due to the challenges involved in determining high-resolution meteorological and surface inputs, particularly LST and friction velocity (u(*)). Additional complexity in evaluating modelled Q(H) arises from anthropogenic heat sources: long-term tower-based observations show that T-A and the radiometer-derived T-0 are warmer during working weekdays than non-working days (up to 0.7 degrees C) and that there is an observed lag (2-3hr) between energy consumption and the observed warming and modelled Q(H).

TI  - Cross-Scale Correlation between In Situ Measurements of Canopy Gap Fraction and Landsat-Derived Vegetation Indices with Implications for Monitoring the Seasonal Pin Tropical Forests Using MODIS Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deciduousness in dry tropical forests results in substantial seasonal changes to canopy gap fractions. The characterization of such structural properties over large areas is necessary for understanding energy and nutrient distribution within forest ecosystems. However, a spatial extrapolation of measurements from relatively few, spatially-concentrated field observations can yield estimated values that have questionable accuracy and precision at regional scales. This paper uses linear regression models to compare measurements of canopy gap fraction from in situ digital cover photography in the dry tropical forest of the Southern Yucatan, Mexico, to measurements of seasonal vegetation change based on three vegetation indices-the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), two-band Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI2), and the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI)-derived from Landsat-7 ETM+ and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data to gauge the ability of standardized combinations of multispectral reflectance data to accurately describe the intensity of deciduousness that occurs during the dry season. Discrete observations are compared, as well as spatially summarized values at coarser spatial scales. Model R-2 values are greater at coarse spatial scales for all vegetation indices. Models of in situ measurements of gap fraction and Landsat NDWI normalized seasonal change exhibit stronger correlation than do models that feature NDVI or EVI2 (R-2 = 0.751 and Mean Absolute Error = 0.04 after aggregation, R-2 = 0.552 and MAE = 0.07 for observation-level data). Based on its comparatively strong correlation with field observations, NDWI is adapted to a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) time series and used for spatial extrapolation and the monitoring of canopy conditions. NDWI values derived from MODIS data are regressed against Tropical Rainforest Measuring Misson (TRMM) rainfall data over the period 2000-2011, and the regression results are compared to those of a prior study that used regression to explain the variation of a MODIS EVI using TRMM rainfall data. A MODIS NDWI time series reveals stronger correlation (R-2 = 0.48 in deciduous forests) with TRMM accumulated (three-month) rainfall data than a MODIS EVI time series. The results indicate that an NDWI time series can accurately describe a variability of canopy leaf abundance during the dry season and could be an alternative basis of long-term monitoring of season phenology in a dry tropical forest.

T2  - MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Micronuclei (MN) and nuclear buds (NB) frequency was assessed monthly over a one-year period in erythrocytes of common soles (Solea solea) from the Basque continental shelf, a minor disturbed area, in order to determine baseline levels and potential biotic and abiotic confounding factors within biomonitoring purposes. Both genotoxic parameters presented seasonal variations, although only NB frequency was positively correlated with environmental variables (i.e. water temperature and salinity). On the contrary, MN and NB were not affected by age and gender. Therefore, samples of combined age and gender can be used for biomonitoring genotoxic effects, although sampling period together with water temperature and salinity should be thoroughly considered for NB. Overall, these findings are the first attempt to establish baseline MN (0.10-0.78 parts per thousand) and NB (0.13-0.82 parts per thousand) frequencies in common sole from Basque marine waters, which are useful for upcoming data comparisons and integration within genotoxicity evaluation procedures of similar marine environments under biomonitoring scopes.

TI  - Combining Linear Pixel Unmixing and STARFM for Spatiotemporal Fusion of Gaofen-1 Wide Field of View Imagery and MODIS Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal fusion of remote sensing data is essential for generating high spatial and temporal resolution data by taking advantage of high spatial resolution and high temporal resolution imageries. At present, the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) is one of the most widely used spatiotemporal fusion technologies of remote sensing data. However, the quality of data acquired by STARFM depends on temporal information from homogeneous land cover patches at the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) imagery, and the estimation accuracy of STARFM degrades in highly fragmentated and heterogeneous patches. To address this problem, we developed an innovative method to improve fusion accuracy, especially in areas of high heterogeneity, by combining linear pixel unmixing and STARFM. This method derived the input data of STARFM by downscaling the MODIS data with a linear spectral mixture model. Through this fusion method, the complement effect of the advantages of remote sensing information can be realized, and the multi-source remote sensing data can be realized for visual data mining. The developed fusion method was applied in Bosten Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China, and our analysis of results suggests that (1) after introducing the linear spectral mixture model, the fusion images illustrated improved spatial details to a certain extent and can be employed to identify small objects, as well as their texture distribution information; (2) for fragmented and highly heterogeneous areas, a stronger correlation between the predicted results and the real images was observed when compared to STARFM with small bias; and (3) the predicted red band and near infrared band can generate high-precision 16-m NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data with advantages in both spatial resolution and temporal resolution. The results are generally consistent with the Gaofen-1 wide field of view cameras (GF-1 WFV) NDVI in the same period and therefore can reflect the spatial distribution of NDVI in detail.

TI  - Variability in Cross-Domain Risk Perception among Smallholder Farmers in Mali by Gender and Other Demographic and Attitudinal Characteristics
T2  - RISK ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous research has shown that men and women, on average, have different risk attitudes and may therefore see different value propositions in response to new opportunities. We use data from smallholder farm households in Mali to test whether risk perceptions differ by gender and across domains. We model this potential association across six risks (work injury, extreme weather, community relationships, debt, lack of buyers, and conflict) while controlling for demographic and attitudinal characteristics. Factor analysis highlights extreme weather and conflict as eliciting the most distinct patterns of participant response. Regression analysis for Mali as a whole reveals an association between gender and risk perception, with women expressing more concern except in the extreme weather domain; however, the association with gender is largely absent when models control for geographic region. We also find lower risk perception associated with an individualistic and/or fatalistic worldview, a risk-tolerant outlook, and optimism about the future, while education, better health, a social orientation, self-efficacy, and access to information are generally associated with more frequent worrywith some inconsistency. Income, wealth, and time poverty exhibit complex associations with perception of risk. Understanding whether and how men's and women's risk preferences differ, and identifying other dominant predictors such as geographic region and worldview, could help development organizations to shape risk mitigation interventions to increase the likelihood of adoption, and to avoid inadvertently making certain subpopulations worse off by increasing the potential for negative outcomes.

TI  - Machine learning modeling of plant phenology based on coupling satellite and gridded meteorological dataset
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in the timing of plant phenological phases are important proxies in contemporary climate research. However, most of the commonly used traditional phenological observations do not give any coherent spatial information. While consistent spatial data can be obtained from airborne sensors and preprocessed gridded meteorological data, not many studies robustly benefit from these data sources. Therefore, the main aim of this study is to create and evaluate different statistical models for reconstructing, predicting, and improving quality of phenological phases monitoring with the use of satellite and meteorological products. A quality-controlled dataset of the 13 BBCH plant phenophases in Poland was collected for the period 2007-2014. For each phenophase, statistical models were built using the most commonly applied regression-based machine learning techniques, such as multiple linear regression, lasso, principal component regression, generalized boosted models, and random forest. The quality of the models was estimated using a k-fold cross-validation. The obtained results showed varying potential for coupling meteorological derived indices with remote sensing products in terms of phenological modeling; however, application of both data sources improves models' accuracy from 0.6 to 4.6 day in terms of obtained RMSE. It is shown that a robust prediction of early phenological phases is mostly related to meteorological indices, whereas for autumn phenophases, there is a stronger information signal provided by satellite-derived vegetation metrics. Choosing a specific set of predictors and applying a robust preprocessing procedures is more important for final results than the selection of a particular statistical model. The average RMSE for the best models of all phenophases is 6.3, while the individual RMSE vary seasonally from 3.5 to 10 days. Models give reliable proxy for ground observations with RMSE below 5 days for early spring and late spring phenophases. For other phenophases, RMSE are higher and rise up to 9-10 days in the case of the earliest spring phenophases.

M3  - Article
AB  - Background. The safety and health of healthcare workers employed in twenty-four-hour hospital wards anti exposed to rotational shiftwork (RS), including night shift, is an hot topic of international literature; in fact shift workers incur increased rates of burnout, accidents and injuries, absenteeism and, consequently, reduced work efficiency than non-shift workers. The aims of the present study were: 1) to analyze the occupational risk associated with RS in healthcare sector and 2) to detect the consequent interventions effective in minimizing RS risk.Methods. The authors designed a questionnaire entitled Rotating Shiftwork Questionnaire (RSQ) which is made up of two sections: 1) Sentinel Events; 2) Risk Factors. The authors used the RSQ to evaluate the RS-Risk among homogeneous groups employed in a twenty-four-hour hospital department.Results. The authors found a medium level of risk among all homogeneous groups. The analysis led to suggest organizational interventions for reducing the sources of RS-risk among healthcare workers.Conclusion. The proposed questionnaire revealed effective in approaching the assessment of RS-risk; the findings were also useful in prioritizing and implementing strategic interventions aimed to moderate the occupational risk related to RS.

TI  - Analysis of the impact on vegetation caused by abrupt deforestation via orbital sensor in the environmental disaster of Mariana, Brazil
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The failure of the Fundao Dam in Mariana, more precisely in the subdistrict of Bento Rodrigues, state of Minas Gerais (Brazil) on November 5th, 2015, is considered to be "the biggest environmental tragedy in the country's history." About thirty-four million cubic meters of tailings were dumped into the river where, another 16 million continued to reach the Atlantic ocean. This disaster seriously affected the flora, fauna, economic activities and people's lives, including the loss of human lives. Remote sensing allows mapping the variability of terrain properties, such as vegetation, water and geology, both in space and time, offering a synoptic view and useful environmental information in future decision making. In this way, this research aims to analyze the impacts of the failure of the Fundao Dam in the municipality of Mariana-MG on the vegetation cover, by means of remote sensing techniques and analysis of digital processing of orbital optical images. In order to analyze the soil cover, Unmixing Espectral Linear Model (UELM) was used in order to separate soil, shade and vegetation classes. Subsequently, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classification method was applied, followed by Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The results showed a loss of 13.02% of the vegetation, about 1289 ha, and a reduction of 68.57% of shade (water), approximately 1347 ha. The UELM showed to be effective in the separation of each image-fraction, being an important stage for the success of the classification. The EVI was the index that best described the vegetation deficit in the affected areas spilling the sludge from waste.

TI  - GENE EXPRESSION ANALYSIS IN THE IDENTIFICATION OF POTENTIAL PREDICTIVE MARKERS IN MAMMARY MALIGNANT NEOPLASMS
T2  - REVISTA UNIVAP
M3  - Article
AB  - The status of axillary lymph nodes is the most informative prognostic factor in the treatment of patients with breast cancer. However, currently, in clinical practice, the decision to dissect lymph nodes is still performed by sentinel lymph node biopsy, which can often bring consequences to the patient or give incorrect results. Thus, the identification of molecular markers in the primary malignant neoplasm that may allow a more accurate classification of the patients in relation to the necessity or not of axillary lymph node dissection is extremely important for a more adequate clinical management. The aim of this study was to determine if the genes SERPINA1, TFF3, TFF1, ARD1A, NGX6 and DKK1 are predictive markers in breast cancer by the analysis of gene expression of RT-qPCR. For this, we compared the group of primary malignant neoplasm with the involvement of lymph nodes and primary malignant neoplasm without affected lymph nodes, in addition to the analysis of the corresponding lymph nodes. For all genes evaluated, only the gene TFF1 presented a differential expression in the comparison of the primary tumor with the corresponding lymph node, although it did not show a statistical difference in the comparison of the positive lymph node primary neoplasm with the negative lymph node primary neoplasm. The results showed that none of the genes analyzed can be considered predictive marker in breast cancer.

TI  - God as Creator: a proposal of relationship between science and theology
T2  - REVELETEO-REVISTA ELECTRONICA ESPACO TEOLOGICO
M3  - Article
AB  - The present text deals with some of the ways used to argue in favor of the existence of God. It seems, however, that an appeal to the arrangement of the world in order to evidence the truth of theism faces a number of limitations. The central hypothesis of theistic worldview, however, is consistent with the assumption of science itself, an intelligible universe being what one would expect from a reality created by someone intelligent with purpose. The approach of focusing on the cognoscibility of the world, although not eliminating the doubt about the existence of God, seems to be a more promising proposal, in the context of the dialogue between science and theology, than the proposal that focuses on gaps in human knowledge, in order to fit God in these gaps, since the previous one, contrary to this, can't be eroded by the progress of scientific knowledge.

TI  - Timeliness in the notification of spotted fever in Brazil: Evaluating compulsory reporting strategies and digital disease detection
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Spotted fever is caused by rickettsia species, and is the most important tick-borne disease. In Brazil, it requires national compulsory notification to the Ministry of Health. Since 2007, all suspected cases of spotted fever have been integrated into the Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN). In this descriptive study we evaluate the timeliness (expressed in number of days between time of clinical suspicion and reporting) of the compulsory notification of spotted fever cases in SINAN and the strategy for digital disease detection (DDD). This study analysed the information from the SINAN and from the digital detection strategy used by ProMED-Portugues. Results show that detection by the SINAN system was more efficient than Promed-Portugues, reporting 90.4% of evaluated suspected cases 20.5 days earlier. The surveillance strategy based on the mandatory case reporting using SINAN has proven to be more timely, but DDD can be considered as a complementary strategy providing a more disseminate epidemiological information to wide range readership globally.

TI  - Is Nature Relatedness Associated with Better Mental and Physical Health?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Nature relatedness is a psychological characteristic with the potential to drive interaction with nature and influence well-being. We surveyed 1538 people in Brisbane, Australia to investigate how nature relatedness varies among socio-demographic groups. We determined whether people with higher nature relatedness reported fewer symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress and better overall health, controlling for potentially confounding socio-demographic and health-related variables. Overall nature relatedness was higher in older people, females, those without children living at home, not working, and people speaking English at home. Aspects of nature relatedness reflecting enjoyment of nature were consistently associated with reduced ill health, consistent with widespread evidence of the health and well-being benefits of experiencing nature. In contrast, aspects of nature relatedness reflecting self-identification with nature, and a conservation worldview, were associated with increased depression, anxiety or stress, after accounting for potential confounding factors. Detailed investigation of causal pathways among nature relatedness, socio-demographic factors and health is warranted, with particular focus on the relationship between stress and nature orientation.

TI  - Subsidence Evolution of the Firenze-Prato-Pistoia Plain (Central Italy) Combining PSI and GNSS Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Subsidence phenomena, as well as landslides and floods, are one of the main geohazards affecting the Tuscany region (central Italy). The monitoring of related ground deformations plays a key role in their management to avoid problems for buildings and infrastructure. In this scenario, Earth observation offers a better solution in terms of costs and benefits than traditional techniques (e.g., GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) or levelling networks), especially for wide area applications. In this work, the subsidence-related ground motions in the Firenze-Prato-Pistoia plain were back-investigated to track the evolution of displacement from 2003 to 2017 by means of multi-interferometric analysis of ENVISAT and Sentinel-1 imagery combined with GNSS data. The resulting vertical deformation velocities are aligned to the European Terrestrial Reference System 89 (ETRS89) datum and can be considered real velocity of displacement. The vertical ground deformation maps derived by ENVISAT and Sentinel-1 data, corrected with the GNSS, show how the area affected by subsidence for the period 2003-2010 and the period 2014-2017 evolved. The differences between the two datasets in terms of the extension and velocity values were analysed and then associated with the geological setting of the basin and external factors, e.g., new greenhouses and nurseries. This analysis allowed for reconstructing the evolution of the subsidence for the area of interest showing an increment of ground deformation in the historic centre of Pistoia Town, a decrement of subsidence in the nursery area between Pistoia and Prato cities, and changes in the industrial sector close to Prato.

TI  - Interannual Variability of the Ice Cover and Primary Production of the Kara Sea
T2  - OCEANOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Model and satellite data have been used to analyze interannual changes in the primary production (PP), ice-free area, and water temperature in the Kara Sea between 2002 and 2016. Significant positive trends for changes in the surface water temperature were recorded for all regions of the Kara Sea (R-2 = 0.37-0.61, p < 0.05). A reliable trend toward an increase in ice-free surface area was observed only for the Yenisei estuary. PP growth trends were significant in the northern Region of the sea and the Yenisei estuary. The decrease in ice cover area for the entire Kara Sea amounted to 1% per year. APP minimum was recorded in 2003, and a maximum, in 2011. The average increase in Kara Sea PP during the study period was 2% per year. The most rapid increase in Kara Sea PP was observed during the spring season (April-May). The increase in annual PP was mostly due to the expansion of the ice-free area. The increase in the phytoplankton photosynthesis rate could not have resulted in the increase in PP, because the average photosynthesis rate for the entire sea decreased during the study period. Considerable region-specific variation in the patterns of interannual Changes in PP in the Kara Sea were observed.

TI  - Laparoendoscopic Single-Site Sentinel Lymph Node Detection in Endometrial Cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF MINIMALLY INVASIVE GYNECOLOGY
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Study Objective: To demonstrate the feasibility of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy using a laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) approach in endometrial cancer (EC).Design: A step-by-step video demonstration of the surgical procedure (Canadian Task Force Classification III).Setting: The satisfaction of patients who undergo LESS hysterectomy is greater than that reported by patients who undergo multiport laparoscopic hysterectomy, owing to better cosmesis and reduced postoperative analgesic requirements [1]. SLN biopsy is associated with significantly lower estimated blood loss, shorter operation time, and less morbidity compared with systematic lymphadenectomy [2]. LESS surgery can be more feasible and safer with the use of SLN biopsy compared with complete lymphadenectomy in patients with early-stage EC.Interventions: This 69-year-old woman with grade 2 endometrioid EC underwent SLN mapping followed by LESS SLN biopsy, total hysterectomy, and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Before the umbilical incision was made, 1.25 mg/mL of indocyanine green was injected into the cervical stroma at the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock positions to both deep and superficial levels. A 10-mm 30 degrees standard-length optical camera for near-infrared fluorescence imaging was used. The total operative time was 75 minutes, and the estimated blood loss was 20 mL. SLNs were detected bilaterally between proximal parts of the external iliac arteries and veins. After SLN resection, total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy were performed. No postoperative complications occurred. The patient was discharged at 30 hours after surgery. In the final pathology, stage 1A G2 EC was detected.Conclusion: LESS SLN biopsy and TLH-BSO is a feasible procedure and sentinel lymph node concept may increase the use of LESS in EC. (C) 2017 AAGL.

T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to generate a land productivity dynamics (LPD) map of a degraded catchment located in sub-humid terrestrial ecosystem via a land degradation assessment using three indicators, namely land use and land cover, land productivity, and soil organic carbon density. The study was carried out in two adjacent microcatchments located in Gediz River Basin and conducted between 2001 and 2015. For this purpose, Landsat satellite images were used to determine changing of land use and land cover and vegetation density. In addition, 319 soil samples were collected from surface and subsurface soil depths to detect soil organic carbon density of the study area in May 2015. According to the study results, in more than 23% of the catchments' area of approx. 3896 ha, land productivity is observed to decline while about 24% shows early signs of decline level. Some of these areas used under agricultural cropping, overgrazed pasture, and artificial areas showed evidence of soil erosion problem. Only very small area of the catchment shows stable and increasing land productivity dynamics trend during the 14-year period.

TI  - Australian snowpack in the NARCliM ensemble: evaluation, bias correction and future projections
T2  - CLIMATE DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study we evaluate the ability of an ensemble of high-resolution Regional Climate Model simulations to represent snow cover characteristics over the Australian Alps and go on to asses future projections of snowpack characteristics. Our results show that the ensemble presents a cold temperature bias and overestimates total precipitation leading to a general overestimation of the snow cover as compared with MODIS satellite data. We then produce a new set of snowpack characteristics by running a temperature based snow melt/accumulation model forced by bias corrected temperature and precipitation fields. While some positive snow cover biases remain, the bias corrected (BC) dataset show large improvements regarding the simulation of total amounts, seasonality and spatial distribution of the snow cover compared with MODIS products. Both the raw and BC datasets are then used to assess future changes in the snowpack characteristics. Both datasets show robust increases in near-surface temperatures and decreases in snowfall that lead to a substantial reduction of the snowpack over the Australian Alps. The snowpack decreases by about 15 and 60% by 2030 and 2070 respectively. While the BC data introduce large differences in the simulation of the present climate snowpack, in relative terms future changes appear to be similar to those obtained using the raw data. Future temperature projections show a clear dependence with elevation through the snow-albedo feedback effect that affects snowpack projections. Uncertainties in future projections of the snowpack are large in both datasets and are mainly dominated by the choice of the lateral boundary conditions.

TI  - Language capacity is not enough: Be intentional about growing culture and worldview understanding
T2  - MISSIOLOGY-AN INTERNATIONAL REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding a community's culture and worldview and having capacity in their first language are considered essential elements for engaging in contextual cross-cultural ministry. Many sending organizations provide training, time, resources and programs to help cross-cultural workers grow their language capacity. The same provisions, however, are not often made for gaining culture and worldview understanding. The reasons for this are varied, but include: a tacit belief that adequate culture and worldview understanding occurs naturally with the gaining of language capacity; a belief that workers come equipped for gaining culture and worldview understanding; a lack of suitable culture and worldview inquiry programs, as well as a lack of trained personnel to facilitate them. An Australian cross-cultural ministry sending organization is seeking to address this imbalance structurally in their organization by developing and providing cross-cultural workers with a culture and worldview inquiry program, the facilitation of each cross-cultural worker's culture and language program, and by training cross-cultural workers in culture and worldview inquiry methods. The results of this are that individuals and teams are growing their language capacities and their understanding of their host communities' cultures and worldviews, and are applying this knowledge to their engagement with the communities with whom they work.

T2  - BUNDESGESUNDHEITSBLATT-GESUNDHEITSFORSCHUNG-GESUNDHEITSSCHUTZ
M3  - Article
AB  - The revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) could change morbidity and mortality statistics significantly, which also affects the area of infectious diseases. Infectious diseases are classified according to their etiology, affected body systemor the life period during which the episode occurs. Specific challenges arise from emerging pathogens and the respective necessary adaptation. For epidemiologic analysis ICD-10 does not always offer enough additional information.ICD provides the basis for international comparison of infectious diseasemorbidity and mortality statistics, but it is also used to collect data for surveillance and research purposes, e.g. the notification system for infectious diseases, syndromic surveillance systems and the evaluation of data quality by using secondary data sources.ICD-11 offers the chance to better represent epidemiological concepts of infectious diseases by adding more relevant information as affected body system or manifestation. Due to the complexity of coding, ensuring continuity of morbidity and mortality statistics could be challenging.

TI  - Assessment of Blood Lead, Zinc, and Mercury Concentrations and Cholinesterase Activity in Captive-reared Alligator Snapping Turtles (<i>Macrochelys</i> <i>temminckii</i>) in Louisiana, USA
T2  - JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - The alligator snapping turtle (Macrochelys temminckii) is a freshwater apex predator that has experienced severe population declines throughout its range due to historical overharvesting and habitat degradation. Because of its long lifespan, high trophic level, and limited home range, it is a suitable sentinel species for monitoring environmental contaminants. In Louisiana, US a pilot program aims to augment free-ranging populations by releasing captive-reared individuals. Baseline values of potential environmental contaminants were determined as part of an overall health assessment to evaluate captive-reared alligator snapping turtles for release. Blood samples from 3-yr-old (n = 23) and 4-yr-old (n = 11) captive-reared alligator snapping turtles were tested for lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), and zinc (Zn) levels by atomic absorption spectrophotometry and cholinesterase (ChE) activity (as a biomarker for organophosphate and carbamate exposure) by the modified Ellman method. Reference intervals were determined for Zn (34 to 295 mu g/dL), Hg (0 to 4.8 mu g/dL), and ChE (0.17 to 1.65 lmole acetylthiocholine/mL per minute). Elevations of Pb, Zn, or Hg, or decreases in ChE activity levels of this cohort during recapture sampling may indicate point-source intoxications or bioaccumulation, both ultimately attributable to environmental contamination. The released animals may serve as sentinels for biomonitoring of their new habitat for the evaluated toxicants.

TI  - Impact of atmospheric stability on X-band and C-band synthetic aperture radar imagery of offshore windpark wakes
T2  - JOURNAL OF RENEWABLE AND SUSTAINABLE ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - C-band and X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data acquired by the Sentinel-1 and TerraSAR-X satellites are used to study atmospheric wakes behind offshore wind parks in the German Bight. A particular focus is on the impact of atmospheric stability on wake parameters like the wake length. Stability parameters are estimated from measurements taken at the FINO-1 observation platform. Based on a data set covering different seasons and concentrating on the first German offshore wind park Alpha Ventus (AV), it is shown that in this area stable atmospheric conditions favour longer wakes. This is first demonstrated for situations, where the wake behind AV was unperturbed by other neighbor wind parks. In this case, wakes of more than 30 kin length are observed. In a second step, the more complicated situation with wake superposition from different neighboring wind parks is analysed. It is shown that in this case, the merged wakes can extend to more than 70 km downstream.The analysis is challenged by two factors. First of all, the FINO-1 platform is within the wind farm wakes for a certain range of wind directions. This means stability estimates for the upstream conditions are not straightforward to obtain in these conditions. The second complication is associated with an apparent increase in the radar cross section downstream of wind parks observed on many SAR scenes, typically within the first 10km downstream the wind park. A semi-empirical model is proposed to explain this effect by an increased downward momentum flux associated with increased turbulence generated by the wind park. Applying numerical inversion methods, a couple of typical downstream wind speed profiles are reproduced with this model based on SAR derived estimates of the friction velocity.

TI  - Detecting and Quantifying a Massive Invasion of Floating Aquatic Plants in the Rio de la Plata Turbid Waters Using High Spatial Resolution Ocean Color Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The massive development of floating plants in floodplain lakes and wetlands in the upper Middle Parana river in the La Plata basin is environmentally and socioeconomically important. Every year aquatic plant detachments drift downstream arriving in small amounts to the Rio de la Plata, but huge temporary invasions have been observed every 10 or 15 years associated to massive floods. From late December 2015, heavy rains driven by a strong El Nino increased river levels, provoking a large temporary invasion of aquatic plants from January to May 2016. This event caused significant disruption of human activities via clogging of drinking water intakes in the estuary, blocking of ports and marinas and introducing dangerous animals from faraway wetlands into the city. In this study, we developed a scheme to map floating vegetation in turbid waters using high-resolution imagery, like Sentinel-2/SMI (MultiSpectral Imager), Landsat-8/OLI (Operational Land Imager), and Aqua/MODIS (MODerate resolution Imager Spectroradiometer)-250 m. A combination of the Floating Algal Index (that make use of the strong signal in the NIR part of the spectrum), plus conditions set on the RED band (to avoid misclassifying highly turbid waters) and on the CIE La*b* color space coordinates (to confirm the visually "green" pixels as floating vegetation) were used. A time-series of multisensor high resolution imagery was analyzed to study the temporal variability, covered area and distribution of the unusual floating macroalgae invasion that started in January 2016 in the Rio de la Plata estuary.

TI  - ESGO Survey on Current Practice in the Management of Cervical Cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective The aim of this survey was to acquire an overview of the current management of cervical cancer with an emphasis on the early disease stages.Materials and Methods A hyperlink to the survey was sent to the European Society of Gynaecological Oncology Office database. The survey contained 6 groups of questions regarding the characteristics of respondents, pretreatment workup, management of the early stages of cervical cancer, adjuvant treatment, fertility-sparing treatment, and surveillance.Results In total, 566 responses were collected. The most frequent imaging method used in the workup was magnetic resonance imaging (74%), followed by computed tomography (54%) and positron emission tomography/computed tomography (25%). Conization or simple hysterectomy was a preferred procedure in stage T1a1 lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI)-positive for 79% of respondents, in stage T1a2 LVSI-negative for 58%, and in stage T1a2 LVSI-positive for 28%. Sentinel lymph node biopsy alone was reported in stage T1a1 by 17% and in stage T1b1 less than 2 cm by 9%, whereas systematic lymphadenectomy by 29% and 90% of respondents. Macrometastases, micrometastases, and isolated tumor cells in lymph nodes were considered indications for adjuvant treatment by 96%, 93%, and 68% of respondents, respectively. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was reported by 28% and 19% of respondents in fertility-sparing and nonsparing management in stage T1b1. Over 60% of respondents recommend primary surgery for their patients with T1b2 N0 disease and 81% of them use a combination of adverse prognostic factors as indication for adjuvant radiotherapy in pN0 disease.Conclusions The results of this survey indicate considerable differences in the workup and treatment of cervical cancer in current clinical practice.

TI  - Estimating and Analyzing the Spatiotemporal Pattern of Aboveground Carbon in Bamboo Forest by Combining Remote Sensing Data and Improved BIOME-BGC Model
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating the carbon stock of forests, and further studying their spatiotemporal variations is an important prerequisite for assessing forest carbon sequestration capability. This paper simulated aboveground carbon (AGC) of bamboo forest in Zhejiang Province, China, during 2003-2014 based on the combination of an improved BIOME-BGC (BioGeochemical Cycles) model and bamboo forest map extracted from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer data, and analyzed the characteristic and impact factors of the AGC spatiotemporal variations based on the geostatistical method. The modeled AGC density significantly correlated with the plot data from continuous forest resource inventory, and led to an average correlation coefficient and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of 0.81% and 17.15%, respectively. The stands with high AGC density were distributed in the mountainous areas in the northwest, southwest, and northeast of the province, while those with low AGC density were located in the basin, high altitude areas, and coastal areas. During the study period, the AGC density and total AGC storage increased from 12.02 to 18.15 Mg C ha(-1) and 9.22 to 16.41 Tg, respectively. The spatial heterogeneity of AGC was revealed by an exponential semi-variance model, and characterized by significant autocorrelation. The dominant factors contributing to the spatial heterogeneity of AGC were structure relevant factors, especially meteorological and terrain factors. The autocorrelation range of AGC in 2003 was 24.90 km, but decreased dramatically after that, indicating that the influence of external factors (i.e., management measures) on AGC increased gradually.

TI  - Global patterns of extreme drought-induced loss in land primary production: Identifying ecological extremes from rain-use efficiency
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying the ecological patterns of loss of ecosystem function in extreme drought is important to understand the carbon exchange between the land and atmosphere. Rain-use efficiency [RUE; gross primary production (GPP)/precipitation] acts as a typical indicator of ecosystem function. In this study, a novel method based on maximum rain-use efficiency (RUEmax) was developed to detect losses of ecosystem function globally. Three global GPP datasets from the MODIS remote sensing data (MOD17), ground upscaling FLUXNET observations (MPIBGC), and process-based model simulations (BESS), and a global gridded precipitation product (CRU) were used to develop annual global RUE datasets for 2001-2011. Large, well-known extreme drought events were detected, e.g. 2003 drought in Europe, 2002 and 2011 drought in the US., and 2010 drought in Russia Our results show that extreme drought-induced loss of ecosystem function could impact 0.9% +/- 0.1% of earth's vegetated land per year and was mainly distributed in semi-arid regions. The reduced carbon uptake caused by functional loss (0.14 +/- 0.03 PgC/yr) could explain >70% of the interannual variation in GPP in drought-affected areas (p <= 0.001). Our results highlight the impact of ecosystem function loss in semi-arid regions with increasing precipitation variability and dry land expansion expected in the future. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Estimation of Lake Outflow from the Poorly Gauged Lake Tana (Ethiopia) Using Satellite Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake Tana is the largest lake in Ethiopia, and its lake outflow is the source of the Blue Nile River that provides vital water resources for many livelihoods and downstream/international stakeholders. Therefore, it is essential to quantify and monitor the water balance of Lake Tana. However, Lake Tana is poorly gauged, with more than 50% of Lake Tana Basin being ungauged from in-situ measurements, making it difficult to quantify the lake inflow from surrounding basins. The lack of in-situ measurements highlights the need for the innovative application of satellite remote sensing. This study explores how freely accessible satellite remote sensing can be used to complement routine weather data to quantify the water balance of Lake Tana and its surrounding catchments. This study particularly investigates whether the outflow from Lake Tana can be estimated with sufficient accuracy as the residual of the lake water balance. Monthly inflow into lake was computed as the total runoff from the surrounding catchments; the runoff was estimated as the residual of the land-based catchment water balance using satellite precipitation improved with an integrated downscaling-calibration procedure, satellite evapotranspiration, and a correction term for changes in land total storage (soil moisture storage and deep percolation). The outflow from Lake Tana was estimated as the residual of lake water balance by combining satellite-based lake precipitation, changes in water storage, and lake inflow with estimated lake evaporation. Evaluation using limited available measurements showed that estimated annual runoff for two gauged subbasins agreed well with measurements, with differences within 4%. The estimated annual outflow from Lake Tana was also close to measured outflow, with a difference of 12%. However, the estimated monthly runoff from catchments and monthly lake outflow were unsatisfactory, with large errors.

TI  - Design of a drug discovery course for non-science majors
T2  - BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Drug Discovery is a 13-week lecture and laboratory-based course that was developed to introduce non-science majors to foundational chemistry and biochemistry concepts as they relate to the unifying theme of drug discovery. The first part of this course strives to build students' understanding of molecules, their properties, the differences that enable them to be separated from one another, and their abilities to bind to biological receptors and elicit physiological effects. After building students' molecular worldview, the course then focuses on four classes of drugs: antimicrobials, drugs that affect the mind, steroid-based drugs, and anti-cancer drugs. During each of these modules, an emphasis is placed on how understanding the basis of disease and molecular-level interactions empowers us to identify novel medicinal compounds. Periodic in class discussions based on articles pertinent to class topics ranging from the spread of antibiotic resistance, to the molecular basis of addiction, to rational drug design, are held to enable students to relate course material to pressing problems of national and daily concern. In addition to class time, weekly inquiry-based laboratories allow students to critically analyze data related to course concepts, and later in the semester give students an opportunity to design and implement their own experiments to screen for antimicrobial activity. This course provides students with an understanding of the importance of chemistry and biochemistry to human health while emphasizing the process, strategies, and challenges related to drug discovery.

TI  - A simplified model of all-sky artificial sky glow derived from VIIRS Day/Night band data
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a simplified method using geographic analysis tools to predict the average artificial luminance over the hemisphere of the night sky, expressed as a ratio to the natural condition. The VIIRS Day/Night Band upward radiance data from the Suomi NPP orbiting satellite was used for input to the model. The method is based upon a relation between sky glow brightness and the distance from the observer to the source of upward radiance. This relationship was developed using a Garstang radiative transfer model with Day/Night Band data as input, then refined and calibrated with ground-based all-sky V-band photometric data taken under cloudless and low atmospheric aerosol conditions. An excellent correlation was found between observed sky quality and the predicted values from the remotely sensed data. Thematic maps of large regions of the earth showing predicted artificial V-band sky brightness may be quickly generated with modest computing resources. We have found a fast and accurate method based on previous work to model all-sky quality. We provide limitations to this method. The proposed model meets requirements needed by decision makers and land managers of an easy to interpret and understand metric of sky quality. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Complete lymphadenectomy following positive sentinel lymph node biopsy in cutaneous melanoma: a critical review.
T2  - Anais brasileiros de dermatologia
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - Cutaneous melanoma is the solid neoplasia with the highest growing incidence among all tumors. It spreads predictably to the lymphatic vessels and sentinel lymph node, and when the latter is affected the prognosis worsens dramatically. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is considered when thickness of the primary tumor exceeds 1mm and/or when there are adverse features in thinner melanomas. When there is nodal metastasis, current evidence in the literature recommends complete lymphadenectomy, although this procedure has its intrinsic risks (i.e., lymphedema and cellulitis), and there are no published clinical trials proving additional overall survival benefits. The current in-depth literature review thus aims to identify patients that will benefit most from the procedure, including those with the highest likelihood of presenting additional affected lymph nodes in the same nodal basin. The authors also discuss techniques for identification of the sentinel lymph node, false-negative rates, and predictive models for lymph node involvement. In conclusion, complete elective lymphadenectomy should always be discussed on a case-by-case basis when metastases are detected in the sentinel lymph node.

T2  - ANNALS OF CLINICAL AND LABORATORY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - A previously healthy 54-year-old woman presented with weight loss, progressive weakness that was more pronounced on the left side, and intermittent occipital headaches. Imaging studies showed multiple enhancing lesions along the white matter, compatible with a demyelinating process. The patient's previous history included relapsing-remitting symptoms of weakness over the past 3 years. A stereotactic brain biopsy showed histological features of demyelination with an associated population of neoplastic lymphoid cells. These unusual findings raise the question of whether demyelinating disease preceded the development of primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL), or whether PCNSL induced demyelination. Although rare, cases of "sentinel lesions" heralding the diagnosis of PCNSL have been reported. This case emphasizes the importance of having a high index of suspicion of PCNSL in the setting of suspected demyelinating lesion in an adult patient.

TI  - Improvement of surgery department performance after implementing hospital quality standards' policies: two decades experience
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundTheodor Bilharz Research Institute (TBRI) Hospital comprises clinical departments, research laboratories, and different supporting services. General Surgery Department (GSD) in TBRI hospital has over 30 years of cumulative surgical and research experience. New managerial policy and quality procedures were developed and implemented from 2007 onwards in GSD. The aim of this study was to assess the pattern of change in utilization and performance in GSD in TBRI hospital after implementing the new policies and procedures, from 2007 onwards.MethodsThis was a retrospective observational study. Electronic data were collected from the medical record unit and annual reports of TBRI hospital from the year 2001 to the year 2016. Hospital utilization indices, admission, surgical operations performed, bed utilization indices, average length of stay (ALOS), bed occupancy rate (BOR), bed turnover rate (BTR), and mortality rate (MR) were calculated before and after implementing the new policies and procedures from the year 2007 onwards.ResultsThe shift to more skilled and major surgical operations was doubled, and the increase of elective surgeries increased to more than three-folds of emergency operations. There was marked increase of outpatient flow to more than three-folds, and decreased MR. The indicators used to show increase of performance in GSD were as follows: improvement in hospital bed indices decreased ALOS, increased BOR, and increased BTR. The year 2016 showed the optimization of all hospital indices: ALOS 5.5, BOR 74.2, BTR 48.9, and MR 0.1.ConclusionQuality improvement may not appear in the initial years of a program. It is recommended to keep up the implemented hospital quality policies and procedures to continue future improvement for better quality of patient care in GSD at TBRI hospital.

TI  - Effects of halogenated contaminants on reproductive development in wild mink (<i>Neovison vison</i>) from locations in Canada
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The concept of the Anthropocene, that humans are now re-engineering global ecosystems, is in part evidenced by the pervasive pollution by persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Certain POPs are hormone mimics and can disrupt endocrine and hence reproductive processes, shown mainly by laboratory studies with model species. There are, in contrast, fewer confirmations of such disruption from eco-epidemiological studies of wild mammals. Here we used the American mink (Neovison vison) as a sentinel species for such a study. Over the period 1998-2006, 161 mink carcasses were obtained from commercial trappers in the Canadian provinces of British Columbia and Ontario. Mink were aged, sexed, measured, and body condition assessed. Livers were analyzed either individually or pooled for organochlorine (OC) pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and subsets for polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). We primarily addressed whether contaminants affected male reproductive development by measuring baculum size and assessing the influences of age and body condition. We also considered the influence of spatial variation on relative exposure and size of baculum. Statistical models separated by age class revealed that significant relationships between baculum length or mass and juvenile mink were mostly positive, whereas for adults and first year mink they were mostly negative. A significant negative relationship for adult mink was determined between DDE and both baculum length and mass. For juvenile mink we found significant positive relationships between aPCBs, DDE and aPBDEs with baculum length. Our results provide some indication of negative effects of halogenated contaminants on male reproductive development in wild mink, and the most likely candidate chemical is the confirmed anti-androgenic compound, DDE, rather than PCBs or other compounds.

TI  - Simulation of Severe Dust Events over Egypt Using Tuned Dust Schemes in Weather Research Forecast (WRF-Chem)
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with chemistry (WRF-Chem) was used to simulate selected severe dust storm events over Egypt in terms of the aerosol optical depth (AOD). Two severe events, which occurred on 22 January 2004 and 31 March 2013, are examined. The analysis includes three dust emission schemes: Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport (GOCART), GOCART with Air Force Weather Agency (GOCART-AFWA), and GOCART with University of Cologne (GOCART-UOC). Each scheme was tested by adjusting coefficients related to the dust flux. The AOD and Single scattering albedo (SSA) from the model were compared against the same parameters derived from the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The grid spacing for both of the data sets is 10 km. Results from the March 2013 event were also compared against point measurements from an Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) station in Cairo. Using WRF with built-in coefficients, all schemes resulted in underestimating AOD. After tuning the coefficients, it was possible to bring the model results closer to the observations from satellite and AERONET. Each severe event required a different tuning, depending on the origin and composition of the dust storm. Sensitivity analysis for each case is performed to identify the scheme that best simulates the given events based on spatial error distribution. A novel comparison of eigenvalue structures for images of both for AOD and SSA from model and MODIS was used. After tuning, the adjusted coefficient GOCART scheme is found to simulate AOD best across the country in both events. However, the results for the 2004 event from GOCART-UOC were closest to MODIS AOD over Cairo (within 5% bias). On the other hand, GOCART-AFWA produced nearest estimate of AOD for the 2013 event when compared to AERONET measurements (within 7% bias). For both of the events, SSA from GOCART and GOCART-AFWA schemes were found to be comparable to MODIS measurements with accuracy that was close to 98%. The accuracy from GOCART-UOC was around 93%.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Organic Films on the Water Surface Using Dual Co-Polarized Ship-Based X-/C-/S-Band Radar and TerraSAR-X
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Microwave radar is a well-established tool for all-weather monitoring of film slicks which appear in radar imagery of the surface of water bodies as areas of reduced backscatter due to suppression of short wind waves. Information about slicks obtained with single-band/one-polarized radar seems to be insufficient for film characterization; hence, new capabilities of multi-polarization radars for monitoring of film slicks have been actively discussed in the literature. In this paper the results of new experiments on remote sensing of film slicks using dual co-polarized radarsa satellite TerraSAR-X and a ship-based X-/C-/S-band radarare presented. Radar backscattering is assumed to contain Bragg and non-Bragg components (BC and NBC, respectively). BC is due to backscattering from resonant cm-scale wind waves, while NBC is supposed to be associated with wave breaking. Each of the components can be eliminated from the total radar backscatter measured at two co-polarizations, and contrasts of Bragg and non-Bragg components in slicks can be analyzed separately. New data on a damping ratio (contrast) characterizing reduction of radar returns in slicks are obtained for the two components of radar backscatter in various radar bands. The contrast values for Bragg and non-Bragg components are comparable to each other and demonstrate similar dependence on radar wave number; BC and NBC contrasts grow monotonically for the cases of upwind and downwind observations and weakly decrease with wave number for the cross-wind direction. Reduction of BC in slicks can be explained by enhanced viscous damping of cm-scale Bragg waves due to an elastic film. Physical mechanisms of NBC reduction in slicks are discussed. It is hypothesized that strong breaking (e.g., white-capping) weakly contributes to the NBC contrast because of cleaning of the water surface due to turbulent surfactant mixing associated with wave crest overturning. An effective mechanism of NBC reduction due to film can be associated with modification of micro-breaking wave features, such as parasitic ripples, bulge, and toe, in slicks.

TI  - A Methodology to Simulate LST Directional Effects Based on Parametric Models and Landscape Properties
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The correction of directional effects on satellite-retrieved land surface temperature (LST) is of high relevance for a proper interpretation of spatial and temporal features contained in LST fields. This study presents a methodology to correct such directional effects in an operational setting. This methodology relies on parametric models, which are computationally efficient and require few input information, making them particularly appropriate for operational use. The models are calibrated with LST data collocated in time and space from MODIS (Aqua and Terra) and SEVIRI (Meteosat), for an area covering the entire SEVIRI disk and encompassing the full year of 2011. Past studies showed that such models are prone to overfitting, especially when there are discrepancies between the LSTs that are not related to the viewing geometry (e.g., emissivity, atmospheric correction). To reduce such effects, pixels with similar characteristics are first grouped by means of a cluster analysis. The models' calibration is then performed on each one of the selected clusters. The derived coefficients reflect the expected impact of vegetation and topography on the anisotropy of LST. Furthermore, when tested with independent data, the calibrated models are shown to maintain the capability of representing the angular dependency of the differences between LST derived from polar-orbiter (MODIS) and geostationary (Meteosat, GOES and Himawari) satellites. The methodology presented here is currently being used to estimate the deviation of LST products with respect to what would be obtained for a reference view angle (e.g., nadir), therefore contributing to the harmonization of LST products.

TI  - Building malware classificators usable by State security agencies
T2  - REVISTA ITECKNE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sandboxing has been used regularly to analyze software samples and determine if these contain suspicious properties or behaviors. Even if sandboxing is a powerful technique to perform malware analysis, it requires that a malware analyst performs a rigorous analysis of the results to determine the nature of the sample: goodware or malware. This paper proposes two machine learning models able to classify samples based on signatures and permissions obtained through Cuckoo sandbox, Androguard and VirusTotal. The developed models are also tested obtaining an acceptable percentage of correctly classified samples, being in this way useful tools for a malware analyst. A proposal of architecture for an IoT sentinel that uses one of the developed machine learning model is also showed. Finally, different approaches, perspectives, and challenges about the use of sandboxing and machine learning by security teams in State security agencies are also shared.

TI  - Combining satellite data and agricultural statistics to map grassland management intensity in Europe
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The world's grasslands, both natural and managed, provide food and many non-provisioning ecosystem services. Although most grasslands today are used for livestock grazing or fodder production, little is known about the spatial patterns of grassland management intensity, especially at broad geographic scales. Using the European Union as a case study, we mapped mowing frequency as a key indicator of grassland management intensity. We used MODIS NDVI time series from 2000-2012 to map mowing frequency using a spline-fitting algorithm that detects up to five mowing events within a single growing season. We combined mowing frequency maps with existing maps of livestock distribution and grassland management frequency to identify clusters of similar grassland management intensity across Europe. Our results highlight generally high mowing frequency in areas of high grassland productivity, especially in Ireland, northern and central France, and the Netherlands. Our analyses also show distinct clusters of similar grassland management, representing different grassland-management intensity regimes. High intensity clusters occurred particularly in western and southern Europe, especially in Ireland, in the northern and central parts of France and Spain, and the Netherlands but also in northern and southern Germany and eastern Poland. Low intensity clusters were found mainly in central and eastern Europe and in mountainous regions but also in Extremadura in Spain, Wales and western England (UK). Generally, our analyses emphasize the usefulness of jointly using satellite time series and agricultural statistics to monitor grassland intensity across broad geographic extents. Our maps allow for a new, spatially-detailed view of management intensity in grassland systems and may help to improve regionally targeted land-use and conservation policies.

TI  - Field biomonitoring using the zebra mussel <i>Dreissena polymorpha</i> and the quagga mussel <i>Dreissena bugensis</i> following immunotoxic reponses. Is there a need to separate the two species?
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha constitutes an extensively used sentinel species for biomonitoring in European and North American freshwater systems. However, this invasive species is gradually replaced in freshwater ecosystem by Dreissena bugensis, a closely related dreissenid species that shares common morphological characteristics but possess some physiological differences. However, few are known about differences on more integrated physiological processes that are generally used as biomarkers in biological monitoring studies. Declining of zebra mussel populations raises the question of the sustainability of using one or both species indifferently to maintain the quality of environmental pollution monitoring data. In our study, we performed a field comparative study measuring immune related markers and bioaccumulation of PCBs, PAHs and PBDEs in sympatrically occurring mussel populations from three sites of the St. Lawrence River. For tested organisms, species were identified using RFLP analysis. Measurement of bioaccumulated organic compounds indicated a higher accumulation of PCBs and PBDEs in D. bugensis soft tissues compared to D. polymorpha while no differences were noticed for PAHs. Results of hemocytic parameters highlighted that differences of hemocyte distributions were associated to modulations of phagocytic activities. Moreover, marked differences occurred in measurement of hemocytic oxidative activity, indicating divergences between the two species for ROS regulation strategies. This physiological characteristic may deeply influence species responses facing environmental or pollution related stress and induce bias if the two species are not differentiated in further biomarker or bioaccumulation measurement-based studies.

TI  - CHANGES IN VEGETATION DUE TO VOLCANIC ACTIVITY, CASE STUDY: TURRIALBA VOLCANO, COSTA RICA, 2014 TO 2017 ERUPTIVE PERIOD.
T2  - Revista Geologica de America Central
M3  - Article
AB  - Since October of 2014, the Turrialba volcano began an eruptive cycle involving phreatic and phreato-magmatic eruptions. These eruptions signal an important change in behavior of this volcanic system which between 1886 and 2014 was limited to exhalative activity with isolated phreatic eruptions in 2007 and 2011. Overall, this activity involves physical and chemical changes that affect vegetation and fauna, as well as population centers. This situation is therefore of public interest. Thus, controlling and assessing these changes in order to determine possible affected areas is necessary to manage hazards. A remote sensing approach is shown in this paper using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) to assess the change in vegetation of the surrounding areas close to the crater. This study was done for the period of 2014 to 2017 with Landsat 8 images. A noticeable change is shown for the 2014 to 2016 period, but a more significant one is shown for the 2016 to 2017 period with an increase of the percentage of affected vegetation.

TI  - Monitoring tidal flat dynamics affected by human activities along an eroded coast in the Yellow River Delta, China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The coast of the northern Yellow River Delta (YRD) has experienced significant erosion since 1976 due to avulsion and consequent lack of sediment supply. Moreover, massive reclamation activity, expansion of the oil industry, and sea-level rise have jointly contributed to the rapid change of tidal flats over recent decades. Therefore, accurate reporting of the coast spatial extent and stability status is urgently required. We presented a method using remotely sensed waterlines to map tidal flats and monitor their spatiotemporal dynamics. The empirical results show that the area of the intertidal zone west of Tiao River Mouth (TRM) appeared to be decreasing. Despite intense hydrodynamic force, the intertidal zone to the east of TRM has expanded due to law prohibiting land reclamation in nature reserve. However, this trend weakened due to the expansion of oil industry after 2007. The movement of the mean high-tide line is the main cause for the increase-decrease patterns of the intertidal zone area. To achieve and maintain land equilibrium in this area, we suggest that a 554-m buffer must be preserved for mean high-tide line retreat. Unfortunately, the shrink crisis of the tidal flats has been extremely severe. Future reclamation and oil projects must be supplemented by studies that evaluate the complexities and dynamics of tidal flats so as to prevent the loss of this unique ecosystem.

TI  - Spatial variability and temporal dynamics of HABs in Northeast China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing severity and intensity of harmful algal blooms (HABs) are of great concern to public health and a threat to ecosystems and have become a global problem in recent decades. Most of the related studies in China have been focused on low-latitude areas, such as Lake Taihu, Chaohu, and Dianchi. However, little attention has been devoted to algal blooms in Northeast China. As a significant Chinese commodity grain production base, the non-point source pollution deteriorated along with the grain production increasing year by year. In fact, the HABs in the little researched Northeast China were exceedingly serious. From 1982 to 2016, there was a total of 271 out of 2186 feasible Landsat images found HABs. The annual total frequencies of the detected HABs increased in fluctuation from 0 in 1982 to 11 times in 2016, and the highest frequency was observed twice, in 2010 and 2014, and was 29 times in both years. The number of lakes and reservoirs detected HABs and the annual sum of normalized HABs area also increased obviously. The tendency was almost coherent with the rising temperature, reduced wind speed, and declining atmospheric pressure. The R-2 and p-value between the annual frequency and the three meteorological indices were (0.274, < 0.005), (0.553, < 0.0001), and (0.073, 0.126), respectively. Besides, as anthropogenic influence indicators in this paper, we selected fertilizer application amount, industrial wastewater and municipal sewage discharge amount, land use type in 1986, 2000, and 2010. We comprehensively considered lacustrine morphologies and hydrological hydrodynamics and analyzed the driving factors of the spatiotemporal distribution pattern of HABs in Northeast China.

TI  - Land Cover Classification with GF-3 Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar Data by Random Forest Classifier and Fast Super-Pixel Segmentation
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Chinese Gaofen-3 (GF-3), a vital satellite for high-resolution earth observation, was the first C-band polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) launched in China with a resolution of up to one meter. Polarimetric SAR can obtain the complete physical scattering mechanisms of targets, thereby having the potential to differentiate objects. In this paper, several classification methods are briefly summarized and the types of features that should be chosen during classification are discussed. A pre-classification step is introduced to reduce the workload of precise labeling. The Random Forest classifier, which performs well for many other classification tasks, is used for the initial land cover classification. Then, based on a polarimetric constant false-alarm rate (CFAR) edge detector, a fast super-pixel generation method for polarimetric SAR image is proposed, which does not require the adjustment of parameters in advance. Following that, majority vote is conducted on the initial classification result based on the super-pixels, so that the classification result can be optimized to better meet the mapping requirements. The experimental results based on GF-3 polarimetric SAR data verify the effectiveness of proposed procedure and demonstrate that GF-3 data has excellent performance in land cover classification.

TI  - Bio-Optical Characterization and Ocean Colour Inversion in the Eastern Lagoon of New Caledonia, South Tropical Pacific
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Eastern Lagoon of New Caledonia (ELNC) is a semi-enclosed system surrounded by an extensive coral reef barrier. The system has been suffering impacts from climate variability and anthropogenic activities, including mining exploitation. Satellite monitoring is thus an essential tool to detect such changes. The present study aimed to assess the bio-optical variability of the ELNC and examine the applicability of ocean colour algorithms, using in situ bio-optical and radiometric data, collected during the March 2014 CALIOPE 2 cruise. The chlorophyll a concentration (Chla) varied from 0.13-0.72 mg.m(-3), and the coastal stations were spectrally dominated by non-algal particles (NAP) and coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) (>80% of the total non-water absorption at 443 nm), due to the contribution of allochthonous sources. The phytoplankton specific absorption was generally lower (mean, 0.049 m(2).mg Chla(-1)) than typical values observed for the corresponding Chla range, as well as the spectral slopes of the absorption of CDOM plus NAP (a(dg)) (mean, 0.016 nm(-1)) and of the particle backscattering coefficient (b(bp)) (mean, 0.07 nm(-1)). The remote sensing reflectance obtained using two in-water approaches and modelled from Inherent Optical Properties (IOPs) showed less than 20% relative percent differences (RPD). Chla estimates were highly biased for the empirical (OC4 and OC3) and semi-analytical (GSM, QAA, GIOP, LMI) algorithms, especially at the coastal stations. Excluding these stations, the GSM01 yielded the best retrievals with 35-40% RPD. a(dg)(443) was well retrieved by all algorithms with similar to 18% RPD, and b(bp)(443) with similar to 40% RPD. Turbidity algorithms also performed reasonably well (30% RPD), showing the capacity and usefulness of the derived products to monitor the water quality of the ELNC, provided accurate atmospheric correction of the satellite data. Regionally tuned algorithms may potentially improve the Chla retrievals, but better parameterization schemes that consider the spatiotemporal variability of the specific IOPs are still needed.

TI  - Soil moisture estimation in Ferlo region (Senegal) using radar (ENVISAT/ASAR) and optical (SPOT/VEGETATION) data
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The sensitivity of the radar signal to the seasonal dynamics in the Sahel region is a considerable asset for monitoring surface parameters including soil moisture. Given the sensitivity of the radar signal to vegetation mass production, roughness and soil moisture, the main problem has been to estimate the contribution of these three parameters to the signal. This study aims to circumvent this problem by combining radar with optical data. The DMP (Dry Mater Product) extracted from SPOT data allowed to estimate vegetation mass production. Surface roughness was estimated from radar data during the dry season. Because during the dry season, radar signal is only conditioned by soil roughness in this region a Radiative Transfer Model (RTM) was used: it consists in a microwave scattering model of layered vegetation based on the first-order solution of the radiative transfer equation and it accounts for multiple scattering within the canopy, surface roughness of the soil, and the interaction between canopy surface and soil.This model was designed to account for the branch size distribution, leaf orientation distribution, and branch orientation distribution for each size. In this study, the RTM has been calibrated with ESCAT (European Radar Satellite Scatterometer) data, and has been used in order to estimate soil moisture.The results obtained have allowed to track the spatial and temporal dynamics of soil moisture on the one hand, and on the other hand the influence of geology and morphopedology on the spatial dynamics of the soil moisture variability. These results are promising despite the fact that the inversed RTM often faces difficulties to interpret the signal for saturated soils, giving an aberrant value of soil moisture more often than not.

TI  - Detection of Coniferous Seedlings in UAV Imagery
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid assessment of forest regeneration using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is likely to decrease the cost of establishment surveys in a variety of resource industries. This research tests the feasibility of using UAVs to rapidly identify coniferous seedlings in replanted forest-harvest areas in Alberta, Canada. In developing our protocols, we gave special consideration to creating a workflow that could perform in an operational context, avoiding comprehensive wall-to-wall surveys and complex photogrammetric processing in favor of an efficient sampling-based approach, consumer-grade cameras, and straightforward image handling. Using simple spectral decision rules from a red, green, and blue (RGB) camera, we documented a seedling detection rate of 75.8 % (n = 149), on the basis of independent test data. While moderate imbalances between the omission and commission errors suggest that our workflow has a tendency to underestimate the seedling density in a harvest block, the plot-level associations with ground surveys were very high (Pearson's r = 0.98; n = 14). Our results were promising enough to suggest that UAVs can be used to detect coniferous seedlings in an operational capacity with standard RGB cameras alone, although our workflow relies on seasonal leaf-off windows where seedlings are visible and spectrally distinct from their surroundings. In addition, the differential errors between the pine seedlings and spruce seedlings suggest that operational workflows could benefit from multiple decision rules designed to handle diversity in species and other sources of spectral variability.

TI  - S3 guidelines on breast cancer: locoregional treatment
T2  - GYNAKOLOGE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the updated S3 guidelines on "Diagnosis, therapy and follow-up of breast cancer", locoregional therapy has been significantly revised due to new clinical study data. The focus of the updated version is on de-escalation of surgery on the breast and axilla in early stage breast cancer. The new definition of adequate resection margins requires "no ink on tumor" which will minimize the rate of re-excisions. Also, prophylactic mastectomy of the contralateral breast in patients without BRCA status or familial high-risk situation is still not indicated. Axillary lymph node dissection can be safely avoided in patients with 1-2 metastatic sentinel lymph nodes who undergo breast-conserving surgery with whole-breast radiotherapy. Major revisions have been made on the recommendations regarding a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNLB) in patients with primary systemic therapy (PST). The SNLB after PST is now defined as the standard treatment in patients with initially clinically negative lymph nodes; however, a complete axillary dissection must be performed in initially lymph node positive patients regardless of the response to PST. Overall, the new recommendations of the S3 guidelines enable in many cases a de-escalation of surgical treatment and thus a reduction of morbidity.

TI  - The Combined ASTER and MODIS Emissivity over Land (CAMEL) Global Broadband Infrared Emissivity Product
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Infrared surface emissivity is needed for the calculation of net longwave radiation, a critical parameter in weather and climate models and Earth's radiation budget. Due to a prior lack of spatially and temporally variant global broadband emissivity (BBE) measurements of the surface, it is common practice in land surface and climate models to set BBE to a single constant over the globe. This can lead to systematic biases in the estimated net and longwave radiation for any particular location and time of year. Under the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Making Earth System Data Records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) project, a new global, high spectral resolution land surface emissivity dataset has recently been made available at monthly at 0.05 degree resolution since 2000. Called the Combined ASTER MODIS Emissivity over Land (CAMEL), this dataset is created by the merging of the MODIS baseline-fit emissivity database developed at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the ASTER Global Emissivity Dataset (GED) produced at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. CAMEL has 13 hinge points between 3.6-14.3 mu m which are expanded to cover 417 infrared spectral channels within the same wavelength region using a principal component regression approach. This work presents the method for calculating BBE using the new CAMEL dataset. BBE is computed via numerical integration over the CAMEL High Spectral Resolution product for two different wavelength ranges-3.6-14.3 mu m which takes advantage of the full, available CAMEL spectra and 8.0-13.5 mu m which has been determined to be an optimal range for computing the most representative all wavelength, longwave net radiation. CAMEL BBE uncertainty estimates are computed, and comparisons are made to BBE computed from lab validation data for selected case sites. Variations of BBE over time and land cover classification schemes are investigated and converted into flux to demonstrate the equivalent error in longwave radiation which would be made by the use of a single, constant BBE value. Misrepresentations in BBE by 0.05 at 310 K corresponds to potential errors in longwave radiation of over 25 W/m(2).

TI  - Deceptive Jamming Detection for SAR Based on Cross-Track Interferometry
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Deceptive jamming against synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can create false targets or deceptive scenes in the image effectively. Based on the difference in interferometric phase between the target and deceptive jamming signals, a novel method for detecting deceptive jamming using cross-track interferometry is proposed, where the echoes with deceptive jamming are received by two SAR antennas simultaneously and the false targets are identified through SAR interferometry. Since the derived false phase is close to a constant in interferogram, it is extracted through phase filtering and frequency detection. Finally, the false targets in the SAR image are obtained according to the detected false part in the interferogram. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by simulation results based on the TanDEM-X system.

TI  - Variability of satellite-based total aerosols and the relationship with emission, meteorology and landscape in North China during 2000-2016
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - North China has recently experienced a deteriorating air quality featured by high aerosol concentration. Spatiotemporal variability of total aerosols and the relationship with emission, meteorology and landscape are investigated in North China during 2000-2016. Results suggest that total aerosol concentration has significantly (p < 0.05) increased since 2000 and declined after 2011. A rising fraction of small-size anthropogenic aerosols is suggested by the declining trend of aerosol size and the growing consumption of fossil fuels, electricity and vehicles. Increasing anthropogenic emissions, declining natural emissions as well as declining wind speed have contributed 34-73%, 2-52% and 43-61% to the build-up of aerosols. Seasonally, the highest aerosol concentration in summer and the lowest in winter are partly influenced by the distinct seasonal patterns of wind direction, speed and vertical velocity. Spatially, the lower elevation and two land cover types with intense human disturbances have shaped high aerosol concentration with large increasing trends in eastern North China. Additionally, the increasing aerosol concentration has significantly reduced sunshine duration, evapotranspiration (p < 0.01) and diurnal temperature range (p < 0.05), whereas aerosol size greatly influences precipitation (p < 0.05) in North China.

T2  - ACTA DERMATO-VENEREOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent analyses of Merkel cell carcinoma, prognosis is poor even in stages I and II. We performed a monocentric retrospective study of 37 consecutive cases with Merkel cell carcinoma stage I to III treated with a combination of surgery and adjuvant radiation to evaluate progression-free and overall survival. The median primary tumour diameter was 17.9 mm. Cases consisted of 31 primary tumours, of which 13 had negative sentinel lymph node biopsy (IA n = 10 and IIA n = 3) and 18 no sentinel lymph node biopsy (IB n = 15 and IIB n = 3), 2 tumours with positive sentinel lymph node biopsy (IIIA) and 4 with local macrometastasis (IIIB). The median age was 71 years and the median follow-up was 60.4 months. The 5-year progression-free survival was 83.8% and 5-year disease-specific survival was 95.7% (overall survival 93.0%). So far, our results show a high survival rate with combined treatment of surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy in early tumour stages of Merkel cell carcinoma.

TI  - Radarsat-1 image processing for regional-scale geological mapping with mining vocation under dense vegetation and equatorial climate environment, Southwestern Cameroon
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The potential of Radarsat-1 beam mode Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data processing for geological investigation in an equatorial environment has been evaluated. This approach used textural analysis based on Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) on our image, followed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) performed on eight normalized co-occurrence indices created (mean, variance, homogeneity, contrast, dissimilarity, entropy, second moment and correlation) and directional filters for lithological discriminations and lineament investigations. Red-Green-Blue (RGB) color-composite was applied to three of the indices, the mean, variance and homogeneity, highlighting the morphostructure of the study area and facilitate lithology discrimination. The PC1 band was multiplied by itself (as PC1 x PC1 image) to enhance the information contained in this neo-canal and to reduce noise during filtering. Directional filters were then applied to the PC1 x PC1 image at 0 degrees, 45 degrees, 90 degrees and 135 degrees directions and the structure lines were extracted manually in a GIS software. From the results obtained, color-composite produced image map containing lithological units easily identified formations such as continental and coastal deposits, sedimentary stack, micaschists, garnet micaschists, micaceous quartzites, charnockitic orthogneisses, and coincided with those already existing on published geological map from Maurizot et al. (1986) and non-published geological map after IRGM geological field campaign. A total of 572 lineaments features (fractures and major faults) were identified on the filtered images and mapped. Major structures (faults) were considered as those clearly identified in the four directions while minor structures (fractures) were those observed in at least two directions. They are oriented in one of the two main directions: NE-SW (N040-N060) and NNW-SSE (N345-N360). The lineament result showed those that already existed on the reference maps and the newly updated lineaments. Spatial relationships between mapped lineaments and areas of current and historical mining exploration were examined by overall lineament density. GPS points of gold indices existing in the area correlate with areas of high lineament density particularly around the Ngovayang massif within the Paleoproterozoic Nyong unit. This study stresses the usefulness of remote sensing data and methods in field campaign, improvement of published geological maps and mining prospecting in areas with an equatorial climate.

TI  - Trends in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index for Mangrove Areas in Northwestern Mexico
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Impacts of climate forcing on mangrove ecosystems have been highlighted by several authors. Nowadays, free access to Landsat imagery represents an opportunity to explore the likely impacts of climate variability on mangrove ecosystems using extended time series of vegetation indices-such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index-as proxies of health status. A comparison of time series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index for mangrove areas located in La Paz (Baja California Sur, Mexico) was performed and the linear trend was evaluated for statistical significance. A significant and negative trend was observed for mangroves located in areas with limited freshwater inputs. In addition, a low but still significant correlation was observed between Normalized Difference Vegetation Index anomalies and the Multivariate El Nino Index for the 1993-2011 period. Analysis of time series suggested that mangroves located in areas with hydrologic stress are responding with a health decline and a weak response to El Nino Southern Oscillation events.

TI  - Shamanism in Contemporary Norway: Concepts in Conflict
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - To choose a terminology for an investigation of shamanism in contemporary Norway is not entirely without problems. Many shamans are adamant in rejecting the term religion in connection with their practices and choose broader rubrics when describing what they believe in. When shamanism was approved as an official religion by the Norwegian government in 2012, the tensions ran high, and many shamanic practitioners refused to accept the connection between religion and shamanism. This chapter provides an account of the emic categories and connections used today by shamanic entrepreneurs and others who share these types of spiritual beliefs. In particular, the advantages and disadvantages of the term religion and how it is deployed on the ground by shamans in Norway will be highlighted.

TI  - Supervised Classification of Built-Up Areas in Sub-Saharan African Cities Using Landsat Imagery and OpenStreetMap
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Landsat archives have been made freely available in 2008, allowing the production of high resolution built-up maps at the regional or global scale. In this context, most of the classification algorithms rely on supervised learning to tackle the heterogeneity of the urban environments. However, at a large scale, the process of collecting training samples becomes a huge project in itself. This leads to a growing interest from the remote sensing community toward Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) projects such as OpenStreetMap (OSM). Despite the spatial heterogeneity of its contribution patterns, OSM provides an increasing amount of information on the earth's surface. More interestingly, the community has moved beyond street mapping to collect a wider range of spatial data such as building footprints, land use, or points of interest. In this paper, we propose a classification method that makes use of OSM to automatically collect training samples for supervised learning of built-up areas. To take into account a wide range of potential issues, the approach is assessed in ten Sub-Saharan African urban areas from various demographic profiles and climates. The obtained results are compared with: (1) existing high resolution global urban maps such as the Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) or the Human Built-up and Settlements Extent (HBASE); and (2) a supervised classification based on manually digitized training samples. The results suggest that automated supervised classifications based on OSM can provide performances similar to manual approaches, provided that OSM training samples are sufficiently available and correctly pre-processed. Moreover, the proposed method could reach better results in the near future, given the increasing amount and variety of information in the OSM database.

AB  - Aim: Considering the importance of early of lymph node metastasis, we determine sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis in staging of metastatic cervical lymph nodes using 3 methods including Ultrasonography, Computed Tomography (CT) scan and Sentinel Node Lymphoscintigraphy (SNL) in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) referred to Shahid Beheshti Hospital Babol.Materials & Method: This study was conducted on 15 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity underwent surgical resection. Clinical diagnosis of all cases was specified with the initial sampling. One week before the surgery 3 methods of Ultrasonography, CT scan and SNL were used for assessment of cervical lymph nodes status.Results: During two years of study, 15 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity underwent surgery. Squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue is the most common cancer of oral cavity. Sensitivity of Ultrasonography and SNL in the diagnosis of metastatic cervical lymph nodes was 100 %. Specificity of Ultrasonography and CT scan was 70 %. It should also be noted that Ultrasonography has given diagnosis of inflammatory lymph nodes in 3 patients.Conclusion: Based on the results, of the 3 diagnostic methods diagnostic value of Ultrasonography and SNL in the diagnosis of real patients (sensitivity) was 100 %. However Ultrasonography and CT scan are superior to SNL in the diagnosis of healthy people (specificity).

TI  - Entomological surveillance of Zika virus in Sardinia, Italy, 2016
T2  - VETERINARIA ITALIANA
M3  - Article
AB  - Zika Virus (ZIKV) is a RNA virus belonging to the genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae. This virus is transmitted through bite of Aedes mosquitoes, in particular Ae. aegypti. On February 1st 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared ZIKV a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Successively, considering the establishment of Ae. albopictus, WHO has classified Italy as having a moderate likelihood of local transmission of ZIKV, preceded in Europe only by France. For this reason an entomological surveillance plan was been activated in Sardinia in 2016. BG Sentinel Mosquito Traps have been positioned in 29 sites, comprising urban areas and points of entry, as ports and airports. Mosquitoes were collected fortnightly from April to December. A total of 3,089 mosquitoes were collected belonging to 10 species. The most numerous species have been Cx. pipiens s.l. and Ae. albopictus. All mosquitoes sampled have been assayed by real time reverse transcriptase PCR for detection of ZIKV RNA. A total of 584 pool have been analyzed and have been reported no evidence of ZIKV. A permanent entomological surveillance should be implemented principally in the urban areas and points of entry, as ports and airports, because Ae. albopictus, susceptible to ZIKV, is established in Sardinia and also know the recent introduction of invasive mosquitoes species Ae. koericus and Ae. japonicus in Italy.

TI  - Phoebe: A Surface Dominated by Water
T2  - ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Saturnian irregular satellite, Phoebe, can be broadly described as a water-rich rock. This object, which presumably originated from the same primordial population shared by the dynamically excited Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs), has received high-resolution spectral imaging during the Cassini flyby. We present a new analysis of the Visual Infrared Mapping Spectrometer observations of Phoebe, which critically, includes a geometry correction routine that enables pixel-by-pixel mapping of visible and infrared spectral cubes directly onto the Phoebe shape model, even when an image exhibits significant trailing errors. The result of our re-analysis is a successful match of 46 images, producing spectral maps covering the majority of Phoebe's surface, roughly a third of which is imaged by high-resolution observations (<22 km per pixel resolution). There is no spot on Phoebe's surface that is absent of water absorption. The regions richest in water are clearly associated with the Jason and south pole impact basins. Phoebe exhibits only three spectral types, and a water-ice concentration that correlates with physical depth and visible albedo. The water-rich and water-poor regions exhibit significantly different crater size frequency distributions and different large crater morphologies. We propose that Phoebe once had a water-poor surface whose water-ice concentration was enhanced by basin-forming impacts that exposed richer subsurface layers. The range of Phoebe's water-ice absorption spans the same range exhibited by dynamically excited KBOs. The common water-ice absorption depths and primordial origins, and the association of Phoebe's water-rich regions with its impact basins, suggests the plausible idea that KBOs also originated with water-poor surfaces that were enhanced through stochastic collisional modification.

TI  - Responses of urban heat island in Atlanta to different land-use scenarios
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban heat island (UHI) effect changes heat and water cycles in urban areas, and has been accused of elevating energy consumption, deteriorating living environment, and increasing mortality rates. Understanding various UHI effects necessitates a systematic modeling approach. A major problem in UHI simulations is that urban areas were either considered to have only one category of land use/cover or outdated in land use/cover patterns due to the lack of high resolution data. Therefore, this study aims at integrating up-to-date remotely sensed land use/cover data with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF/UCM)/Urban Canopy Model modeling systems to simulate surface temperature patterns in Atlanta, Georgia. In addition, three land-use scenarios, i.e., spontaneous scenario (SS), concentrated scenario (CS), and local policy scenario (LPS), were designed and incorporated into the modeling. Five numerical experiments were conducted by using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to explore the impact of urbanization-induced land-cover changes on temperature patterns. Land use and land-cover patterns under all three scenarios suggested that urban growth would continue through in-filling development and outward expansion. Compared to temperature simulations in 2011, temperature maps corresponding to the three urban growth scenarios showed warmer and cooler temperature patterns outside and inside the urban core, respectively. Analysis of the mean diurnal temperature cycle suggested that the highest temperature difference of 3.9 K was observed between 2011 and the LPS, and occurred around 22:00 local time. Overall, the simulations showed different UHI effects respond to the land-use scenarios in the summer. It is recommended for urban managers and policy makers to reflect on the potential impacts of alternative urban growth policies on thermal environment.

TI  - Use of satellite leaf area index estimating evapotranspiration and gross assimilation for Australian ecosystems
T2  - ECOHYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate quantification of terrestrial evapotranspiration and ecosystem productivity is of significant merit to better understand and predict the response of ecosystem energy, water, and carbon budgets under climate change. Existing diagnostic models have different focus on either water or carbon flux estimates with various model complexity and uncertainties induced by distinct representation of the coupling between water and carbon processes. Here, we propose a diagnostic model to estimate evapotranspiration and gross primary production that is based on biophysical mechanism yet simple for practical use. This is done by coupling the carbon and water fluxes via canopy conductance used in the Penman-Monteith-Leuning equation (named as PML_V2 model). The PML_V2 model takes Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer leaf area index and meteorological variables as inputs. The model was tested against evapotranspiration and gross primary production observations at 9 eddy-covariance sites in Australia, which are spread across wide climate conditions and ecosystems. Results indicate that the simulated evapotranspiration and gross primary production by the PML_V2 model are in good agreement with the measurements at 8-day timescale, indicated by the cross site Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency being 0.70 and 0.66, R-2 being 0.80 and 0.75, and root mean square error being 0.96mmd(-1) and 1.14molm(-2)s(-1) for evapotranspiration and gross primary production, respectively. As the PML_V2 model only requires readily available climate and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer vegetation dynamics data and has few parameters, it can potentially be applied to estimate evapotranspiration and carbon assimilation simultaneously at long-term and large spatial scales.

TI  - Coseismic Displacements from Moderate-Size Earthquakes Mapped by Sentinel-1 Differential Interferometry: The Case of February 2017 Gulpinar Earthquake Sequence (Biga Peninsula, Turkey)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We study the tectonic deformation from the February 2017 shallow earthquake sequence onshore Biga Peninsula (NW Turkey, NE Aegean region). We use InSAR interferograms (Sentinel-1 satellites) to identify the seismic fault (striking N110 degrees E) and seismological data (parametric data and Moment Tensor solutions from NOA and KOERI catalogues) so as to refine its geometry and kinematics using inversion techniques. Despite the moderate magnitudes of the main events of the sequence (5.0 <= M-w <= 5.2), the total surface deformation is 2.2 fringes (or maximum 6.2 cm along LOS) and it is well visible with InSAR because of the shallow depth of the four main events (6-8 km) and the good coherence of the signal phase. Our geodetic inversion showed that the fault has normal-slip kinematics, dimensions of 6 by 6 km (length, width) and dips at 45 degrees. The InSAR data are fitted by a uniform slip of 28 cm. In addition, 429 earthquakes were relocated with the HypoDD software and the use of a 1-D velocity model. The dip-direction of the fault is not retrievable from InSAR, but a south-dipping plane is clear from seismology and the aftershocks distribution. The spatial distribution of relocated events indicates the activation of one fault with a rupture zone length of about 10 km, a result of the occurrence of off-fault aftershocks along strike the main rupture. A stress inversion using 20 focal mechanisms (M >= 3.6; NOA solutions) indicates that faulting accommodates a N196 degrees E extension. It is confirmed that moderate (5.0 <= M <= 5.2) shallow events can be traced in InSAR studies and can produce surface displacements that provide useful data in fault inversion.

AB  - In this paper, the CHAMP satellite data from the last decade are used to map the lithospheric magnetic field in continental China at altitudes of 300 and 400 km using the spline function model technique. The results show that our model has higher amplitude than the spherical harmonic magnetic field model MF7. The resulting lithospheric anomaly distribution of continental China agrees with the geotectonic structure and crustal thermal structure. The magnetic anomaly distribution clearly indicates extrusion of the Tibetan Plateau towards the northeast and northwest directions. Northward movement is impeded by the relative rigid Tarim Basin featured with positive magnetic anomalies. The positive magnetic anomalies in Tarim basin extend to the northern Tibetan Plateau, suggesting that the southern part of Tarim Basin underthrusted the northern Tibetan Plateau.

TI  - Predictive Power of the Emissivity Angular Variation of Soils in the Thermal Infrared (8-14 μm) Region by Two Mie-Based Emissivity Theoretical Models
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - A confident knowledge of land surface emissivity at viewing zenith angles far from nadir is of prime interest to perform an accurate correction of the anisotropy effect in the measurements made by orbiting thermal infrared (TIR) sensors. It is also important for the correct treatment of angular measurements carried out by remote sensors such as AATSR/ENVISAT, MODIS/Terra-Aqua, or the recently launched SLSTR/Sentinel-3, which can also be used for the angular normalization of land surface temperature due to viewing geometry effect. In this letter, the anisotropy of TIR emissivity predicted by two analytical, Warren-Wiscombe-Dozier and Hapke, models based on Mie diffraction theory was compared with field-measured values under dry conditions. The results showed good agreement between models and measurements (RMSEs ranging from +/- 0.004 to +/- 0.030 depending on the sample, with an average value of +/- 0.016) if the compactness of the grains soil is taken into account, demonstrating the good performance of the cosine term of the zenith angle included in the expressions of both models. A significant disagreement between models and measurements is, however, obtained for some samples at high zenith angles, suggesting the necessity of a fudge factor to include in the compactness correction in that condition.

TI  - Initial Assessment of Precise Point Positioning with LEO Enhanced Global Navigation Satellite Systems (LeGNSS)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The main challenge of precise point positioning (PPP) applications is the long convergence time of typically a half hour, or even more, to achieve centimeter accuracy. Even when the multi-constellation is involved and ambiguity resolution is implemented, it still requires about ten minutes. It is becoming a hot spot to incorporate the low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellation for enhancing the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), named here as LEO-enhanced GNSS (LeGNSS). In this system, the LEO satellites cannot only receive GNSS signals, but also serve as GNSS satellites by transmitting similar navigation signals to the ground users, but with higher signal strength and much faster geometric change due to their low altitude. As a result, the convergence time of PPP is expected to be shortened to a few minutes, or even seconds. Simulation software is developed to simulate GNSS and LEO observations for ground stations taking into account tropospheric delay, satellite clock errors, observation noises, as well as other error sources. Then the number of visible satellites, the geometry dilution of precision (GDOP), and the convergence time of the kinematic mode of PPP are evaluated on a global scale compared to those of GNSS systems. The simulation results show that LeGNSS can decrease the PPP convergence to 5 min. If there are more LEO satellites included in the LeGNSS, it is expected that the initialization of PPP can be further shortened.

TI  - Is completion axillary lymph node dissection necessary in patients who are underrepresented in the ACOSOG Z0011 trial?
T2  - ADVANCES IN RADIATION ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: The American College of Surgeons Oncology Group trial Z0011 demonstrated that axillary node dissection (ALND) can be omitted in patients managed with breast conserving surgery and 1 to 2 positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) without adverse effects on locoregional recurrence or disease-free survival (DFS). We investigated patients with breast cancer for whom clinicopathologic features were underrepresented in the Z0011 trial and analyzed radiation therapy treatment patterns and clinical outcomes.Methods and materials: We retrospectively reviewed records of patients who underwent a lumpectomy and SLN biopsy with positive SLNs but not an ALND and completed adjuvant radiation therapy. Eligible patients had T3 tumors, >2 positive SLNs, invasive lobular carcinoma, estrogen receptor negative status, extranodal extension, Nottingham Grade 3, or were age <50 years.Results: We identified 105 women treated between July 2011 and July 2016 with a median follow-up time of 48.5 months (Range, 11-83 months). There were 40 women with an extranodal extension (38.9%) and 42 women with grade 3 disease (40.0%). Nineteen patients received whole breast irradiation alone (18.1%) and 86 patients were treated with modified tangent fields including the superior axilla level I/II (81.9%). Thirty-three patients (31.4%) also received a 3rd supraclavicular, nodaldirected field. Among the 86 patients who received axillary nodal irradiation, nodal volume contouring was performed in 77 patients (89.5%). Fifty-one patients (48.6%) also received adjuvant chemotherapy. The overall rates of 4-year DFS and locoregional control (LRC) were 94.3% and 98.1%, respectively. Off all patients, 1 patient experienced an internal mammary nodal recurrence, another patient a contralateral breast tumor, and two patients distant metastases. There were no axillary or ipsilateral breast tumor recurrences.Conclusions: This retrospective analysis of women who were underrepresented or excluded from the Z11 trial and underwent a lumpectomy and SLN biopsy with positive SLNs demonstrated comparable rates of LRC and DFS. The high rates of LRC and DFS suggest that completion ALND may be safely omitted in this patient population but larger data sets and longer follow-up times are needed to confirm this finding.

TI  - Mast cell chymase decreases the severity of group B <i>Streptococcus</i> infections
T2  - JOURNAL OF ALLERGY AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Group B Streptococcus (GBS) or Streptococcus agalactiae are beta-hemolytic gram-positive bacteria that colonize the lower genital tracts of women and are frequently associated with infections during pregnancy. Innate immune defenses are critical for controlling GBS dissemination and systemic infection. Mast cells are resident sentinel cells that come into contact with pathogens early during colonization and infection.Objective: We aimed to investigate the contribution of chymase to systemic GBS infection and rates of preterm birth.Methods: Pharmacologic and genetic approaches using mice deficient in mast cell protease (MCPT) 4, the mouse functional homologue of human chymase, were used.Results: Our studies show that mast cells release a protease with chymotrypsin-like cleavage specificity in response to GBS. Additionally, increased GBS systemic infection and preterm births were observed in MCPT4-deficient mice versus MCPT4-sufficient mice. Furthermore, we observed that proteolytic cleavage of the host extracellular matrix protein fibronectin by peritoneal cell-derived mast cell lysates diminished GBS adherence. Consistent with this observation, the increase in GBS dissemination and preterm births observed in MCPT4-deficient mice was abolished when GBS was deficient in expression of the fibronectin-binding protein SfbA.Conclusions: Taken together, our results suggest that the protective effect of MCPT4 against GBS dissemination and preterm labor can be attributed in part to MCPT4-mediated proteolysis of fibronectin. Our studies reveal a novel role of mast cells in defense against bacterial infections.

TI  - The Role of Edify in Promoting Christ-centred Education Through Low-fee Independent Schools
T2  - TRANSFORMATION-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HOLISTIC MISSION STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Free universal primary education has been promoted globally since the declaration of Education for All in 1990. As a result, the number of school-going children in the developing world has increased at an unprecedented scale and governments have run short of educational facilities and qualified teachers. Millions of children have been left without access to school and those who enrolled received poor quality education. Low-fee independent (private) schools (LFISs), which charge small fees, have mushroomed everywhere in response to parental demand for access and quality education. Low-income families began to send their children to LFISs rather than government schools. Despite the critical role they play in providing access and quality education, LFISs were faced with challenges that hindered them from unleashing their full potential. Edify was founded in 2009 with the vision of flourishing Godly nations to stand alongside Christian LFISs through the provision of loan capital, training and education technology services to enable them to improve and expand sustainable Christ-centred education globally. During its eight years of operation, Edify has cumulatively partnered with around 3500 schools, having an impact on 1 million children. Over 20,000 school leaders and teachers have been trained in conjunction with local training partners. With the recycling of repayment through local lending partners, Edify has dispersed US$21.9 million in total loans to schools. With a brief historical background of LFISs, this article presents the rationale, content and modus operandi of Edify's programme.

TI  - Evolutionary trend of the Gorgan Bay (southeastern Caspian Sea) during and post the last Caspian Sea level rise
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Gorgan Bay (GB) is a semi-confined sedimentary environment at the southeastern corner of the Caspian Sea (CS). High sensitivity to eustatic sea-level variations resulted in changes in the sedimentary fades and patterns of erosion/sedimentation for the GB in the last Caspian Sea-level cycle (1977-1995). Therefore, the evolutionary trend in coastal sedimentary environments was studied to determine the pattern of erosion and sedimentation related to sea-level fluctuation cycles. The sedimentology of the bay basin was studied in 500 km(2) of the study area in 2001. In addition, coastal changes over the two past and post periods of sea-level rise were studied using satellite images (Landsat 7 with a resolution of 30 m) and ArcGIS 10.1 software. Waves, wave-induced currents and sediment transport were simulated using the MIKE-21 software package. Mixed sediments, particularly at the western and southern areas of the bay basin, were detected through reworking of coarser barrier island sediments into deeper areas. Well-sorted (0.35-0.5 phi) sediments, with 98.31 +/- 2.8% sand-size particles, were identified as the common texture along the wave-dominated coasts. Sea progradation, destruction of the beach profile and an increase in sea coverage of approximately 15,600 ha around the GB were other impacts of the CS level rise. Additional impacts included severe erosion and submergence of a 9000 ha area of the flat coastal plains (slope similar to 0.035%). The results demonstrate that water-level rise has strengthened the sediment accumulation in the bay inlet and basin at a mean rate of 0.430 MCM and 12.7 MCM, respectively. Both field measurements and simulation results revealed the notable shoaling of the bay entrance at a mean rate of 0.2 m. Simulations concluded that annual longshore transport toward the bay inlet has occurred at a net rate of 80,000 m(3) during the last CS-level rise. Natural events after the eustatic cycle in the southeastern corner of the CS resulted in severe shoaling of the GB inlet and basin and restriction in the water exchange between the bay and open sea. Therefore, comprehensive management practices to restore the GB capacity and its natural habitats are critically needed.

TI  - Spatial Identification of Key Alteration Minerals Using ASTER and Landsat 8 Data in a Heavily Vegetated Tropical Area
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Central Gold Belt (CGB) of Malaysia is a major host to gold deposits. Penjom, Raub, Selising and Buffalo reef are major gold mines in CGB. The study area, Selinsing gold mine, is located at the northwest of Pahang province on the lineament known as the Raub Bentong Suture. Presence of dense vegetation and cloud cover in tropical regions are main obstacles in alteration mapping using satellite imageries. In this study, Landsat 8 and ASTER level 1B images were used to map clay minerals and quartz rich zones at Selinsing gold mine and surrounding areas. Direct principal component analysis (DPCA), matched filtering (MF) and band ratio were the effective methods used in this study. High concentration of clay minerals was detected using band ratio 6/7, DPC2 and MF and ratio 14/12 was carried out to highlight quartz rich zones. The results of image processing methods were verified by in situ inspection and X-ray diffraction analyses. The results show that, in spite of limited bedrock exposure, the known gold prospects and potential areas of mineralization can be recognized by the methods employed in this study.

TI  - ASSESSMENT OF TRANSFORMATION OF URBAN GREEN SPACES AND AGRICULTURE LAND IN KARACHI: A CASE STUDY OF GUTTER BAGHEECHA IN AND ITS SURROUNDING AREAS
T2  - International Journal of Biology and Biotechnology
M3  - Article
AB  - The sustainability of green spaces in any mega city like Karachi is indispensible for ecological stability. Pace of urban growth in Karachi is very fast and this city is continued to be at the risk of various environmental challenges. The abrupt land use changes and green cover depletion is one of the core issue for urban environment. Cultivated land is an important asset for the urban dwellers but unfortunately it is deteriorating at the pretext of improvement in the infrastructure facilities. The negative anthropogenic and environmental components are big challenge for managing ecological balance of Karachi.In this study state of art techniques of Geoinformatics utilized to monitor and map periodic changes of land use in SITE Town Karachi from (1992-2015) with special focus on the biomass depletion in Gutter Bagheecha during (2001-2015). Field survey was also conducted for ground truthing and collection of primary data. Comparative analysis were based on Satellite imageries of Landsat -7 and 8 TM 30 m and QuickBird 61 cm resolutions. Results revealed gross degradation in biomass in one of the ecologically rich land-used in Karachi during past 15 years. GIS technology proved very promissing for monitoring the variations of land resources such as loss of green cover or biomass due to urban expansion. Therefore, this study should be beneficial for agriculturists, Urban ecologist and town planners.

TI  - Aboveground biomass estimation using multi-sensor data synergy and machine learning algorithms in a dense tropical forest
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest aboveground biomass (AGB) is an important factor for tracking global carbon cycle to tackle the impact of climate change. Among all available remote sensing data and methods, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data in combination with decision tree based machine learning algorithms has produced favourable results in estimating higher biomass values. Suitability of this method for dense tropical forests has not been properly checked with an adequate number of studies. In this study, aboveground biomass was estimated for two major tree species, Shorea robusta, and Tectona grandis, of Katerniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary, a tropical forest situated in northern India. Aboveground biomass was estimated by combining C-band SAR data from Sentinel-1A satellite, texture images generated from Sentinel-1A data, vegetation indices produced using Sentinel-2A data and ground inventory plots. Decision tree-based machine learning algorithms were used in place of parametric regression models for establishing a relationship between fields measured values and remotely sensed parameters. Using random forest model with a combination of vegetation indices with SAR backscatter as predictor variables shows the best result for S. robusta forest, with a coefficient of determination value of 0.71 and an RMSE value of 105.027 t/ha. In T. grandis forest best result can be found in the same combination but for stochastic gradient boosted model with a coefficient of determination value of 0.6 and an RMSE value of 79.45 t/ha. This study shows that Sentinel series satellite data has exceptional capabilities in estimating dense forest AGB and machine learning algorithms can be very helpful to do so.

TI  - Evaluating Effectiveness of Mass and Continuous Long-lasting Insecticidal Net Distributions Over Time in Madagascar: A Sentinel Surveillance Based Epidemiological Study
T2  - ECLINICALMEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The reduction of global malaria burden over the past 15 years is much attributed to the expansion of mass distribution campaigns (MDCs) of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN). In Madagascar, two LLIN MDCs were implemented and one district also benefited from a community-based continuous distribution (CB-CD). Malaria incidence dropped but eventually rebounded after a decade.Methods: Data from a sentinel surveillance network over the 2009-2015 period was analyzed. Alerts were defined as weekly number of malaria cases exceeding the 90th percentile value for three consecutive weeks. Statistical analyses assessed the temporal relationship between LLIN MDCs and (i) number of malaria cases and (ii) malaria alerts detected, and (iii) the effect of a combination of MDCs and a CB-CD in Toamasina District.Findings: Analyses showed an increase of 13.6 points and 21.4 points in the percentile value of weekly malaria cases during the second and the third year following the MDC of LLINs respectively. The percentage of alert-free sentinel sites was 98.2% during the first year after LLIN MDC, 56.7% during the second year and 31.5% during the third year. The number of weekly malaria cases decreased by 14% during the CB-CD in Toamasina District. In contrast, sites without continuous distribution had a 12% increase of malaria cases.Interpretation: These findings support the malaria-preventive effectiveness of MDCs in Madagascar but highlight their limited duration when not followed by continuous distribution. The resulting policy implications are crucial to sustain reductions in malaria burden in high transmission settings. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Development of non-linear models predicting daily fine particle concentrations using aerosol optical depth retrievals and ground-based measurements at a municipality in the Brazilian Amazon region
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Epidemiological studies generally use particulate matter measurements with diameter less 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) from monitoring networks. Satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) data has considerable potential in predicting PM2.5 concentrations, and thus provides an alternative method for producing knowledge regarding the level of pollution and its health impact in areas where no ground PM2.5 measurements are available. This is the case in the Brazilian Amazon rainforest region where forest fires are frequent sources of high pollution. In this study, we applied a non-linear model for predicting PM2.5 concentration from AOD retrievals using interaction terms between average temperature, relative humidity, sine, cosine of date in a period of 365,25 days and the square of the lagged relative residual. Regression performance statistics were tested comparing the goodness of fit and R-2 based on results from linear regression and non-linear regression for six different models. The regression results for non-linear prediction showed the best performance, explaining on average 82% of the daily PM2.5 concentrations when considering the whole period studied. In the context of Amazonia, it was the first study predicting PM2.5 concentrations using the latest high-resolution AOD products also in combination with the testing of a non-linear model performance. Our results permitted a reliable prediction considering the AOD-PM2.5 relationship and set the basis for further investigations on air pollution impacts in the complex context of Brazilian Amazon Region.

M3  - Article
AB  - During the development of cinematograph, the synthesis tendency of literature and cinema becomes more and more obvious. As an important way of thinking in literary and cinematographic poetics, the montage, on the one hand, serves as the compositional principle, on the other hand, it facilitates the transfer of the author's worldview. A vivid example of this is the creativity of V. Makanin, in general, and his story "Voices" in particular. The writer uses the montage and leitmotif structure, which manifests itself in the mix of micro-plots and the change of narrative strategies, and in the construction of the "chronotope", based on the opposition of the moment and eternity. This allows him to create a special art space inside the literary work, reflecting the writer's strategy and worldview.

TI  - Selection of extreme environmental conditions, albedo coefficient and Earth infrared radiation, for polar summer Long Duration Balloon missions
T2  - ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The selection of the extreme thermal environmental conditions albedo coefficient and Earth infrared radiation for the thermal design of stratospheric balloon missions is usually based on the methodologies applied in space missions. However, the particularities of stratospheric balloon missions, such as the much higher residence time of the balloon payload over a determined area, make necessary an approach centered in the actual environment the balloon is going to find, in terms of geographic area and season of flight. In this sense, this work is focussed on stratospheric balloon missions circumnavigating the North Pole during the summer period. Pairs of albedo and Earth infrared radiation satellite data restricted to this area and season of interest have been treated statistically. Furthermore, the environmental conditions leading to the extreme temperatures of the payload depend in turn on the surface finish, and more particularly on the ratio between the solar absorptance and the infrared emissivity alpha/epsilon. A simple but representative thermal model of a balloon and its payload has been set up in order to identify the pairs of albedo coefficient and Earth infrared radiation leading to extreme temperatures for each value of alpha/epsilon.

TI  - Late Spring Frost in Mediterranean Beech Forests: Extended Crown Dieback and Short-Term Effects on Moth Communities
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The magnitude and frequency of Extreme Weather Events (EWEs) are increasing, causing changes in species distribution. We assessed the short-term effects of a late spring frost on beech forests, using satellite images to identify damaged forests and changes in v-egetation phenology, as well as to support the analyses on associated moth communities. The EWE caused crown dieback above 1400 m of altitude, recovered only after several weeks. Nine stands for moth sampling, settled in impacted and non-impacted forests, allowed us to study changes in moth communities and in the wingspan of the most impacted species. The EWE modified community structures, reducing the abundance of beech-feeder species, but leaving species richness unaltered. Operophtera fagata and Epirrita christyi, dominant before the EWE, lost 93% and 89% of their population, respectively. We found a general increase in the average wingspan for these species, caused by the loss of small specimens in most impacted forests, suggesting a re-colonization from non-impacted forests. According to our results, populations of some species could be more resilient than others after an EWE due to their different dispersal ability. Forest ecosystems appear to be dynamic entities able to cope with extreme weather events but, likely, only if they continue to occur in the future at the current rate.

TI  - Myopia and saliency in renewable resource management
T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - An important challenge in managing renewable resources is to understand why owners and managers sometimes make decisions that deplete resources and future earnings, such as when graziers allow pastures and land condition to be degraded. In this paper, we test two potential reasons for unsustainable management practices, myopia and salience, with each explaining why resource managers may exhibit impatience in harvest decisions. Myopia is associated with decision makers placing lower weight on future outcomes than would be implied by their pure time preference. Salience is associated with overweighting of consumption now', implying inconsistency in time preferences. To test for these effects on renewable resource management, an incentivised, dynamic field experiment was carried out with rangeland grazing enterprise owners in north-eastern Australia that related management choices with uncertain rainfall events to both profits and land condition over time. Results demonstrate that respondents exhibiting myopia/salience in their choices tended to achieve lower cumulative scores in the experiment, as well as lower land conditions on their properties as measured with remote sensing data. Our results explain why there may be persistent optimisation failures by resource owners that reduce both profits and environmental outcomes.

M3  - Article
AB  - In the first part of - L'Adolescence clementine (1532), Marot denounces the torments that "Mad Love" provokes, as it deprives the individual of his liberty and of the joys of reciprocity. On the other hand, the poet suggests a celebration of a sensual fulfillment that does not alter the sincerity of - one's faith. It proposes recognizing in terrestrial life the time and the place for a double jubilation: one stems from the human emotion of love, and the other brings the spiritual joy of salvation.

TI  - Mapping Urban Land Use at Street Block Level Using OpenStreetMap, Remote Sensing Data, and Spatial Metrics
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Up-to-date and reliable land-use information is essential for a variety of applications such as planning or monitoring of the urban environment. This research presents a workflow for mapping urban land use at the street block level, with a focus on residential use, using very-high resolution satellite imagery and derived land-cover maps as input. We develop a processing chain for the automated creation of street block polygons from OpenStreetMap and ancillary data. Spatial metrics and other street block features are computed, followed by feature selection that reduces the initial datasets by more than 80%, providing a parsimonious, discriminative, and redundancy-free set of features. A random forest (RF) classifier is used for the classification of street blocks, which results in accuracies of 84% and 79% for five and six land-use classes, respectively. We exploit the probabilistic output of RF to identify and relabel blocks that have a high degree of uncertainty. Finally, the thematic precision of the residential blocks is refined according to the proportion of the built-up area. The output data and processing chains are made freely available. The proposed framework is able to process large datasets, given that the cities in the case studies, Dakar and Ouagadougou, cover more than 1000 km(2) in total, with a spatial resolution of 0.5 m.

TI  - Prediction of Non-sentinel Lymph Node Metastases After Positive Sentinel Lymph Nodes Using Nomograms
T2  - ANTICANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background/Aim: Only 30-50% of patients with sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases present with further axillary lymph node metastases. Therefore, up to 70% of patients with positive SLN are overtreated by axillary dissection (AD) and may suffer from complications such as sensory disturbances or lymphedema. According to the current S3 guidelines, AD can be avoided in patients with a T1/T2 tumor if breast-conserving surgery with subsequent tangential irradiation is performed and no more than two SLNs are affected. Additionally, use of nomograms, that predict the probability of non-sentinel lymph node (NSLN) metastases, is recommended. Therefore, models for the prediction of NSLN metastases in our defined population were constructed and compared with the published nomograms. Patients and Methods: In a retrospective study, 2,146 primary breast cancer patients, who underwent SLN biopsy at the University Women's Hospital in Tuebingen, were evaluated by dividing the patient group in a training and validation collective (TC or VC). Using the SLN-positive TC patients, three models for the prediction of the likelihood of NSLN metastases were adapted and were then validated using the SLN-positive VC patients. In addition, the predictive power of nomograms from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), Stanford, and the Cambridge model were compared with regard to our patient collective. Results: A total of 2,146 patients were included in the study. Of these, 470 patients had positive SLN, 295 consisted the training collective and 175 consisted the validation collective. In a regression model, three variants - with 11, 6 and 2 variables - were developed for the prediction of NSLN metastases in our defined population and compared to the most frequently used nomograms. Our variants with 11 and with 6 variables were proven to be a particularly suitable model and showed similarly good results as the published MSKCC nomogram. Conclusion: Our developed nomograms may be used as a prediction tool for NSLN metastases after positive SLN.

TI  - Snow Depth Retrieval Based on a Multifrequency Passive Microwave Unmixing Method for Saline-Alkaline Land in the Western Jilin Province of China
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Passive microwave data of a snow-covered land surface received by a passive microwave radiometer is composed of microwave radiation from the snow cover and the underlying surface. The western Jilin Province of China is an important area with seasonal snow. Here, the land cover types mainly include characteristically saline-alkaline farmland and grassland. The main aim of this paper is to obtainmore accurate snow depth (SD) data in the western Jilin Province of China. First, a multifrequency passive microwave unmixing method is proposed for the study area. Second, based on Fengyun-3B microwave radiation imagery (MWRI) data and advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 (AMSR2) data, the SD retrieval results are evaluated using four methods: using MWRI data with Foster's algorithm and with the standard MWRI algorithm, and using the AMSR2 data with Foster's algorithm and with the standard AMSR2 algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that using MWRI data with the standard MWRI algorithm yields the highest accuracy for SD retrieval, with average bias and root-mean-square-error (RMSE) values of approximately 6.9 and 7.5 cm, respectively. Finally, we combined the unmixing method with the optimal SD retrieval method, and obtained more accurate SD data for the study area. Using MWRI data with the standard MWRI algorithm, the average bias and RMSE improved by approximately 9.7% and 7% when using the unmixed pixels compared with using the original mixed pixels.

TI  - Mapping Paddy Rice Area and Yields Over Thai Binh Province in Viet Nam From MODIS, Landsat, and ALOS-2/PALSAR-2
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study uses multiple satellite datasets to map paddy rice areas and yields for the Thai Binh Province, Viet Nam, over the summer growing season of 2015. The major datasets used are: first, surface reflectance and vegetation indices (VI) by fusing the optical observations from the Landsat sensors and the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer; and second, the L-band radar data from the PALSAR-2 sensor onboard the Advanced Land Observing Satellite 2. We find that although the fused VI time series are not necessarily beneficial for paddy rice mapping, the fusion datasets reduce observational gaps and allow us to better identify peak VI values and derive their empirical relationships with crop-cutting yield data (R-2 = 0.4 for all the rice types, and R-2 = 0.69 for the dominant rice type -58% of all the sampled fields). The L-band radar data have slightly lower performance in rice mapping than the optical satellite data, while it has much less contribution to yield estimation than the optical data. Furthermore, our study suggests the geolocation errors of satellite images be taken into account when selecting small sample areas for crop cutting. This practice will ensure the representativeness of crop-cutting sample areas with regard to satellite observations and thus better linkages between field data and satellite pixels for yield modeling. We also highlight the need of crop-cutting data from multiple years and/or at different regions to account for the spatial and temporal variations of harvest index to improve the spatially explicit rice yield estimates through satellite observations.

TI  - Study on causes of fever in primary healthcare center uncovers pathogens of public health concern in Madagascar
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe increasing use of malaria diagnostic tests reveals a growing proportion of patients with fever but no malaria. Clinicians and health care workers in low-income countries have few tests to diagnose causes of fever other than malaria although several diseases share common symptoms. We propose here to assess etiologies of fever in Madagascar to ultimately improve management of febrile cases.MethodologyConsenting febrile outpatients aged 6 months and older were recruited in 21 selected sentinel sites throughout Madagascar from April 2014 to September 2015. Standard clinical examinations were performed, and blood and upper respiratory specimens were taken for rapid diagnostic tests and molecular assays for 36 pathogens of interest for Madagascar in terms of public health, regardless of clinical status.Principal findingsA total of 682 febrile patients were enrolled. We detected at least one pathogen in 40.5% (276/682) of patients and 6.2% (42/682) with co-infections. Among all tested patients, 26.5% (181/682) had at least one viral infection, 17.0% (116/682) had malaria and 1.0% (7/682) presented a bacterial or a mycobacterial infection. None or very few of the highly prevalent infectious agents in Eastern Africa and Asia were detected in this study, such as zoonotic bacteria or arboviral infections.ConclusionsThese results raise questions about etiologies of fever in Malagasy communities. Nevertheless, we noted that viral infections and malaria still represent a significant proportion of causes of febrile illnesses. Interestingly our study allowed the detection of pathogens of public health interest such as Rift Valley Fever Virus but also the first case of laboratory-confirmed leptospirosis infection in Madagascar.

TI  - Are patients and physicians willing to accept less-radical procedures for cervical cancer?
T2  - JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To evaluate the opinions of women who underwent surgery for cervical cancer (CC) and physicians who treat CC about the acceptability of increased oncological risk after less-radical surgery.Methods: One hundred eighty-two women who underwent surgery for CC and 101 physicians participated in a structured survey in 3 tertiary cancer centers in Czech Republic and Turkey. Patients and physicians were asked whether they would accept any additional oncological risks, which would be attributable to the omission of parametrectomy (radical hysterectomy/trachelectomy vs. simple hysterectomy/trachelectomy) or pelvic lymph node dissection (systematic resection vs. sentinel lymph node sampling).Results: Although 52.2% of patients reported morbidity related to their previous treatment, the majority of patients would not accept less-radical surgical treatment if it was associated with any increased risk of recurrence (50%-55%, no risk; 17%-24%, risk < 0.1%). Physicians tended to accept a significantly higher risk than patients in the Czech Republic, but not in Turkey. Patients with higher education levels, more advanced-stage of disease, or adverse events related to previous cancer treatment, and patients who received adjuvant therapy were significantly more likely to accept an increased oncological risk.Conclusion: Patients, even if they suffered from morbidity related to previous CC treatment, do not want to choose between oncological safety and a better quality of life. Physicians tend to accept the higher oncological risk associated with less-radical surgical procedures, but attitudes differ regionally. Professionals should be aware of this tendency when counselling the patients before less-radical surgery.

TI  - Inversion of Rice Biophysical Parameters Using Simulated Compact Polarimetric SAR C-Band Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurate estimation of rice parameters plays a significant role in rice monitoring and yield forecasting for ensuring food security. Compact-polarimetric (CP) synthetic aperture radar (SAR), a good compromise between the dual- and quad-polarized SARs, is an important part of the new generation of Earth observation systems. In this paper, the ability of CP SAR data to retrieve rice biophysical parameters was explored using a modified water cloud model. The results showed that S-1 was superior to other CP variables in rice height inversion with a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.92 and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 5.81 cm. RL was the most suitable for inverting the volumetric water content of the rice canopy, with an R-2 of 0.95 and a RMSE of 0.31 kg/m(3). The m-chi decomposition produced the highest accuracies for the ear biomass: R-2 was 0.89 and RMSE was 0.17 kg/m(2). The highest accuracy of leaf area index (LAI) retrieval was obtained for RH (right circular transmit and horizontal linear receive) with an R-2 of 0.79 and a RMSE of 0.33. This study illustrated the capability of CP SAR data with respect to retrieval of rice biophysical parameters, especially for height, volumetric water content of the rice canopy, and ear biomass, and this mode may offer the best option for rice-monitoring applications because of swath coverage.

TI  - Abatement expenditures, technology choice, and environmental performance: Evidence from firm responses to import competition in Mexico
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Abatement expenditures are not the only available tool for firms to decrease emissions. Technology choice can also indirectly affect environmental performance. We assess the impact of import competition on plants' environmental outcomes. In particular, exploiting a unique combination of Mexican plant-level and satellite imagery data, we measure the effect of tariff changes due to free-trade agreements on three main outcomes: plants' fuel use, plants' abatement expenditures, and measures of air pollution around plants' location. Our findings show that import competition induced plants in Mexico to increase energy efficiency, reduce emissions, and in turn reduce direct investment in environmental protection. Our findings suggest that the general technology upgrading effect of any policy could be an important determinant of environmental performance in developing countries and that this effect may not be captured in abatement data.

TI  - Monitoring Deforestation in Rainforests Using Satellite Data: A Pilot Study from Kalimantan, Indonesia
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring large forest areas is presently feasible with satellite remote sensing as opposed to time-consuming and expensive ground surveys as alternative. This study evaluated, for the first time, the potential of using freely available medium resolution (30 m) Landsat time series data for deforestation monitoring in tropical rainforests of Kalimantan, Indonesia, at sub-annual time scales. A simple, generic, data-driven algorithm for deforestation detection based on a consecutive anomalies criterion was proposed. An accuracy assessment in the spatial and the temporal domain was carried out using high-confidence reference sample pixels interpreted with the aid of multi-temporal very high spatial resolution image series. Results showed a promising spatial accuracy, when three consecutive anomalies were required to confirm a deforestation event. Recommendations in tuning the algorithm for different operational use cases were provided within the context of satisfying REDD+ requirements, depending on whether spatial accuracy or temporal accuracy need to be optimized.

T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data particularly Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (Pol SAR) data has shown promising results in crop monitoring and classification with reasonably high accuracy in tropical countries like India. Our study explores the use polarimetric SAR data for crop discrimination by evaluating different polarimetric parameters and various decomposition techniques using single date fine quadpol C-band RADARSAT-2 dataset over heterogeneous agricultural area of Mehsana district of Gujarat state in India. Vegetation parameter, Radar Vegetation Index (RVI) and five decomposition techniques (e.g. H/A/a, Freeman-2, Freeman-3, Van Zyl-3 and Krogager) based on incoherent and coherent decompositions were selected to generate input images of classification. RVI shows good correlation with the crop stage at higher biomass with high value of RVI and with urban and water body with lower values of RVI respectively. H/A/a and its combinations i.e. (H-A) and (1-H)(1-A) show good results for discriminating land cover with different scattering mechanisms. Freeman-2, Freeman-3, Van Zyl-3 and Krogager are also evaluated for classification capability between various land covers and different crop types at different phenological stages. In 3-component decompositions, Freeman gives better results compared to other decomposition techniques for discriminating agricultural crops and natural vegetation. VanZyl decomposition overestimates surface component for agricultural crops and vegetation compared to Freeman 3-component decomposition. Krogager decomposition gives better seperability for man-made targets. The limitations of optical data for discrimination of crops based on biophysical parameters at various crop stages with similar spectral signature can be overcome by even single date full polarimetric SAR data with different decomposition techniques.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Management of stage IV melanoma patients remains a challenge. In spite of promising new therapies, many patients develop resistance and progression. The aim of this pilot study was to determine if circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are associated with shortened (180-day) progression-free survival (PFS) after a baseline CTC assessment in stage IV melanoma patients.STUDY DESIGN: A baseline CTC assessment was performed in 93 stage IV melanoma patients using a commercially available immunomagnetic system. The presence of 1 or more CTC was considered a positive result. A Cox multivariable regression model was used to evaluate the association between presence of CTCs at baseline and PFS, after adjusting for covariables. Kaplan-Meier curves and a log-rank test were used to summarize and compare unadjusted PFS for patients stratified by CTC positivity.RESULTS: Median follow-up was 17 months; mean age was 55 years. Thirteen of 93 (14%) patients had no evidence of disease (NED) at baseline CTC assessment. One or more CTC was detected in 39 of 93 (42%) of patients at baseline; CTCs were not associated with primary melanoma features or NED status. Twenty-eight of 93 (30%) patients progressed within 180 days of baseline draw, with 20 of 39 (51%) of the CTC-positive patients relapsing compared with 8 of 54 (15%) of the CTC-negative patients. In adjusted Cox models, a significant association was found suggesting worse PFS within 180 days for CTC-positive patients at baseline (vs CTC-negative) (hazard ratio 4.69, 95% CI 1.59 to 13.77, p = 0.005).CONCLUSIONS: One or more CTCs at baseline were associated with progression within 180 days in stage IV melanoma patients. This information warrants further study of CTCs as a means of identifying patients at high-risk for disease progression. (C) 2018 by the American College of Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Inc.

T2  - JNCI CANCER SPECTRUM
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) genotype influences the development of invasive cervical cancer (ICC); however, there is uncertainty regarding the association of HPV genotype with survival among ICC patients.Methods: Follow-up data were collected from 693 previously selected and HPV-typed ICC cases that were part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Cancer Registry Surveillance System. Cases were diagnosed between 1994 and 2005. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate five-year all-cause survival. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the effect of HPV genotype on survival after adjusting for demographic, tumor, and treatment characteristics.Results: Five-year all-cause survival rates varied by HPV status (HPV 16: 66.9%, HPV 18: 65.7%, HPV 31/33/45/52/58: 70.8%, other oncogenic HPV genotypes: 79.0%, nononcogenic HPV: 69.3%, HPV-negative: 54.0%). Following multivariable adjustment, no statistically significant survival differences were found for ICC patients with HPV 16-positive tumors compared with women with tumors positive for HPV 18, other oncogenic HPV types, or HPV-negative tumors. Women with detectable HPV 31/33/33/45/52/58 had a statistically significant 40% reduced hazard of death at five years (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.38 to 0.95), and women who tested positive for nononcogenic HPV genotypes had a statistically significant 57% reduced hazard of death at five years (95% CI-0.19 to 0.96) compared with women with HPV 16 tumors. Few statistically significant differences in HPV positivity, tumor characteristics, treatment, or survival were found by race/ethnicity.Conclusions: HPV genotype statistically significantly influenced five-year survival rates among women with ICC; however, screening and HPV vaccination remain the most important factors to improve patient prognosis and prevent future cases.

TI  - Land Cover Changes Induced by Demining Operations in Halgurd-Sakran National Park in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents an analysis of Landsat data to quantify how the deployment of landmines and demining operations in the first national park in Iraq, the Halgurd-Sakran Core Zone (HSCZ) in the Kurdistan region, has altered the vegetation/land cover patterns over 17 years (between 1998 and 2015). Post-war impacts of landmines on land cover fragmentation and degradation in HSCZ are examined using GIS and remote sensing. Landmines fundamentally change the available land use options for local communities by limiting access to the land. Their widespread use in military conflicts around the world made investigating the impacts of minefields on land cover fragmentation the subject of scientific studies. The Iraqi-Iranian war (1980-1988) and subsequent conflicts have left behind densely mined areas in Kurdistan, especially in the border zones, which were previous battle zones. These leftover weapons of historic wars are indiscriminate and still affecting people. The results revealed that the relationship between land use/land cover (LULC) classes before and after the Fall of Baghdad is different for all classes, especially for pasture and cultivated lands. Between 1998 and 2015 the proportion of land covered by forest or under agricultural cultivation decreased substantially, matched by a large increase in pasture extent. The results also show that after 2003 increased attention has been paid to raising landmine awareness in the areas most affected by mines. Additionally, the landmines slowed down the progression in HSCZ, otherwise, agricultural production and productivity could potentially have doubled. The change in cultivated land area in the park does not relate to population growth but to the presence of minefields, minefield programme awareness, and socio-economic factors. Strong rural pull factors succeeded in bringing displaced people back to villages as a result of social progress, economic growth, and political stability in HSCZ.

TI  - Estimation of mass elevation effect and its annual variation based on MODIS and NECP data in the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The lofty and extensive Tibetan Plateau has significant mass elevation effect (MEE). In recent years, a great effort has been made to quantify MEE, with the recognition of intra-mountain basal elevation (MBE) as the main determinant of MEE. In this study, we improved the method of estimating MEE with MODIS and NECP data, by refining temperature laps rate, and dividing MBE plots, and then analyzed the spatio-temporal variation of MEE in the Plateau. The main conclusions include: 1) the highest average annual MEE of the plateau is as high as 11.5488A degrees C in the southwest of the plateau, where exists a high-MEE core and MEE takes on a trend of decreasing from the core to the surrounding areas; 2) in the interior of the plateau, the maximum monthly MEE is 14.1108A degrees C in the highest MBE plot (4934 m) in August; while the minimum monthly MEE appeared primarily in January and February; 3) in the peripheral areas of the plateau, annual mean MEE is relatively low, mostly between 3.0068A degrees C-5.1972A degrees C, where monthly MEE is high in January and December and low in June and July, completely different from the MEE time-series variation in the internal parts of the plateau.

TI  - Comparisons of bin and bulk microphysics schemes in simulations of topographic winter precipitation with radar and radiometer measurements
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Hebrew University Cloud Model (HUCM) bin scheme and the Thompson bulk scheme in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model are compared to assess biases often found in simulated brightness temperature and radar reflectivity. Compared to our preceding study that evaluated several bulk schemes in the WRF model, the current study obtains a reduction of the bias from excessive microwave scattering by precipitation ice for both HUCM bin and the Thompson bulk microphysics schemes for a topographic winter precipitation event associated with an atmospheric river. The Thompson particle size distributions (PSDs) and snow particle density assumption are implemented into the Goddard Satellite Data Simulator Unit (G-SDSU) and have produced improvements. Despite the greater sophistication of the bin scheme in representing cloud and precipitation processes, the simulation with the Thompson bulk scheme is generally in better agreement with observations for this winter event. The explicitly resolved hydrometeor PSDs in HUCM enable analysis of mass spectra variations in response to changes in microphysics assumptions. Two HUCM sensitivity runs tested the enhancement of snow particle breakup and the influence of ice nuclei (IN) concentration. Higher IN concentration resulted in increased snow mass and broadened the spectrum toward small-size particles. Modified snow mass spectra and resultant changes in graupel contributed to modifications in scattering and reflectivity simulations. The article demonstrates the bin scheme's capability to provide a new means to improve our understanding of uncertainties in mesoscale weather models and radiative transfer models.

TI  - Incidentally Discovered Solitary Gastrointestinal Polyp with Pathological Significance in Children: Four Case Reports
T2  - PEDIATRIC GASTROENTEROLOGY HEPATOLOGY & NUTRITION
M3  - Article
AB  - Most solitary gastrointestinal (GI) polyps in children are either inflammatory or hamartomatous. Solitary hyperplastic polyp, sentinel polyp and solitary adenomatous polyp have been occasionally diagnosed in adults, but very rarely reported in Korean children. We recently came across a case with adenomatous polyp in the colon, a case with hyperplastic polyp beneath the gastroesophageal junction, a case with hyperplastic polyp in the prepyloric area, and a case with sentinel polyp in the distal esophagus, which are unusual pathologic types in children. These mucosal lesions were diagnosed incidentally during elective endoscopic examinations for GI symptoms. Most polyps do not cause significant symptoms, so the diagnosis might be delayed, especially in children, in whom GI endoscopy is not commonly performed for screening purpose as in the adults.

TI  - Chaplains' Roles as Mediators in Critical Clinical Decisions.
T2  - AMA journal of ethics
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Chaplains provide spiritual care and support to patients, families, and hospital staff. What may be less familiar is that chaplains also help mediate decisions among patients, family members, and clinical teams. How clinicians, patients, and families formulate and articulate their goals and concerns can be informed either directly or indirectly by religious values. Finding common ground and common language can be helpful for both the medical team and the family. Physicians can use their clinical and social authority to try to ameliorate distress and offer recommendations based on patients' and families' goals and values; conversely, physicians' hesitancy to use their authority in these ways can generate moral distress among patients, families, and caregivers. However, when the medical team engages in conversation with a willingness to be informed by patients' religious worldview, more effective decision making may ensue.

TI  - Contemporary Evaluation of Breast Lymph Nodes in Anatomic Pathology
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PATHOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Objectives: Management of the axilla in breast cancer patients has evolved considerably since the introduction of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy in the 1990s. Several new clinical and technological developments in the last decade warrant special consideration due to their impact on pathology practice.Methods: This review covers the SLN biopsy procedure, issues in the histopathologic and molecular diagnosis of the SLN, and most importantly, evidence from recent practice-changing clinical trials.Results: ACOSOG Z0011, IBCSG 23-01, and AMAROS trials have shown that early-stage breast cancer patients who have limited metastatic involvement of the SLNs do not benefit from completion axillary dissections.Conclusions: It is not necessary for pathologists to search for all small metastases to predict non-SLN involvement, regional recurrence, or death due to disease. Processing should be designed with the goal of detecting macrometastases. Multiple levels, routine immunohistochemistry, and molecular testing are not recommended.

TI  - Diversity of dengue virus-3 genotype III in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Dengue is the most important arboviral disease in tropical and subtropical countries. Dispersal of the vector and an increase in migratory flow between countries have led to large epidemics and severe clinical outcomes. Over the past 20 years, dengue epidemics have become more wide-spread and frequent. Previous studies have shown that dengue is endemic in Jeddah, Makkah and Al-Madinah in western Saudi Arabia as well as in Jazan region in the southern part of the country. The four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV) have been reported from western Saudi Arabia. It has been suggested that pilgrims could play a significant and unique role in DENV-1 and DENV-2 introduction into Saudi Arabia, especially in the cities of Jeddah, Makkah and AlMadinah during Hajj and Umrah seasons. However, only limited data on DENV-3 in Saudi Arabia are available.Methods: All available DENV-3 sequences published and unpublished from Saudi Arabia and other countries were retrieved from Genbank and gene sequence repository and phylogenetically analyzed to examine the diversity of DENV-3 into the city of Jeddah.Results: Based on the analysis of the envelope gene and non-structural 1 (E/NS1) junction sequences, we show that there were at least four independent introductions of DENV-3, all from genotype III into Jeddah. The first introduction was most probably before 1997 as Saudi virus isolates from 1997 formed a cluster without any close relationship to other globally circulating isolates, suggesting their local circulation from previous introduction events. Two introductions were most probably in 2004 with isolates closely-related to isolates from Africa and India (Asia), in addition to another introduction in 2014 with isolates clustering with those from Singapore (Asia).Conclusions: Our data shows that only genotype III isolates of DENV-3 are circulating in Jeddah and highlights the potential role of pilgrims in DENV-3 importation into western Saudi Arabia and subsequent exportation to their home countries during Hajj and Umrah seasons. Therefore, it is highly recommended to establish DENV sentinel surveillance programs targeting clinical cases and the mosquito vector in the country to implement effective control measures and to minimize the burden of the disease in the kingdom.

TI  - A Component-Based Multi-Layer Parallel Network for Airplane Detection in SAR Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, a component-based multi-layer parallel network is proposed for airplane detection in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery. In response to the problems called sparsity and diversity brought by SAR scattering mechanism, depth characteristics and component structure are utilized in the presented algorithm. Compared with traditional features, the depth characteristics have better description ability to deal with diversity. Component information is contributing in detecting complete targets. The proposed algorithm consists of two parallel networks and a constraint layer. First, the component information is introduced into the network by labeling. Then, the overall target and corresponding components are detected by the trained model. In the following discriminative constraint layer, the maximum probability and prior information are adopted to filter out wrong detection. Experiments for several comparative methods are conducted on TerraSAR-X SAR imagery; the results indicate that the proposed network has a higher accuracy for airplane detection.

M3  - Article
AB  - With the depletion of fossil fuel energy, geothermal resource exploration has become an important research hotspot around the world. Thermal infrared remote sensing technology is a new trend in the field of geothermal resources investigation and exploration, with the advantages of quick, economical study of large areas that have variations in geothermal resources and heat distribution. Based on the MODIS thermal infrared remotely sensed data, the split-window algorithm was used to retrieve the surface temperature of the geothermal region in Eastern Liaoning, China. The temperature inversion images at four seasons during the year of 2016 were selected, and the high temperature zones in the inversion results were compared with the geothermal features and fault structures in the study area. It was found that the spatial distribution relationships were highly similar. In conclusion, the distribution of geothermal resources can be inferred by analyzing the inversion results of regional temperatures and geological structures.

TI  - Kernel Low-Rank Multitask Learning in Variational Mode Decomposition Domain for Multi-/Hyperspectral Classification
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multitask learning (MTL) has recently yielded impressive results for classification of remotely sensed data due to its ability to incorporate shared information across multiple tasks. However, it remains a challenging issue to achieve robust classification results in the case that the data are from nonlinear subspaces. In this paper, we propose a kernel low-rank MTL (KL-MTL) method to handle multiple features from the 2-D variational mode decomposition (2-D-VMD) domain for multi-/hyperspectral classification. On the one hand, a nonrecursive 2-D-VMD method is applied to extract various features [i.e., intrinsic mode functions (IMFs)] of the original data concurrently. Compared with the existing 2-D empirical mode decomposition, 2-D-VMD has much stronger mathematical foundation and does not need any recursive sifting process. On the other hand, KL-MTL is proposed for classification by taking the extracted IMFs as features of multiple tasks. In KL-MTL, the low-rank representation formulated by nuclear norm can capture global structure of multiple tasks, while the kernel tricks are utilized for nonlinear extension of the lowrank MTL. Moreover, the optimization problem in KL-MTL is solved by the inexact augmented Lagrangian method. Compared with several state-of-the-art feature extraction and classification methods, the experimental results using both multi-/ hyperspectral images demonstrate that the proposed method has satisfactory classification performance.

TI  - Integrating Remote Sensing, GIS, and Sedimentology Techniques for Identifying Dust Storm Sources: A Case Study in Khuzestan, Iran
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - There is an urgent need for zoning the dust sources, as the first step to control dust storms. Hence, this study aimed to identify the exact interior sources of dust in Khuzestan Province (Iran), using a hybrid method of remote sensing, GIS and sedimentology. To this end, the spatial data of pedology, landuse, climate, slope and sedimentology were used as the constraint layers and vegetation, land surface temperature and soil moisture were used as the major layers. The major layers were extracted by performing the necessary computational process on the image of the Landsat 8 satellite. Constraint layers were used to eliminate the regions without dust production potential. In the next step, the major layers were weighted applying the paired comparison and fuzzy analytic hierarchy process methods. Then, the final integration of the layers took place by multiplying each major layer in the respective weight, and the map of the dust sources in the region was prepared. To validate the results, field trips were done for 180 points of the sources which indicate the high accuracy of the identified regions. The results revealed that 9% of the area in Khuzestan Plain equal to 350,000 ha is regarded as the source of dust production. Moreover, according to the results, it can be said that satellite images, especially those with efficient resolutions such as Landsat 8 products, are suitable basis data for extracting indicators (temperature, humidity and vegetation) of the dust sources.

TI  - Smoke aerosols dispersion and transport from the 2013 New South Wales (Australia) bushfires
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental monitoring and modelling, especially in the regional context, has seen significant progress with the widely usage of satellite measurement in conjunction with local meteorological and air quality monitoring to understand the atmospheric dispersion and transport of air pollutants. This paper studies the application of these data and modelling tools to understand the environment effects of a major bushfire period in the state of New South Wales (NSW), Australia, in 2013. The bushfires have caused high pollution episodes at many sites in the greater Sydney metropolitan areas. The potential long-range transport of aerosols produced by bushfires to other region and states has been seen by regulators as a major concern. Using data and images collected from satellites, in addition to the results obtained from different simulations carried out using HYSPLIT trajectory model and a regional meteorological model called Conformal Cubic Atmospheric Model (CCAM), we were able to identify at least 2 days on which the smoke aerosols from bush fires in NSW has been transported at high altitude to the northern state of Queensland and the Coral Sea. As a result, widespread high particle concentration in South East Queensland including the Brisbane area, as measured by nearly all the air quality monitoring stations in this region, occurred on the day when the smoke aerosols intruded to lower altitude as indicated by the CALIOP (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization) Lidar measurements on the CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation) satellite. The use of meteorological or air quality modelling to connect the ground-based measurements with satellite observations as shown in this study is useful to understand the pollutant transport due to bushfires and its impact on regional air quality.

M3  - Article
AB  - The German National Forest Inventory consists of a systematic grid of permanent sample plots and provides a reliable evidence-based assessment of the state and the development of Germany's forests on national and federal state level in a 10 year interval. However, the data have yet been scarcely used for estimation on smaller management levels such as forest districts due to insufficient sample sizes within the area of interests and the implied large estimation errors. In this study, we present a double-sampling extension to the existing German National Forest Inventory (NFI) that allows for the application of recently developed design-based small area regression estimators. We illustrate the implementation of the estimation procedure and evaluate its potential for future large-scale operational application by the example of timber volume estimation on two small-scale management levels (45 and 405 forest district units respectively) over the entire area of the federal German state of Rhineland-Palatinate. An airborne laserscanning (ALS) derived canopy height model and a tree species classification map based on satellite data were used as auxiliary data in an ordinary least square regression model to produce the timber volume predictions. The results support that the suggested double-sampling procedure can substantially increase estimation precision on both management levels: the two-phase estimators were able to reduce the variance of the one-phase simple random sampling estimator by 43% and 25% on average for the two management levels respectively.

TI  - Quantifying the Contribution of Different Cloud Types to the Radiation Budget in Southern West Africa
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The contribution of cloud to the radiation budget of southern West Africa (SWA) is poorly understood and yet it is important for understanding regional monsoon evolution and for evaluating and improving climate models, which have large biases in this region. Radiative transfer calculations applied to atmospheric profiles obtained from the CERES-CloudSat-CALIPSO-MODIS (CCCM) dataset are used to investigate the effects of 12 different cloud types (defined by their vertical structure) on the regional energy budget of SWA (5 degrees-10 degrees N, 8 degrees W-8 degrees E) during June-September. We show that the large regional mean cloud radiative effect in SWA is due to nonnegligible contributions from many different cloud types; eight cloud types have a cloud fraction larger than 5% and contribute at least 5% of the regional mean shortwave cloud radiative effect at the top of the atmosphere. Low clouds, which are poorly observed by passive satellite measurements, were found to cause net radiative cooling of the atmosphere, which reduces the heating from other cloud types by approximately 10%. The sensitivity of the radiation budget to underestimating low-cloud cover is also investigated. The radiative effect of missing low cloud is found to be up to approximately -25 W m(-2) for upwelling shortwave irradiance at the top of the atmosphere and 35 W m(-2) for downwelling shortwave irradiance at the surface.

TI  - Quantification of Polychlorinated Biphenyl (PCB) Concentration in San Francisco Bay Using Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency banned the use of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in 1979, due to the high environmental and public health risks with which they are associated. However, PCBs continue to persist in the San Francisco Bay (SFB), often at concentrations deemed unsafe for humans. In situ PCB monitoring within the SFB is extremely limited, due in large part to the high monetary costs associated with sampling. Here we offer a cost effective alternative to in situ PCB monitoring by demonstrating the feasibility of indirectly quantifying PCBs in the SFB via satellite remote sensing using a two-step approach. First, we determined the relationship between in situ PCB concentrations and suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) in the SFB. We then correlated in situ SSC with spatially and temporally consistent Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2A reflectances. We demonstrate strong relationships between SSC and PCBs in all three SFB sub-embayments (R-2 > 0.28-0.80, p < 0.01), as well as a robust relationship between SSC and satellite measurements for both Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2A (R-2 > 0.72, p < 0.01). These relationships held regardless of the atmospheric correction regime that we applied. The end product of these relationships is an empirical two-step relationship capable of deriving PCBs from satellite imagery. Our approach of estimating PCBs in the SFB by remotely sensing SSC is extremely cost-effective when compared to traditional in situ techniques. Moreover, it can also be utilized to generate PCB concentration maps for the SFB. These maps could one day serve as an important tool for PCB remediation in the SFB, as they can provide valuable insight into the spatial distribution of PCBs throughout the bay, as well as how this distribution changes over time.

TI  - Dynamics of the wetland vegetation in large lakes of the Yangtze Plain in response to both fertilizer consumption and climatic changes
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Using moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data that cover the 15-year period from 2000 to 2014 and a phenology-based classification method, the long-term changes in the wetland vegetation of 25 large lakes on the Yangtze Plain were obtained. The classification method was developed based on the phenological information extracted from time series of MODIS observations, which demonstrated mean user's/producer's accuracies of 76.17% and 84.58%, respectively. The first comprehensive record of the spatial distribution and temporal dynamics of wetland vegetation in the large lakes on the Yangtze Plain was created. Of the 25 lakes examined, 17 showed a decreasing trend of vegetation area percentages (VAPs) during the study period, and 7 were statistically significant (p < 0.05). The same number of lakes was found to display decreasing trends in vegetation greenness over this 15-year period, and these decreasing trends were statistically significant (p < 0.05) for 11 of the lakes. Substantially fewer lakes showed increases in either their VAPs or their vegetation greenness values. Analysis using a multiple general linear model revealed that the amounts of chemical fertilizer used for farmlands surrounding the lakes, precipitation, daily sunshine hours, temperature and water turbidity played the most important roles in regulating the interannual changes in vegetation greenness in 40% (10/25), 12% (3/25), 4% (1/25), 20% (5/25) and 12% (3/25) of the lake wetlands, respectively. On average, the combined effects of these five driving factors above explained 89.08 7.89% of the variation in greenness over this 15-year period for the 25 lakes. This wetland vegetation environmental data record (EDR) of large lakes in Yangtze Plain demonstration will provide a crucial baseline information for the wetland environment conservation and restoration.

TI  - Influences of environmental changes on water storage variations in Central Asia
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatio-temporal pattern of the global water resource has significantly changed with climate change and intensified human activities. The regional economy and ecological environment are highly affected by terrestrial water storage (TWS), especially in arid areas. To investigate the variation of TWS and its influencing factors under changing environments, the response relationships between TWS and changing environments (climate change and human activities) in Central Asia have been analyzed based on the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data, Climatic Research Unit (CRU) climate data and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) remote sensing data products (MOD16A2, MOD13A3 and MCD12Q1) from 2003 to 2013. The slope and Pearson correlation analysis methods were used. Results indicate that: (1) TWS in about 77 % of the study area has decreased from 2003 to 2013. The total change volume of TWS is about 2915.6 x 10(8) m(3). The areas of decreased TWS are mainly distributed in the middle of Central Asia, while the areas of increased TWS are concentrated in the middle-altitude regions of the Kazakhstan hills and Tarim Basin. (2) TWS in about 5.91% of areas, mainly distributed in the mountain and piedmont zones, is significantly positively correlated with precipitation, while only 3.78% of areas show significant correlation between TWS and temperature. If the response time was delayed by three months, there would be a very good correlation between temperature and TWS. (3) There is a significantly positive relationship between TWS and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in 13.35% of the study area. (4) The area of significantly positive correlation between TWS and evapotranspiration is about 31.87%, mainly situated in mountainous areas and northwestern Kazakhstan. The reduction of regional TWS is related to precipitation more than evaporation. Increasing farmland area may explain why some areas show increasing precipitation and decreasing evapotranspiration. (5) The influences of land use on TWS are still not very clear. This study could provide scientific data useful for the estimation of changes in TWS with climate change and human activities.

TI  - Stepwise Evolution Analysis of the Region-Merging Segmentation for Scale Parameterization
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multiscale image segmentation is a fundamental process of object-based image analysis, and the segmentation scale is a key parameter. The selection of the optimal scale parameter has attracted widely attentions in recent years, and many methods were proposed for this task. However, these methods usually need to set a scale sequence, which depends on the segmentation algorithm. When using another segmentation algorithm, the definition of the scale is different, these methods are less effective. In this study, we are aiming at developing a general framework for analyzing and estimating the optimal scale parameter for the region-merging segmentation, which is the most widely used approach for generating multiscale objects in remote sensing. A stepwise evolution analysis (SEA) framework and its application in optimal scale parameter estimation are proposed. In the SEA framework, the evolutions of scale, local variance (LV), and Moran's I (MI) indexes are analyzed step-by-step, and then, be used for automated scale parameterizations. Four LV-and MI-metrics-based methods were technically integrated in this framework, and applied to a Quick-Bird and a WorldView-2 image to evaluate the performance. The results demonstrated that: The stepwise analysis of a hierarchical region merging provided the distribution information of the scale, which could be used to estimate the key parameters and integrate different scale parameterization methods. The traditional LV-and MI-based scale estimation methods could be technically integrated, which showed the powerful ability and great potential in utilizing different scale parameterization methods for the region-merging segmentation.

TI  - Geological Characteristics of Von Karman Crater, Northwestern South pole-Aitken Basin: Chang'E-4 Landing Site Region
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS
M3  - Article
AB  - Von Karman crater (diameter = similar to 186 km), lying in the northwestern South Pole-Aitken (SPA) basin, was formed in the pre-Nectarian. The Von Karman crater floor was subsequently flooded with one or several generations of mare basalts during the Imbrian period. Numerous subsequent impact craters in the surrounding region delivered ejecta to the floor, together forming a rich sample of the SPA basin and farside geologic history. We studied in details the targeted landing region (45.0-46.0 degrees S, 176.4-178.8 degrees E) of the 2018 Chinese lunar mission Chang'E-4, within the Von Kaman crater. The topography of the landing region is generally flat at a baseline of similar to 60 m. Secondary craters and ejecta materials have covered most of the mare unit and can be traced back to at least four source craters (Finsen, Von Karman L, Von Karman L', and Antoniadi) based on preferential spatial orientations and crosscutting relationships. Extensive sinuous ridges and troughs are identified spatially related to ea Jie crater (diameter = similar to 4 km). Reflectance spectral variations due to difference in both composition and physical properties are observed among the ejecta from various-sized craters on the mare unit. The composition trends were used together with crater scaling relationships and estimates of regolith thickness to reconstruct the subsurface stratigraphy. The results reveal a complex geological history of the landing region and set the framework for the in situ measurements of the CE-4 mission, which will provide unique insights into the compositions of farside mare basalt, SPA compositional zone including SPA compositional anomaly and Mg-pyroxene annulus, regolith evolution, and the lunar space environment.Plain Language Summary The South Pole-Aitken (SPA) basin on the farside of the Moon is the largest known impact structure in the solar system. It is the key area to answer several important questions about the Moon, including its internal structure and thermal evolution. We outline the geologic history of an important area (Von Karman crater) within SPA. In 2018,a new Chinese lunar mission Chang'E-4 (CE-4) will be the first to land in the Von Karman crater, within the SPA basin. The scientific instruments of CE-4, mounted on a lander and a rover, will analyze both surface and subsurface of this farside region. Here we present a detailed geological study of the selected landing region of CE-4, based on remote sensing data of the Moon. Our study identified several targets of high scientific interests and proposes testable hypotheses for the CE-4 mission.

T2  - CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY AND INFECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Our objective was to evaluate whether vaccination with the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) prevents the incidence of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) caused by influenza (influenza-associated CAP, IA-CAP) or other respiratory viruses in the elderly.Methods: This analysis was part of the Community-Acquired Pneumonia immunization Trial in Adults (CAPiTA); a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 84 496 immunocompetent individuals aged >= 65 years. CAP was defined by clinical and radiological criteria, and oropharyngeal swabs were collected from all individuals referred to a sentinel centre with a clinical suspicion of pneumonia. Presence of influenza A and B, parainfluenza 1, 2, 3 and 4, human adeno-, boca-, corona-, metapneumo-, rhino-and respiratory syncytial viruses was determined by real-time PCR.Results: Of 3209 episodes of suspected pneumonia, viral aetiology was tested in 2917 and proportions with influenza virus, human metapneumovirus and respiratory syncytial virus were 4.6%, 2.5% and 3.1%, respectively. There were 1653 oropharyngeal swabs for PCR testing available from 1814 episodes that fulfilled criteria for CAP, yielding 23 first episodes of IA-CAP in the PCV13 and 35 in the in placebo group-vaccine efficacy for IA-CAP of 34.4% (95% CI -11.1% to 61.2%; p 0.117). Annual influenza vaccination was received by 672 (87.2%) in the PCV13 group and 719 (87.7%) in the placebo group of the confirmed CAP cases.Conclusion: In a randomized study of 84 496 elderly individuals with a high uptake of influenza vaccination, PCV13 was not associated with a statistically significant reduction of influenza or virus-associated CAP. Overall incidence of non-influenza viral pneumonia was low. (c) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.

TI  - Management of the Hand Tumors
T2  - TURKISH JOURNAL OF PLASTIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Tumors of the hand are usually benign in nature, and therefore, treatment is usually nonessential. Indications for the surgical treatment are cosmetic concern and potential for malignancy. Since malignant hand tumors are seen very rarely, suspicious findings should be assessed thoroughly, and the diagnosis should be established as well. The purpose of this article is to evaluate those lesions that commonly arise in the hand region including lipomas, ganglion cysts, and glomus tumors as well as malignant tumors such as soft-tissue sarcomas and squamous cell carcinomas. Material and Methods: A retrospective review of all 528 surgically removed primary skin and soft-tissue tumors of the hand at our department between 1996 and 2016 was performed. Results: A total of 528 patients were evaluated in this study. The most common benign tumor of the hand was pyogenic granuloma (24%), and the most common malign tumor of the hand was squamous cell carcinoma (65.2%). Malignant tumors incidence was higher in males, whereas benign tumors incidence was higher in females. Conclusions: A careful history and physical examination performed by a specialist can narrow down the possibilities regarding the type of tumor. The vast majority of hand tumors tend to be benign. In contrast to skin cancers in general, those occurring on the hand frequently have a worse prognosis, with a greater propensity for recurrence, metastatic spread, and functional deficit.

T2  - NATIVA
M3  - Article
AB  - The substitution of the Cerrado of Mato Grosso for agricultural practices and phenological dynamics alter the biophysical indexes of the surface such as surface temperature (Tsup) and leaf area index (LAI). Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the variation of LAI and Tsup by remote sensing in a Cerrado area in the state of Mato Grosso. The images of the Thematic Mapper (TM) Landsat 5 sensor were used to estimate the LAI and Tsup of an area of Cerrado (CE), sugarcane (CA), pasture (PA) and soybean (SJ) in 2011. The LAI and Tsup presented an inverse correlation. LAI declined and Tsup increased throughout the dry season. The higher LAI and lower Tsup were observed in the CE, while the lower LAI and higher Tsup were observed in SJ. The temporal and spatial patterns of LAI and Tsup in the study area were driven by precipitation, anthropogenic activities and by the phenological cycle of vegetation itself.

TI  - Variation and changes in land-use intensities behind nickel mining: Coupling operational and satellite data
T2  - RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
M3  - Article
AB  - Case studies of nickel mines in New Caledonia revealed significant differences among mining sites even though the mines host the same type of nickel laterite ore deposit and employ the same open-cut mining method. The intensity of land use change was evaluated as the area of land use change per unit of metal contained in extracted ores. Among the six mines studied, the lowest intensity of 0.00177 [m(2)/kg] is very close to the reference value of 0.0018 [m(2)/kg] provided by the nickel industry, whereas the highest-impact mine has an intensity approximately ten times greater, at 0.0191 [m(2)/kg]. This wide variation is attributed to the different operational stage of each mine. It means careful and continuous monitoring of such changes is necessary. We also evaluated historical changes in land use intensity, and found a decreasing trend, which may be the result of technological developments in the downstream sector. Our results show that the use of a single, representative intensity value can be misleading. Instead, it is necessary to analyze mine-specific changes. Historical data are also useful for analyzing the impacts of technological improvements over time. Both forms of analysis are feasible by coupling satellite imagery with operational data.

TI  - Analysis of South Atlantic Anomaly perturbations on Sentinel-3A Ultra Stable Oscillator. Impact on DORIS phase measurement and DORIS station positioning
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - DORIS measurements rely on the precise knowledge of the embedded oscillator which is called the Ultra Stable Oscillator (DORIS USO). The important radiations in the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) perturb the USO behavior by causing rapid frequency variations when the satellite is flying through the SAA. These variations are not taken into account in standard DORIS processing, since the USO is modelled as a third degree polynomial over 7-10 days. Therefore, there are systematic measurements errors when the satellite passes through SAA. In standard GNSS processing, the clock is directly estimated at each epoch.On Sentinel-3A, the GPS receiver and the DORIS receiver use the same USO. It is thus possible to estimate the behavior of the USO using GPS measurements. This estimated USO behavior can be used in the DORIS processing, instead of the third degree polynomial, hence allowing an estimation of the orbit sensitivity to these USO anomalies.This study shows two main results. First, the SAA effect on the DORIS USO is observed well using GPS measurements. Second, the USO behavior observed with GPS can be used to mitigate the SAA effect.Indeed, when used in Sentinel-3A processing, the resulting DORIS orbit shows improved phase measurements and station positioning for stations inside the SAA (Arequipa and Cachoeira). The phase measurements residuals are improved by up to 10 cm, and station vertical positioning (i.e. on the estimated Up component in the North-East-Up station frame) is improved by up to a few centimeters. However, the orbit itself is not sensitive to the correction because only two stations (out of almost 60) are SAA-sensitive on Sentinel-3A. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of COSPAR.

TI  - The Development of Near Real-Time Biomass and Cover Estimates for Adaptive Rangeland Management Using Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 Surface Reflectance Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rangelands are critical working landscapes and are the focus of considerable conservation planning efforts globally. A key conservation challenge in these landscapes is that high interannual variability in both climatic conditions and land use greatly limits the utility of outdated or static vegetation maps for management decision-making. One potential solution to this problem lies in remote sensing-derived information; however, prospective users must have continuous and timely access to vegetation products tailored to their needs. Google Earth Engine (GEE) can overcome the many storage, processing, and visualization barriers associated with creating ready-to-use remote sensing products for the public. While GEE provides a platform for building tools to analyze data and share results with users in near real-time for adaptive management, monitoring products need to (1) provide accurate and stable estimates over time and (2) align with management goals and the ecology of the rangeland system in question. Here, we assess estimates of vegetation cover and above-ground biomass at two dominant phenological time periods (summer/green and fall/brown), as modeled from the Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 Climatic Data Record (CDR) product. Using a best-subset regression modeling approach, we modeled vegetation cover and biomass, finding that the best predictors vary by season, corresponding to vegetation phenology. We also found that sensor-specific models decreased the relative differences between mapped cover and biomass estimates when comparing Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 scenes one day apart in the summer and fall. Ultimately, we developed an automated model selection process driven by sensor and vegetation greenness that can run in GEE to monitor and analyze vegetation amounts across the grazing season for adaptive management.

TI  - Time to Procedure, Nuclear Imaging and Clinicopathological Characteristics as Predictive Factors for Sentinel Lymph Node Metastasis in Cutaneous Melanoma: A Single-Center Analysis
T2  - ANNALS OF PLASTIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is a widely accepted staging procedure for cutaneous melanoma patients who are at risk of clinically occult nodal metastases. Numerous predictive factors for regional lymph node metastases have been identified; however, few have been found to be reproducibly significant. Also, the role of blue dye in identification was questioned in recent trials. Time to procedure was also found to be predictive of SLN positivity, but this was not confirmed in other studies. In our study, predictive factors for metastatic involvement of SLN were analyzed, together with the role of addition blue dye in imaging on detection rate and false-negative SLN rate. An impact of time interval to procedure on the rate of SLN positivity was also explored.Methods Data analysis was done in 362 cutaneous melanoma patients who underwent lymphoscintigraphy and SLN biopsy at our institution from 2010 to 2016, with a median follow-up of 29 months (1-98 months). To delineate the relation of each variable (demographical, time to procedure, and clinical and pathological variables, as well as the presence of in-transit nodes, the number of draining basins, and SLN localization on scintigraphy) with positive SLN status, we used univariate logistic regression with odds ratios representing effect size.Results Metastatic involvement SLN was found in 67 (18.8%) of 356 patients. Detection rate was similar with or without further intraoperative SLN identification with blue dye (98.8% vs 98.17%, P > 0.05). Time to procedure was not associated with higher SLN positivity rate (P > 0.05). In univariate analysis, Breslow thickness (P < 0.001), primary ulceration lesion (P = 0.001), and lymphovascular invasion (P = 0.006) were strongly correlated with SLN positivity, as well as the site of primary tumor (P = 0.024), tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) (P = 0.021), and sex (P = 0.026). In multivariate analysis, Breslow thickness and TILs were found to be significant independent predictors of SLN status (P < 0.05).Conclusions Addition of blue dye did not improve SLN detection rate; time to procedure was not found to be associated with higher SLN biopsy positivity rates. Breslow thickness and TILs, as a marker of immune response to tumor, were consistently found to be significant independent predictors of SLN status.

TI  - Agricultural Burning and Air Quality over Northern India: A Synergistic Analysis using NASA's A-train Satellite Data and Ground Measurements
T2  - AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 10th Asian Aerosol Conference (AAC)

AB  - In the recent years, New Delhi, the capital city of India, has ranked among the most polluted cities in the world regarding its air quality related to the submicron Particulate Matter (PM2.5). Using NASA's A-train satellite data (MODIS, OMI, and CALIOP), ground-level PM2.5 measured in New Delhi (2013-2016), and back-trajectory calculations, we show that the PM2.5 over New Delhi is strongly affected by the agricultural fires in the northwestern Indian states of Punjab and Haryana during the post-monsoon season (October and November). The mass concentration of PM2.5 escalates from similar to 50 mu g m(-3) measured prior to the onset of residue burning in early October to as high as 300 mu g m(-3) (24-hour averaged, 7day running mean) during the peak burning period in early November. A linear regression analysis reveals that the variations in PM2.5 over New Delhi can be attributed to the concurrent changes in the satellite retrievals of fire counts and aerosols over the crop burning area. The back-trajectory analysis shows that most clusters (> 80%) of the northwesterly flow near the ground intercepted the crop burning region before arriving at the receptor location in New Delhi; this further corroborates the transport patterns inferred from the satellite data. A 15-year long satellite record (2002-2016) reveals an increasing trend in agricultural fires (similar to 617 per year) and aerosol loading (0.031 and 0.04 per year in aerosol optical depth and UV aerosol index) in November. Increasing levels of crop residue burning and resulting particulate matter pollution at an alarming rate over northern India is a pressing concern demanding corrective measures to substantially reduce or completely diminish the crop burning through an effective residue management system.

TI  - A Promising Method of Typhoon Wave Retrieval from Gaofen-3 Synthetic Aperture Radar Image in VV-Polarization
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The motivation of this work is to explore the possibility of typhoon wave retrieval (the main parameter is significant wave height (SWH)) for C-band Gaofen (GF-3) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) with a wide swath coverage (>400 km). We aim to establish an analysis of a typhoon wave in the subresolution-scale (approximately 20 x 20 km(2)) on GF-3 SAR through SAR-measured parameters, including a normalized radar cross section (NRCS) and variance of the normalized SAR image (herein called cvar), which are the basic variables in an empirical wave retrieval algorithm and are independent of visible wave streaks. Several typhoons around the China Seas were captured by Chinese GF-3 SAR in 2017; e.g., Noru, Doksuri, Talim and Hato. The wave fields simulated from the third-generation numerical wave model WAVEWATCH-III (WW3) are collocated with these images. In general, the distribution patterns of the typhoon waves from the WW3 model are consistent with wave fields from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) at 0.125 degrees grids, indicating that the simulation results from the WW3 model are suitable for our study. In addition to winds retrieved from GF-3 SAR images in vertical-horizontal (VH) polarization, the characteristics of the typhoon wave on vertical-vertical (VV) polarization GF-3 SAR images are studied. It is found that SWH has a linear relationship with NRCS and cvar, however, SWH fluctuates with wind speed at all incidence angles. Based on the analyzed results, we simply tune two empirical wave retrieval algorithms for GF-3 SAR in typhoons. Although the correlation (COR) reaches 0.5 taking account into the NRCS term, a more accurate retrieval algorithm, including more related terms, is anticipated for further development for GF-3 SAR and validated through more typhoon images.

TI  - Earthquake/Tsunami Damage Level Mapping of Urban Areas Using Full Polarimetric SAR Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) data show good performance in near-real-time earthquake/tsunami damage assessment. In this paper, an improved damage level index for earthquake/tsunami damage level mapping of urban areas based on distance metric learning using full PolSAR data has been proposed. First, urban areas are extracted by our proposed classification method, which conjunctively uses multiresolution segmentation and support vector machine. Then, a double-bounce scattering power-based damage level index is adopted for damage level mapping. To solve the problem that the primary result does not match with the truth damage level in heavily damaged areas, distance metric learning method is introduced to calculate the Mahalanobis metric to compose an improved index. Extensive experimental comparison and analysis on L-band ALOS PALSAR data of Tohoku earthquake demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed index. Both the analysis about damage level assessment map and sample areas' linear fitting with truth damage level indicate the improved damage level index achieves high accuracy. The same analysis was applied to evaluate the damage induced in Kumamoto earthquake event. The analysis result verified the robustness of the proposed damage level index.

TI  - The geographical characteristics of Nansha Islands in the South China Sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - As is well-known, Nansha Islands in the South China Sea (SCS) are of important strategic position and invaluable ecological value. Therefore, many attentions are paid to either the political and legal aspects of exposed features that matter in the maritime delimitation, or the physical and geographical characteristics of coral reefs that are the predominant structures of these islands. However, it seems that they consistently lose the connection of sciences and humanities in the research of Nansha Islands in the SCS. In this study, we carry out a combinative research, based on remote sensing data using satellite imagery analysis together with historical materials using literature investigation, so as to reconsider to the geographical characteristics of Nansha Islands from a standpoint of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). After thoroughly appraising the statuses of these newly formed sand cays, several high tide features of Nansha Islands are identified. By means of the comparison of satellite images coupled with reference to nautical charting and sailing directions during different time periods, we can conclude that the statuses of these high tide features formed on reef platforms are relatively stable due to the growth of reef-building organisms although their migration patterns are subject to external disturbances, and hence the cursory judgment pursuant to the relevant provisions of the UNCLOS about whether a coral reef belongs to a low tide elevation only based on outdated references or ex parte evidences is not reliable. Moreover, it is accordingly justified to improve further development and perfection of the maritime legislation by eliminating such ambiguities with the growth of coral reefs and the evolution of sand cays being both taken into account.

TI  - Desertification in the south Junggar Basin, 2000-2009: Part I. Spatial analysis and indicator retrieval
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Desertification is a serious environmental problem that threatens ecological balance and society sustainability, and pursuit of efficient techniques for its monitoring is always highlighted. Compared to in-situ investigation, remote sensing (RS) has proved to be an efficient solution plan, particularly for large covers, whereas previous RS-based studies mostly focused on proposal and validation of various indicators for different scenarios. To comprehensively reflect desertification and project its trend, this study attempted to develop a new comprehensive RS information model, with the scenario for test deployed at the south Junggar Basin, China in the last decade (2000-2009). The premise of establishing such a model, however, is not simple, involving selection of RS images with appropriate spatial resolutions and uniform retrievals of indicators with high accuracies. To handle these fundamental problems, this Part I compared the merits and faults of MODIS and TM images in desertification characterization, by making spatial analyses including land cover patchand pixel-scale analyses and land attribute semi-variance and scale-agreement analyses. After the MODIS images with the resolution of 250 m were identified to be the appropriate choice, multiple representative indicators including NDVI, fraction of vegetation cover, land surface temperature, albedo and soil moisture that relate to different aspects of desertification processes were uniformly retrieved by using their individual effective algorithms and downscaling. Tests showed the spatial analyses did help in ensuring the premise of the whole study and the retrievals of indicators were reliable. The contributions are of fundamental implications for improving RS-based desertification analysis and have created a firm foundation for developing a RS information model in Part II. (C) 2017 COSPAR.

TI  - Glacier Change, Supraglacial Debris Expansion and Glacial Lake Evolution in the Gyirong River Basin, Central Himalayas, between 1988 and 2015
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Himalayan glacier changes in the context of global climate change have attracted worldwide attention due to their profound cryo-hydrological ramifications. However, an integrated understanding of the debris-free and debris-covered glacier evolution and its interaction with glacial lake is still lacking. Using one case study in the Gyirong River Basin located in the central Himalayas, this paper applied archival Landsat imagery and an automated mapping method to understand how glaciers and glacial lakes interactively evolved between 1988 and 2015. Our analyses identified 467 glaciers in 1988, containing 435 debris-free and 32 debris-covered glaciers, with a total area of 614.09 +/- 36.69 km(2). These glaciers decreased by 16.45% in area from 1988 to 2015, with an accelerated retreat rate after 1994. Debris-free glaciers retreated faster than debris-covered glaciers. As a result of glacial downwasting, supraglacial debris coverage expanded upward by 17.79 km2 (24.44%). Concurrent with glacial retreat, glacial lakes increased in both number (+41) and area (+54.11%). Glacier-connected lakes likely accelerated the glacial retreat via thermal energy transmission and contributed to over 15% of the area loss in their connected glaciers. On the other hand, significant glacial retreats led to disconnections from their proglacial lakes, which appeared to stabilize the lake areas. Continuous expansions in the lakes connected with debris-covered glaciers, therefore, need additional attention due to their potential outbursts. In comparison with precipitation variation, temperature increase was the primary driver of such glacier and glacial lake changes. In addition, debris coverage, size, altitude, and connectivity with glacial lakes also affected the degree of glacial changes and resulted in the spatial heterogeneity of glacial wastage across the Gyirong River Basin.

TI  - Characterizing Light Pollution Trends across Protected Areas in China Using Nighttime Light Remote Sensing Data
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Protected areas (PAs) with natural, ecological, and cultural value play important roles related to biological processes, biodiversity, and ecosystem services. Over the past four decades, the spatial range and intensity of light pollution in China has experienced an unprecedented increase. Few studies have been documented on the light pollution across PAs in China, especially in regions that provide a greater amount of important biodiversity conservation. Here, nighttime light satellite images from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) were selected to characterize light pollution trends across PAs using nighttime light indexes and hot spot analysis, and then the light pollution changes in PAs were classified. Furthermore, the causes of light pollution changes in PAs were determined using high-resolution satellite images and statistical data. The results showed the following: (1) Approximately 57.30% of PAs had an increasing trend from 1992 to 2012, and these PAs were mainly located in the eastern region, the central region, and a small part of the western region of China. Hot spot analysis showed that the patterns of change for the total night light and night light mean had spatial agglomeration characteristics; (2) The PAs affected by light pollution changes were divided into eight classes, of which PAs with stable trends accounted for 41%, and PAs with high increasing trends accounted for 10%. PAs that had high increasing trends with low density accounted for the smallest amount, i.e., only 1%; (3) The factors influencing light pollution changes in PAs included the distance to urban areas, mineral exploitation, and tourism development and the migration of residents. Finally, based on the status of light pollution encroachment into PAs, strategies to control light pollution and enhance the sustainable development of PAs are recommended.

TI  - Geo-Positioning Accuracy Improvement of Multi-Mode GF-3 Satellite SAR Imagery Based on Error Sources Analysis
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The GaoFen-3 (GF-3) satellite is the only synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite in the High-Resolution Earth Observation System Project, which is the first C-band full-polarization SAR satellite in China. In this paper, we proposed some error sources-based weight strategies to improve the geometric performance of multi-mode GF-3 satellite SAR images without using ground control points (GCPs). To get enough tie points, a robust SAR image registration method and the SAR-features from accelerated segment test (SAR-FAST) method is used to achieve the image registration and tie point extraction. Then, the original position of these tie points in object-space is calculated with the help of the space intersection method. With the dataset clustered by the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm, we undertake the block adjustment with a bias-compensated rational function model (RFM) aided to improve the geometric performance of these multi-mode GF-3 satellite SAR images. Different weight strategies are proposed to develop the normal equation matrix according to the error sources analysis of GF-3 satellite SAR images, and the preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) method is utilized to solve the normal equation. The experimental results indicate that our proposed method can improve the geometric positioning accuracy of GF-3 satellite SAR images within 2 pixels.

M3  - Article
AB  - Located within the Semi-Arid zone of Northwestern Nigeria, Sokoto Close-Settled Zone (SCSZ), has over the years been suffering from climate change and its associated socio-economic consequences. These negatively affects both the natural ecosystem and the livelihood of the inhabitant of the area. Using multi-temporal Landsat data and meteorological data such as rainfall and temperature records, as well as geospatial analyses such as Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), image differencing and simple statistical techniques, this research identified and assess differentmanifestations of climate change in the area. Implications of these on the livelihoods of the people in the area were also discussed. The result indicated an increasing trend in both minimum and maximum temperatures as well as a progressive decline in the rainfall pattern of the area over the last 10 years. Also, the area recorded over 40% loss of vegetation cover within the same period. The cumulative effects of the above scenarios, leads to decline in crop and livestock productivity, destruction of farmlands and grazing areas and increasing water scarcity, among others, all of which negatively affect the livelihood of the inhabitant of the area, leading to declining family income, food shortages, and in some extreme cases malnutrition and diseases. Mitigation and adaptation strategies including sustainable land and water management practices, ecosystem-based adaptations, afforestation, agroforestry, alternative sources of livelihood as well as civic and environmental education were also suggested.

TI  - <i>Planck</i>/SDSS cluster mass and gas scaling relations for a volume-complete redMaPPer sample
T2  - MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Using Planck satellite data, we construct Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) gas pressure profiles for a large, volume-complete sample of optically selected clusters. We have defined a sample of over 8000 redMaPPer clusters from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, within the volume-complete redshift region 0.100 < z < 0.325, for which we construct SZ effect maps by stacking Planck data over the full range of richness. Dividing the sample into richness bins we simultaneously solve for the mean cluster mass in each bin together with the corresponding radial pressure profile parameters, employing an Monte Carlo Markov Chain analysis. These profiles are well detected over a much wider range of cluster mass and radius than previous work, showing a clear trend towards larger break radius with increasing cluster mass. Our SZ-based masses fall similar to 16 per cent below the mass-richness relations from weak lensing, in a similar fashion as the 'hydrostatic bias' related with X-ray derived masses. Finally, we derive a tight Y-500 - M-500 relation over a wide range of cluster mass, with a power-law slope equal to 1.70 +/- 0.07, which agrees well with the independent slope obtained by the Planck team with an SZ-selected cluster sample, but extends to lower masses with higher precision.

AB  - The traditional method is used to deal with massive remote sensing data stored in low efficiency and poor scalability. This article presents a parallel processing method based on MapReduce and HBase. The filling of remote sensing images by the Hilbert curve makes the MapReduce method construct pyramids in parallel to reduce network communication between nodes. Then, the authors design a massive remote sensing data storage model composed of metadata storage model, index structure and filter column family. Finally, this article uses MapReduce frameworks to realize pyramid construction, storage and query of remote sensing data. The experimental results show that this method can effectively improve the speed of data writing and querying, and has good scalability.

TI  - Evaluation of Multiple Satellite-Based Soil Moisture Products over Continental US Based on In Situ Measurements
T2  - WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Measurements of soil water content are of great importance for climatic researches and hydrological applications. Satellite remote sensing techniques have provided convenient access to global soil moisture data at high temporal resolution. The evaluation of remotely sensed soil moisture products from multiple sensors are fundamental for understanding the quality and usefulness of the products and are helpful for the improvements of the retrieval algorithms. In this study, we evaluated four satellite-based soil moisture products against two in situ networks over continental U.S. These products are the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS), the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth observing system (AMSR-E), the Fengyun-3B/Microwave Radiation Imager (FY-3B/MWRI), and the Essential Climate Variable (ECV) soil moisture products. The evaluation results show that the temporal characteristics of ECV and SMOS soil moisture products are consistent with those of in situ measurements. Larger errors and bias exist in AMSR-E and FY-3B/MWRI over the study region. In general, the ECV product performs the best comparing with other products. Therefore, the ECV product is recommended in regional hydrological applications and water resource management over the continental U.S. for its good performance in absolute values and soil moisture anomalies.

TI  - Modern management of T1 rectal cancer by transanal endoscopic microsurgery: a 10-year single-centre experience
T2  - COLORECTAL DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim Minimally invasive, organ-sparing surgery has been used increasingly for early rectal cancer in recent years. However, local recurrence remains a concern. This study presents a 10-year single-centre experience of recurrence after local excision for T1 rectal cancer.Method Data were collected prospectively on all patients undergoing local excision by transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) in a single institution. Data covering a 10-year period were analysed.Results In all, 192 patients underwent TEM for rectal cancer; 70 of these had T1 tumour in the TEM specimen and did not have preoperative radiotherapy. Four were managed with completion surgery following TEM and a further six had radiotherapy; 60 underwent surveillance alone. Local recurrence occurred in six patients; three underwent salvage surgery. Estimated local recurrence at 3 years was 7.2% for the surveillance alone group.Conclusions Local recurrence rates were lower than previous studies. Better preoperative assessment, more effective local excision surgery and postoperative radiotherapy may be contributory factors to a better-thanpredicted outcome. Local excision should be offered as part of standard of care for T1 rectal cancer in the presence of good preoperative selection and meticulous surveillance.

TI  - Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis of 36 blood group alleles among 396 Thai samples reveals region-specific variants
T2  - TRANSFUSION
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUNDBlood group phenotype variation has been attributed to potential resistance to pathogen invasion. Variation was mapped in blood donors from Lampang (northern region) and Saraburi (central region), Thailand, where malaria is endemic. The previously unknown blood group allele profiles were characterized and the data were correlated with phenotypes. The high incidence of the Vel-negative phenotype previously reported in Thais was investigated.STUDY DESIGN AND METHODSDNA from 396 blood donors was analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Outliers were investigated by serology and DNA sequencing. Allele discrimination assays for SMIM1 rs1175550A/G and ACKR1 rs118062001C/T were performed and correlated with antigen expression.RESULTSAll samples were phenotyped for Rh, MNS, and K. Genotyping/phenotyping for RhD, K, and S/s showed 100% concordance. Investigation of three RHCE outliers revealed an e-variant antigen encoded by RHCE*02.22. Screening for rs147357308 (RHCE c.667T) revealed a frequency of 3.3%. MN typing discrepancies in 41 samples revealed glycophorin variants, of which 40 of 41 were due to Mi(a). Nine samples (2.3%) were heterozygous for FY*01W.01 (c.265C>T), and six samples (1.5%) were heterozygous for JK*02N.01. All samples were wildtype SMIM1 homozygotes with 97% homozygosity for rs1175550A.CONCLUSIONSMatrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry is an efficient method for rapid routine genotyping and investigation of outliers identified novel variation among our samples. The expected high prevalence of the Mi(a+) phenotype was observed from both regions. Of potential clinical relevance in a region where transfusion-dependent thalassemia is common, we identified two RHCE*02 alleles known to encode an e-variant antigen.

TI  - Warm spells on the East African plateau and impacts in the White Nile basin
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyzes warm spells in the dry season over the East African plateau. Lake levels were observed to decline in the period July 2004 to January 2007. The warmest spell was identified using maximum temperature and satellite outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) observations averaged over Uganda: 20-22 Feb 2005. Meteorological conditions in that case were dominated by a surge of the NE monsoon from the Arabian Sea toward East Africa. Subsiding air induced daytime land surface temperatures > 55 A degrees C. Dry easterly winds swept across Uganda, and the vegetation fraction dropped > 10% in 1 month. At the seasonal scale, the NE monsoon intensity over the Arabian Sea correlated with indices of desiccation over the White Nile basin. In the annual cycle, sensible heat flux follows potential evaporation, reaching -4.5 mm/day in February. Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) model projections favor a long-term weakening of the NE monsoon and a northward migration of the equatorial trough over the west Indian Ocean in Dec-Mar season. Although maximum temperatures are projected to rise +2 A degrees C by the end of the 21st century, the length of the dry season could shrink, thus maintaining the water balance near current levels.

TI  - MODELING PINUS ELLIOTTII GROWTH WITH MULTITEMPORAL LANDSAT DATA: A STUDY CASE IN SOUTHERN BRAZIL
T2  - BOLETIM DE CIENCIAS GEODESICAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data are a key proxy to forest monitoring and management at local, regional and global scales. Considering the hypothesis that NDVI and EVI can be used at least during one decade to monitor Pinus elliottii in Southern Brazil, the objective of this study was to identify saturation time after planting of these vegetation indices in a Pinus elliottii plantation and the most suitable index by adjusting theoretical functions to each one of them. Based on Landsat Surface Reflectance Higher-Level Data Products, 32 scenes were selected between 1984 to 2015. A set of theoretical polynomial, gaussian and logistic mathematical functions were applied to fit the experimental data on vegetation indices. The determination coefficient (R-2) and RMSE at 95% probability were also used. Finally, EVI efficiency was tested by changing the L parameter. The logistic model was the one that best explained the data resulting from NDVI and EVI over time. NDVI was more effective than EVI for this forest monitoring, identifying the forest growth pattern until its 18 years of age. EVI may have been saturated after 14 years and the L factor may be set to near to zero to achieve a higher coefficient of determination.

TI  - Assessment of freely available DSMs for automatic karst feature detection
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this work is to present the detection and qualification of natural karst depressions in southern Ksiromero, SW Aitoloakarnania Prefecture, Western Greece, by the use of freely available digital surface model (DSM) data in line with the geographical information systems-GIS. The study area is a part of the Ionian geotectonic zone whose geological background consists of the Triassic evaporates and Triassic carbonate breccias. The after-Triassic carbonate series, which consist of the Jurassic limestones, the Cretaceous limestones and the Eocene limestones, are also presented in the study area. Several DSMs such as ASTER GDEM, SRTM DEM, ALOS Global DSM, and a DSM generated from Sentinel-1 data were evaluated so as to be used for the automatic karst detection. Furthermore, a karst detection procedure applied on DSMs was performed with the aid of analogue and digital air photos. Additionally, the aforementioned procedure was applied also on DEM with the aid of digitized contours referring to topographic maps characterized by a scale of 1/50,000. All the detected features have been also validated via in situ observations. Finally, all DSMs presented herein are characterized by similar percentage of success in terms of automatic karst detection, regardless their spatial resolution and height accuracy. Their rate varies from 66 to 73%.

TI  - Modified Wiener Filter for Restoring Landsat Images in Remote Sensing Applications
T2  - PERTANIKA JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Images are inherently affected by different noises such as, speckle, salt and pepper, Gaussian, poisson, and white noise during its acquisition or transmission, hence, their true intensities cannot be reflected from the pixel values of an image. The main focus of this work is on designing a filtering method that preserves the edges of an image while removing the noise. The modified wiener filter is proposed to denoise satellite images. A detailed study on different noises and the filtering techniques, such as mean, median, wiener, Gaussian filter and the proposed modified wiener filter is done. The performance of these filtering methods is assessed by the image quality metrics, such as mean squared error, peak signal to noise ratio, and correlation coefficient. The results show the choice of a filter for denoising depends on the type of noise present in the image. The proposed modified wiener filter performs relatively well for most of the noise models compared with the existing linear and non-linear filtering methods. This technique can be widely used during the pre-processing of satellite images in remote sensing applications.

TI  - Estimation of Forest Crown Density Using Pleiades Satellite Data and Nonparametric Classification Method
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Zagros forests in western Iran are a crucial source of environmental services, but are severely threatened by climatic and anthropological constraints. One crucial forest parameter is the amount of canopy coverage which enables an indirect assessment of aboveground biomass and, in turn, the carbon emission and sequestration. The aim of this study is estimation of forest crown density using Pleiades satellite data and three non-parametric classification include random forest (RF), boosted regression tree (BRT) and classification and regression tree (CART) in Kaka Reza of Lorestan province, western Iran. For this purpose, we then ensured the accuracy of geometric images, creating the necessary processing such as vegetation indices, principal component analysis and texture analysis was performed on the original bands using a random-systematic sampling design, 96 sample plots were taken. Results showed that RF compared to the two other algorithms with overall accuracy of 75% and kappa coefficient of 0.73 could better classify the forest crown density, while the CART method had the lowest accuracy with overall accuracy of 71% and kappa coefficient of 0.68. Also results showed BRT had overall accuracy of 71% and kappa coefficient of 0.68. Overall results showed Pleiades satellite data and non-parametric classification method had high capability for separation crown density in Zagros region.

TI  - Reconstruction of MODIS Land Surface Temperature Products Based on Multi-Temporal Information
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) products derived from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor are one of the most important data sources used to research land surface energy and water balance at regional and global scales. However, MODIS data are severely contaminated by cloud cover, which limits the applications of LST products. In this paper, based on the spatio-temporal autocorrelation of land surface variables, a reconstruction algorithm depending on the correlations between spatial pixels in multiple time phases from available MODIS LST data is developed to reconstruct clear-sky LST values for missing pixels. Considering the impacts of correlation and bias between predictors and reconstructed data on the modeling error, the known data in the reconstructed time phase are combined with the data temporally nearest to them as predictor variables to establish their temporal relationships with the reconstructed data. The reconstructed results are validated by a series of evaluation indices. The average correlation coefficient between the reconstructed results and ground-based observations is 0.87, showing high temporal change accuracy. The difference in Moran's I, representing spatial structure characteristics between the known and reconstructed data, is 0.03 on average, indicating a slight loss of spatial accuracy. The average reconstruction rate is approximately 87.0%. The modeling error, as part of the reconstruction error, is only 1.40 K on average and accounts for 5.0% of the total error. If the product and modeling errors are removed, the residual error represents approximately 3.5 K and 5.6 K of the annual mean difference between the cloudy and cloudless LST at night and during the day, respectively. In addition, different reconstruction cases are demonstrated using various predictor data, including many combinations of multi-temporal MODIS LST data, the microwave brightness temperature, and the combination of the normalized difference vegetation index and terrain data. Comparisons among cases show that the known MODIS LST data are more reliable as predictor variables and that the data combination advocated in this paper is optimal.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ANTIMICROBIAL CHEMOTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Relebactam is an inhibitor of class A beta-lactamases, including KPC beta-lactamases, and class C b-lactamases, and is currently under clinical development in combination with imipenem. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the in vitro activity of imipenem/relebactam against Gram-negative ESKAPE pathogens (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter spp.) submitted by clinical laboratories in 17 European countries to the Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART) global surveillance programmein 2015.Methods: MICs were determined using the CLSI standard broth microdilution method and interpreted using EUCAST clinical breakpoints. Relebactam was tested at a fixed concentration of 4 mg/L in combination with doubling dilutions of imipenem. Imipenem/relebactam MICs were interpreted using breakpoints for imipenem.Results: Rates of susceptibility to imipenem and imipenem/relebactam for isolates of P. aeruginosa (n" 1705), K. pneumoniae (n = 1591) and Enterobacter spp. (n = 772) were 72.0/94.7%, 88.7/94.8% and 95.6/96.8%, respectively. Relebactam restored imipenem susceptibility to 81.1%, 54.2% and 26.5% of imipenem-nonsusceptible isolates of P. aeruginosa (n = 477), K. pneumoniae (n = 179) and Enterobacter spp. (n = 34). Most imipenem/relebactam-non-susceptible isolates carried MBLs, OXA-48 or GES carbapenemases. Relebactam did not increase the number of isolates of A. baumannii (n = 486) susceptible to imipenem.Conclusions: Relebactam restored susceptibility to imipenemfor the majority of imipenem-non-susceptible isolates of P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae tested as well as some isolates of imipenem-non-susceptible Enterobacter spp. Based on our results, imipenem/relebactam appears to be a promising therapeutic option for treating patients with infections caused by antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative bacilli.

AB  - Reliable and current availability of land cover knowledge are essential for many studies regarding planning, management, monitoring and updating activities. The optical satellite sensor data has been utilized for the classification of land use/land cover. In this study, the capability of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometric coherence is practiced for land cover classification in Okara, Pakistan using Sentinel-1A imagery. Two Single Look Complex (SLC) product of months April and May 2016 were used and processed to create backscatter and interferometric coherence layers. From backscatter layers of each month, the mean backscatter and backscatter difference layer were obtained. False color composite (FCC) were developed comprising mean backscatter, backscatter difference and coherence, and performed supervised classification using maximum likelihood method to generate land cover classes i.e. water, barren, vegetation and built-up. Kappa statistics were employed for accuracy assessment of the output map. Results showed the good potential of Sentinel-1C-band for land cover classification having 0.69 Kappa coefficient and 80% overall accuracy. This study investigated the potential of C-band backscatter coefficients and coherence map for land cover discrimination. Coherence proved to be efficient in the examination of vegetative and non-vegetative areas. (C) 2017 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Potential of Space-Borne PolInSAR for Forest Canopy Height Estimation Over India-A Case Study Using Fully Polarimetric <i>L</i>-, <i>C</i>-, and <i>X</i>-Band SAR Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper aims to demonstrate the potential of space-borne datasets for forest height estimation over Indian tropical forests. Fully polarimetric space-borne SAR interferometry (PolInSAR) data is acquired at the L-, C-, and X-band frequencies. The X-band data are acquired in two modes-single pass and repeat pass. The datasets are compensated for decorrelation due to SNR and varying spatial baselines. The remaining major decorrelation is the volumetric decorrelation, which is modeled using random volume over ground model to estimate the PolInSAR height for all the three frequencies. The modified Three-stage inversion algorithm is utilized for forest stand height estimation. The effect of forest biomass on height inversion accuracy is assessed. Furthermore, a first-order estimate of the absolute temporal decorrelation is demonstrated for the repeat-pass space-borne PolInSAR datasets. Extensive field validation campaigns are carried out in the tropical forest ranges. The forest height is inverted using data at all the three frequencies and validated with field measured values. The zero-temporal baseline bistatic TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X and the L-band ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 result in a good height inversion with r(2) and RMSE of 0.77 and 1.86 m (X-band) and 0.75 and 1.94 m (L-band), respectively. Furthermore, a comparison of estimated height of ALOS-2/PALSAR-2, TerraSAR-X, and RadarSAT-2 has been done with respect to the estimated height of TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X. It is observed that RMSEof height inversion with respect to TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X height is found to be 5.4 m, 7.6 m, and 12.8mfor ALOS-2/PALSAR2, RadarSAT-2, and TerraSAR-X, respectively.

TI  - Trends in LST over the peninsular Spain as derived from the AVHRR imagery data
T2  - GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyzes the spatio-temporal variability and trends of land surface temperature (LST) over peninsular Spain, considering all the available historical satellite imagery data from the NOAA-AVHRR product from July 1981 to June 2015 and explores whether changes in IST are related to the observed changes in air temperature, solar radiation and land cover. We found that LST showed a significant increase between 1982 and 2014, with an average increase on the order of 0.71 degrees C decade(-1), being stronger during summertime (1.53 C decade(-1)). The results also indicate a strong spatial coherence between LST and NDVI changes. The areas that experienced an increase in the LST were spatially consistent with those areas with no changes or even a dominant decrease in vegetation coverage. In addition, the strong increase of LST is coherent with observations of the recent radiative forcing affecting Spain, particularly during summertime. The confidence of the obtained 1ST trends during summer is also reinforced by the spatial differences recorded in trends, in addition to the differences found between land cover types. Specifically, the magnitude of this increase was much higher in the dryland nonpermanent agricultural areas, which are usually harvested during summer, when soil is dominantly nude. In contrast, in well-developed forests, the magnitude of LST was much lower. Our results on the observed LST trends and their spatial patterns can contribute to better understanding of the recent eco-hydrological processes in peninsular Spain.

TI  - Mapping Oil Spills from Dual-Polarized SAR Images Using an Artificial Neural Network: Application to Oil Spill in the Kerch Strait in November 2007
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has been widely used to detect oil-spill areas through the backscattering intensity difference between oil and background pixels. However, since the signal is similar to that produced by other phenomena, positive identification can be challenging. In this study we developed an algorithm to effectively analyze large-scale oil spill areas in SAR images by focusing on optimizing the input layer to artificial neural network (ANN) through removal the factor of lowering the accuracy. An ANN algorithm was used to generate probability maps of oil spills. Highly accurate pixel-based data processing was conducted through false or un-detection element reduction by normalizing the image or applying a non-local (NL) means filter and median filter to the input neurons for ANN. In addition, the standard deviation of co-polarized phase difference (CPD) was used to reduce false detection from the look-alike with weak damping effect. The algorithm was validated using TerraSAR-X images of an oil spill caused by stranded oil tanker Volganefti-139 in the Kerch Strait in 2007. According to the validation results of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the oil spill was detected with an accuracy of about 95.19% and un-detection or false detection by look-alike and speckle noise was greatly reduced.

TI  - Structural Equation Model for Burn Severity with Topographic Variables and Susceptible Forest Cover
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to its significant roles in post-fire responses of forest ecosystem, numerous studies have been investigating factors affecting burn severity. In the broad sense, topography, fuels, and fire weather, known as the forest fire triangle, determine the degree of burn severity. Most previous studies have adopted ordinary least squares (OLS) methods to investigate these factors, which have proven effective for capturing the direct and linear effects of those variables on burn severity. However, they oversimplify the relationships among variables and have limitations in explaining the complex effects of the variables. One way to overcome this limitation is the structural equation model (SEM) method. SEM can decompose effects of a variable into direct effects and indirect (i.e., acting through other variables) effects. The goal of this study is to capture a systematic structure, explaining how topographic characteristics including slope, elevation, topographic wetness index (TWI), solar radiation index (SRI), and susceptible forest cover type (i.e., Japanese red pine) affect burn severity. We built a hypothetical SEM and estimated the model in AMOS. The results strongly suggest that the effects of topographic characteristics are far more complex than those suggested by the OLS analyses in previous studies. Specifically, elevation and TWI had direct and indirect negative effects on burn severity, while slope and SRI had only an indirect positive effect, which was not captured in the linear regression model. Nonetheless, the percentage of red pine showed the strongest positive effect on burn severity (i.e., increasing burn severity). The results of this study and those of previous studies reinforce the importance of controlling susceptible forest cover through forest management and silviculture.

TI  - Preoperative Axillary US in Early-Stage Breast Cancer: Potential to Prevent Unnecessary Axillary Lymph Node Dissection
T2  - RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the value of preoperative axillary ultrasonography (US) for preventing unnecessary axillary lymph node dissection after sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy in a large series of patients with early-stage breast cancers treated with both breast-onserving surgery and SLN biopsy.Materials and Methods: From March 2009 to February 2013, 1802 patients who underwent breast-conserving surgery for clinical T1-2/N0 cancers and SLN biopsy with or without axillary lymph node dissection were included. Preoperative axillary US results and clinical-pathologic variables were compared according to the status of non-SLN metastasis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to find factors associated with non-SLN metastasis.Results: Of 1802 patients, 397 (22.0%) underwent axillary lymph node dissection due to positive SLN biopsy and 76 (4.2%) had non-SLN metastasis at final histopathologic examination. Patients with non-SLN metastasis were younger and showed positive axilla at US and clinical T2 stage more frequently (P<05). At multivariate analysis, positive axilla at US (P=.001), clinical T2 stage (P=.005), and lymphovascular invasion (P<.001) were significantly associated with non-SLN metastasis. Among 1284 patients with negative axilla at US and clinical T1 stage cancer, 1254 (97.7%) did not have non-SLN metastasis and 30 (2.3%) had non-SLN metastasis.Conclusion: Preoperative axillary US results and clinical T stage are associated with the status of non-SLN metastasis in patients with early breast cancer. The results of this study suggest that preoperative axillary US can help select patients at minimal risk of non-SLN metastasis, for whom axillary lymph node dissection can be omitted. (c) RSNA, 2018

TI  - Quantifying the effects of freeze-thaw transitions and snowpack melt on land surface albedo and energy exchange over Alaska and Western Canada
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Variations in land surface albedo and snow-cover strongly impact the global biosphere, particularly through the snow-albedo feedback on climate. The seasonal freeze-thaw (FT) transition is coupled with snowpack melt dynamics and strongly impacts surface water mobility and the energy budget in the northern (>45 degrees N) arctic and boreal region (ABR). However, understanding of the regional variation in snowmelt and its effect on the surface energy budget are limited due to sparse in situ measurements of these processes and environmental constraints on effective monitoring within the ABR. In this study, we combined synergistic observations from overlapping satellite optical-infrared and microwave sensor records to quantify the regional patterns and seasonal progression in wet snow conditions during the spring snowmelt and autumn snow accumulation periods across Alaska and western Canada. The integrated satellite record included daily landscape FT status from AMSR microwave brightness temperature retrievals; and snow-cover extent, black sky albedo and net shortwave solar radiation (R(sne)t) derived from MODIS and AVHRR observations. The integrated satellite records were analyzed with in situ surface air temperature and humidity observations from regional weather stations over a two-year study period (2015-2016) overlapping with the NASA ABoVE (Arctic Boreal Vulnerability Experiment). Our results show a large (79%) mean decline in land surface albedo between dry snow and snow-free conditions during the spring (March-June) and autumn (August-November) transition periods. Onset of diurnal thawing and refreezing of the surface snow layer and associated wet snow conditions in spring contributed to an approximate 25% decrease in snow cover albedo that extended over a seven to 21 week snowpack depletion period. The lower wet snow albedo enhances Rsnet by approximately 74% (9-10MJm(-2) d(-1)) relative to dry snow conditions, reinforcing snowmelt and surface warming, and contributing to growing season onset and activation of biological and hydrological processes in the ABR. These results contribute to better understanding of snow albedo feedbacks to Arctic amplification, and the representation of these processes in global Earth system models.

TI  - Cloud Area Distributions of Shallow Cumuli: A New Method for Ground-Based Images
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - We develop a new approach that resolves cloud area distributions of single-layer shallow cumuli from ground-based observations. Our simple and computationally inexpensive approach uses images obtained from a Total Sky Imager (TSI) and complementary information on cloud base height provided by lidar measurements to estimate cloud equivalent diameter (CED) over a wide range of cloud sizes (about 0.01-3.5 km) with high temporal resolution (30 s). We illustrate the feasibility of our approach by comparing the estimated CEDs with those derived from collocated and coincident high-resolution (0.03 km) Landsat cloud masks with different spatial and temporal patterns of cloud cover collected over the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Southern Great Plains (SGP) site. We demonstrate that (1) good (similar to 7%) agreement between TSI and Landsat characteristic cloud size can be obtained for clouds that fall within the region of the sky observable by the TSI and (2) large clouds that extend beyond this region are responsible for noticeable (similar to 16%) underestimation of the TSI characteristic cloud size. Our approach provides a previously unavailable dataset for process studies in the convective boundary layer and evaluation of shallow cumuli in cloud-resolving models.

TI  - Automatic citrus tree extraction from UAV images and digital surface models using circular Hough transform
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tree counts and sizes are important information to apply to crop yield estimation and agricultural planning. Therefore, obtaining automatic extraction of trees, their locations, diameters, and counts from remotely sensed data is a challenging task. In this study, a novel approach is proposed for the automatic extraction of citrus trees using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) multispectral images (MSIs) and digital surface models (DSMs). The tree boundaries were extracted by using sequential thresholding, Canny edge detection and circular Hough transform algorithms. The performance of the developed approach was assessed on three test areas that include different characteristics with regard to tree counts, diameters, densities and background covers. The proposed tree extraction procedure was applied to DSM that were generated from UAV images (Data Set 1), UAV MSIs (Data Set 2) and both of them together (Data Set 3). The accuracies of the obtained results were assessed using three different techniques that evaluate the tree extraction results according to the counts, areas and locations. The obtained results indicate the success of the developed approach with delineation accuracies that exceeded 80% for each test area using each data set. The most accurate results were obtained when Data Set 1 was used. Although Data Set 2 provides the lowest accuracies when compared with other data sets, the delineation accuracies are still high and can be used especially for counting trees and detecting tree locations.

TI  - Improvement in recruitment of Japanese sardine with delays of the spring phytoplankton bloom in the Sea of Japan
T2  - FISHERIES OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - To evaluate the impact of temporal variation of primary productivity on the recruitment of Japanese sardine (Sardinops melanostictus) in the Sea of Japan, the phenology of sea surface phytoplankton abundance was estimated from 8day multiple satellite (SeaWiFS, MODIS-Aqua, MERIS, and VIIRS) derived sea surface chlorophyll (SSChl) a concentrations from January 1998 to December 2015. Because relationships between SSChl a and insitu chlorophyll a concentrations were significantly different among periods based on the satellite combinations used, maximum and minimum SSChl a concentrations of 1year were relativized as 1 and 0, respectively. Spatio-temporal variation of relativized SSChl a concentrations was determined by using empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis. Scores in the first EOF mode denoted the basin-scale variations of SSChl a concentrations in the Sea of Japan, and the major peak from the end of February to the end of May displayed the spring bloom. The logarithm of recruitment per spawner (LNRPS) for sardine was positively affected by delays in the start and end dates of the spring phytoplankton bloom. The delay of the date of the lowest sea surface temperature contributed to the delay of the end of the spring bloom during the period 1998-2015 and elevated the LNRPS during the period 1982-2015. Sardine spawns in the southern Sea of Japan from April to May, hence, delays of the spring bloom prolonged its overlap with sardine larval periods, and thus improved the recruitment of Japanese sardine in the Sea of Japan.

TI  - Parks protect forest cover in a tropical biodiversity hotspot, but high human population densities can limit success
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Maintaining forest cover is important for Biodiversity Hotspots that support many endangered and endemic species but have lost much of their original forest extent. In developing countries, ongoing economic and demographic growth within Hotspots can alter rates and patterns of deforestation, making it a concern to quantify rates of forest loss and assess landscape-scale correlates of deforestation within Hotspots. Such analyses can help set baselines for future monitoring and provide landscape-scale perspectives to design conservation policy. For the Western Ghats Biodiversity Hotspot in India, we examined correlates of forest loss following rapid economic expansion (post-2000 CE). First, we used open-source remote-sensing data to estimate annual trends in recent forest loss (from 2000 to 2016) for the entire Hotspot. Across the entire Western Ghats, we assessed the relative importance of and interactions among demographic, administrative, and biophysical factors that predicted rates of forest loss measured as the number of 30 x 30-m pixels of forest lost within randomly selected 1 km(2) cells. Protected areas reduced forest loss by 30%, especially when forests were closer to roads (33%) and towns (36%). However, the advantage of protection declined by 32% when local population densities increased, implying that the difference in forest loss between protected and non-protected areas disappears at high local population densities. To check scale-dependency of spatial extent, we repeated the modelling process for two landscape subsets within Western Ghats. In contrast with results for the entire Western Ghats, both focal landscapes showed no difference in deforestation with protection status alone or its interactions with village population density and distance to towns. However, deforestation was 88% lower when forests were protected and farther from roads. Overall, our results indicate that protected areas help retain forest cover within a global Biodiversity Hotspot even with rapid development, but high human population densities and road development can reduce the benefits of protection.

TI  - DETERMINING RAPTOR SPECIES AND TISSUE SENSITIVITY FOR IMPROVED WEST NILE VIRUS SURVEILLANCE
T2  - JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Raptors are a target sentinel species for West Nile virus (WNV) because many are susceptible to WNV disease, they are easily sighted because of their large size, and they often occupy territories near human settlements. Sick and dead raptors accumulate at raptor and wildlife rehabilitation clinics. However, investigations into species selection and specimen type for efficient detection of WNV are lacking. Accordingly, we evaluated dead raptors from north-central Colorado, US and southeast Wyoming, US over a 4-yr period. Nonvascular mature feathers ("quill''), vascular immature feathers ("pulp''), oropharyngeal swabs, cloacal swabs, and kidney samples were collected from raptor carcasses at the Rocky Mountain Raptor Program in Colorado from 2013 through 2016. We tested the samples using real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR. We found that 11% (53/482) of raptor carcasses tested positive for WNV infection. We consistently detected positive specimens during a 12-wk span between the second week of July and the third week of September across all years of the study. We detected WNV RNA most frequently in vascular feather pulp from Cooper's Hawk (Accipiter cooperii). North American avian mortality surveillance for WNV using raptors can obviate necropsies by selecting Cooper's Hawk and Red-tailed Hawk (Buteo jamaicensis) as sentinels and targeting feather pulp as a substrate for viral detection.

TI  - Lithologic mapping using Random Forests applied to geophysical and remote-sensing data: A demonstration study from the Eastern Goldfields of Australia
T2  - GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Eastern Goldfields of Western Australia is one of the world's premier gold-producing regions; however, large areas of prospective bedrock are under cover and lack detailed lithologic mapping. Away from the near-mine environment, exploration for new gold prospects requires mapping geology using the limited data available with robust estimates of uncertainty. We used the machine learning algorithm Random Forests (RF) to classify the lithology of an underexplored area adjacent to the historically significant Junction gold mine, using geophysical and remotesensing data, with no geochemical sampling available at this reconnaissance stage. Using a sparse training sample, 1.6% of the total ground area, we produce a refined lithologic map. The classification is stable, despite including parts of the study area with later intrusions and variable cover depth, and it preserves the stratigraphic units defined in the training data. We assess the uncertainty associated with this new RF classification using information entropy, identifying those areas of the refined map that are most likely to be incorrectly classified. We find that information entropy correlates well with inaccuracy, providing a mechanism for explorers to direct future expenditure toward areas most likely to be incorrectly mapped or geologically complex. We conclude that the method can be an effective additional tool available to geoscientists in a greenfield, orogenic gold setting when confronted with limited data. We determine that the method could be used either to substantially improve an existing map, or produce a new map, taking sparse observations as a starting point. It can be implemented in similar situations (with limited outcrop information and no geochemical data) as an objective, data-driven alternative to conventional interpretation with the additional value of quantifying uncertainty.

TI  - Tropospheric ozone enhancement during post-harvest crop-residue fires at two downwind sites of the Indo-Gangetic Plain
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study, surface ozone (O-3), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and carbon monoxide (CO) levels were measured at two sites downwind of fire active region in the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP): Agra (27.16 degrees N, 78.08 degrees E) and Delhi (28.37 degrees N, 77.12 degrees E) to study the impact of post-harvest crop-residue fires. The study period was classified into two groups: Pre-harvest period and Post-harvest period. During the post-harvest period, an enhancement of 17.3 and 31.7 ppb in hourly averaged O-3 mixing ratios was observed at Agra and Delhi, respectively, under similar meteorological conditions. The rate of change of O-3 was also higher in the post-harvest period by 56.2% in Agra and 39.5% in Delhi. Relatively higher O-3 episodic days were observed in the post-harvest period. Fire hotspots detected by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) along with backward air-mass trajectory analysis suggested that the enhanced O-3 and CO levels at the study sites during the post-harvest period could be attributed to crop-residue burning over the North-West IGP (NW-IGP). Satellite observations of surface CO mixing ratios and tropospheric formaldehyde (HCHO) column also showed higher levels during the post-harvest period.

TI  - Remotely sensed ET for streamflow modelling in catchments with contrasting flow characteristics: an attempt to improve efficiency
T2  - STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - An efficient calibration with remotely sensed (RS) data is important for accurate predictions at ungauged catchments. This study investigates the advantages of streamflow-sensitive regionalization on calibration with RS evapotranspiration (ET). Regionalization experiments are performed at 28 catchments in Australia. The catchments are classified into three groups based on annual rainfall and runoff coefficients. Streamflow, RS ET, and a multi-objective RS ET-streamflow calibration are performed using the DiffeRential Evolution Adaptive Metropolis algorithm in each catchment. Simplified Australian Water Resource Assessment-Landscape model is calibrated for a selection of five parameters. Posterior probability distributions of parameters from three calibrations performed at donor catchments in each group are inspected to find the parameter for regionalization in the individual group. In group 1 of wetter catchments, regionalization of parameter FsoilEmax (soil evaporation scaling factor) helps to simplify the calibration without any deterioration in ET, soil moisture (SM) and streamflow predictions. Regionalization of parameter Beta (coefficient describing rate of hydraulic conductivity increase with water content) in group 2 assists to improve the streamflow predictions with no decrement in ET and SM predictions. However, regionalization is not able to provide satisfactory results in group 3. Group 3 includes low-yielding catchments, with average annual rainfall below 1000 mm/year and runoff coefficient less than 0.1, where traditional streamflow calibration also fails to produce accurate results. This study concludes that streamflow-sensitive regionalization is effective for improving the efficacy of RS ET calibration in wetter catchments.

AB  - Standard chlorophyll-a (chl-a) algorithms, which rely on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) data aboard the Aqua satellite, usually show different performances depending on the area under consideration. In this paper, we assessed their accuracy in retrieving the chl-a concentration in the Basilicata Ionian Coastal waters (Ionian Sea, South of Italy). The outputs of one empirical (Med-OC3) and two semi-analytical algorithms, the Garver-Siegel-Maritorena (GSM) and the Generalized Inherent Optical Properties (GIOP) model, have been compared with ground measurements acquired during three different measurement campaigns. The achieved results prove the poor accuracy (adjusted R-2 value of 0.12) of the investigated empirical algorithm and, conversely, the good performance of semi-analytical algorithms (adjusted R-2 ranging from 0.74 to 0.79). The co-existence of Coloured Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM) and Non-Algal Particles (NAP) has likely determined large errors in the reflectance ratios used in the OCx form algorithms. Finally, a local scale assessment of the bio-optical properties, on the basis of the in situ dataset, allowed for the definition of an operational local scale-tuned version of the MODIS chl-a algorithm, which assured increased accuracy (adjusted R-2 value of 0.86). Such a tuned algorithm version can provide useful information which can be used by local authorities within regional management systems.

TI  - Technique for single axillary incision robotic assisted quadrantectomy and immediate partial breast reconstruction with robotic latissimus dorsi flap harvest for breast cancer A case report
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rationale: The clinical application of robotic surgery in breast conserving surgery or volume replacement with robotic latissimus dorsi flap harvest (RLDFH) has been rarely reported. In this study, we report the preliminary experience and clinical outcome of robotic assisted quadrantectomy (RAQ) and immediate partial breast reconstruction (IPBR) with RLDFH.Patient concern: Decreasing and avoid back scar length after latissimus dorsi flap harvest.Diagnoses: One 28 years old female with left breast cancer underwent RAQ and IPBR with RLDFH. Initially, she was diagnosed with left breast infiltrating carcinoma that was clinical stage T3N1M0 and triple negative.Interventions: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy consisting of 4 cycles of epirubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by 4 cycles of docetaxel was performed. Breast magnetic resonance imaging showed residual breast cancer about 4.5 cm over the left upper outer quadrant of the breast. Sentinel lymph node biopsy showed no lymph node metastasis. RAQ, which took 82 minutes, was performed first, and the resected breast specimen's weight was 203 gm. She received IPBR with RLDFH, which took 97 minutes.Outcomes: The overall blood loss was 40 mL. The final pathology result was ypT2 (4.2 cm)N0 (sn0/3)M0 and stage IIA. The resection margin was free of tumors. The post-operative recovery was smooth except for seroma formation over the back, which was relieved after repeated aspiration at an outpatient clinic. The patient was satisfied with the post-operative scar and aesthetic outcome. No local recurrence, distant metastasis or case mortality was found during 5 months of follow-up.Lessons: RAQ and IPBR with RLDFH is a safe alternative for small-to-medium-breast-size women with breast cancer who desire breast conservation and are indicated for volume replacement with autologous latissimus dorsi flap.

TI  - Information content of in situ and remotely sensed chlorophyll-<i>a</i>: Learning from size-structured phytoplankton model
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll-a measurements in the form of in situ observations and satellite ocean colour products are commonly used in data assimilation to calibrate marine biogeochemical models. Here, a two size-class phytoplankton biogeochemical model, with a OD configuration, was used to simulate the surface chlorophyll-a dynamics (simulated surface Chl-a) for cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies off East Australia. An optical model was then used to calculate the inherent optical properties from the simulation and convert them into remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs). Subsequently, R-rs was used to produce a satellite-like estimate of the simulated surface Chl-a concentrations through the MODIS OC3M algorithm (simulated OC3M Chl-a). Identical parameter optimisation experiments were performed through the assimilation of the two separate datasets (simulated surface Chl-a and simulated OC3M Chl-a), with the purpose of investigating the contrasting information content of simulated surface Chl-a and remotely-sensed data sources. The results we present are based on the analysis of the distribution of a cost function, varying four parameters of the biogeochemical model. In our idealized experiments the simulated OC3M Chl-a product is a poor proxy for the total simulated surface Chl-a concentration. Furthermore, our result show the OC3M algorithm can underestimate the simulated chlorophyll-a concentration in offshore eddies off East Australia (Case I waters), because of the weak relationship between large-sized phytoplankton and remote-sensing reflectance. Although Case I waters are usually characteristic of oligotrophic environments, with a photosynthetic community typically represented by relatively small-sized phytoplankton, mesoscale features such as eddies can generate seasonally favourable conditions for a photosynthetic community with a greater proportion of large phytoplankton cells. Furthermore, our results show that in mesoscale features such as eddies, in situ chlorophyll-a observations and the ocean colour products can carry different information related to phytoplankton sizes. Assimilating both remote-sensing reflectance and measurements of in situ chlorophyll-a concentration reduces the uncertainty of the parameter values more than either data set alone, thus reducing the spread of acceptable solutions, giving an improved simulation of the natural environment.

T2  - ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - International Symposium on Polar Ice, Polar Climate, and Polar Change
CL  - Boulder, CO
AB  - Large discrepancies have been observed between satellite-derived sea-ice concentrations(IC) from passive microwave remote sensing and those derived from optical images at several locations in the East Antarctic, between February and April 2014. These artefacts, that resemble polynyas in the IC maps, appear in areas where optical satellite data show that there is landfast sea ice. The IC datasets and the corresponding retrieval algorithms are investigated together with microwave brightness temperature, air temperature, snowfall and bathymetry to understand the failure of the IC retrieval. The artefacts are the result of the application of weather filters in retrieval algorithms. These filters use the 37 and 19 GHz channels to correct for atmospheric effects on the retrieval. These channels show significant departures from typical ranges when the artefacts occur. A melt-refreeze cycle with associated snow metamorphism is proposed as the most likely cause. Together, the areas of the artefacts account for up to 0.5% of the Antarctic sea-ice area and thus cause a bias in sea-IC time series. In addition, erroneous sea ICs can adversely affect shipping operations.

TI  - Variations in Remotely-Sensed Phytoplankton Size Structure of a Cyclonic Eddy in the Southwest Indian Ocean
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Phytoplankton size classes were derived from weekly-averaged MODIS Aqua chlorophyll a data over the southwest Indian Ocean in order to assess changes in surface phytoplankton community structure within a cyclonic eddy as it propagated across the Mozambique Basin in 2013. Satellite altimetry was used to identify and track the southwesterly movement of the eddy from its origin off Madagascar in mid-June until mid-October, when it eventually merged with the Agulhas Current along the east coast of South Africa. Nano- and picophytoplankton comprised most of the community in the early phase of the eddy development in June, but nanophytoplankton then dominated in austral winter (July and August). Microphytoplankton was entrained into the eddy by horizontal advection from the southern Madagascar shelf, increasing the proportion of microphytoplankton to 23% when the chlorophyll a levels reached a peak of 0.36 mg.m(-3) in the third week of July. Chlorophyll a levels declined to <0.2 mg.m(-3) in austral spring (September and October) as the eddy propagated further to the southwest. Picophytoplankton dominated the community during the spring period, accounting for >50% of the population. As far as is known, this is the first study to investigate temporal changes in chlorophyll a and community structure in a cyclonic eddy propagating across an ocean basin in the southwest Indian Ocean.

TI  - Desertification Sensitivity Analysis Using MEDALUS Model and GIS: A Case Study of the Oases of Middle Draa Valley, Morocco
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Oases can play a significant role in the sustainable economic development of arid and Saharan regions. The aim of this study was to map the desertification-sensitive areas in the Middle Draa Valley (MDV), which is in the southeast of Morocco. A total of 13 indices that affect desertification processes were identified and analyzed using a geographic information system. The Mediterranean desertification and land use approach; which has been widely used in the Mediterranean regions due to its simplicity; flexibility and rapid implementation strategy; was applied. All the indices were grouped into four main quality indices; i.e., soil quality; climate quality; vegetation quality and management quality indices. Each quality index was constructed by the combination of several sub-indicators. In turn; the geometric mean of the four quality index maps was used to construct a map of desertification-sensitive areas; which were classified into four classes (i.e., low; moderate; high and very high sensitivity). Results indicated that only 16.63% of the sites in the study were classified as least sensitive to desertification; and 50.34% were classified as highly and very highly sensitive areas. Findings also showed that climate and human pressure factors are the most important indicators affecting desertification sensitivity in the MDV. The framework used in this research provides suitable results and can be easily implemented in similar oasis arid areas.

TI  - Regulation of oyster (<i>Crassostrea virginica</i>) hemocyte motility by the intracellular parasite <i>Perkinsus marinus</i>: A possible mechanism for host infection
T2  - FISH & SHELLFISH IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Hemocytes associated with the mucus lining of pallial (mantle, gill) surfaces of the oyster Crassostrea virginica have been recently suggested to facilitate infection by the Alveolate parasite Perkinsus marinus by mediating the uptake and dispersion of parasite cells. These "pallial hemocytes", which are directly exposed to microbes present in surrounding seawater, are able to migrate bi-directionally between mucosal surfaces and the circulatory system, potentially playing a sentinel role. Interestingly, P. marinus was shown to increase trans-epithelial migration of hemocytes suggesting it may regulate cell motility to favor infection establishment. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of P. marinus on hemocyte motility and identify specific molecular mechanisms potentially used by the parasite to regulate hemocyte migration. In a first series of experiments, various components of P. marinus (live P. marinas cells, extracellular products, fragments of P. marinus cell membrane, membrane-modified live P. marinus cells, heat-killed P. marinus) along with components of the opportunistic bacterial pathogen Vibrio alginolyticus (bacterial cells and extracellular products) were investigated for their effects on hemocyte motility. In a second series of experiments, inhibitors of specific molecular pathways involved in motility regulation (Y-27632: inhibitor of Rho-associated protein kinase, RGDS: integrin inhibitor, CK-666: Arp2/3 inhibitor) were used in conjunction with qPCR gene expression experiments to identify pathways regulated by P. marinus exposure. Results showed a specific increase in hemocyte motility following exposure to live P. marinus cells. The increase in motility induced by P. marinus was suppressed by RGDS and CK-666 implicating the involvement of integrins and Arp2/3 in cell activation. Gene expression data suggest that Arp2/3 is possibly regulated directly by an effector produced by P. marinus. The implications of increased hemocyte motility prompted by P. marinus during the early stage of the infection process are discussed.

TI  - The last natural seasonal forests of Indonesia: Implications for forest management and conservation
T2  - APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - AimThe status, type and ecology of the vegetation of the southeastern seasonal regions of Indonesia need to be clarified to identify adequate natural resource management and conservation strategies.LocationTanimbar archipelago represents a group of islands south of the Banda sea in the Moluccas. The largest is the flat Yamdena (7 degrees 36S, 131 degrees 25E).MethodsVegetation was interpreted from LANDSAT satellite data, overlaid with geology and topography for pre-stratification. Within each strata, forest sites were equally systematically sampled using a network of small 0.2ha survey plots (60 plots, 7,130 trees) and soil pits sampled for 44 of the vegetation plots. Fisher's alpha diversity index was used together with ordination techniques to assert differences in forest types.ResultsThe forest covered c. 70% of the island, comprising seasonal evergreen forest (SEF), dry deciduous forest (DDF) and moist deciduous forest' (MDF). The SEF canopy (Burseraceae, Meliaceae, Oleaceae and Dilleniaceae) sited around 35m. The density of trees above 10cm diameter averaged 632 individuals/ha, the basal area (BA) was 32m(2)/ha, and species diversity (SD, Fischer ) 14.84. Rattans are abundant in the understorey. The MDF exhibited a mixture of evergreen and deciduous big trees while the lower storey was evergreen. Rattans were less common. Distinct family species associations emerged from the ordination (Combretaceae, Fabaceae, Malvaceae and Apocynaceae or Meliaceae, Gnetaceae, Clusiaceae). The density of trees averaged 491 individuals/ha, BA 26m(2)/ha and SD 18.73. The canopy of the DDF (Ebenaceae, Fabaceae, Apocynaceae and Menispermaceae) was around 30m. During the dry season all tree species shed their leaves. The density of trees averaged 552 individuals/ha, BA 20m(2)/ha and SD 11.58.ConclusionsThe last natural seasonal forests of Indonesia are nowadays only found in the Tanimbar Archipelago. The existence of three contrasted seasonal forest types on small flat island was remarkable and should be quickly translated into decision making for land zoning, agriculture or forestry development, avoiding approaches applied in the humid region of the country. To succeed however, the ecology of these seasonal forests should quickly become priority areas for research to feed the design of suitable conservation and management strategies.

TI  - Diet and Habitat Requirements of the Philippine Endemic Frugivorous Monitor Lizard Varanus bitatawa.
T2  - Biawak
M3  - Article
AB  - Little is known about the ecology and diet of Varanus bitatawa, a recently discovered monitor lizard endemic to the Sierra Madre Mountains of Northern Luzon. Here we present data that show that it has a seasonal omnivorous diet comparable to its southern congener Varanus olivaceus. Consumption of fruits from Pandanus sp., Canarium sp. and Microcos stylocarpa was evident in fecal samples, from spool and line tracking observations, and from camera trap images. The frugivorous diet was supplemented with snails and insects belonging to the orders Orthoptera, Phasmatodea and Coleoptera. Habitat of V. bitatawa was studied in lowland disturbed dipterocarp forest at an elevation below 300 m. In three sampled sites basal area of dipterocarp trees ranged from 16.23 to 84.14 m2ha-1, total tree density from 624.6 to 1021.4 trees per ha-1 and density of Pandanus from 115.15 to 222.30 trees per ha-1. Predominantly arboreal, V. bitatawa showed reliance on large sentinel trees. Of trees utilized, 47.4% were estimated at over 30 m tall with a mean circumference at breast height (CBH) of 176.28 cm and were significantly larger than the mean CBH of trees in sampled habitats. Shy and reclusive, V. bitatawa is likely to be vulnerable to disturbance. Illegal selective logging further degrades remaining habitat threatening the large dipterocarp trees on which they rely. Continued and improved protection of the forests within the Sierra Madre Mountain Range is imperative to safeguard the future of this restricted range species.

TI  - Climate change projections for Greek viticulture as simulated by a regional climate model
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Viticulture represents an important economic activity for Greek agriculture. Winegrapes are cultivated in many areas covering the whole Greek territory, due to the favorable soil and climatic conditions. Given the dependence of viticulture on climate, the vitivinicultural sector is expected to be affected by possible climatic changes. The present study is set out to investigate the impacts of climatic change in Greek viticulture, using nine bioclimatic indices for the period 1981-2100. For this purpose, reanalysis data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and data from the regional climatic model Regional Climate Model Version 3 (RegCM3) are used. It was found that the examined regional climate model estimates satisfactorily these bioclimatic indices. The results of the study show that the increasing trend of temperature and drought will affect all wine-producing regions in Greece. In vineyards in mountainous regions, the impact is positive, while in islands and coastal regions, it is negative. Overall, it should be highlighted that for the first time that Greece is classified into common climatic characteristic categories, according to the international Geoviticulture Multicriteria Climatic Classification System (MCC system). According to the proposed classification, Greek viticulture regions are estimated to have similar climatic characteristics with the warmer wine-producing regions of the world up to the end of twenty-first century. Wine growers and winemakers should take the findings of the study under consideration in order to take measures for Greek wine sector adaptation and the continuation of high-quality wine production.

TI  - Risk Factors for a False-Negative Result of Sentinel Node Biopsy in Patients with Clinically Node-Negative Breast Cancer
T2  - CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeAlthough sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) can accurately represent the axillary lymph node (ALN) status, the false-negative rate (FNR) of SLNB is the main concern in the patients who receive SLNB alone instead of ALN dissection (ALND).Materials and MethodsWe analyzed 1,886 patients who underwent ALND after negative results of SLNB, retrospectively. A logistic regression analysis was used to identify risk factors associated with a false-negative (FN) result. Cox regression model was used to estimate the hazard ratio of factors affecting disease-free survival (DFS).ResultsTumor located in the upper outer portion of the breast, lymphovascular invasion, suspicious node in imaging assessment and less than three sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) were significant independent risk factors for FN in SLNB conferring an adjusted odds ratio of 2.10 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.30 to 3.39), 2.69 (95% CI, 1.47 to 4.91), 2.59 (95% CI, 1.62 to 4.14), and 2.39 (95% CI, 1.45 to 3.95), respectively. The prognostic factors affecting DFS were tumor size larger than 2 cm (hazard ratio [HR], 1.86; 95% CI, 1.17 to 2.96) and FN of SLNB (HR, 2.51; 95% CI, 1.42 to 4.42) in SLN-negative group (FN and true-negative), but in ALN-positive group (FN and true-positive), FN of SLNB (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.33 to 1.25) did not affect DFS.ConclusionIn patients with risk factors for a FN such as suspicious node in imaging assessment, upper outer breast cancer, less than three harvested nodes, we need attention to find another metastatic focus in non-SLNs during the operation. It may contribute to provide an exact prognosis and optimizing adjuvant treatments.

TI  - On the precipitation susceptibility of monsoon clouds to aerosols using high-altitude ground-based observations over Western Ghats, India
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Precipitation susceptibility of monsoon clouds to changes in aerosols has been studied initially by utilizing ground based observations from a High Altitude Cloud Physics Laboratory (HACPL), Mahabaleshwar, India collected during monsoon seasons and later compared with the results obtained from satellite observations. Cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentration, rain intensity and integrated liquid have been taken from ground based observations for calculating precipitation susceptibility. As a first step, we have analyzed the temporal variation of CCN concentration, rain intensity and integrated liquid water during monsoon season. It is observed that all three parameters exhibit strong diurnal variation with two peaks i.e. in morning and afternoon. CCN showed strong morning peak whereas other two showed during afternoon hours. Later precipitation susceptibility has been estimated using CCN as aerosol proxy and it is higher similar to 0.65 for the integrated liquid water ranging from 0.6 to 0.8 mm. Secondly, we have compared ground based observation with satellite observations carried out using aerosol optical depth (AOD), rain rate and liquid water path. Satellite observations showed that precipitation susceptibility, S-0, using AOD as aerosol proxy is higher (S-0 = 0.98) for liquid water path ranging from 800 to 1000 gm(-2). It is also seen that the results are in agreement with the earlier reported results especially with the report from tropical region. Present analysis also showed that the precipitation is getting suppressed at medium range of integrated liquid/liquid water path. This is the first such study from Indian region explicitly using ground-based observations.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma Series of 37 Cases and Systematic Review of the Literature
T2  - ACTA DERMATO-VENEREOLOGICA
M3  - Review
AB  - Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSSC) is one of the most common skin cancers and can lead to patient death. Early detection of node metastasis is a major goal for dermatologists and oncologists. The procedure sentinel lymph node biopsy has been proposed to improve early detection of node metastasis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and impact of this technique on the prognosis of cSSC. A total of 37 patients (Saint Louis Hospital, Paris, France) who had undergone sentinel lymph node biopsy and 290 cases from the literature were analysed. The mean rate of positive sentinel lymph node biopsy was 0.14 [95% CI 0.09-0.22]. However, relapse-free survival and overall survival were not affected by sentinel lymph node status (log-rank test; p = 0.08 and p = 0.31, respectively), suggesting that this procedure is not mandatory in the management of cSSC.

TI  - Effects of spatio-temporal landscape patterns on land surface temperature: a case study of Xi'an city, China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A city is a mixed ecosystem of nature, economy, and society and is simultaneously transforming natural areas and adapting to nature. Urbanization causes the population to expand rapidly, leading to rapid expansions of scale. Consequently, the proportions of impermeable surfaces (ISs) and greenspaces (GSs) change drastically, which has a considerable influence on the urban thermal environment. The aim of this study was to research the effects of spatio-temporal landscape patterns on land surface temperature (LST) and between GS and IS in the city of Xi'an using the urban-rural gradient, the moving split-window algorithm (MSA), multiple grid resolutions, and landscape metrics based on three-phase Landsat data. The results showed that there was a significantly positively correlated with IS density and significantly negatively correlated with the GS density from the urban center to rural areas. Over the past 25 years, the main urban area of Xi'an has expanded by nearly 6.2 times its initial size. The correlation between IS density and LST increased with increasing grid size, and the correlation between GS density and LST increased with decreasing grid size. Thus, LST is highly sensitive to the ISs and GSs at particular grid sizes. The correlation coefficients of the ISs and GSs with LST increased with decreasing grid size during 1992-2016. Hence, the LST was less sensitive to IS and the GS densities in conjunction with larger grid sizes. The class area (CA) and the landscape shape index (LSI) of the ISs were significantly positively correlated with the LST, whereas the CA and largest patch index (LPI) of the GSs were negatively correlated with the LST. The LST of the ISs in 1992, 2006, and 2016 were 1.6, 1.8, and 3.9 A degrees C higher, respectively, than those of the GSs, indicating that GSs are important to lowering urban LSTs. Therefore, the government and urban planning departments should consider optimizing the spatial patterns of ISs and GSs to fully exploit the cooling effect of optimally configured GSs, which would be conducive to the sustainable development of the urban ecological environment.

TI  - Estimating Plant Traits of Alpine Grasslands on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau Using Remote Sensing
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping plants traits on theQinghai-Tibetan Plateau grassland is important for understanding ecosystem functions and how plants respond to global change. Detailed trait maps for the complete Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau are missing. Here, we addressed this issue by combining Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 multispectral satellite data with field measurements to map and compare plant traits of meadow and steppe communities across the complete Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. We measured in-situ plant-level traits of CHLorophyll content (CHL), specific plant area (SPA = plant area / plant dry mass), and plant dry matter content (PDMC = plant dry mass / fresh mass). We hypothesized that plant-level traits of SPA and PDMC are close to community-weighted means (CWMs) of specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf dry matter content (LDMC) because leaves represent the largest fraction of above-ground biomass in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau grasslands. Despite vastly different measurement methods, we found that the remotely sensed traits (SPA and PDMC) correlated with literature-derived leaf traits of CWMs of SLA and LDMC. Both remotely sensed and field-measured results showed that alpine meadow plants reveal a wider range and higher averages of CHL and SPA but lower PDMC compared with alpine steppe plants. These trait differences between vegetation types indicate faster growth of alpine meadow and higher resilience to harsh conditions of alpine steppe, representing differences in adaptation strategies to environmental conditions. Our study demonstrates that remote sensing can be used to estimate plant traits in alpine grasslands with potential applications to retrieve functional diversity and correlated ecosystem functions in future studies.

TI  - Short-wave infrared emitted/excited fluorescence from carbon dots and preliminary applications in bioimaging
T2  - MATERIALS CHEMISTRY FRONTIERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fluorescent carbon dots (FCDs) have attracted tremendous attention in biological applications. The short-wave infrared (SWIR, 900-1700 nm) spectral range is considered as a novel optical tissue window due to low photon scattering. In this work, we investigated the fluorescence characteristics of FCDs based on the SWIR spectral range. SWIR emissions were observed from FCDs for the first time, when long-wavelength excitation (e.g. longer than 731 nm) was adopted. Wavelength-tunable two-photon fluorescence could also be obtained from the FCDs, under 1000-1560 nm SWIR femtosecond (fs) excitation. Interestingly, when an fs excitation wavelength as long as 1560 nm was adopted, two typical nonlinear optical signals, namely two-photon fluorescence and third harmonic generation (THG), could be observed. Based on the one-photon SWIR fluorescence, FCDs were successfully utilized for in vivo sentinel node mapping and tumour imaging. Under SWIR fs excitation, FCD-assisted two-photon fluorescence microscopy realized deep-tissue imaging of zebrafish embryos and the brain neuron networks of mice. SWIR excited and emitting FCDs have potential as fluorescent probes for deep-tissue and high-contrast functional bioimaging and related applications in the future.

TI  - Spatiotemporal evolution of the remotely sensed global continental PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration from 2000-2014 based on Bayesian statistics
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - PM2.5 pollution is threatening human health and quality of life, especially in some densely populated regions of Asia and Africa. This paper used remotely sensed annual mean PM2.5 concentrations to explore the spatiotemporal evolution of global continental PM2.5 pollution from 2000 to 2014. The work employed an improved Bayesian space-time hierarchy model combined with a multiscale homogeneous subdivision method. The statistical results quantitatively demonstrated a 'high-value increasing and low value decreasing' trend. Areas with annual PM(2.)5 concentrations of more than 70 mu g/m(3) and less than 10 mu g/m(3) expanded, while areas with of an annual PM2.5 concentrations of 10-25 mu g/m(3) shrank. The most heavily PM2.5-polluted areas were located in northwest Africa, where the PM2.5 pollution level was 12.0 times higher than the average global continental level; parts of China represented the second most PM2.5-polluted areas, followed by northern India and Saudi Arabia and Iraq in the Middle East region. Nearly all (96.50%) of the highly PM2.5-polluted area (hot spots) had an increasing local trend, while 68.98% of the lightly PM2.5-polluted areas (cold spots) had a decreasing local trend. In contrast, 22.82% of the cold spot areas exhibited an increasing local trend. Moreover, the spatiotemporal variation in the health risk from exposure to PM2.5 over the global continents was also investigated. Four areas, India, eastern and southern China, western Africa and central Europe, had high health risks from PM2.5 exposure. Northern India, northeastern Pakistan, and mid-eastern China had not only the highest risk but also a significant increasing trend; the areas of high PM2.5 pollution risk are thus expanding, and the number of affected people is increasing. Northern and central Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, the Middle East, western Russia and central Europe also exhibited increasing PM2.5 pollution health risks. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - A Bayesian Space-Time Hierarchical Model for Remotely Sensed Lattice Data Based on Multiscale Homogeneous Statistical Units
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Bayesian hierarchical model has the outstanding capacity to combine prior knowledge with observations, as well as to generate rich spatiotemporal patterns. However, this advanced method has limited use in remotely sensed lattice data applications due to the large computational burden and unreasonable statistical inferences based on statistical units with a fixed scale. This paper presents a multiscale spatial homogeneous subdivision method and develops a Bayesian space-time hierarchical model (BSTHM) for remotely sensed lattice data. This can solve the above-mentioned limitations by constructing multiscale spatial homogeneous units with good statistical properties. The quantitative criteria for subdivision are provided. The outcome of the BSTHM is not only more reasonable in theory but also much easier to interpret; meanwhile, the computational efficiency is also considerably improved. This novel approach and its merits are illustrated by a case study that examines the spatiotemporal variation of PM2.5 pollution in Asia from 2000 to 2014 using remotely sensed data describing PM2.5 annual mean concentrations. Overall spatial pattern, common time trend, and local variation trend were decomposed and quantificationally estimated from an intricate spatiotemporal process.

TI  - Satellite-Based Models Need Improvements on Simulating Annual Gross Primary Productivity: A Comparison of Six Models for Regional Modeling of Deciduous Broadleaf Forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Modeling vegetation gross primary productivity (GPP) is crucial to understanding the land-atmosphere interactions and, hence, the global carbon cycle. While studies have demonstrated that satellite-based models could well simulate intra-annual variation of vegetation GPP, there is a need to understand our ability to capture interannual GPP variability. This study compares the spatiotemporal performance of six satellite-based models in regional modeling of annual GPP for deciduous broadleaf forests across the eastern United States. The 2001-2012 average annual gross primary productivities (AAGPPs) derived from different models have mismatched spatial patterns with divergent changing trends along both latitude and longitude. Evaluation using flux tower data indicates that some models could have considerable biases on a yearly basis. All tested models, despite performing well on the 8-day basis because of the underlying strong seasonality in vegetation productivity, fail to capture interannual variation of GPP across sites and years. Our study identifies considerable modeling uncertainties on a yearly basis even for an extensively studied biome of deciduous broadleaf forest at both site and large scales. Improvements to the current satellite-based models have to be made to capture interannual GPP variation in addition to intra-annual variation.

TI  - Unified Vision-Based Methodology for Simultaneous Concrete Defect Detection and Geolocalization
T2  - COMPUTER-AIDED CIVIL AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vision-based autonomous inspection of concrete surface defects is crucial for efficient maintenance and rehabilitation of infrastructures and has become a research hot spot. However, most existing vision-based inspection methods mainly focus on detecting one kind of defect in nearly uniform testing background where defects are relatively large and easily recognizable. But in the real-world scenarios, multiple types of defects often occur simultaneously. And most of them occupy only small fractions of inspection images and are swamped in cluttered background, which easily leads to missed and false detections. In addition, the majority of the previous researches only focus on detecting defects but few of them pay attention to the geolocalization problem, which is indispensable for timely performing repair, protection, or reinforcement works. And most of them rely heavily on GPS for tracking the locations of the defects. However, this method is sometimes unreliable within infrastructures where the GPS signals are easily blocked, which causes a dramatic increase in searching costs. To address these limitations, we present a unified and purely vision-based method denoted as defects detection and localization network, which can detect and classify various typical types of defects under challenging conditions while simultaneously geolocating the defects without requiring external localization sensors. We design a supervised deep convolutional neural network and propose novel training methods to optimize its performance on specific tasks. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method is effective with a detection accuracy of 80.7% and a localization accuracy of 86% at 0.41 s per image (at a scale of 1,200 pixels in the field test experiment), which is ideal for integration within intelligent autonomous inspection systems to provide support for practical applications.

TI  - Antarctic Surface Ice Velocity Retrieval from MODIS-Based Mosaic of Antarctica (MOA)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The velocity of ice flow in the Antarctic is a crucial factor to determine ice discharge and thus future sea level rise. Feature tracking has been widely used in optical and radar imagery with fine resolution to retrieve flow parameters, although the primitive result may be contaminated by noise. In this paper, we present a series of modified post-processing steps, such as SNR thresholding by residual, complex Butterworth filters, and triple standard deviation truncation, to improve the performance of primitive results, and apply it to MODIS-based Mosaic of Antarctica (MOA) datasets. The final velocity field result displays the general flow pattern of the peripheral Antarctic. Seventy-eight out of 97 streamlines starting from seed points are smooth and continuous. The RMSE with 178 manually selected tie points is within 60 m.a(-1). The systematic comparison with Making Earth System Data Records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) datasets in seven drainages shows that the results regarding high magnitude and large-scale ice shelf are highly reliable; absolute mean and median difference are less than 18 m.a(-1), while the result of localized drainage suffered from too much tracking error. The relative differences from manually selected and random points are controlled within 8% when speed is beyond 500 m.a(-1), but bias and uncertainty are pronounced when speed is lower than that. The result through our accuracy control strategy highlights that coarse remote-sensed images such as Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrophotometer (MODIS) can still offer the capability for comprehensive and long-term continental ice sheet surface velocity mapping.

TI  - Active pharmacovigilance in China: recent development and future perspectives
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The effectiveness of active pharmacovigilance depends on the specific methods adopted and the work patterns put into place. Over the past few years, much attention has been paid to the importance of implementing such systems in China. However, less has been done to evaluate the state of implementation and future needs of such systems.This paper reviews China's recent approaches to active pharmacovigilance by examining: (1) information collected from scientific articles and the websites of the China Food and Drug Administration and the China National Center for Adverse Drug Reaction Monitoring, (2) information available on China's spontaneous reporting systems (SRS) and active pharmacovigilance system, and (3) annual reports and internal reports on this subject.Areas that improved most meaningfully for China's active pharmacovigilance in recent years appear to include: (1) quicker reporting and more intelligent scanning methods for adverse drug reactions (ADRs), (2) the use of pharmacovigilance approaches to mine electronic hospital records, and (3) the development of integrated systems including the China Hospital Pharmacovigilance System and China Sentinel Hospital Alliance Program.Not only has the national online SRS system provided a platform for passive pharmacovigilance, it has also become an important platform for various explorations of active pharmacovigilance in China. Quick reporting and intelligent scanning of ADRs, facilitated by automated ADR detection based on electronic hospital records, have accelerated to capabilities for active pharmacovigilance. The outcomes of the programs, such as the China Hospital Pharmacovigilance System and China Sentinel Hospital Alliance Program, usher in a new era for China's active pharmacovigilance. These are particularly important to bridge the information system of sentinel hospitals and ADR research centers, but gaps remain. Thus, much work needs to be done before a high-level active pharmacovigilance system is sufficiently mature to ensure drug safety in the country.

TI  - Post-Fire Vegetation Succession and Surface Energy Fluxes Derived from Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing frequency of fires inhibits the estimation of carbon reserves in boreal forest ecosystems because fires release significant amounts of carbon into the atmosphere through combustion. However, less is known regarding the effects of vegetation succession processes on ecosystem C-flux that follow fires. This paper describes intra- and inter-annual vegetation restoration trajectories via MODIS time-series and Landsat data. The temporal and spatial characteristics of the natural succession were analyzed from 2000 to 2016. Finally, we regressed post-fire MODIS EVI, LST and LSWI values onto GPP and NPP values to identify the main limiting factors during post-fire carbon exchange. The results show immediate variations after the fire event, with EVI and LSWI decreasing by 0.21 and 0.31, respectively, and the LST increasing to 6.89 degrees C. After this initial variation, subsequent fire-induced variations were significantly smaller; instead, seasonality began governing the change characteristics. The greatest differences in EVI, LST and LSWI were observed in August and September compared to those in other months (0.29, 6.9 and 0.35, respectively), including July, which was the second month after the fire. We estimated the mean EVI recovery periods under different fire intensities (approximately 10, 12 and 16 years): the LST recovery time is one year earlier than that of the EVI. GPP and NPP decreased after the fire by 22-45 g C.m(-2).month(-1) (30-80%) and 0.13-0.35 kg C.m(-2).year(-1) (20-60%), respectively. Excluding the winter period, when no photosynthesis occurred, the correlation between the EVI and GPP was the strongest, and the correlation coefficient varied with the burn intensity. When changes in EVI, LST and LSWI after the fire in the boreal forest were more significant, the severity of the fire determined the magnitude of the changes, and the seasonality aggravated these changes. On the other hand, the seasonality is another important factor that affects vegetation restoration and land-surface energy fluxes in boreal forests. The strong correlations between EVI and GPP/NPP reveal that the C-flux can be simply and directly estimated on a per-pixel basis from EVI data, which can be used to accurately estimate land-surface energy fluxes during vegetation restoration and reduce uncertainties in the estimation of forests' carbon reserves.

TI  - A Rice Mapping Method Based on Time-Series Landsat Data for the Extraction of Growth Period Characteristics
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid and accurate acquisition of rice cultivation information is very important for the management and assessment of rice agriculture and for research on food security, the use of agricultural water resources, and greenhouse gas emissions. Rice mapping methods based on phenology have been widely used but further studies are needed to clearly quantify the rice characteristics during the growth cycle. This paper selected the area where rice agriculture has undergone tremendous changes as the observation object. The rice areas were mapped in three time periods during the period from 1993 to 2016 by combining the characteristics of the harvested areas, flooded areas, and the time interval when harvesting and flooding occurred. An error matrix was used to determine the mapping accuracy. After exclusion of clouds and cloud shadows, the overall accuracy of the paddy fields was higher than 90% (90.5% and 93.5% in period 1 and period 3, respectively). Mixed pixels, image quality, and image acquisition time are important factors affecting the accuracy of rice mapping. The rapid economic development led to an adjustment of people's diets and presumably this is the main reason why rice cultivation is no longer the main agricultural production activity in the study area.

TI  - Lake Surface Water Temperature Derived from 35 Years of AVHRR Sensor Data for European Lakes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake surface water temperature (LSWT) is an important parameter with which to assess aquatic ecosystems and to study the lake's response to climate change. The AVHRR archive of the University of Bern offers great potential to derive consistent LSWT data suited for the study of climate change and lake dynamics. To derive such a dataset, challenges such as orbit drift correction, non-water pixel detection, and homogenization had to be solved. The result is a dataset covering over 3.5 decades of spatial LSWT data for 26 European lakes. The validation against in-situ temperature data at 19 locations showed an uncertainty between +/- 0.8 K and +/- 2.0 K (standard deviation), depending on locations of the lakes. The long-term robustness of the dataset was confirmed by comparing in-situ and satellite derived temperature trends, which showed no significant difference. The final trend analysis showed significant LSWT warming trends at all locations (0.2 K/decade to 0.8 K/decade). A gradient of increasing trends from south-west to north-east of Europe was revealed. The strong intra-annual variability of trends indicates that single seasonal trends do not well represent the response of a lake to climate change, e.g., autumn trends are dominant in the north of Europe, whereas winter trends are dominant in the south. Intra-lake variability of trends indicates that trends at single in-situ stations do not necessarily represent the lake's response. The LSWT dataset generated for this study gives some new and interesting insights into the response of European lakes to climate change during the last 36 years (1981-2016).

TI  - Clinicopathologic analysis of a large series of microinvasive breast cancers
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Clinical management of microinvasive breast cancer (Tmic) remains controversial. Although metastases are infrequent in Tmic carcinoma patients, surgical treatment typically includes lymph node sampling. The objective of this study was to determine the rate and predictors of lymph node metastases, recurrence, and survival in a large series of Tmic breast carcinomas. Consecutive cases of Tmic were identified within our health care system from 2001 to 2015. We reviewed results of lymph node sampling and other pathologic factors including hormone receptor/HER2 status, associated insitu tumor size/grade, margin status, number of invasive foci, surgical/adjuvant therapies, and recurrence/survival outcomes. In this cohort, 294 Tmic cases were identified with mean follow-up of 4.6years. Of 260 patients who underwent axillary staging, lymph node metastases were identified in 1.5% (all of which were ductal type). All Tmic cases with positive lymph node metastases had associated DCIS with size>5cm (5.3-8.5cm) compared to a median DCIS tumor size of 2.5cm (0.2-19.0cm) for the entire cohort. No lymph node metastases were seen with microinvasive lobular carcinoma. During the follow-up period, there were no regional/distant recurrences or breast cancer-associated deaths in a mean follow-up period of 4.6years. Two patients developed subsequent ipsilateral breast cancer (DCIS) in a different quadrant than the original Tmic. Clinical behavior of microinvasive breast cancer in this series is similar to DCIS. Lymph node metastases are uncommon and were only seen with ductal type microinvasive carcinoma. Our data suggest limited benefit for routine node sampling and support management of Tmic similar to DCIS, particularly for patients with DCIS<5cm in size.

TI  - Preoperative predictors of high and low axillary nodal burden in Z0011 eligible breast cancer patients with a positive lymph node needle biopsy result
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Z0011 trial showed that early breast cancer patients with low axillary nodal burden, may be spared an axillary lymph node dissection with no survival compromise. Axillary lymph node dissection can be reserved for patients with a high axillary nodal burden. We aim to determine the preoperative factors that could distinguish between low and high axillary nodal burden in Z0011 eligible patients with a needle biopsy proven metastatic node.Method: Patients who fulfilled Z0011 trial criteria with a positive lymph node needle biopsy and had axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) were recruited. These patients were classified into low and high nodal burden subgroups, defined as having 1-2 and >= 3 metastatic lymph nodes, respectively. The clinical, radiological and pathological features between the 2 subgroups were compared.Results: 70 (40%) and 105 (60%) patients had low and high nodal burden respectively. The high nodal burden subgroup was more likely to have on ultrasound >= 3 abnormal lymph nodes (37.14% versus 4.29%) (P < 0.0001) and maximum cortical thickness >4 mm (31.43% versus 10.0%) (P = 0.0036). Multivariate analysis revealed abnormal lymph nodes >= 3 to have an odds ratio of 20.72 (95% CI 5.91-72.65) P < 0.0001.Conclusion: >= 3 abnormal lymph nodes on ultrasound was the most significant predictor of high nodal burden subgroup in Z0011 eligible patients with a positive lymph node needle biopsy. This information could allow this subgroup to proceed to an upfront ALND and avoid the need of a sentinel lymph node biopsy in the post Z0011 trial era.

TI  - Flood Mapping Using Multi-Source Remotely Sensed Data and Logistic Regression in the Heterogeneous Mountainous Regions in North Korea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Flooding is extremely dangerous when a river overflows to inundate an urban area. From 1995 to 2016, North Korea (NK) experienced extensive damage to life and property almost every year due to a levee breach resulting from typhoons and heavy rainfall during the summer monsoon season. Recently, Hoeryeong City (2016) experienced heavy rain during Typhoon Lionrock, and the resulting flood killed and injured many people (68,900) and destroyed numerous buildings and settlements (11,600). The NK state media described it as the most significant national disaster since 1945. Thus, almost all annual repeat occurrences of floods in NK have had a severe impact, which makes it necessary to figure out the extent of floods to restore the damaged environment. However, this is difficult due to inaccessibility. Under such a situation, optical remote sensing (RS) data and radar RS data along with a logistic regression were utilized in this study to develop modeling for flood-damaged area delineation. High-resolution web-based satellite imagery was also interpreted to confirm the results of the study.

TI  - Single-Polarized SAR Classification Based on a Multi-Temporal Image Stack
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover classification plays a pivotal role in Earth resource management. In the past, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) had been extensively studied for classification. However, limited work has been done on multi-temporal datasets owing to the lack of data availability and computational power. As Earth observation (EO) becomes more and more imperative, it becomes essential to exploit the information embedded in multi-temporal datasets. In this paper, we present a framework for SAR pixel labeling. Specifically, we exploit spatio-temporal information for pixel labeling. The proposed scheme includes four steps: (1) extraction of spatio-temporal observations; (2) feature computation; (3) feature reduction and (4) pixel labeling. First, an adaptive approach is applied to the data cube to extract spatio-temporal observations in both coherent and incoherent domains. Second, features in distinct domains are designed and computed to boost information content embedded in the multi-temporal datasets. Third, sequential feature selection is utilized for selecting the most discriminative features among the entire feature space. Last, the discriminative classifier is used to label the class of each pixel. By integrating pixel-/object-based processing techniques, spatial/temporal observations and coherent/incoherent data attributes, the proposed method explores diverse observations to solve complex labeling problems. In the experiments, we apply the proposed method on 64 TanDEM-X images and 70 COSMO-SkyMed high-resolution images, respectively. Both experiments reveal high accuracies for multi-class labeling. The proposed technique, therefore, provides a new solution for classifying multi-temporal single-polarized datasets.

TI  - Detection of Shoot Beetle Stress on Yunnan Pine Forest Using a Coupled LIBERTY2-INFORM Simulation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Yunnan pine shoot beetles (PSB), Tomicus yunnanensis and Tomicus minor have spread through southwestern China in the last five years, leading to millions of hectares of forest being damaged. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop an effective approach for accurate early warning and damage assessment of PSB outbreaks. Remote sensing is one of the most efficient methods for this purpose. Despite many studies existing on the mountain pine beetle (MPB), very little work has been undertaken on assessing PSB stress using remote sensing. The objective of this paper was to develop a spectral linear mixing model aided by radiative transfer (RT) and a new Yellow Index (YI) to simulate the reflectance of heterogeneous canopies containing damaged needles and quantitatively inverse their PSB stress. The YI, the fraction of dead needles, is a physically-explicit stress indicator that represents the plot shoots damage ratio (plot SDR). The major steps of this methods include: (1) LIBERTY2 was developed to simulate the reflectance of damaged needles using YI to linearly mix the green needle spectra with the dead needle spectra; (2) LIBERTY2 was coupled with the INFORM model to scale the needle spectra to the canopy scale; and (3) a look-up table (LUT) was created against Sentinel 2 (S2) imagery and inversed leaf chlorophyll content (LCC), green leaf area index (LAI) and plot SDR. The results show that (1) LIBERTY2 effectively simulated the reflectance spectral values on infested needles (mean relative error (MRE) = 1.4-18%), and the YI can indicate the degrees of needles damage; (2) the coupled LIBERTY2-INFORM model is suitable to estimate LAI (R-2 = 0.73, RMSE = 0.17 m m(-2), NRMSE = 11.41% and the index of agreement (IOA) = 0.92) and LCC (R-2 = 0.49, RMSE = 56.24 mg m(-2), NRMSE = 25.22% and IOA = 0.72), and is better than the original LIBERTY model (LAI: R-2 = 0.38, RMSE = 0.43 m m(-2), NRMSE = 28.85% and IOA = 0.68; LCC: R-2 = 0.34, RMSE = 76.44 mg m(-2), NRMSE = 34.23% and IOA = 0.57); and (3) the inversed YI is positively correlated with the measured plot SDR (R-2 = 0.40, RMSE = 0.15). We conclude that the LIBERTY2 model improved the reflectance simulation accuracy of both the needles and canopies, making it suitable for assessing PSB stress. The YI has the potential to assess PSB damage.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Wetland Changes Using a Kernel Extreme Learning Machine Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural wetland ecosystems provide not only important habitats for many wildlife species, but also food for migratory and resident animals. In Shanghai, the Chongming Dongtan International Wetland, located at the mouth of the Yangtze River, plays an important role in maintaining both ecosystem health and ecological security of the island. Meanwhile it provides an especially important stopover and overwintering site for migratory birds, being located in the middle of the East Asian-Australasian Flyway. However, with the increase in development intensity and human activities, this wetland suffers from increasing environmental pressure. On the other hand, biological succession in the mudflat wetland makes Chongming Dongtan a rapidly developing and rare ecosystem in the world. Therefore, studying the wetland spatio-temporal change is an important precondition for analyzing the relationship between wetland evolution processes and human activities. This paper presents a novel method for analyzing land-use/cover changes (LUCC) on Chongming Dongtan wetland using multispectral satellite images. Our method mainly takes advantages of a machine learning algorithm, named the Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (K-ELM), which is applied to distinguish between different objects and extract their information from images. In the K-ELM, the kernel trick makes it more stable and accurate. The comparison between K-ELM and three other conventional classification methods indicates that the proposed K-ELM has the highest overall accuracy, especially for distinguishing between Spartina alternflora, Scirpus mariqueter, and Phragmites australis. Meanwhile, its efficiency is remarkable as well. Then a total of eight Landsat TM series images acquired from 1986 to 2013 were used for the LUCC analysis with K-ELM. According to the classification result, the change detection and spatio-temporal quantitative analysis were performed. The specific analysis of different objects are significant for learning about the historical changes to Chongming Dongtan and obtaining the evaluation rules. Generally, the rapid speed of Chongming Dongtan's urbanization brought about great influence with respect to natural resources and the environment. Integrating the results into the ecological analysis and ecological regional planning of Dongtan could provide a reliable scientific basis for rational planning, development, and the ecological balance and regional sustainability of the wetland area.

TI  - The dynamic observation of dissolved organic matter in the Zhujiang (Pearl River) Estuary in China from space
T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The distributions of estuarine colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) are the combined results of physicalbiogeochemical processes. Remote sensing is needed to monitor highly dynamically estuarine CDOM. Using in situ data from four seasonal cruises, an algorithm is developed to estimate CDOM absorption coefficient at 400 nm (a (CDOM)(400)) in the Zhujiang (Pearl River) Estuary (ZJE). The algorithm uses band ratios of R (rs)(667)/R (rs)(443) and R (rs)(748)/R (rs)(412). By applying it to moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer onboard Aqua satellite (MODIS/Aqua) data from 2002 to 2014, seasonal climatology a (CDOM)(400) in the ZJE is calculated. CDOM distributions are majorly influenced by water discharge from the Zhujiang River and underwater topography. Along the section vertical to a water depth gradient, the seasonal a (CDOM)(400) exponentially decreased (y=ae (bx) , b < 0), but with great differences among seasons. Riverine fresh water is the primary source of CDOM in the ZJE. Fulvic acid fraction decreases with increasing salinity. Using developed algorithms, conservative CDOM mixing equation, and river discharge, effective riverine end-member concentration and flux of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in summer and winter from 2002 to 2014 are first estimated from the MODIS/Aqua data. Both effective riverine end-member DOC concentration and flux are positively related to the river discharge, significantly in summer with R (2) of 0.698 for concentration and 0.965 7 for flux.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the MODIS vegetation net primary productivity (NPP) product data (MOD17A3-NPP) and evapotranspiration (ET) product data (MOD16A3-ET) of 2000-2014, this study adopted linear trend analysis, correlation coefficient, partial correlation coefficient and other mathematical analysis methods to analyse both the temporal-spatial evolution of vegetation NPP in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Region (SGNR) in the 15 years, and the influence of meteorological factors (temperature, precipitation and ET) and human activities on its vegetation NPP. The results indicated that (1) from 2000 to 2014 the vegetation annual net primary productivity (ANPP) of the study region significantly increased from 169.06 g C/(m(2) a) to 262.49 g C/(m(2) a), having an annual rate of increase of 4.57 g C/(m(2) a); (2) the increase of ANPP was significant for more than 84% of the study region, and extremely significant for more than 70%; (3) no obvious correlation was detected between ANPP and annual average temperature (AAT), Areas which had a significant positive correlation between ANPP and annual precipitation (AP) were mainly concentrated in arid and semi-arid areas with an AP of less than 400 mm; (4) a significant positive correlation was detected between ANPP and AET in more than 90% of the study region; (5) a gradual improvement in ANPP and a continuous improvement in the ecological environment were identified in SGNR. These improvements were inseparable from the decisive role played by human activities.

TI  - Monitoring vegetation coverage in Tongren from 2000 to 2016 based on Landsat7 ETM+ and Landsat8
T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation coverage is an important indicator in regional ecological environment monitoring and plays a key role in its quality assessment. We consider Landsat7 ETM+ in 2000 and Landsat8 in 2016 as data sources using a different time phase partial image substitution method to eliminate cloud effects and an NDVI dimidiate pixel model to invert the vegetation coverage of the two time phases. We further classify them into five grades, provide statistics and analyse the areas of different grades at different time periods, while monitoring the spatial evolution of vegetation coverage over the past 16 years in Tongren. Experimental results showed that: (1) the different time phase partial image substitution method could reduce the influence of clouds on vegetation extraction; (2) in Tongren, the vegetation coverage area was decreased from 17,300.1 km(2) to 17,224.8 km(2) (i.e. decreased by 75.3 km(2)); (3) the areas of grade I and V increased by 0.42% and 15.08%, respectively, whereas the areas of grade II, III and IV decreased by 3.15%, 6.98% and 5.37%, respectively, which indicates that most of the area containing lower amount of vegetation gradually altered into an area containing a higher coverage of vegetation, whereas a few areas became bare land; and (4) the vegetation areas decreased due to expansion of cities and construction of dams, while vegetation increased due to the cultivation of crops and trees. Research shows that the overall evolution of vegetation coverage in Tongren is considerably good. However, while undertaking future development in the mountainous Karst region, one should be aware of the land's intensive use and environmental protection.

TI  - Gold-copper deposits in Wushitala, Southern Tianshan, Northwest China: Application of ASTER data for mineral exploration
T2  - GEOLOGICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Southern Tianshan area is one of the most important gold belts identified by many world-class, super large and large gold deposits such as Muruntau (Uzbekistan), Kumtor (Kyrgyzstan), and Jilau (Tajikistan). Some medium- to small-scale gold deposits, such as Sawayaerdun and Bulong, have been discovered and reported in recent years at the China part of the belt. The study area, named the Wushitala area, is located in the eastern part of Southern Tianshan, and it has a strong potential for gold and other metallic mineral deposits. This study utilizes various image processing techniques, including false colour composite, band ratios, and matched filtering, to process Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data and map the distribution of hydrothermal minerals (e.g., muscovite, kaolinite, chlorite, epidote, goethite, and malachite) related to the known deposits in the Wushitala area. The identified alteration zones are coincident with the known gold and copper deposits and field samples from the study area. The distribution of the alteration zones also indicates that the acid intrusions and regional structures play an important role in focusing the mineralizing fluids. The results show that ASTER data accompanied with image processing methods and reference spectra (e.g., JPL, lab, or field measured) could be an effective technique for mapping hydrothermal alteration zones in areas with no dominant vegetation cover. Due to the extensively distributed acid intrusions and structures along the Southern Tianshan Belt, the mineral prospecting methodology is suggested for application in similar geological settings in the belt.

TI  - Relationship of root zone soil moisture with solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence and vegetation indices in winter wheat: A comparative study based on continuous ground-measurements
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Root zone soil moisture is a critical component in the interaction between the hydrosphere, atmosphere, and biosphere. Optical reflectance of the vegetation canopy could provide abundant information about plant function and therefore has been used to detect the root zone soil moisture over large areas. Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is another signal with close ties to photosynthesis; however, its detailed relationship with soil moisture at different depths within the root zone has not been reported. In particular, little is known about the difference between SIF and reflectance-based vegetation indices (VIs) in responding to lag root zone soil moisture. In this study, we presented continuous ground measurements of VIs and SIF at 760 nm over four plots of wheat with different irrigation treatments. Results showed that both SIF and VIs positively and significantly correlated with root zone soil moisture, but with different lag responses to soil moisture changes at various depths. Their relationships also varied with the development of vegetation as well as with the status of soil moisture. Compared to VIs, SIF was still sensitive enough to measure vegetation variation even when the leaf area index or chlorophyll content was at high levels, suggesting that SIF was more feasible in root zone soil moisture monitoring over closure canopies.

TI  - Resolving Surface Displacements in Shenzhen of China from Time Series InSAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past few decades, the coastal city of Shenzhen has been transformed from a small fishing village to a mega city as China's first Special Economic Zone. The rapid economic development was matched by a sharp increase in the demand for usable land and coastal reclamation has been undertaken to create new land from the sea. However, it has been reported that subsidence occurred in land reclamation area and around subway tunnel area. Subsidence and the additional threat of coastal inundation from sea-level rise highlight the necessity of displacement monitoring in Shenzhen. The time Series InSAR technique is capable of detecting sub-centimeter displacement of the Earth's surface over large areas. This study uses Envisat, COSMO-SkyMed, and Sentinel-1 datasets to determine the surface movements in Shenzhen from 2004 to 2010 and from 2013 to 2017. Subsidence observed can be attributable to both land reclamation and subway construction. Seasonal displacements are likely to be associated with precipitation. The influence of ocean tidal level changes on seasonal displacement is not strongly evident from the results and requires further investigations. In general, InSAR has proven its ability to provide accurate measurements of ground stability for the city of Shenzhen.

M3  - Article
AB  - Preoperative assessment of nodal stage is of importance in breast cancer treatment decision-making. This study was done to determine the power of combined mammography and ultrasonography in differentiating N0-N1 from N2-N3 breast cancer.We retrospectively reviewed clinical data of 3944 female patients with invasive breast cancer by preoperative mammography and ultrasonography between January 2006 and December 2013 at our hospital. Pathological diagnosis was available for each patient. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy of mammography alone, ultrasonography alone, and combination of them for assessment of axillary lymph node (ALN) status were calculated, using definitive histological results as the baseline.The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy was 90.4%, 68.2%, 36.5%, 97.2%, and 71.9% for ultrasonography; was 66.9%, 80.8%, 41.3%, 92.3%, and 78.4% for mammography; and was 94.9%, 62.4%, 33.8%, and 98.4% for combined mammography and ultrasonography. For combination, accuracy and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 67.9% and 0.85, respectively.In conclusion, combining ultrasonography and mammography improves the sensitivity in differentiating N0-N1 breast cancer from N2-N3 breast cancer, but leading to a reduced specificity. Addition of mammography to ultrasonography seems not to provide significant benefits in predicting ALN status in breast cancer patients.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Phytoplankton Size Class in Northwest Atlantic from 1998 to 2016: Bio-Optical Algorithms Comparison and Application
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Phytoplankton community structure and phytoplankton size class (PSC) are linked to ecological and biogeochemical changes in the oceanic environment. Many models developed to obtain the fraction of PSCs from satellite remote sensing have only been evaluated in open oceans, and very limited effort has been carried out to report on the performance of these PSC models in productive continental shelf waters. In this study, we evaluated the performance of nine PSC models in the coastal Northwest Atlantic (NWA) by comparison of in situ phytoplankton pigment measurements with coincidental satellite data from the Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS), Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). Our results show that no PSC model retrieved all three phytoplankton size classes (pico-, nano-, and micro-phytoplankton) with reliable accuracy in the region of interest. In particular, these PSC models showed poor performance for retrieval of the picophytoplankton fraction of total phytoplankton in our study region, which could be related to the under-representation of pico-dominated samples in the productive waters of the NWA. For the accuracy of retrieved microphytoplankton and combined nano-pico phytoplankton fraction, the regional model developed by Devred et al. (2011) yielded the best result, followed by the model of Brewin et al. (2011). The model of Devred et al. (2011) was applied to satellite-derived chlorophyll-a concentration from the Ocean Color Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI) archive in the NWA from 1998 to 2016. We report solely on the microphytoplankton biomass and fraction given the inverse relationship that exists with the nano-pico class. The multi-decadal trend along with the deseasonalized trend of microphytoplankton fraction was computed and analyzed for six biogeochemical provinces located in the NWA. Over the 19-year time series, there were significant, positive trends for four of the six provinces, with a slope of 0.36%.yr(-1) in the Northwest Continental Shelf (NWCS), 0.25%.yr(-1) in the Arctic Waters (ARCT), 0.12%.yr(-1) in the Slope Waters (SW) and 0.06%.yr(-1) in the Gulf Stream (GFST). Strong positive anomalies of microphytoplankton fraction were found in winter months in NWCS between 2009 and 2014, which could be associated with changes in environmental factors.

TI  - Application of partial least squares regression in detecting the important landscape indicators determining urban land surface temperature variation
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Revealing the interaction between landscape pattern and urban land surface temperature (LST) can provide insight into mitigating thermal environmental risks. However, there is no consensus about the key landscape indicators influencing LST.This study sought to identify the key landscape indicators influencing LST considering a large number of landscape pattern variables and multiple scales.This study applied ordinary least squares regression and partial least squares regression to explore a combination of landscape metrics and identify the key indicators influencing LST. A total of 49 Landsat images of the main city of Shenzhen, China were examined at 13 spatial scales.The landscape composition indicators derived from biophysical proportion, a new metric developed in this study, more effectively determined LST variation than those derived from land cover proportion. Area-related landscape configuration indicators independently characterized LST variation, but did not give much more new information beyond that given by land cover proportion. Shape-related landscape configuration indicators were effective in combination with land cover proportion, but their importance was uncertain when temporal and spatial scales varied.The influence of landscape configuration on LST exists but should not be overestimated. Comparison of numerous variables at multiple spatiotemporal scales can help identify the influence of multiple landscape characteristics on LST variation.

TI  - Assessment of surface urban heat island across China's three main urban agglomerations
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article proposes a method for estimating the surface urban heat island intensity (SUHI) of urban areas, which addresses prior difficulties in the determination of rural contexts that may be used as a point of comparison. Based on indexes produced using this method, as well as remotely sensed datasets, the article compares the temporal and spatial characteristics of SUHIs within three major urban agglomerations (the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, the Yangtze River Delta, and the Pearl River Delta) and six typical metropolises. The article also examines the influence of socioeconomic factors on SUHI. The study revealed that this method is able to objectively monitor regional-scale SUHIs. The climate of the area studied is probably a determining factor in the seasonal variation of SUHIs. Research from the last 5 years (2010-2014) demonstrates that the urban heat island effect within the three urban agglomerations and five metropolises is serious. From 1994 to 2014, the average SUHI value for central urban areas rose from 0.4 to 2.3 K, while the total area where the SUHI value was > 3.0 K increased from 1938 to 29,690 km(2). The morphology of heat islands is significantly influenced by urbanization, meaning that heat islands within the areas studied will only continue to grow. Urban population and electricity consumption are the socioeconomic factors that exerted the greatest influence on the size of heat islands in China's major urban agglomerations. However, it is likely that economic measures designed to mitigate the UHI effect will differ in effectiveness from one urban agglomeration to another.

TI  - Geostatistical models using remotely-sensed data predict savanna tsetse decline across the interface between protected and unprotected areas in Serengeti, Tanzania
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Monitoring abundance is essential for vector management, but it is often only possible in a fraction of managed areas. For vector control programmes, sampling to estimate abundance is usually carried out at a local-scale (10s km(2)), while interventions often extend across 100s km2. Geostatistical models have been used to interpolate between points where data are available, but this still requires costly sampling across the entire area of interest. Instead, we used geostatistical models to predict local-scale spatial variation in the abundance of tsetse-vectors of human and animal African trypanosomes-beyond the spatial extent of data to which models were fitted, in Serengeti, Tanzania.2. We sampled Glossina swynnertoni and Glossina pallidipes >10 km inside the Serengeti National Park (SNP) and along four transects extending into areas where humans and livestock live. We fitted geostatistical models to data >10 km inside the SNP to produce maps of abundance for the entire region, including unprotected areas.3. Inside the SNP, the mean number of G. pallidipes caught per trap per day in dense woodland was 166 (+/- 24 SE), compared to 3 (+/- 1) in grassland. Glossina swynnertoni was more homogenous with respective means of 15 (+/- 3) and 15 (+/- 8). In general, models predicted a decline in abundance from protected to unprotected areas, related to anthropogenic changes to vegetation, which was confirmed during field survey.4. Synthesis and applications. Our approach allows vector control managers to identify sites predicted to have relatively high tsetse abundance, and therefore to design and implement improved surveillance strategies. In East and Southern Africa, trypanosomiasis is associated with wilderness areas. Our study identified pockets of vegetation which could sustain tsetse populations in farming areas outside the Serengeti National Park. Our method will assist countries in identifying, monitoring and, if necessary, controlling tsetse in trypanosomiasis foci. This has specific application to tsetse, but the approach could also be developed for vectors of other pathogens.

TI  - Examining Spatial Patterns of Urban Distribution and Impacts of Physical Conditions on Urbanization in Coastal and Inland Metropoles
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban expansion has long been a research hotspot and is often based on individual cities, but rarely has research conducted a comprehensive comparison between coastal and inland metropoles for understanding different spatial patterns of urban expansions and driving forces. We selected coastal metropoles (Shanghai and Shenzhen in China, and Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam) and inland metropoles (Ulaanbaatar in Mongolia, Lanzhou in China, and Vientiane in Laos) with various developing stages and physical conditions for examining the spatiotemporal patterns of urban expansions in the past 25 years (1990-2015). Multitemporal Landsat images with 30 m spatial resolution were used to develop urban impervious surface area (ISA) distributions and examine their dynamic changes. The impacts of elevation, slope, and rivers on spatial patterns of urban expansion were examined. This research indicates that ISA is an important variable for examining urban expansion. Coastal metropoles had much faster urbanization rates than inland metropoles. The spatial patterns of urban ISA distribution and expansion are greatly influenced by physical conditions; that is, ISA is mainly distributed in the areas with slopes of less than 10 degrees. Rivers are important geographical factors constraining urban expansion, especially in developing stages, while bridges across the rivers promote urban expansion patterns and rates. The relationships of spatial patterns of urban ISA distribution and dynamics with physical conditions provide scientific data for urban planning, management, and sustainability.

TI  - Mapping China's Ghost Cities through the Combination of Nighttime Satellite Data and Daytime Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the side-effects generated by mainland China's urbanization process is "ghost cities"-generally defined as clusters of abandoned buildings or housing structures-but there is a notable lack of studies on the basic characteristics related to this phenomenon, such as size, growth, level, distribution, scale, intensity, pattern and determinants. Through a combination of nighttime satellite data and daytime satellite data as a useful proxy, in this paper, we present the spatial pattern and temporal evolution of China's ghost cities over the last two decades. Nighttime light's rate of change in newly built areas is developed based on DMSP/OLS and Normalized Difference Built-up Index to assess a city's darkness. Results show that the ghost city problem is real, but, at least so far, confined to 22 smaller cities. However, further analysis reveals that nighttime lights change in newly built areas, following an inverted U-curve for big cities representing a reversion from positive to negative values for the trends in recent years. The methodology through the use of the complementary characteristics in time between DMSP/OLS and Landsat data in our study prove to serve as deposing the direct evidences to ascertain and quantify such social-economic phenomenon.

TI  - InSAR Baseline Estimation for Gaofen-3 Real-Time DEM Generation
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - For Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), the normal baseline is one of the main factors that affects the accuracy of the ground elevation. For Gaofen-3 (GF-3) InSAR processing, the poor accuracy of the real-time orbit determination results in a large baseline error, leads to a modulation error in azimuth and a slope error in the range for timely Digital Elevation Model (DEM) generation. In order to address this problem, a novel baseline estimation approach based on Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DEM is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the orbit fitting is executed to remove the non-linear error factor, which is different from traditional methods. Secondly, the height errors are obtained in a slant-range plane between SRTM DEM and the GF-3 generated DEM, which can be used to estimate the baseline error with a linear variation. Then, the real-time orbit can be calibrated by the baseline error. Finally, the DEM generation is performed by using the modified baseline and orbit. This approach has the merit of spatial and precise orbital free ability. Based on the results of GF-3 interferometric SAR data for Hebei, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified and the accuracy of GF-3 real-time DEM products can be improved extensively.

TI  - Human activities accelerated the degradation of saline seepweed red beaches by amplifying top-down and bottom-up forces
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes dominated by saline seepweed (Suaeda heteroptera) provide important ecosystem services such as sequestering carbon (blue carbon), maintaining healthy fisheries, and protecting shorelines. These salt marshes also constitute stunning red beach landscapes, and the resulting tourism significantly contributes to the local economy. However, land use change and degradation have led to a substantial loss of the red beach area. It remains unclear how human activities influence the top-down and bottom-up forces that regulate the distribution and succession of these salt marshes and lead to the degradation of the red beaches. We examined how bottom-up forces influenced the germination, emergence, and colonization of saline seepweed with field measurements and a laboratory experiment. We also examined whether top-down forces affected the red beach distribution by conducting a field survey for crab burrows and density, laboratory feeding trials, and waterbird investigations. The higher sediment accretion rate induced by human activities limited the establishment of new red beaches. The construction of tourism facilities and the frequent presence of tourists reduced the density of waterbirds, which in turn increased the density of crabs, intensifying the top-down forces such as predators and herbivores that drive the degradation of the coastal red beaches. Our results show that sediment accretion and plant-herbivory changes induced by human activities were likely the two primary ecological processes leading to the degradation of the red beaches. Human activities significantly shaped the abundance and distribution of the red beaches by altering both top-down and bottom-up ecological processes. Our findings can help us better understand the dynamics of salt marshes and have implications for the management and restoration of coastal wetlands.

TI  - A C-Band Geophysical Model Function for Determining Coastal Wind Speed Using Synthetic Aperture Radar
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A new geophysical model function (GMF), called C_SARMOD2, has been developed to relate high-resolution C-band normalized radar cross section (NRCS), acquired in VV polarization over the ocean, to the 10-m height wind speed. A total of 3078 RADARSAT-2 and Sentinel-1A VV-polarized synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, acquired under different wind speed conditions, were collocated with in situ buoy measurements. The paired dataset was used to derive transfer functions and coefficients of C_SARMOD2, and then to validate the wind speed retrievals. The comparison between SAR-retrieved wind speeds and buoy measurements show almost no bias and a root mean square error of 1.84 m/s. Two representative quad-and dual-polarization SAR images, acquired from coastal regions, are used as case studies to examine C_SARMOD2 performances. The case study and statistical validation results suggest that the proposed C_SARMOD2 has the potential to measure coastal wind speeds at subkilometer resolutions. Although derived from low resolution NRCS measurements, this study also confirms the great robustness of CMOD5.N and recent CMOD7 when applied to SAR data. In addition, it shows that with the new generation of SAR satellite-borne sensors, it is no longer mandatory to rely on scatterometers in order to build a GMF, which will be used for SAR applications. Such an approach is particularly important in view of the upcoming RADARSAT Constellation Mission with new polarization configurations. Moreover, it also opens new perspectives on the derivation of GMFs in HH-polarization. However, these results also suggest that for coastal areas, the increase of the resolution to define the GMF is less important than adding other geophysical parameters to improve wind retrieval performance. This advocates for the necessity of revisiting the methodologies for ocean surface wind speed measurements in coastal areas.

TI  - A Multisource Remotely Sensed Data Oriented Method for "Ghost City" Phenomenon Identification
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid urbanization in China has corresponded with rapid economic development and beneficial transformations of society that have also exacerbated many sensitive urban problems. Several "ghost cities" have emerged due to the mismatch between the speed of expansion and the rationality of urban planning, especially when the extensive city construction goes far beyond the actual peoples' demands. This paper presents a novel method for investigating "ghost city" phenomenon based on multisource remotely sensed data. Three components are included. First, coarse-to-fine built-up area extraction and multiscale integration based on nighttime light Defense Meteorological Satellite Program operational linescan system imagery, Chinese land cover/use datasets and maximum green vegetation fraction product. Second, improved "ghost city" index (IGCI) construction and discrimination of "ghost city" phenomenon comprising the rate of land urbanization, the rate of population urbanization, and the intensity of nighttime light. Third, comparison and validation of the IGCI with the traditional "ghost city" index with respect to spatio-temporal distribution and the landscape pattern of "ghost city." The proposed method was validated using entire districts in Ordos, China. Experimental results demonstrated that the IGCI takes advantages of the spatio-temporal variations of cities and the characteristics of "ghost city" phenomenon. This is also validated by means of the per capita housing construction area and the landscape expansion index, and showed that the urban construction land grows much faster than the population of Ordos. With respect to the accuracy and distribution of spatial patterns, the obtained experimental results exhibit good consistency with results from previous statistical studies.

TI  - Subdermal Ultrasound Contrast Agent Injection for Sentinel Lymph Node Identification: An Analysis of Safety and Contrast Agent Dose in Healthy Volunteers
T2  - JOURNAL OF ULTRASOUND IN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives-Mapping of the lymphatic chain for identification of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) is an important aspect of predicting outcomes for patients with breast cancer, and it is usually performed as an intraoperative procedure using blue dye and/or radiopharmaceutical agents. Recently, the use of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) has been proposed as an alternative imaging technique for this mapping. The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of subdermal administration of the ultrasound (US) contrast agent Sonazoid (GE Healthcare, Oslo, Norway) in terms of patient safety and to select the dose to be used for lymphatic applications in humans.Methods-This study was performed in 12 female volunteers who received bilateral subdermal injections of Sonazoid (1 or 2 mL dose) in the mid-upper outer quadrant of their breasts at 2 different time points. Contrast-enhanced US examinations were performed 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours after injection to identify SLNs.Results-Sentinel lymph nodes were identified within the first hour after injection as enhanced structures, and there was no significant difference by dose in the number of SLNs identified (P = .74). The volunteers only had minor adverse experiences (AEs) that resolved completely without intervention by study completion.Conclusions-The subdermal use of Sonazoid in this study showed only minor local and nonsignificant AEs that were completely resolved without any intervention. Two different doses were compared with no significant differences observed between them. Hence, the lower dose studied (1 mL) was selected for use in future clinical studies.

TI  - Identifying Groundwater Potential in Crystalline Basement Rocks Using Remote Sensing and Electromagnetic Sounding Techniques in Central Western Mozambique
T2  - NATURAL RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Exploring for groundwater in crystalline rocks in semiarid areas is a challenge because of their complex hydrogeology and low potential yields. An integrated approach was applied in central western Mozambique, in an area covered by Precambrian crystalline basement rocks. The approach combined a digital elevation model (DEM), remote sensing, and a ground-based geophysical survey. The aim was to identify groundwater zones with high potential and to identify geological structures controlling that potential. Lineaments were extracted from the DEM that had been enhanced using an adaptive-tilt, multi-directional, shading technique and a non-filtering technique to characterize the regional fracture system. The shallowness and amount of stored groundwater in the fracture zones was assessed using vegetation indices derived from Landsat 8 OLI images. Then, 14 transient electromagnetic (TEM) survey profiles were taken in different geological settings across continuous lineaments that were considered to be aligned along inferred faults. In the central lineament zones, the TEM soundings gave resistivity values of less than 300 Omega m at a depth of 20-80 m. The values varied with location. Conversely, values greater than 400 Omega m were observed at the sites away from the central zones. This contrast is probably caused by the differences in permeability and degree of weathering along the fractured zones. These differences could be key factors in determining groundwater occurrence. By integrating five water-related factors (lineament density, slope, geology, vegetation index, and proximity to lineaments), high groundwater potential zones were located in the vicinity of the lineaments. In these zones, vegetation remains active regardless of the season.

TI  - Soil erosion estimation using RUSLE and GIS techniques-a study of a plateau fringe region of tropical environment
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper tries to understand the soil erosion characteristics in a tropical plateau fringe region by the use of Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE). Soil loss estimation is an important phenomenon to understand the land degradation. An integrated method needs to be adopted in tropical plateau fringe region to estimate the soil loss. RUSLE has been adopted for the present study. The river in the basin under consideration sees its origin from a plateau top region and flows through the plateau fringe region of eastern Chotanagpur plateau, India. The present study area reflects undulated plateau fringe landform with gently sloping dissected plateau topography. The different factors like, rainfall erosivity factor (R), soil erodibility factor (K), topographic factor (LS), crop and management factor (C), and support and practice factor (P) have been enumerated using field and remote sensing data. Each factors result has also been verified with previous literature. All factors have been multiplied in GIS environment to estimate soil loss. High-magnitude soil loss region (> 10 t ha(-1) year(-1)) covers 4.88% of the total area and extends up to the upper reaches of the watershed. Topographic and soil factors best represent this loss. Low-magnitude soil loss region (< 2.5 t ha(-1) year(-1)) in the lower reaches of the watershed is a result of successful land management activity. Soil erosion is dominated process of land degradation in the upper reaches of the watershed and estimation of soil loss is an important input for land-use land-cover management. The study also inferred that RUSLE soil erosion model could be effectively used in tropical plateau fringe environment.

TI  - Very Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Complex Land Cover Mapping Using Multispectral Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite recent advances of deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in various computer vision tasks, their potential for classification of multispectral remote sensing images has not been thoroughly explored. In particular, the applications of deep CNNs using optical remote sensing data have focused on the classification of very high-resolution aerial and satellite data, owing to the similarity of these data to the large datasets in computer vision. Accordingly, this study presents a detailed investigation of state-of-the-art deep learning tools for classification of complex wetland classes using multispectral RapidEye optical imagery. Specifically, we examine the capacity of seven well-known deep convnets, namely DenseNet121, InceptionV3, VGG16, VGG19, Xception, ResNet50, and InceptionResNetV2, for wetland mapping in Canada. In addition, the classification results obtained from deep CNNs are compared with those based on conventional machine learning tools, including Random Forest and Support Vector Machine, to further evaluate the efficiency of the former to classify wetlands. The results illustrate that the full-training of convnets using five spectral bands outperforms the other strategies for all convnets. InceptionResNetV2, ResNet50, and Xception are distinguished as the top three convnets, providing state-of-the-art classification accuracies of 96.17%, 94.81%, and 93.57%, respectively. The classification accuracies obtained using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) are 74.89% and 76.08%, respectively, considerably inferior relative to CNNs. Importantly, InceptionResNetV2 is consistently found to be superior compared to all other convnets, suggesting the integration of Inception and ResNet modules is an efficient architecture for classifying complex remote sensing scenes such as wetlands.

TI  - Do characteristics of pollinator-friendly gardens predict the diversity, abundance, and reproduction of butterflies?
T2  - INSECT CONSERVATION AND DIVERSITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Pollinator declines have motivated efforts to plant nectar and host plants for butterflies and other pollinators, but whether gardens promote pollinator conservation requires further investigation. We established garden plots to determine whether plant type (native vs. exotic) and weed maintenance (low or high) influence adult butterfly abundance and species richness, and the abundance and survival of immature stages of four species (monarch, queen, black swallowtail, and gulf fritillary). To assess how predator activity and mortality of immature stages might differ inside gardens compared to other suitable habitat patches, we compared caterpillar survival on sentinel host plants placed within and outside of plots. The abundance and species richness of adult butterflies (all taxa) increased with the number of flowering plants per plot, but did not depend on plant type or weeding treatment. Exotic plots had greater adult monarch and gulf fritillary abundances, greater monarch and queen egg counts, and lower black swallowtail caterpillar counts relative to native plots. The survival of immature stages (egg to instar 5) ranged from 2 to 13% and was similar across plots, except for gulf fritillary larvae, which had higher survival in exotic plots. Monarch caterpillar mortality risk was higher on sentinel plants placed inside plots, relative to those outside of plots. This study suggests that garden plots attracted a diversity of adult butterflies and supported the reproduction of focal species. Given lower immature monarch survival within versus outside of plots, further work is needed to examine natural enemy pressure within pollinator gardens.

TI  - ADAPTIVE INTERPOLATION OF MULTIDIMENSIONAL SIGNALS FOR DIFFERENTIAL COMPRESSION
T2  - COMPUTER OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Algorithms of interpolation of multidimensional signals for differential compression are investigated. We propose an approach for constructing adaptive interpolators based on the automatic selection of an interpolating function at each point of the signal. The selection is made with the use of attributes calculated from the point's local neighborhood. An adaptive multidimensional interpolator is developed with this approach. It automatically selects an interpolating function at each point of the signal, providing improved contour interpolation accuracy. The choice is made by a decision rule based on a local characteristic of distinctness and direction of the contour. The proposed interpolator is implemented for a three-dimensional case. The interpolator switches between six interpolating functions: an averaging function and functions that take into account contours of five directions. An experimental study of the proposed algorithm is carried out on three-dimensional hyper spectral remote sensing data. The proposed interpolator allows increasing the efficiency of differential compression.

TI  - Three-Year Retention in Buprenorphine Treatment for Opioid Use Disorder Among Privately Insured Adults
T2  - PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: This study examined factors related to retention in buprenorphine treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) among privately insured patients.Methods: Patients with OUD who were newly started on buprenorphine during federal fiscal year (FY) 2011 were identified in a national private insurance claims database (MarketScan), and treatment retention (filled buprenorphine prescriptions) was evaluated through FY 2014. Proportional hazards models were used to examine demographic, clinical, and service use characteristics in FY 2011, including ongoing insurance coverage, associated with discontinuation of treatment.Results: Of 16,190 patients with OUD newly started on buprenorphine in FY 2011, 45.0% were retained in treatment for more than one year, and 13.7% for more than three years (mean +/- SD duration of retention=1.23 +/- 1.16 years). During the first three years after buprenorphine initiation, 49.3% (N=7,988) disenrolled from their insurance plan. Cox proportional hazards models showed that for every 30 days of enrollment, the risk of discontinuation declined by 10% (hazard ratio [HR]=.90, 95% confidence interval [CI]=. 90-.91). FY 2011 factors reducing discontinuation risk were age greater than the median (HR=.90, CI=.87-.93) and receipt of outpatient psychotherapy (HR=.90, CI=.86-.92); increased risk was associated with psychiatric hospitalization (HR=1.30, CI=1.24-1.36), emergency department visits (HR=1.07, CI=1.04-1.14), and additional substance use disorders (HR=1.05, CI=1.01-1.10).Conclusions: Buprenorphine treatment retention declined markedly in the first year and was substantially lower than in comparable studies from publicly funded health care systems, apparently largely due to disenrollment. The association of psychotherapy with greater retention suggests that it may be an important complement to opioid agonist treatment.

TI  - Suspended Sediment Variability at the Solimoes and Negro Confluence between May 2013 and February 2014
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - This study focuses on the confluence of two major rivers of the world, the Solimoes River (white waters) and Negro River (black waters). Surface suspended sediment samples (SSC) and spectroradiometer taken along transverse profiles at 500 m intervals over a distance of 10 km, as well as satellite images (MODIS) during the hydrological year, were used to follow suspended sediment variability. In January and February, the confluence is dominated by white waters from the Solimoes River in the two banks, and in June and July in the right bank by black waters from the Negro River and in the left bank by clear waters from the Solimoes River. We found that indirect tools, such as reflectance obtained by spectrometer or MODIS images, can be used to determine surface suspended sediments in a contrasting zone.

TI  - An Appraisal of the Potential of Landsat 8 in Estimating Chlorophyll-<i>a</i>, Ammonium Concentrations and Other Water Quality Indicators
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In-situ monitoring of lake water quality in synergy with satellite remote sensing represents the latest scientific trend in many water quality monitoring programs worldwide. This study investigated the suitability of the Operational Land Imager (OLI) instrument onboard the Landsat 8 satellite platform in accurately estimating key water quality parameters such as chlorophyll-a and nutrient concentrations. As a case study the largest freshwater body of Greece (Trichonis Lake) was used. Two Landsat 8 images covering the study site were acquired on 30 October 2013 and 30 August 2014 respectively. Near concurrent in-situ observations from two water sampling campaigns were also acquired from 22 stations across the lake under study. In-situ measurements (nutrients and chlorophyll-a concentrations) were statistically correlated with various spectral band combinations derived from the Landsat imagery of year 2014. Subsequently, the most statistically promising predictive models were applied to the satellite image of 2013 and validation was conducted using in-situ data of 2013 as reference. Results showed a relatively variable statistical relationship between the in-situ and reflectances (R logchl-a: 0.58, R NH4+: 0.26, R chl-a: 0.44). Correlation coefficient (R) values reported of up to 0.7 for ammonium concentrations and also up to 0.5 and up to 0.4 for chl-a concentration and chl-a concentrations respectively. These results represent a higher accuracy of Landsat 8 in comparison to its predecessors in the Landsat satellites series, as evidenced in the literature. Our findings suggest that Landsat 8 has a promising capability in estimating water quality components in an oligotrophic freshwater body characterized by a complete absence of any quantitative, temporal and spatial variance, as is the case of Trichonis lake. Yet, even with the presence of a lot of ground information as was the case in our study, a quantitatively accurate estimation of water quality constituents in coastal/inland waters remains a great challenge. The launch of sophisticated spaceborne sensing systems, such as that of Landsat 8, can assist in improving our ability to estimate freshwater lake properties from space.

TI  - Mitigation of RFI Main Lobes in SMOS Snapshots by Bandpass Filtering
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the beginning of the soil moisture and ocean salinity mission, the pervading presence of radio frequency interferences (RFI) has been one of the mast problematic issues. The effect of an RFI is not just a hot spot but also six tails along the three main axes, and the general presence of ripples which degrade the quality of L1 brightness temperature snapshots. The standard mitigation technique is to apply an apodization (Blackman), but such a low-pass filter leaves traces of the tails and spreads the signal of the main lobes. New RFI mitigation techniques, such as nodal sampling, are very effective in reducing the impact of tails and ripples, but in some cases they lead to the spread of the RFI main lobe, with a significant loss of data on the affected area. In this letter, we propose a new technique to reduce their spread by an adaptive thresholding on a bandpass filtered version of the snapshot, with a significant recovery of data.

TI  - On the characterization of temporal and spatial patterns of archaeological crop-marks
T2  - JOURNAL OF CULTURAL HERITAGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop-marks are the most important proxy indicators of the presence of archaeological buried remains. Their characteristics and information provided on human past depend on the nature of expected features, land use, meteorological parameters, soil and vegetation types. The interaction of these factors is crucial for the major and minor visibility of crop-marks over seasons. Hence, the need to improve the knowledge of vegetation-mark phenomenology by a multi-temporal investigation. This can be based on a holistic approach jointly using aerial prospection, information on meteorological conditions and in situ survey of soil and vegetation. Today, the availability of low cost Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) makes this approach feasible, as discussed in this paper. Herein, a multitemporal analysis from March to October 2014 has been conducted on a test site selected in the Tavoliere delle Puglie. It is one of the richest European areas in archaeological crop-marks because of the long and intense human frequentation (from Neolithic to Modern Ages) and the geo-pedological conditions which favoured the preservation of crop marks. In particular, results from the aerial observations evidenced not only during the spring season the expected crop-marks, due to cultivation, but, also, in August and October, weed marks linked to spontaneous herbaceous mainly growing due to favoured meteorological conditions (especially rain). Outputs from our investigations revealed new insights on the characteristics archaeological vegetation marks in relation with vegetation types and meteorological conditions.

TI  - Adrenocortical tumors associated with the TP53 p. R337H germline mutation can be identified during child-care consultations
T2  - JORNAL DE PEDIATRIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To evaluate the clinical features associated with adrenocortical hormone overexpression and familial cancer profiling as potential markers for early detection of adrenocortical tumors in children from South and Southeast Brazil.Methods: The clinical manifestations and anthropometric measurements of 103 children diagnosed with adrenocortical tumors were analyzed.Results: Between 1982 and 2011, 69 girls and 34 boys diagnosed with adrenocortical tumors were followed-up for a median time of 9.0 years (0-34 years). Signs of androgen overproduction atone (n=75) or associated with cortisol (n=18) were present in 90.3%. TP53 p.R337H mutation was found in 90.5% of patients. Stages I, II, III, and IV were observed in 45.6%, 27.2%, 19.4%, and 7.8% of patients, respectively. At diagnosis, there were no significant differences in height (p=0.92) and weight (p = 0.22) among children with adrenocortical tumors, but children with virilization alone had significantly higher height-for-age Z-scores (0.92 +/- 1.4) than children with hypercortisolism alone or combined (-0.32 +/- 1,8; p = 0.03). The five-year overall survival was 76.7% (SD +/- 4.2). Patients with advanced-stage disease had a significantly worse prognosis than those with limited disease (p<0.001). During follow-up, ten of 55 p.R337H carrier parents developed cancer, whereas none of the 55 non-carriers did.Conclusions: Signs of adrenocortical hormone overproduction appear early, even in cases with early-stage. These signs can be identified at the physical examination and anthropometric measurements. In southern Brazil, pediatric adrenocortical tumor is a sentinel cancer for detecting families with germline p.R337H mutation in TP53 gene. (C) 2017 Sociedade Brasileira de Pediatria.

TI  - Multitemporal Cloud Masking in the Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The exploitation of Earth observation satellite images acquired by optical instruments requires an automatic and accurate cloud detection. Multitemporal approaches to cloud detection are usually more powerful than their single scene counterparts since the presence of clouds varies greatly from one acquisition to another whereas surface can be assumed stationary in a broad sense. However, two practical limitations usually hamper their operational use: the access to the complete satellite image archive and the required computational power. This work presents a cloud detection and removal methodology implemented in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform in order to meet these requirements. The proposed methodology is tested for the Landsat-8 mission over a large collection of manually labeled cloud masks from the Biome dataset. The quantitative results show state-of-the-art performance compared with mono-temporal standard approaches, such as FMask and ACCA algorithms, yielding improvements between 4-5% in classification accuracy and 3-10% in commission errors. The algorithm implementation within the Google Earth Engine and the generated cloud masks for all test images are released for interested readers.

TI  - Analyzing the diurnal variations of land surface temperatures for surface urban heat island studies: Is time of observation of remote sensing data important?
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) images show the nonexistence of surface urban heat island (SUHI) effect over Jaipur and Ahmedabad cities during the daytime, whereas a clear picture of SUHI effect during nighttime. But in Ludhiana, diurnal SUHI effect has been observed. Hence the contrast diurnal LST pattern of three cities in India has been analyzed in the study. The analysis indicates that nighttime images can be used for the analysis of SUHI effect over any area. The use of daytime images for this analysis depends on the surface cover and time of observation which may show a false temporary SUHI effect. Time of observation is very important for analyzing the efficacy of remote sensing data for diurnal LST variations for different land covers and SUHI studies. SUHI varies during the day, and it is more significant during the evening/night. Diurnal LST relationship at different time intervals with various land surface parameters like vegetation, built-up, soil, etc. has also been investigated in the present research. Various land surfaces play a significant role in the diurnal variations of LSTs. The study discusses the adequacy of the observation time, from the viewpoint of heat island measures strategies.

TI  - Investigating spatio-temporal surface urban heat island growth over Jaipur city using geospatial techniques
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban heat island (UHI) effect is one of the major impacts at local scale. A criterion based on UHIindex and transect methods have been proposed to estimate the spatio-temporal surface UHI (SUHI) growth. The study has been carried out to analyze the spatial and seasonal variations of SUHI growth over Jaipur city of the years from 2003 to 2015 for six years' time interval using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. Analysis of land surface temperature (LST) data shows that significant SUHI growth exists over the study area. UHIindex has been used to mark the locations of hot spots (HS) of Jaipur city. Significant increase of up to 230% in the area of HS has been observed between 2003 and 2015. Main focus of the research is to find the increase in area, over a period of time, for fixed temperature gradient from the LST of HS. This increase in area can be used as a measure to indicate UHI growth of the city. Isothermal lines representing fixed temperature difference with respect to LST of HS have been created. Increase in area enclosed by different isothermal lines varies from 20% to above 400% during different seasons between 2003 and 2015.

AB  - Ways of combined usage of data obtained by the satellite sounding of the marine surface along with modeling approaches are considered. The technique of data application is proposed to combine satellite surveys and forecasts using the hydrodynamic Princeton Ocean Model (POM). Based on this, information is provided on transfer directions, particle sizes, and particulate matter concentrations at the time of complete or partial absence of satellite images. The satellite multispectral images were treated using an approach based on the calculations of the total indices of light absorption or backscattering by seawater containing particulate matter of various origins. As the information sources, data from the MODIS device of the Aqua satellite for 2013-2014 were used. The analysis of the correspondence of modeling and survey information confirmed the efficiency of regular usage of satellite data.

T2  - ACS SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We generated "sentinel" bacteria that respond to the biomarker nitric oxide (NO) and produce a homogeneous and strong fluorescent response. Our dual-plasmid system consists of a signal "relay" vector that employs an NO-responsive promoter that amplifies the native signal (via expression of T7 Polymerase (T7Pol)) to a second vector responsible for GFP expression. Importantly, to achieve an optimal "sentinel" response, we developed strategies that balance the transcriptional load within cells by altering (i) translation and (ii) activity of the T7Pol. Our optimized genetic circuitry was then used to transform commensal E. coli Nissle, as a proof-of-concept toward an ingestible cell-based sensor for Crohn's disease (CD) that, in turn, is marked by elevated levels of intestinal NO. Thus, the "biosensors" demonstrated here may serve as a simple diagnostic tool, contrasting the standard of care including colonoscopies or biopsies.

AB  - Environmental impact of mining is studied by two criteria: aerosol pollution and vegetation cover conditionusing the data of long-term satellite observations. In terms of the mining and processing industry on the Kola Peninsula, environmental impact is predicted as overlapping of aerosol pollution areas and decrease in the vegetation index. It is shown that predicted boundaries of impact-zones match in case of one or two sources of effect, and unmatch in case of many sources. The proposed approach to integration of the remote sensing data allows differentiating between the environmental impact of mining and natural change of the vegetation cover.

TI  - Setting up a water quality ensemble forecast for coastal ecosystems: a case study of the southern North Sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROINFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Prediction systems, such as the coastal ecosystem models, often incorporate complex non-linear ecological processes. There is an increasing interest in the use of probabilistic forecasts instead of deterministic forecasts in cases where the inherent uncertainties in the prediction system are important. The primary goal of this study is to set up an operational ensemble forecasting system for the prediction of the Chlorophyll-a concentration in coastal waters, using the Generic Ecological Model. The input ensemble is generated from perturbed model process parameters and external forcings through Latin Hypercube Sampling with Dependence. The forecast performance of the ensemble prediction is assessed using several forecast verification metrics that can describe the forecast accuracy, reliability and discrimination. The verification is performed against in-situ measurements and remote sensing data. The ensemble forecast moderately outperforms the deterministic prediction at the coastal in-situ measurement stations. The proposed ensemble forecasting system is therefore a promising tool to provide enhanced water quality prediction for coastal ecosystems which, with further inclusion of other uncertainty sources, could be used for operational forecasting.

TI  - Improving Landslide Detection from Airborne Laser Scanning Data Using Optimized Dempster-Shafer
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A detailed and state-of-the-art landslide inventory map including precise landslide location is greatly required for landslide susceptibility, hazard, and risk assessments. Traditional techniques employed for landslide detection in tropical regions include field surveys, synthetic aperture radar techniques, and optical remote sensing. However, these techniques are time consuming and costly. Furthermore, complications arise for the generation of accurate landslide location maps in these regions due to dense vegetation in tropical forests. Given its ability to penetrate vegetation cover, high-resolution airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is typically employed to generate accurate landslide maps. The object-based technique generally consists of many homogeneous pixels grouped together in a meaningful way through image segmentation. In this paper, in order to address the limitations of this approach, the final decision is executed using Dempster-Shafer theory (DST) rule combination based on probabilistic output from object-based support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifiers. Therefore, this research proposes an efficient framework by combining three object-based classifiers using the DST method. Consequently, an existing supervised approach (i.e., fuzzy-based segmentation parameter optimizer) was adopted to optimize multiresolution segmentation parameters such as scale, shape, and compactness. Subsequently, a correlation-based feature selection (CFS) algorithm was employed to select the relevant features. Two study sites were selected to implement the method of landslide detection and evaluation of the proposed method (subset "A" for implementation and subset "B" for the transferrable). The DST method performed well in detecting landslide locations in tropical regions such as Malaysia, with potential applications in other similarly vegetated regions.

TI  - Exhaust Air Particle PCR as a new method for the hygienic monitoring of IVC reared rodent colonies: A contribution to the reduction of experimental animals
T2  - BERLINER UND MUNCHENER TIERARZTLICHE WOCHENSCHRIFT
M3  - Article
AB  - The hygienic status of laboratory animals is pivotal for animal health as well as for the reliability and reproducibility of experimental results in biomedical research. Common health monitoring strategies of individually ventilated cage (IVC) reared rodent colonies involve sentinel animals exposed to soiled bedding of the colony to monitor. After an adequate exposure time these sentinel mice representing all animals housed in the respective racks are euthanized and examined for unwanted organisms which results in higher numbers of animals used for the sole purpose of health monitoring. Sentinel monitoring is subject to limitations: IVCs prevent transmission of airborne pathogens; transmission of unwanted organisms to sentinels by used bedding is uncertain due to dilution and susceptibility of sentinels to some pathogens is low.Screening of exhaust air dust of IVC racks for nucleic acids of unwanted pathogens is a relatively new and promising approach to improve health monitoring in IVC systems whilst avoiding the additional use of animals for this purpose. This review article summarizes current studies on the new health monitoring technology. Exhaust Air Particle (EAP) PCR outperformed sentinel monitoring by far.Infections have been detected newly or at lower prevalence. Hence, laboratory animals can be replaced in biomedical research and knowledge on the hygienic status of rodent colonies can be improved. Since the technology has a broad applicability the possible impact as replacement according to the 3Rs is remarkable.

TI  - Short-term solar irradiance forecasting via satellite/model coupling
T2  - SOLAR ENERGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The short-term (0-3 h) prediction of solar insolation for renewable energy production is a problem well-suited to satellite-based techniques. The spatial, spectral, temporal and radiometric resolution of instrumentation hosted on the geostationary platform allows these satellites to describe the current cloud spatial distribution and optical properties. These properties relate directly to the transient properties of the downwelling solar irradiance at the surface, which come in the form of 'ramps' that pose a central challenge to energy load balancing in a spatially distributed network of solar farms. The short-term evolution of the cloud field may be approximated to first order simply as translational, but care must be taken in how the advection is handled and where the impacts are assigned. In this research, we describe how geostationary satellite observations are used with operational cloud masking and retrieval algorithms, wind field data from Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP), and radiative transfer calculations to produce short-term forecasts of solar insolation for applications in solar power generation. The scheme utilizes retrieved cloud properties to group pixels into contiguous cloud objects whose future positions are predicted using four-dimensional (space + time) model wind fields, selecting steering levels corresponding to the cloud height properties of each cloud group. The shadows associated with these clouds are adjusted for sensor viewing parallax displacement and combined with solar geometry and terrain height to determine the actual location of cloud shadows. For mid/high-level clouds at mid-latitudes and high solar zenith angles, the combined displacements from these geometric considerations are non-negligible. The cloud information is used to initialize a radiative transfer model that computes the direct and diffuse-sky solar insolation at both shadow locations and intervening clear-sky regions. Here, we describe the formulation of the algorithm and validate its performance against Surface Radiation (SURFRAD; Augustine et al., 2000, 2005) network observations. Typical errors range from 8.5% to 17.2% depending on the complexity of cloud regimes, and an operational demonstration outperformed persistence-based forecasting of Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) under all conditions by similar to 10 W/m(2).

T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonal water temperature data from 388 large Canadian lakes (area >= 100 km(2)) were used to develop improved empirical tools for forecasting the impacts of climate change on the magnitude (T-P) and time of occurrence (J(P)) of annual peak surface water temperatures. Analyses of remotely sensed open-water temperatures with sinusoidal models produced estimates of T-P and J(P) predominately better than other models. Those estimates were analyzed for lake and climate patterns. Linear mixed effects regression produced a significant model of T-P with fixed positive effects for mean July and annual air temperatures and lake perimeter, but negative effects with mean July and annual percent cloud cover, mean annual precipitation, range of monthly mean global clear sky radiation, area, and elevation. Subsets of the estimates with mean, maximum, or Secchi depth values produced similarly significant models with negative depth coefficients. J(P) was relatively invariant but small, significant lake and climate effects were detected. The best models identified in our analyses will be useful tools for forecasting how climate change will alter aspects of the limnetic seasonal water temperature cycle that strongly influences the species composition and productivity of their fisheries.

AB  - The problems of remote monitoring systems for detection and classification of anomalous phenomena in the environment with appropriate algorithms and software are considered. The technique of detecting and classifying anomalous phenomena in the investigated medium suggested in this paper allows us to solve the problems of measurement and detection on a real time basis. A scientific basis for multi-channel remote monitoring systems has been developed. New methods and algorithms for processing remote sensing data and formation of updated databases for improving our knowledge about environment were used. The system is based on modern computer technologies and high-performance computing systems. It is clear that the analysis of integrated contact and remote measurements can increase reliability of estimations of parameters of natural systems and solve the problem of planning of these measurements. Application of remote monitoring is related in many cases to the acceptance of the statistical decision about the existence of any given phenomenon on a surveyed part of the study site. One of the features of information gathering for such a decision is the impossibility of obtaining statistical samples in large amounts. Therefore, it is necessary to develop the optimum algorithms of identification of random signals characterized by the samples of limited data under the conditions of a priori parametric indefiniteness.

TI  - A Statistical Variable Selection Solution for RFM Ill-Posedness and Overparameterization Problems
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Parameters of a rational function model (RFM), known as rational polynomial coefficients, are commonly redundant and highly correlated, leading to the problems of overparameterization and ill-posedness, respectively. In this paper, an innovative two-stage statistical method, called an uncorrelated and statistically significant RFM (USS-RFM), is presented to deal directly with these two problems. In the first stage, the proposed method employs a novel correlation analysis, which aims to exclude highly correlated coefficients. In the second stage, a new iterative significance test is applied to detect and remove unnecessary coefficients from the RFM. The proposed method is implemented on eight real data sets captured by Cartosat-1, GeoEye-1, Pleiades, Spot-3, and WorldView-3 platforms. The results are evaluated in terms of the positioning accuracy, model degrees of freedom, processing time, and figure condition analysis. Experimental results prove the efficiency of the proposed method, showing that it could achieve subpixel accuracy even for cases with five ground control points. The proposed USS-RFM is compared to an l(1)-norm regularization (L1R) technique and a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm in the terrain-dependent case of the RFM. The results demonstrate the superiority of the USS-RFM, which performs better than the alternative methods in terms of positioning accuracy by more than 50% on average. Moreover, the RFMs resulted from the USS-RFM demonstrate to have higher degrees of freedom and, as a result, higher level of reliability. From the perspective of processing time, USS-RFM and L1R are similar while both are much faster than PSO.

TI  - Comparison of univariate and multivariate geographically weighted regression for estimating air temperature over Iran
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Station recording air temperature (T-a) has limited spatial coverage, especially in unpopulated areas. Since temperature can change greatly both spatially and temporally, stations data are often inadequate for meteorology and subsequently climatology studies. Time series of moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature (T-s) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) products, combined with digital elevation model (DEM), albedo from Era-Interim and meteorological data from 2006 to 2015, were used to estimate daily mean air temperature over Iran. Geographically weighted regression was applied to compare univariate and multivariate model accuracy. In the first model, which only interfered with land surface temperature (LST), the results indicate a weak performance with coefficient of determination up to 91% and RMSE of 1.08 to 2.9 A degrees C. The mean accuracy of a four-variable model (which used LST, elevation, slope, NDVI) slightly increased (6.6% of the univariate model accuracy) when compared to univariate model. RMSE dropped by 19% of the first model. By addition albedo in the third model, the coefficient of determination increased significantly. This increase was 32% of the univariate model and 23.75% of the 4-variable model accuracy. The statistical comparison between the three models revealed that there is significant improvement in air estimation by applying the geographically weighted regression (GWR) method with interfering LST, NDVI, elevation, slope, and albedo with mean absolute RMSE of 0.62 A degrees C and mean absolute R (2) of 0.99. In order to better illustrate the third model, t values were spatially mapped at 0.05 level.

TI  - Automated extraction of meandering river morphodynamics from multitemporal remotely sensed data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - We introduce PyRIS, an automated, process- based software for extracting extensive meandering and anabranching river morphodynamics from multitemporal satellite imagery, including a unique ability to quantify river bars dynamics. PyRIS provides three main computations: (i) detection of planform centerline including complex river patterns, (ii) computation of migration vectors between subsequent centerlines, and (iii) analysis of sediment bars dynamics. PyRIS was validated against several test cases in the Amazon River basin, specifically i) main channel extraction from the anabranching Amazon river, ii) migration analysis following a large cutoff on the Ucayali River and iii) detection of sediment bar migration on the Xingu River. Tests prove the capability of PyRIS to detect the main channel in anabranching structures and chute cutoffs. PyRIS can extract extensive morphodynamic information with unprecedented automation levels and reasonable computational effort (5 h for 28 Landsat images of a 240 km reach of the Xingu River on a 3.20 GHz Intel).

AB  - The Rufiji Delta is a critical ecosystem that comprises 50% of mangrove cover in mainland Tanzania, providing a plethora of ecosystem services that support diverse livelihood options. However, the rate of mangrove loss, especially due to rapid expansion of rice farming in the delta, is alarming. Landsat imagery from 1991, 2000, 2009 and 2015 was used to estimate total current mangrove area in the delta. There has been loss of mangroves from 51,941 ha estimated in 1991 to 45,519 ha in 2015, which is an annual loss rate of 0.52%. Clearance for rice farming expanded from 5,344 ha in 1991 to 12,642 ha in 2015. The average mangrove annual loss and gain from 1991 to 2015 were estimated to be 378 ha and 109 ha respectively. The consequences of this loss are not well appreciated. The present analysis serves as an updated baseline to inform the urgent need for coordination of multiple stakeholders to address the complex drivers of mangrove loss to secure the future of mangroves and ecosystem services in the delta.

TI  - Precise orbit determination of the Sentinel-3A altimetry satellite using ambiguity-fixed GPS carrier phase observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEODESY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-3 mission takes routine measurements of sea surface heights and depends crucially on accurate and precise knowledge of the spacecraft. Orbit determination with a targeted uncertainty of less than 2 cm in radial direction is supported through an onboard Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, a Doppler Orbitography and Radiopositioning Integrated by Satellite instrument, and a complementary laser retroreflector for satellite laser ranging. Within this study, the potential of ambiguity fixing for GPS-only precise orbit determination (POD) of the Sentinel-3 spacecraft is assessed. A refined strategy for carrier phase generation out of low-level measurements is employed to cope with half-cycle ambiguities in the tracking of the Sentinel-3 GPS receiver that have so far inhibited ambiguity-fixed POD solutions. Rather than explicitly fixing double-difference phase ambiguities with respect to a network of terrestrial reference stations, a single-receiver ambiguity resolution concept is employed that builds on dedicated GPS orbit, clock, and wide-lane bias products provided by the CNES/CLS (Centre National d'Aetudes Spatiales/Collecte Localisation Satellites) analysis center of the International GNSS Service. Compared to float ambiguity solutions, a notably improved precision can be inferred from laser ranging residuals. These decrease from roughly 9 mm down to 5 mm standard deviation for high-grade stations on average over low and high elevations. Furthermore, the ambiguity-fixed orbits offer a substantially improved cross-track accuracy and help to identify lateral offsets in the GPS antenna or center-of-mass (CoM) location. With respect to altimetry, the improved orbit precision also benefits the global consistency of sea surface measurements. However, modeling of the absolute height continues to rely on proper dynamical models for the spacecraft motion as well as ground calibrations for the relative position of the altimeter reference point and the CoM.

AB  - Breast cancer treatment is multidisciplinary. Most women with early-stage breast cancer are candidates for breast-conserving surgery with radiotherapy or mastectomy. The risk of local recurrence and the chance of survival do not differ with these approaches. Sentinel node biopsy is used for axillary staging, and individualized approaches are minimizing the need for axillary dissection in women with positive sentinel nodes. Adjuvant systemic therapy is used in most women based on proven survival benefit, and molecular profiling to individualize treatment based on risk is now a clinical reality for patients with hormone receptor-positive cancers.

TI  - Fragmentation and connectivity of the natural cover at county level in Costa Rica, during 2000 and 2015 years
T2  - REVISTA GEOGRAFICA DE AMERICA CENTRAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This research proposes the formulation of a fragmentation / connectivity index that assesses the condition of natural cover at the canton level for Costa Rica based on spatial distribution considering the variables: area of the county, the natural coverage area, the number of fragments and distance of neighborhood between the fragments of the natural cover, for the years 2000 and 2015. The images Landsat 7 for the year 2000 and Landsat 8 for the year 2015 were used where the land use categories for each year were derived through supervised classification with ERDAS software and with ArcMap10.5 biometric indices were estimated using the Vargas equation (2008) which was modified for its application. Within the results, we identified the cantons that present greater or lesser fragmentation and connectivity of their natural coverage during the study period.

TI  - Evaluation of multi-temporal sentinel-2 capabilities for estimation of leaf chlorophyll concentration
T2  - BIOSCIENCE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing can provide a fast and non-destructive estimation of leaf chlorophyll content and consequently can be used in plant nitrogen status evaluation. Such evaluation can be of valuable assistance in modifying the fertilization strategy in an area of interest. Sentinel-2 has the advantage of the high spatial, spectral and temporal resolution and therefore can be considered a powerful tool in such studies. Furthermore, it incorporates three new spectral bands in the red-edge region which enhances its capabilities for vegetation studies. The present work addresses the comparison between the sensitivity of three approaches in processing Sentinel 2 data for the estimation of leaf chlorophyll concentrations of wheat and olive cultivated in a selected area in the North West of Sinai Peninsula, Egypt. These approaches included the use of reflectance data of selected bands and vegetation indices with or without the red edge bands. The proposed approach has an overall accuracy expressed as coefficient of determination of 0.90 between the actual and predicted chlorophyll. This approach utilized neural networks and used two vegetation indices the Chlorophyll vegetation index (CVI) and the Inverted Red-Edge Chlorophyll Index (IRECI) in addition to the plant type.

TI  - Complex Crustal Deformation of the 2016 Kaikoura, New Zealand, Earthquake Revealed by ALOS-2
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE SEISMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2016 Kaikoura earthquake is one of the most complex earthquakes recorded by modern observation techniques. A comprehensive understanding of this event has not yet been achieved despite analysis of observed data. To advance clarification of the mechanism of the earthquake, we revealed detailed surface displacement caused by the earthquake using Advanced Land Observing Satellite 2 Synthetic Aperture Radar data and constructed fault models comprising rectangular planes with a uniform slip. Remarkably large and intricate surface displacements were detected in two distinct areas: (1) a southwestern part around the Hundalee fault and The Humps fault zone and (2) a northeastern part around the Kekerengu fault and the little recognized Papatea fault. A gap where the displacement is relatively small exists between the two major zones of faulting. In the southwestern part, extremely complicated displacements are disclosed in detail and have been modeled as an intricate set of six faults that include previously unknown structures. In the northeastern part, the largest displacement of similar to 9 m was detected along the Kekerengu and Papatea faults. The modeled fault plane along the Kekerengu fault shows a large reverse and dextral slip and possibly released the largest seismic moment of all modeled fault segments. The constructed fault model also explains far-field displacement, indicating that the dominant slip direction was right lateral, consistent with the strain field in this region. The calculated change of Coulomb failure stress (Delta CFS) suggests that the static stress changes by the southwestern fault segments may have contributed to triggering the northeastern fault segments.

TI  - Detecting Vegetation Change in Response to Confining Elephants in Forests Using MODIS Time-Series and BFAST
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Afromontane forests are biodiversity hotspots and provide essential ecosystem services. However, they are under pressure as a result of an expanding human population and the impact of climate change. In many instances electric fencing has become a necessary management strategy to protect forest integrity and reduce human-wildlife conflict. The impact of confining hitherto migratory elephant populations within forests remains unknown, and monitoring largely inaccessible areas is challenging. We explore the application of remote sensing to monitor the impact of confinement, employing the Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) time-series decomposition method over a 15-year period on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) (MOD13Q1) datasets for two Kenyan forests. Results indicated that BFAST was able to identify disturbances from anthropogenic, fire and elephant damage. Sequential monitoring enabled the detection of gradual changes in the forest canopy, with degradation and regeneration being observed in both sites. Annual rates of forest loss in both areas were significantly lower than reported in other studies on Afromontane forests, suggesting that installing fences has reduced land-use conversion from human-related disturbances. Negative changes in EVI were predominantly gradual degradation rather than large-scale, abrupt clearings of the forest. Results presented here demonstrate that BFAST can be used to monitor biotic and abiotic drivers of change in Afromontane forests.

TI  - Population-based study of the sensitivity of axillary ultrasound imaging in the preoperative staging of node-positive invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundPreoperative staging of the axilla is important to allow decisions regarding neoadjuvant treatment and the management of the axilla. Invasive lobular carcinoma metastases are difficult to detect because of the infiltrative pattern of the nodal spread. In this study the sensitivity of preoperative axillary staging between invasive lobular (ILC) and ductal (IDC) carcinoma was compared.MethodsAll women diagnosed with pure ILC or IDC in the West of Scotland in 2012-2014 were identified from a database maintained prospectively within the Managed Clinical Network. Pretreatment axillary ultrasound imaging (AUS), core biopsy and fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) results were compared between ILC and IDC.ResultsSome 602 women with ILC and 4199 with IDC had undergone axillary surgery, of whom 209 and 1402 respectively had nodal metastases. Pretreatment AUS sensitivity was significantly lower in ILC than in IDC (321 versus 501 per cent respectively, P<0001; OR 047, 95 per cent c.i. 034 to 064). Core biopsy had equally high sensitivity of 86 per cent in both subtypes; however, FNAC was significantly less sensitive in both ILC (55 per cent; P=0003) and IDC (756 per cent; P=0006). Multivariable analysis revealed that cT3-4 status and symptomatic presentation were both significant in predicting nodal metastasis in patients with ILC and false-negative AUS findings (OR 377, 95 per cent c.i. 169 to 842, P=0001; and OR 192, 124 to 298, P=0003, respectively).ConclusionAUS is inferior in detecting axillary node metastasis in ILC compared with IDC. Women with cT3-4 lobular carcinoma may benefit from ultrasound-guided axillary biopsy regardless of the ultrasonographic appearance of the nodes.Less sensitive in lobular carcinoma

TI  - Sentinel node biopsy in early oral squamous cell carcinomas: Long-term follow-up and nodal failure analysis
T2  - ORAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Evaluate the reliability of sentinel node biopsy (SNB) in T1/T2 cN0 oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), and compare recurrence-free time (RFT) and overall survival (OS) between patients undergoing SNB and neck dissection (ND).Patients and methods: Patients with T1/T2 cN0 OSCC underwent SNB followed by systematic ND in the first cohort and SNB followed by selective ND in case of positive sentinel nodes (SN) in the second cohort.Results: A total of 229 patients were followed (first cohort 50, second cohort 179). SNs were successfully detected in 93.9% (215/229) of cases. Median follow-up was 5.6 years. Recurrence occurred in 38/215 patients, with isolated nodal recurrence in 18/215 patients. At 5 years, the rate of recurrence-free patients was 80.0% and the rate of patients without isolated nodal recurrence was 90.4%. Negative predictive value of SNB was 92.7%. No statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups regarding RFT and OS. In 83% (10/12) of ipsilateral isolated nodal recurrences, primary tumor was located in anterior part of oral cavity. Only 43% (3/7) of SN+ patients with nodal recurrence were eligible for salvage surgery, compared to 91% (10/11) of SN-patients. SNB resulted in fewer complications than ND (8% vs 28%, p < 0.0001).Conclusion: SNB is a reliable staging tool for T1/T2 cN0 OSCC, without adverse effect on patient survival and fewer complications. No late recurrences occurred in long-term follow-up. Close follow-up is mandatory for SN+ patients, who are at higher risk of nodal recurrence and have worse prognosis.

TI  - Vegetation Water Use Based on a Thermal and Optical Remote Sensing Model in the Mediterranean Region of Donana
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET) is a central process in the climate system, is a major component in the terrestrial water budget, and is responsible for the distribution of water and energy on land surfaces especially in arid and semiarid areas. In order to inform water management decisions especially in scarce water environments, it is important to assess ET vegetation use by differentiating irrigated socio-economic areas and natural ecosystems. The global remote sensing ET product MOD16 has proven to underestimate ET in semiarid regions where ET is very sensitive to soil moisture. The objective of this research was to test whether a modified version of the remote sensing ET model PT-JPL, proven to perform well in drylands at Eddy Covariance flux sites using the land surface temperature as a proxy to the surface moisture status (PT-JPL-thermal), could be up-scaled at regional levels introducing also a new formulation for net radiation from various MODIS products. We applied three methods to track the spatial and temporal characteristics of ET in the World Heritage UNESCO Donana region: (i) a locally calibrated hydrological model (WATEN), (ii) the PT-JPL-thermal, and (iii) the global remote sensing ET product MOD16. The PT-JPL-thermal showed strong agreement with the WATEN ET in-situ calibrated estimates (rho = 0.78, rho(1month-lag) = 0.94) even though the MOD16 product did not (rho = 0.48). The PT-JPL-thermal approach has proven to be a robust remote sensing model for detecting ET at a regional level in Mediterranean environments and it requires only air temperature and incoming solar radiation from climatic databases apart from freely available satellite products.

TI  - Snow Cover Mapping Using Polarization Fraction Variation With Temporal RADARSAT-2 C-Band Full-Polarimetric SAR Data Over the Indian Himalayas
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing is an indispensable tool for Earth observation over large areal extent. Snow cover extent monitoring has been one such application where microwave sensors have been a popular choice due to their sensitivity toward the dielectric property. Snow is a dynamic matter since its dielectric state is dependent on climatic factors prevailing locally around it. In the literature, the polarization fraction (PF) has been used for landcover characterization. In this paper, we utilize the seasonal variation of the PF for mapping snow cover over the Himalayan terrain. Temporal variation of the strength in the polarized return due to change in landcover and season is the prime motivation behind this approach. In addition, the effect of SAR data acquisition time on mapping algorithms is considered in this work which is seldom discussed in the literature. Furthermore, a study is conducted to analyze the seasonal variation in the entropy (H) and the scattering type (a) parameters over the bare snow-covered ground and the forested areas. The seasonal response of the terrain in the H/a plane corresponding to specific scattering characteristics is analyzed. The applicability of the approach is tested with RADARSAT-2 (FQ28) C-band full polarimetric image pairs over the Manali-Dhundi region, Himachal Pradesh, India, located in the western Hindu-Kush Himalayas. The snow cover map is explicitly validated with in situ observatory measurements and optical satellite imagery.

TI  - Bird conservation in the Carpathian Ecoregion in light of long-term land use trends and conservation responsibility
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use change alters species' abundance and distributions by affecting habitat availability and quality. The decline of bird populations worldwide is of major concern, and habitat protection and restoration are primary conservation actions. However, conservation decisions largely consider only short-term habitat changes and species' population dynamics in a given area. Disregarding long term modifications in species' available habitat, and the role of a given population for a species' global population may lead to misdirected conservation action. Our goal here was to combine the assessment of conservation responsibility, with that of century-long available habitat dynamics, in order to inform better conservation practice. We compiled available habitat data for 170 bird species in the Carpathian Region from 1860 to 2010 from historic maps and satellite data. We analyzed these species' range distributions, IUCN extinction risk and population trends, and we identified 29 species of high conservation responsibility, and all of them were forest or and grassland specialists. Furthermore, we found major land use trends including cropland abandonment and increase in forests and grasslands that resulted in increases in potential habitat for the species for which the Carpathians have high conservation responsibility. The loss of row-crop agriculture, on the other hand, reduced habitat for species for which the Carpathians do not have high responsibility, and thus subsidizing agriculture may not be warranted from a conservation perspective. More broadly, many regions worldwide are undergoing rapid land use changes, and we suggest that these should be analyzed relative to a given regions' conservation responsibility to see if there are opportunities for conservation, i.e., cases similar to the Carpathians, where conservation efforts 'only' have to foster current land use trends, and make them permanent, rather than to try to revert the loss of habitat.

T2  - ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - International Symposium on Polar Ice, Polar Climate, and Polar Change
CL  - Boulder, CO
AB  - The presence of leads with open water or thin ice is an important feature of the Arctic sea ice cover. Leads regulate the heat, gas and moisture fluxes between the ocean and atmosphere and are areas of high ice growth rates during periods of freezing conditions. Here, an algorithm providing an automatic lead detection based on synthetic aperture radar images is described that can be applied to a wide range of Sentinel-1 scenes. By using both the HH and the HV channels instead of single co-polarised observations the algorithm is able to classify more leads correctly. The lead classification algorithm is based on polarimetric features and textural features derived from the grey-level co-occurrence matrix. The Random Forest classifier is used to investigate the importance of the individual features for lead detection. The precision-recall curve representing the quality of the classification is used to define threshold for a binary lead/sea ice classification. The algorithm is able to produce a lead classification with more that 90% precision with 60% of all leads classified. The precision can be increased by the cost of the amount of leads detected. Results are evaluated based on comparisons with Sentinel-2 optical satellite data.

TI  - Introducing a new framework for mapping subsidence vulnerability indices (SVIs): ALPRIFT
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Proof-of-concept (PoC) is presented for a new framework to serve as a proactive capability to mapping subsidence vulnerability of Shabestar plain of approximately 500 km(2) overlaying an important aquifer supporting a region renowned for diversity of agricultural products. This aquifer is one of 12 in East and West Azerbaijan provinces, Northwest Iran, which surround the distressed Lake Urmia, with its water table declined approximately 4 m in between 2004 and 2014. The decline of water table in aquifers undermines their soil texture and structure by exposure to pressures under their weight and thereby induce or trigger land subsidence. Inspired by the DRASTIC framework to map intrinsic aquifer vulnerability to anthropogenic pollution, the paper introduces the ALPRIFT framework for subsidence, which comprises the seven data layers of Aquifer media (A), Land use (L), Pumping of groundwater, Recharge (R), aquifer thickness Impact (I), Fault distance (F) and decline of water Table (T). The paper prescribes rates to account for local variations and weights for the relative importance of the data layers. The proof-of-concept for ALPRIFT is supported by the correlation of Subsidence Vulnerability Indices (SVIs) with measured subsidence values, which renders a value of 0.5 but improves significantly to 0.86 when using fuzzy logic. Similar improvements are suggested by the ROC/AUC performance metric. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All lights reserved.

AB  - Context: Measures of population health at the subcounty level are needed to identify areas for focused interventions and to support local health improvement activities.Objective: To extend the County Health Rankings population health measurement model to the ZIP code level using widely available hospital and census-derived data sources.Design: Retrospective administrative data study.Setting: Missouri.Population: Missouri FY 2012-2014 hospital inpatient, outpatient, and emergency department discharge encounters (N = 36 176 377) and 2015 Nielsen data.Main Outcome Measures: ZIP code-level health factors and health outcomes indices.Results: Statistically significant measures of association were observed between the ZIP code-level population health indices and published County Health Rankings indices. Variation within counties was observed in both urban and rural areas. Substantial variation of the derived measures was observed at the ZIP code level with 20 (17.4%) Missouri counties having ZIP codes in both the top and bottom quintiles of health factors and health outcomes. Thirty of the 46 (65.2%) counties in the top 2 county quintiles had ZIP codes in the bottom 2 quintiles.Conclusions: This proof-of-concept analysis suggests that readily available hospital and census-derived data can be used to create measures of population health at the subcounty level. These widely available data sources could be used to identify areas of potential need within counties, engage community stakeholders, and target interventions.

TI  - The effects of cyanobacterial blooms on MODIS-L2 data products in the southern Caspian Sea
T2  - OCEANOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - MODIS satellite imageries with minimal cloud cover (<25%) were used to extract cyanobacteria index, floating algea index, fluorescence line height, chlorophyll-a and sea surface temperature products, for seven days concurrent with blooms. The results showed a positive correlation between cyanobacteria index and chlorophyll-a (R = 0.74, p <= 0.05 and R= 0.75, p <= 0.05 for 2005 and 2010 respectively), and a negative correlation between the cyanobacteria index and fluorescence line height (R = -0.74, p <= 0.05 and R = -0.93, p <= 0.005 for 2005 and 2010 respectively). Further analysis showed that considering Fluorescence Line Height is not sufficient to detect the cyanobacterial blooms in the offshore area. However, the results indicated a weak correlation between cyanobacteria index and floating algae index (R = -0.42, p = 0.34 and R= -0.47, p = 0.29 for 2005 and 2010 respectively). The results also indicated that the irregular increases in the cyanobacteria index and chlorophyll-a in the study region was an operational index for the incidence of cyanobacterial bloom, where the surface wind speed and temperature conditions were <4 m s(-1) and >= 30 degrees C, respectively. Finally, a linear model was defined for monitoring, which determines occurrence or non-occurrence of cyanobacteria bloom based on daily monitoring of the changes of products. In order to evaluate the proposed model, its efficiency was tested on datasets at different times and locations, and the results were consistent with field reports, as expected.

TI  - Detection of micrometastasis in axillary lymph nodes of breast carcinoma patients and its association with clinical outcome
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF PATHOLOGY AND MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context: There is heterogeneity in the clinical behavior of breast carcinoma patients with node negativity. Studies have analyzed different factors influencing the outcome in such patients. It is suggested that the presence of nodal micrometastasis can act as a tool in predicting the aggressiveness of these tumors. Aims: The aim of this study is to assess the yield of micrometastasis/isolated tumor cell (ITC) by ultrastaging the morphologically negative axillary nodes and staining them with immunohistochemistry for epithelial membrane antigen. The association of such metastasis with the clinical outcome is determined. Settings and Design: This was a retrospective analytical study. One hundred cases of node-negative breast carcinoma patients who underwent surgery along with axillary lymph node dissection were selected. Materials and Methods: The largest node from the axillary dissection was selected and subjected to ultrastaging and immunohistochemical staining (as sentinel node dissection was not a routine practice at that time), to look for occult metastasis in the form of micrometastasis or ITCs. Statistical Analysis: Occurrence of events in the form of recurrence or death was noted. Association of the parameters was analyzed using Fisher's exact test. Results: Among the 100 cases, 79 patients were followed up for a minimum period of 5 years. Two cases had micromets in one node each. These two patients were among the eight, who developed events subsequently (25%). Hence, a statistically significant association was found between the presence of micromets with events. Conclusions: There is a statistically significant association between the presence of micromets and disease recurrence. Hence, we suggest that ultrastaging of the negative axillary node (now sentinel node, as it is being routinely done) might prove effective in predicting the events/prognosis in clinically and morphologically node-negative breast carcinoma patients

TI  - Robotic video endoscopic inguinal lymphadenectomy (R-VEIL) for vulvar cancer with sentinel node mapping using indocyanine green and near-infrared fluorescence imaging technology
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Objectives: Video endoscopy inguinal lymphadenectomy (VEIL) has emerged as the new frontier for the surgical staging of vulvar cancer (VC) [1, 2]. In this surgical film we show a step-by-step video presentation of a Robotic SLN mapping using ICG (Canadian Task Force classification III). Although the therapeutic benefit of SLN remains controversial in clinical NO (cNO) with VC > 4 cm [3], it provides prognostic information that can guide further adjuvant treatment. Robotic sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping using indocyanine green (ICG) appears to be a suitable and attractive alternative to provide reliable staging with respect to other tracers [3, 4].Methods: A 75-year-old severely obese woman (BMI:47.8 kg/m(2)) with squamous VC grading 3, clinical stage II (cT = 5 cm, cNO, cM0) and with a pre-operative PET-CT scan negative for metastatic localizations, was admitted for surgery. Surgical staging was performed including radical vulvectomy with macroscopic resection margins larger than 2 cm., SLN mapping with ICG followed by systematic inguinal lymphadenectomy. Da Vinci Xi System (R) was used to perform it.Results: The operation was performed successfully with no intraoperative or postoperative complication. Operative time was 310 min overall. Twenty-five inguinal lymph nodes were removed (11 on the left, 14 on the right). The pathology report came back positive for SLN removed. The patient was discharged on day #4 and 20 days later started adjuvant radiochemotherapy.Conclusions: SLN with ICG is robotically feasible. However, we notice that further prospective trials are needed to compare ICG with other colorimetric and/or radioactive tracers in this subset of patients.[GRAPHICS].

TI  - A Novel Approach for Mapping Wheat Areas Using High Resolution Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Global wheat production reached 754.8 million tons in 2017, according to the FAO database. While wheat is considered as a staple food for many populations across the globe, mapping wheat could be an effective tool to achieve the SDG2 sustainable development goal-End Hunger and Secure Food Security. In Lebanon, this crop is supported financially, and sometimes technically, by the Lebanese government. However, there is a lack of statistical databases, at both national and regional scales, as well as critical information much needed in the subsidy and compensation system. In this context, this study proposes an innovative approach, named Simple and Effective Wheat Mapping Approach (SEWMA), to map the winter wheat areas grown in the Bekaa plain, the primary wheat production area in Lebanon, in the years of 2016 and 2017. The proposed methodology is a tree-like approach relying on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values of four-month period that coincides with several phenological stages of wheat (i.e., tillering, stem extension, heading, flowering and ripening). The usage of the freely available Sentinel-2 imageries, with a high spatial (10 m) and temporal (5 days) resolutions, was necessary, particularly due to the small sized and overlapped plots encountered in the study area. Concerning the wheat areas, results show that there was a decrease from 11,063 +/- 1309 ha in 2016 to 7605 +/- 1184 in 2017. When SEWMA was applied using 2016 ground truth data, the overall accuracy reached 87.0% on 2017 data, whereas, when implemented using 2017 ground truth data, the overall accuracy was 82.6% on 2016 data. The novelty resides in executing early classification output (up to six weeks before harvest) as well as distinguishing wheat from other winter cereal crops with similar NDVI yearly profiles (i.e., barley and triticale). SEWMA offers a simple, yet effective and budget-saving approach providing early-season classification information, very crucial to decision support systems and the Lebanese government concerning, but not limited to, food production, trade, management and agricultural financial support.

TI  - Iatrogenically false positive sentinel lymph nodes in breast cancer: Methods of recognition and evaluation
T2  - SEMINARS IN DIAGNOSTIC PATHOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - With the introduction of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy as a standard procedure for staging clinically node negative breast cancer patients, meticulous pathologic evaluation of SLNs by serial sections and/or immunohistochemistry for cytokeratins has become commonplace in order to detect small volume metastases (isolated tumor cells and micrometastases). This practice has also brought to the fore the concept of iatrogenically false positive sentinel nodes secondary to epithelial displacement produced largely by preoperative needling procedures. While this concept is well described in the clinical and pathologic literature, it is, in our experience, still under-recognized, with such lymph nodes frequently incorrectly diagnosed as harboring true metastases, possibly resulting in unwarranted further surgery and/or chemotherapy. This review discusses the concept of displaced epithelium in the histologic evaluation of breast surgical specimens and provides a stepwise approach to the correct identification of iatrogenically transported displaced epithelial cells in sentinel lymph nodes.

TI  - A Decade of Veteran Voices: Examining Patient Portal Enhancements Through the Lens of User-Centered Design
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Health care systems have entered a new era focused on patient engagement. Patient portals linked to electronic health records are recognized as a promising multifaceted tool to help achieve patient engagement goals. Achieving significant growth in adoption and use requires agile evaluation methods to complement periodic formal research efforts.Objective: This paper describes one of the implementation strategies that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has used to foster the adoption and sustained use of its patient portal, My HealtheVet, over the last decade: an ongoing focus on user-centered design (UCD). This strategy entails understanding the users and their tasks and goals and optimizing portal design and functionality accordingly. Using a case study approach, we present a comparison of early user demographics and preferences with more recent data and several examples to illustrate how a UCD can serve as an effective implementation strategy for a patient portal within a large integrated health care system.Methods: VA has employed a customer experience analytics (CXA) survey on its patient portal since 2007 to enable ongoing direct user feedback. In a continuous cycle, a random sample of site visitors is invited to participate in the Web-based survey. CXA model questions are used to track and trend satisfaction, while custom questions collect data about users' characteristics, needs, and preferences. In this case study, we performed analyses of descriptive statistics comparing user characteristics and preferences from FY2008 (wherein "FY" means "fiscal year") to FY2017 and user trends regarding satisfaction with and utilization of specific portal functions over the last decade, as well as qualitative content analysis of user's open-ended survey comments.Results: User feedback has guided the development of enhancements to core components of the My HealtheVet portal including available features, content, interface design, prospective functional design, and related policies. Ten-year data regarding user characteristics and portal utilization demonstrate trends toward greater patient engagement and satisfaction. Administration of a continuous voluntary Web-based survey is an efficient and effective way to capture veterans' voices about who they are, how they use the patient portal, needed system improvements, and desired additional services.Conclusions: Leveraging "voice-of-the-customer" techniques as part of patient portal implementation can ensure that such systems meet users' needs in ways that are agile and most effective. Through this strategy, VA has fostered significant adoption and use of My HealtheVet to engage patients in managing their health.

TI  - Exploring evapotranspiration dynamics over Sub-Sahara Africa (2000-2014)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring changes in evapotranspiration (ET) is useful in the management of water resources in irrigated agricultural landscapes and in the assessment of crop stress and vegetation conditions of drought-vulnerable regions. Information on the impacts of climate variability on ET dynamics is profitable in developing water management adaptation strategies. Such impacts, however, are generally unreported and not conclusively determined in some regions. In this study, changes in MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer)-derived ET (2000-2014) over large proportions of Sub-Sahara Africa (SSA) are explored. The multivariate analyses of ET over SSA showed that four leading modes of observed dynamics in ET, accounting for about 90% of the total variability, emanated mostly from some sections of the Sudano-Sahel and Congo basin. Based on Man-Kendall's statistics, significant positive trends (alpha = 0.05) in ET over the Central African Republic and most parts of the Sahel region were observed. Over much of the Congo basin nonetheless, ET showed significant (alpha = 0.05) distributions of widespread negative trends. These trends in ET were rather found to be consistent with observed changes in model soil moisture but not in all locations, perhaps due to inconsistent trends in maximum rainfall and land surface temperature. However, the results of spatio-temporal drought analysis confirm that the extensive ET losses in the Congo basin were somewhat induced by soil moisture deficits. Amidst other prominent drivers of ET, the dynamics of ET over the terrestrial ecosystems of SSA appear to be a more complex phenomenon that may transcend natural climate variations.

T2  - ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - International Symposium on Polar Ice, Polar Climate, and Polar Change
CL  - Boulder, CO
AB  - Research on young thin sea ice is essential to understand the changes in the Arctic. But it is also the most challenging to investigate, both in situ and from satellites. If satellite remote-sensing techniques are developing rapidly, fieldwork remains crucial for the mandatory validation of such data. In April 2016, an Arctic fieldwork campaign was conducted at Kongsfjorden, Svalbard. This campaign provided an opportunity to combine various techniques to record the fjord ice properties ranging from local field sampling to broader ground-based and satellite radar remote sensing of the fjord. Tracking the boat used to access the field sites with hand-held GPS devices offered a good opportunity to map fjord ice and assess the limits of radar identification of small icebergs and thin ice. During 1 week, 17 icebergs and the thin ice edges in two different locations were mapped. The GPS tracks present a good agreement with the Radarsat-2 data analysis for one of the two ice edges. The second ice edge track only partly corresponds to the radar scene. Ice movement, recorded by a ground-based radar, is likely to explain this result. Grounded icebergs could be identified in both Radarsat-2 and ground-based radar.

TI  - What Is Caring in Nursing?: Sorting Out Humanistic and Christian Perspectives
T2  - JOURNAL OF CHRISTIAN NURSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Historically, some propose that organized nursing was founded on biblical principles and the caring behaviors and characteristics of Christ, and that caring originates with God. More recently, perceptions of caring have shifted to a humanistic, postmodern worldview, where the source of caring is within the person. This integrative literature review synthesized caring literature from humanistic, postmodern, and biblical, theological worldviews. Findings reveal that 95% of research and 85% of nonresearch publications were written from the humanistic perspective. The results lay a foundation for an alternative middle range theory on caring from a biblical worldview for nurses holding Christian beliefs.

TI  - Hydrological model using ground- and satellite-based data for river flow simulation towards supporting water resource management in the Red River Basin, Vietnam
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Red River basin (RRB) exhibits substantial variation of water resource seasonally and annually. Sustainable water resource management in the RRB has been challenging due to the lack of in situ hydrological measurement data over the basin-wide scale. To address this issue, this study aimed to perform the setting up, calibration, and validation of the variable infiltration capacity (VIC) hydrological model forced with ground- and satellite-based datasets at a high spatial resolution of 0.1 degrees for simulating the daily river flow of the Red River system in the RRB during the period of 2005-2014. By using the finely resolved land cover characterization with 15 types of land cover and leaf area index - the most important feature of vegetation that significantly influences the simulation of hydrological variables provided by the spatially distributed satellite remote sensing data, this study would not only address the poor data availability over the RRB but also enhance the accuracy of model simulation. The simulation results generally indicated that the calibrated VIC model could satisfactorily capture the river flow dynamics of the Red River system in the RRB. The VIC model's underestimated river flow compared to the observed data during the dry season for the downstream stations was likely due to the operation of the large man-made reservoirs and dams in the upstream catchments of the RRB that not represented by the VIC model. The findings also suggested that for further improving the VIC model performance, the use of more spatially representative meteorological data provided by satellite remote sensing should be considered in future studies.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forest is an important ecosystem rich in biodiversity and structural complexity with high woody biomass content. Longer wavelength radar data at L-band sensor provides improved forest biomass (AGB) information due to its higher penetration level and sensitivity to canopy structure. The study presents a regression based woody biomass estimation for tropical deciduous mixed forest dominated by Shores robusta using ALOS PALSAR mosaic (HH, HV) and field data at the lower Himalayan belt of Northern India. For the purpose of understanding the scattering mechanisms at L-band from this forest type, Michigan Microwave Canopy Scattering model (MIMICS-I) was parameterized with field data to simulate bacicscatter across polarization and incidence range. Regression analysis between field measured forest biomass and L-band bacicscatter data from PALSAR mosaic show retrieval of woody biomass up to 100 Mg ha(-1) with error between 92 and 94 Mg ha(-1) and coefficient of determination (r(2)) between 0.53 and 0.55 for HH and HH + HV polarized channel at 0.25 ha resolution. This positive relationship could be due to strong volume scattering from ground/trunk interaction at HH-polarized while in combination with direct canopy scattering for HV-polarization at ALOS specific incidence angles as predicted by MIMICS-I model. This study has found that L-band SAR data from currently ALOS-1/-2 and upcoming joint NASA-ISRO SAR (NISAR) are suitable for mapping forest biomass <= 100 Mg ha(-1) at 25 m resolution in far incidence range in dense deciduous mixed forest of Northern India.

TI  - Evaluation of Atmospheric Effects on Interferograms Using DEM Errors of Fixed Ground Points
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data are widely used for disaster monitoring. To extract damaged areas automatically, it is essential to understand the relationships among the sensor specifications, acquisition conditions, and land cover. Our previous studies developed a method for estimating the phase noise of interferograms using several pairs of TerraSAR-X series (TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X) datasets. Atmospheric disturbance data are also necessary to interpret the interferograms; therefore, the purpose of this study is to estimate the atmospheric effects by focusing on the difference in digital elevation model (DEM) errors between repeat-pass (two interferometric SAR images acquired at different times) and single-pass (two interferometric SAR images acquired simultaneously) interferometry. Single-pass DEM errors are reduced due to the lack of temporal decorrelation and atmospheric disturbances. At a study site in the city of Tsukuba, a quantitative analysis of DEM errors at fixed ground objects shows that the atmospheric effects are estimated to contribute 75% to 80% of the total phase noise in interferograms.

TI  - Pathogen elimination and prevention within a regulated, Designated Pathogen Free, closed pig herd for long-term breeding and production of xenotransplantation materials
T2  - XENOTRANSPLANTATION
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundWe established a Source Animal (barrier) Facility (SAF) for generating designated pathogen-free (DPF) pigs to serve as donors of viable organs, tissues, or cells for xenotransplantation into clinical patients. This facility was populated with caesarian derived, colostrum deprived (CDCD) piglets, from sows of conventional-specific (or specified) pathogen-free (SPF) health status in six cohorts over a 10-month period. In all cases, CDCD piglets fulfilled DPF status including negativity for porcine circovirus (PCV), a particularly environmentally robust and difficult to inactivate virus which at the time of SAF population was epidemic in the US commercial swine production industry. Two outbreaks of PCV infection were subsequently detected during sentinel testing. The first occurred several weeks after PCV-negative animals were moved under quarantine from the nursery into an animal holding room. The apparent origin of PCV was newly installed stainless steel penning, which was not sufficiently degreased thereby protecting viral particles from disinfection. The second outbreak was apparently transmitted via employee activities in the Caesarian-section suite adjacent to the barrier facility. In both cases, PCV was contained in the animal holding room where it was diagnosed making a complete facility depopulation-repopulation unnecessary.MethodInfectious PCV was eliminated during both outbreaks by the following: euthanizing infected animals, disposing of all removable items from the affected animal holding room, extensive cleaning with detergents and degreasing agents, sterilization of equipment and rooms with chlorine dioxide, vaporized hydrogen peroxide, and potassium peroxymonosulfate, and for the second outbreak also glutaraldehyde/quaternary ammonium. Impact on other barrier animals throughout the process was monitored by frequent PCV diagnostic testing.ResultAfter close monitoring for 6months indicating PCV absence from all rooms and animals, herd animals were removed from quarantine status.ConclusionTen years after PCV clearance following the second outbreak, due to strict adherence to biosecurity protocols and based on ongoing sentinel diagnostic monitoring (currently monthly), the herd remains DPF including PCV negative.

TI  - An inverse method for watershed change detection using hybrid conceptual and artificial intelligence approaches
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) changes intrinsically lead to various hydrological impacts especially on the outflow rate of the watersheds. This research investigated LULC changes and its effect on outlet runoff by detecting LULC changes location and severity via an inverse method for the Little River Watershed, USA. For this purpose, the Clark's conceptual Rainfall-Runoff model was applied to the delineated sub-watersheds of the basin to generate different outflows by altering the Storage Coefficient (SC) of the model for each sub-watershed as the representative of LULC. Then, the relation between SC values and outflow time series was simulated by Artificial Intelligence (AI) based models of artificial neural network and least square support vector machine. In this way, in order to ignore redundant information and reduce the dimension of input vector, Wavelet-Entropy (WE) values of the outflow sub-series were computed and used as the inputs of the AI model to compute SCs of the sub-watersheds as the outputs. The trained multi-output AI model as an inverse method could be then used to predict the SC values (as representative of LULC) of the sub-watersheds using the observed time series of runoff at the outlet. The obtained results showed that the proposed inverse method could reliably detect not only the location but also the severity of LULC changes by prediction of SC values in the coming future years. For validation of the method, a comparison was also performed between the obtained results and recorded changes via normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land use classification, extracted from Landsat images. The comparison approved the ability of the proposed method for LULC change detection in a way that deforestation and cropland increasing of the sub-watersheds from 1990 to 2013 were aligned with the SC reduction e.g., 26% decrease of SC for downstream sub-watershed versus 53% decrease and 21% increase of forest and crop lands, respectively.

TI  - Dust Impacts on the 2012 Hurricane Nadine Track during the NASA HS3 Field Campaign
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - During the 2012 deployment of the NASA Hurricane and Severe Storm Sentinel (HS3) field campaign, several flights were dedicated to investigating Hurricane Nadine. Hurricane Nadine developed in close proximity to the dust-laden Saharan air layer and is the fourth-longest-lived Atlantic hurricane on record, experiencing two strengthening and weakening periods during its 22-day total life cycle as a tropical cyclone. In this study, the NASA GEOS-5 atmospheric general circulation model and data assimilation system was used to simulate the impacts of dust during the first intensification and weakening phases of Hurricane Nadine using a series of GEOS-5 forecasts initialized during Nadine's intensification phase (12 September 2012). The forecasts explore a hierarchy of aerosol interactions within the model: no aerosol interaction, aerosol-radiation interactions, and aerosol-radiation and aerosol-cloud interactions simultaneously, as well as variations in assumed dust optical properties. When only aerosol-radiation interactions are included, Nadine's track exhibits sensitivity to dust shortwave absorption, as a more absorbing dust introduces a shortwave temperature perturbation that impacts Nadine's structure and steering flow, leading to a northward track divergence after 5 days of simulation time. When aerosol-cloud interactions are added, the track exhibits little sensitivity to dust optical properties. This result is attributed to enhanced longwave atmospheric cooling from clouds that counters shortwave atmospheric warming by dust surrounding Nadine, suggesting that aerosol-cloud interactions are a more significant influence on Nadine's track than aerosol-radiation interactions. These findings demonstrate that tropical systems, specifically their track, can be impacted by dust interaction with the atmosphere.

TI  - Effects of cooling strategies and tool coatings on cutting forces and tooth frequency in high-speed down-milling of Inconel-718 using helical bull-nose solid carbide end mills
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the results of experimental investigation of the effects of three cooling strategies (minimum quantity lubrication (MQL), cryogenic cooling using liquid nitrogen (LN2), and combined (MQL + LN2)) and three tool coatings (uncoated and AlTiN- and GMS(2)-coated) on cutting force components (F (x) , F (y) , F (z) ); the resultant cutting force, F (r) ; and cutter tooth frequency in peripheral high--speed end milling of Inconel-718 to improve machinability and reduce cost. All the experiments were conducted on a Cincinnati Milacron Sabre 750 vertical machining center (VMC), equipped with Acramatic 2100 CNC controller using uncoated and AlTiN- and GMS(2)-coated solid carbide bull-nose helical end mills of 12.7 mm (0.5 in.) diameter, and 0.762 mm (0.03 in.) corner radius. Each experiment consisted of eight passes, each pass of 76.2 mm (3 in.) cutting length. Axial and radial depths of cut, cutting speed, and material removal rate were kept constant for all experiments. The experimental results show that uncoated end mills generated lowest resultant cutting forces, whereas GMS(2)-coated end mills generated highest resultant cutting forces under all cooling strategies. MQL cooling strategy generated lowest resultant cutting forces, whereas LN2 cooling strategy generated highest resultant cutting forces for all end mill coatings. Using LN2 cooling strategy alone is not recommended for machining Inconel-718 due to high cutting forces and vibrations. Uncoated end mills under MQL cooling strategy generated the lowest cutting forces and are recommended for machining Inconel-718, whereas GMS(2)-coated end mills under LN2 cooling strategy generated highest cutting forces.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Urban Heat Island Phenomena Assessment using Landsat Imagery: A Case Study of Bangkok Metropolitan and its Vicinity, Thailand
T2  - Environment and Natural Resources Journal
M3  - Article
AB  - Applications of LST data to advanced research on UHI phenomena and its intensity are still relatively low in Thailand The main objectives of this study are (1) to extract and predict LST data associated with urban and non-urban areas from Landsat imageries and (2) to quantify the intensity of UHI phenomena and its changes over BMV between 2006 and 2026. The research methodology was conducted systematically to extract and predict the LST associated with the urban and non-urban areas in order to assess the intensity of UHI phenomena. The results show that WAI as UHI intensity is extremely critical between 2006 and 2022 and becomes critically severe during 2024 and 2026. The result also show that URI as a degree of UHI development has increased from 2010 to 2016, however, it will suddenly decrease in 2018 and continuously increase between 2020 and 2026. In addition, TGCI analysis indicates that a decreasing temperature trend is dominant in the existing urban areas while an increasing temperature trend shows remarkably in urban expansion areas. These findings confirm the impacts of urbanization and urban development state on UHI intensity. In conclusion, the approaches and results of this study can be applied to master the urban planning properly, especially the mitigation of UHI phenomena in the future.

TI  - Opportunities and Challenges for the Estimation of Aquaculture Production Based on Earth Observation Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aquaculture makes a crucial contribution to global food security and protein intake and is a basis for many livelihoods. Every second fish consumed today is produced in aquaculture systems, mainly in land-based water ponds situated along the coastal areas. Satellite remote sensing enables high-resolution mapping of pond aquaculture, facilitating inventory analyses to support sustainable development of the planet's valuable coastal ecosystems. Free, full and open data from the Copernicus earth observation missions opens up new potential for the detection and monitoring of aquaculture from space. High-resolution time series data acquired by active microwave instruments aboard the Sentinel-1 satellites and fully automated, object-based image analysis allow the identification of aquaculture ponds. In view of the diversity and complexity in the production of aquaculture products, yield and production varies greatly among species. Although national statistics on aquaculture production exist, there is a large gap of pond-specific aquaculture production quantities. In this regard, earth observation-based mapping and monitoring of pond aquaculture can be used to estimate production and has great potential for global production projections. For the deltas of the Mekong River, Red River, Pearl River, and Yellow River, as one of the world's most significant aquaculture production regions, we detected aquaculture ponds from high spatial resolution Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. We collected aquaculture production and yield statistics at national, regional and local levels to link earth observation-based findings to the size, number and distribution of aquaculture ponds with production estimation. With the SAR derived mapping product, it is possible for the first time to assess aquaculture on single pond level at a regional scale and use that information for spatial analyses and production estimation.

TI  - Decision Fusion of D-InSAR and Pixel Offset Tracking for Coal Mining Deformation Monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground surface subsidence is a universal phenomenon in coal mining areas which can cause serious damage to the surrounding environment. In this paper, we consider the use of differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (D-InSAR), multi-temporal InSAR (MT-InSAR), and the pixel offset tracking technique to monitor the surface deformation of a coal mining area. In this study, we use the two-pass D-InSAR method to generate 19 interferometric image pairs from 20 TerraSAR-X SpotLight images. The results show that D-InSAR can be used to obtain high accuracy surface deformation in the mining areas where there is no high gradient deformation, and the pixel offset tracking method offers advantages in those areas where high gradient deformation is found, but its performance is not stable. This means that the unilateral use of these technologies cannot obtain reliable subsidence information in mining areas. Therefore, it is essential to find a new way to integrate the respective advantages of these different methods. In this paper, a new fusion method combining the D-InSAR result with the offset tracking result based on a spatial decorrelation distribution map is proposed to obtain the subsidence results in a mining area. To ensure the reliability of the results, a decision rule is proposed for the spatial decorrelation distribution map, which is generated manually by union analysis in ArcGIS. In the experiments, the mean absolute error of the fusion result is 0.0748 m, while that of D-InSAR is 0.1890 m, and that of offset tracking is 0.1358 m. It is therefore clear that the proposed fusion method is more reliable and more accurate than the use of individual methods, and it may be able to serve as a reference in mining subsidence monitoring.

TI  - A Generalized Evaluation Scheme for Comparing Temperature Products from Satellite Observations, Numerical Weather Model, and Ground Measurements Over the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground surface temperature (GST) measurements are scarce in Tibetan plateau (TP), whereas the satellite observations and numerical weather model outputs are good alternatives to fill the spatial gaps among ground stations. However, the evaluation of different temperature products is challenging due to the distinct temporal and spatial dimensions in their acquisition methods. This paper intended to develop an evaluation framework for comparing the performances of various temperature data, including the Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) satellite land surface temperature (LST) data, the high Asia refined (HAR) analysis numerical outputs, and the GST. In the proposed framework, we introduce a diurnal temperature cycle model and an aggregated weighted method to solve the temporal and spatial mismatch problem between different data sets. The results over TP show that the evaluation framework solves the temporal and spatial matching among different data sets. AATSR LST and HAR outputs are consistent regardless of the heterogeneous and weather conditions at Linzhi site indicating that the fully homogeneous land surface conditions are not the only way for the satellite/simulation validations. Our results suggest that the proposed framework of time normalization and spatial aggregation method is appropriate for evaluating satellite thermal infrared retrieved data sets and numerical simulations even when the proper ground measurements are insufficient. Since it performs well in the high elevation and complex land surface-conditioned TP region, it will be easy to be adopted in the other regions with a variety of data sets.

TI  - Multi-temporal flood mapping and satellite altimetry used to evaluate the flood dynamics of the Bolivian Amazon wetlands
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Bolivian Amazon wetlands are extensive floodplains distributed over the Mamore, Beni, Madre de Dios and Guapore Rivers. Located within the upper Madeira River Basin, the wetlands play important roles in regulating the biogeochemical processes and hydrological cycle of the region. In addition, they have major ecological and hydrological relevance for the entire Amazon Basin. These wetlands are characterized by the occurrence of episodic floods that result from contrasting hydro-meteorological processes in the Andean Mountain region, the piedmont area and the Amazon lowlands. In this study, we characterized the flood dynamics of the region using multi-temporal flood mapping based on optical altimetry (MODIS - Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer - M*D09A1) and satellite altimetry (ENVISAT RA-2 and SARAL AltiKa altimeters). This study provides new insights regarding the frequency, magnitude and spatial distribution of exogenous floods, which are created by flood waves from the Andes; and endogenous floods, which result from runoff originating in the lowlands. The maximum extent of flooding during 2001-2014 was 43144 km(2) in the Mamore Basin and 34852 km(2) in the Guapore Basin, and the total surface water storage in these floodplains reached 94 km3. The regionalization of flood regimes based on water stage time series signatures allowed those regions that are exposed to frequent floods, which are generally located along rivers without a direct connection with the Andes, to be distinguished from floodplains that are more dependent on flood waves originating in the Andes and its piedmonts. This information is of great importance for understanding the roles of these wetlands in the provision of ecosystem services.

TI  - Assessment of Root Zone Soil Moisture Estimations from SMAP, SMOS and MODIS Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, six satellite-based root zone soil moisture (RZSM) estimates from March 2015 to December 2016 were evaluated both temporally and spatially. The first two were the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) and the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) L4 RZSM products. The other four were obtained through the Soil Water Index (SWI) approach, which embedded surface soil moisture (SSM). The SMOS-Barcelona Expert Center (BEC) L4 SSM product and the apparent thermal inertia (ATI)-derived SSM from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data were used as SSM datasets. In the temporal analysis, the RZSM estimates were compared to in situ RZSM from 14 stations of the Soil Moisture Measurements Station Network of the University of Salamanca (REMEDHUS). Regarding the spatial assessment, the resulting RZSM maps of the Iberian Peninsula were compared between them. All RZSM values followed the temporal evolution of the ground-based measurements well, although SMOS and MODIS showed underestimation while SMAP displayed overestimation. The good results obtained from MODIS ATI are notable, notwithstanding they were not estimated through microwave radiometry. A very high agreement was found in terms of spatial patterns for the whole Iberian Peninsula except for the extreme north area, which is dominated by high mountains and dense forests.

TI  - Variation in laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery across England: a 5-year review
T2  - SURGICAL ENDOSCOPY AND OTHER INTERVENTIONAL TECHNIQUES
M3  - Review
AB  - Laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery (LARS) remains central to the management of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease but the scale and variation in provision in England is unknown. The aims of this study were firstly to examine the processes and outcomes of anti-reflux surgery in England and compare them to national guidelines and secondly to explore potential variations in practice nationally and establish peer benchmarks.All adult patients who underwent LARSin England during the Financial years FY 2011/2012-FY 2016/2017 were identified in the Surgeon's Workload Outcomes and Research Database (SWORD), which is based on the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data warehouse. Outcomes included activity volume, day-case rate, short-stay rate, 2- and 30-day readmission rates and 30-day re-operation rates. Funnel plots were used to identify national variation in practice.In total, 12,086 patients underwent LARS in England during the study period. The operation rate decreased slightly over the study period from 5.2 to 4.6 per 100,000 people. Most outcomes were in line with national guidelines including the conversion rate (0.76%), 30-day re-operation rate (1.43%) and 2- and 30-day readmission rates (1.65 and 8.54%, respectively). The day-case rate was low but increased from 7.4 to 15.1% during the 5-year period. Significant variation was found, particularly in terms of hospital volume, and day-case, short-stay and conversion rates.Although overall outcomes are comparable to studies from other countries, there is significant variation in anti-reflux surgery activity and outcomes in England. We recommend that units use these data to drive local quality improvement efforts.

TI  - Rain-on-snow events in Alaska, their frequency and distribution from satellite observations
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wet snow and the icing events that frequently follow wintertime rain-on-snow (ROS) affect high latitude ecosystems at multiple spatial and temporal scales, including hydrology, carbon cycle, wildlife, and human development. However, the distribution of ROS events and their response to climatic changes are uncertain. In this study, we quantified ROS spatiotemporal variability across Alaska during the cold season (November to March) and clarified the influence of precipitation and temperature variations on these patterns. A satellite-based daily ROS geospatial classification was derived for the region by combining remote sensing information from overlapping MODIS and AMSR sensor records. The ROS record extended over the recent satellite record (water years 2003-2011 and 2013-2016) and was derived at a daily time step and 6 km grid, benefiting from finer (500 m) resolution MODIS snow cover observations and coarser (12.5 km) AMSR microwave brightness temperature-based freeze-thaw retrievals. The classification showed favorable ROS detection accuracy (75%-100%) against in situ climate observations across Alaska. Pixel-wise correlation analysis was used to clarify relationships between the ROS patterns and underlying physiography and climatic influences. Our findings indicate that cold season ROS events are most common during autumn and spring months along the maritime Bering Sea coast and boreal interior regions, but are infrequent on the colder arctic North Slope. The frequency and extent of ROS events coincided with warm temperature anomalies (p<0.1), but showed a generally weaker relationship with precipitation. The weaker precipitation relationship was attributed to several factors, including large uncertainty in cold season precipitation measurements, and the important contribution of humidity and turbulent energy transfer in driving snowmelt and icing events independent of rainfall. Our results suggest that as high latitude temperatures increase, wet snow and ROS events will also increase in frequency and extent, particularly in the southwestern and interior regions of Alaska.

TI  - Spatial Identification of Multi-dimensional Poverty in Rural China: A Perspective of Nighttime-Light Remote Sensing Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Poverty has emerged as one of the chronic dilemmas facing the development of human society during the twenty first century. Accurately identifying regions of poverty could lead to more effective poverty-alleviation programs. This study used a new type of remote-sensing data, NPP-VIIRS, to locate poverty-stricken areas based on nighttime light, taking Chongqing Municipality as a sample, and constructed a multidimensional poverty index (MPI) system, guided by a well-known and widely used conceptual framework of sustainable livelihood. A regression model was constructed and results were correlated with those using the average nighttime light index. The model was then tested on Shaanxi Province, and average relative error of the estimated MPI was only 11.12%. These results showed that multidimensional poverty had a high spatial concentration effect at the regional scale. We then applied the index nationwide, at the county scale, analyzing 2852 counties, which we divided into seven classifications, based on the MPI: extremely low, low, relatively low, medium, relatively high, high, and extremely high. Eight hundred forty-eight counties in 26 provinces were identified as multidimensionally poor. Among these, 254 were absolutely poor counties and 543 were relatively poor counties; 195 of these are not on the list of poverty-stricken counties as identified by income levels alone. By improving the accuracy of targeting, this method of identifying multidimensional poverty areas could help the Chinese government improve the effectiveness of poverty reduction strategies, and it could also be used as a reference for other countries or regions that seek to target poor areas that suffer multidimensional deprivation.

TI  - The use of earth observation methods for estimating regional crop evapotranspiration and yield for water footprint accounting
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing can efficiently support the quantification of crop water requirements included in the goal of assessing water footprints, which is to analyse how human activities or specific products relate to issues of water scarcity and pollution and identify how activities and products can become more sustainable from a water perspective. Remote sensing techniques have become popular in estimating actual crop evapotranspiration and hence crop water requirements in recent decades due to the advantages they offer to users, e.g. low cost, regional data and use of maps instead of point measurements as well as saving time. The use of earth observation data supports models' accuracy in the procedure for assessing water footprint, since no average values are used: instead, users have real values for the specific parameters. The present study provides two examples of how remote sensing techniques are used essentially for estimating evapotranspiration along with crop yield, two basic parameters, for assessing water footprint. Two different case studies have been illustrated to define the methodology proposed, which refers to Mediterranean conditions and can be applied after inferring the necessary field data of each crop. The first case study refers to the application of Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) for estimating evapotranspiration, while the second refers to the Crop Yield prediction. Both elements, such as evapotranspiration and crop yield, are vital for water footprint accounting. Firstly, the SEBAL was adopted, under the essential adaptations for local soil and meteorological conditions for estimating groundnut water requirements. Landsat-5 TM, Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper+ and Landsat 8 OLI images were used to retrieve the required spectral data. The SEBAL model is enhanced with empirical equations regarding crop canopy factors, in order to increase the accuracy of crop evapotranspiration estimation. Maps were created for evapotranspiration (ET) using the SEBAL modified model for the area of interest. The results were compared with measurements from an evaporation pan, used as a reference. Statistical comparisons showed that the modified SEBAL can predict ETc in a very effective and accurate way and provide water footprint modellers with high-level crop water data. Yield prediction plays a vital role in calculating water footprint. Having real values rather than taking reference (or averaged) values from FAO is an advantage that Earth Observation means can provide. This is very important in econometric or any other prediction models used for estimating water footprint because using average data reduces accuracy. In this context, crop and soil parameters along with remotely sensed data can be used to develop models that can provide users with accurate yield estimations. In a second step, crop and soil parameters along with the normalized difference vegetation index were correlated to examine whether crop yield can be predicted and to define the actual time-window to predict the yield. Statistical and remote sensing techniques were then applied to derive and map a model that can predict crop yield. The algorithm developed for this purpose indicates that remote sensing observations can predict crop yields effectively and accurately. Using the statistical Student's t test, it was found that there was no statistically significant difference between predicted and real values for crop yield.

M3  - Article
AB  - To evaluate the sensitivity, negative predictive value (NPV) and false-negative (FN) rate of the near infrared (NIR) indocyanine green (ICG) sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping in patients with poorly differentiated endometrial cancer who have undergone a full pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy after SLN mapping.We performed a retrospective analysis of patients with endometrial cancer undergoing a laparoscopic NIR-ICG SLN mapping followed by a systematic pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy. Inclusion criteria were a grade 3 endometrial cancer or a high-risk histology (papillary serous, clear cell carcinoma, carcinosarcoma, and neuroendocrine carcinoma) and a completion pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy to the renal vessels after SLN mapping. Overall and bilateral detection rates, sensitivity, NPV, and FN rates were calculated.From December 2012 until January 2017, 42 patients fulfilled inclusion criteria. Overall and bilateral detection rates were 100 and 90.5%, respectively. Overall, 23.8% of the patients had lymph node metastases. In one patient, despite negative bilateral pelvic SLNs, a metastatic non-SLN-isolated para-aortic metastasis was detected. This NSLN was clinically suspicious and sent to frozen section analysis during the surgery. FN rate, sensitivity, and NPV were 10, 90, and 97.1%, respectively. For the SLN mapping algorithm, FN rate, sensitivity, and NPV were 0, 100, and 100%, respectively.Laparoscopic NIR-ICG SLN mapping in high-risk endometrial cancer patients has acceptable sensitivity, FN rate, and NPV.

TI  - Feasibility of Charcoal Tattooing of Cytology-Proven Metastatic Axillary Lymph Node at Diagnosis and Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy after Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Breast Cancer Patients
T2  - CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeSentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) can be performed when node-positive disease is converted to node-negative status after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT). Tattooing nodes might improve accuracy but supportive data are limited. This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of charcoal tattooing metastatic axillary lymph node (ALN) at presentation followed by SLNB after NCT in breast cancers.Materials and MethodsTwenty patients with cytology-proven node metastases prospectively underwent charcoal tattooing at diagnosis. SLNB using dual tracers and axillary surgery after NCT were then performed. The detection rate of tattooed node and diagnostic performance of SLNB were analyzed.ResultsAll patients underwent charcoal tattooing without significant morbidity. Sentinel and tattooed nodes could be detected during surgery after NCT. Nodal pathologic complete response was achieved in 10 patients. Overall sensitivity, false-negative rate (FNR), negative predictive value, and accuracy of hot/blue SLNB were 80.0%, 20.0%, 83.3%, and 90.0%, respectively. Retrieving more nodes and favorable nodal response were associated with improved performance. The best accuracy was observed when excised tattooed node was calculated together (FNR, 0.0%). Cold/non-blue tattooed nodes of five patients were removed during non-sentinel axillary surgery but clinicopathological parameters did not differ compared to patients with hot/blue tattooed node detected during SLNB, suggesting the importance of the tattooing procedure itself to improve performance.ConclusionCharcoal tattooing of cytology-confirmed metastatic ALN at presentation is technically feasible and does not limit SLNB after NCT. The tattooing procedure without additional preoperative localization is advantageous for improving the diagnostic performance of SLNB in this setting.

TI  - Satellite Data to Improve the Knowledge of Geohazards in World Heritage Sites
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - According to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) agency, the World Heritage Sites (WHS) inscribed in the World Heritage List (WHL) must be safeguarded with an adequate protection system, in order to guarantee their integrity and authenticity. Currently, many UNESCO sites are threatened by geohazards, but the safeguard of these sites does not seem to be wide-ranging. Looking at the standard list of factors affecting the Outstanding Universal Value (OUV) of WHS, which has been adopted by the World Heritage Committee in 2008, it seems that only sudden geological events are considered as factors that undermine the protection of the properties. Furthermore, it is well known that slow-kinematic phenomena can also threaten cultural and natural heritage. This study proposes a satellite InSAR-based procedure to identify and monitor the temporal and spatial evolution of ground deformation related to slow-kinematic geohazards (slow-moving landslides and ground-subsidence). This procedure, applied in this work on the Tuscany Region (Italy), simplify the InSAR products interpretation, making them easily exploitable by the local WHS managers for long-term geohazards monitoring and conservation strategies. These activities, thanks to the main characteristics of the recent Sentinel-1 data (short revisit time, free availability without any restrictions and worldwide coverage), can be defined for each UNESCO site of the world.

TI  - A Review of the Available Land Cover and Cropland Maps for South Asia
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Review
AB  - A lack of accuracy, uniqueness and the absence of systematic classification of cropland categories, together with long-pending updates of cropland mapping, are the primary challenges that need to be addressed in developing high-resolution cropland maps for south Asia. In this review, we analyzed the details of the available land cover and cropland maps of south Asia on national and regional scales in south Asia and on a global scale. Here, we highlighted the methodology adopted for classification, datasets used, classification system used for classifying different land covers and croplands and the resolution of datasets available. This listed review of different available datasets can help the reader to know which datasets to be used in their study and to understand which methodology to be chosen to further developing the accurate high-resolution land cover and cropland maps for advanced studies and for better understanding of ground reality in a timely updated version. We tried to identify the major concerns, particularly the inadequacy of knowledge regarding the spatial distribution of major crop types within south Asia, which hinder policy and strategic investment and delay the efforts to improve food security for a rapidly growing human population at a time of constant market instability and changing global climate. The overall focus of this paper is on reviewing the need for timely updated high-resolution cropland maps of south Asia.

T2  - REVISTA GEOGRAFICA VENEZOLANA
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to characterize the spatial-temporal variation of use and occupation of the soil, under the influence of small hydroelectric plants (PCHs) in the Branco River watershed Rondonia, Brazil, by using the normalized difference vegetation index technique (NDVI). Images from the Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 satellites and SRTM images were used. Thus, the ArcGIS software was used in the definition of subwatersheds, in getting the NDVI and vectorization of the water transposition channels. At the end, 76 subwatersheds were delimited; the paired t-test (p < 0.01) indicated a decrease in plant cover between 1996 and 2006 (3.49 % year-1), and between 2006 and 2016 the average plant suppression rate was 1.30% per year-1. The installations of the PCHs increased the water depth due to the construction of transposition channels; by means of the NDVI it was possible to verify the dynamics of use and occupation of the soil.

TI  - Steppe Fires in Conditions the Regime of Reserve and Under Changing Anthropogenic Impacts
T2  - GEOGRAPHY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - An analysis of geoinformation data on the spread of steppe fires is proposed, the areas of which are identified on the basis of a series of Landsat satellite images for 1984-2015. We selected five key sites located in different geographic areas of the Transvolga region and South Ural, covering clusters of the Orenburgskii state nature as well as adjacent agricultural areas. By analyzing the long-term dynamics, we determined a widespread trend of an intensification of steppe fires. Since the mid-1990s till the present, it has manifested itself in a significant increase in the area of occurrence and in recurrence frequency. It has been established that the cause for an intensification of fires in the steppe regions is a significant reduction in agricultural production, accompanied by restoration of vegetation cover on unused lands and accumulation of dry phytomass. It was determined that, given the favorable conditions for the occurrence of fires, the weather and climate factors increased in importance, implying a higher amplitude of fluctuations in the areas of the burnt-over areas, especially in abnormal years. Data on the current frequency of grass fires (both in protected areas and in a large part of agricultural lands) indicate that the vegetation cover and other components of steppe ecosystems are constantly in a state of post-pyrogenic succession. Using an example of one of the sites (the Burtinskaya steppe), a high restorative capacity of tree-shrub areas within the boundaries of the ecotopes occupied by them was revealed. It was noted that the absolute regime of reserve that excludes any economic activities, combined with an intensification of fire phenomena in the adjacent territories, gives rise to an acute fire-hazardous situation. It is pointed out that there is a need to establish a unified system for ecological monitoring of fires.

AB  - With rapid and accelerated Arctic sea-ice loss, it is beneficial to update and baseline historical change on the regional scales from a consistent, intercalibrated, long-term time series of sea-ice data for understanding regional vulnerability and monitoring ice state for climate adaptation and risk mitigation. In this paper, monthly sea-ice extents (SIEs) derived from a passive microwave sea-ice concentration climate data record for the period of 1979-2015, are used to examine Arctic-wide and regional temporal variability of sea-ice cover and their decadal trends for 15 regions of the Arctic. Three unique types of SIE annual cycles are described. Regions of vulnerability within each of three types to further warming are identified. For the Arctic as a whole, the analysis has found significant changes in both annual SIE maximum and minimum, with -2.41 +/- 0.56% per decade and -13.5 +/- 2.93% per decade change relative to the 1979-2015 climate average, respectively. On the regional scale, the calculated trends for the annual SIE maximum range from + 2.48 to -10.8% decade(-1), while the trends for the annual SIE minimum range from 0 to up to -42% decade(-1).

TI  - Three-Dimensional Structure Inversion of Buildings with Nonparametric Iterative Adaptive Approach Using SAR Tomography
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar tomography (TomoSAR) is a useful tool for retrieving the three-dimensional structure of buildings in urban areas, especially for datasets with a high spatial resolution. However, among the previous TomoSAR estimators, some cannot retrieve the 3-D structure of objects with a high elevation resolution, some cannot maintain the spatial resolution, and some require the selection of a hyperparameter. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a new nonparametric iterative adaptive approach with a model selection tool based on the Bayesian information criterion (IAA-BIC) for the application of TomoSAR in urban areas. IAA-BIC employs weighted least squares to acquire a high elevation resolution and works well for both distributed and coherent scatterers, even with single-look. Concurrently, IAA-BIC does not require the user to make any difficult selection regarding a hyperparameter. The proposed IAA-BIC estimator was tested in simulated experiments, and the results confirmed the advantages of the IAA-BIC estimator. Moreover, the three-dimensional structure of the Hubei Science and Technology Venture building in Wuhan, China, was retrieved through the IAA-BIC method with nine very high spatial resolution TerraSAR-X images. The height estimation accuracy for this building was about 1% and 4% relative to its real height for single-look and multi-look, respectively. In addition, a comparison between the IAA-BIC estimator and some of the typical existing TomoSAR estimators (Capon, MUSIC, and compressed sensing (CS)) was also carried out. The results indicate that the IAA-BIC estimator obtains a better resolution for coherent sources than Capon and MUSIC; notably, the IAA-BIC estimator obtains a similar performance to CS, but in less computation time.

T2  - NATIVA
M3  - Article
AB  - Pastures under inefficient management practices get degraded, leading to serious socioeconomic and environmental issues. That being said, understanding the dynamics of such systems and their interaction with the environment is essential when it comes to looking towards sustainable alternatives for livestock activities. The management, annual dynamics and socio-environmental interactions in pastures in an hydrographic basin located in Atlantic Forest biome, Minas Gerais, Brasil, were studied during the hydrological year of 2016/2017. Field data and farmers reports were utilized, such as remote sensing via images from LANDSAT 8 OLI and Google Earth Pro((R)). A quality index was proposed for the pastures, which usually presented medium quality. Degradation levels were high, oscillating in a quadratic basis (levels 2, 4, 5 and IDP) and potential (level 1) with precipitation (p < 0,01), which suggests that irrigation might be an efficient practice when it comes to degradation control. During the year, at least 51,27% of pastures have presented signs of degradation, achieving 91,32% in dry periods. The results suggest less quality and bigger degradation levels in pastures located in high and steep areas. Considering the local environmental conditions, agroecological silvopasture systems are recommended regarding the pastures management.

TI  - Axillary Ultrasound Fine Needle Aspiration Biopsy <i>Is There a Role in the Post Z-0011 Era?</i>
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY-CANCER CLINICAL TRIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Axillary ultrasound with fine needle aspiration (AXUSFNA) in early-stage breast cancer has required reappraisal. ACOSOG Z-0011 and after mapping of the axilla: radiotherapy or surgery have shown that women with limited nodal disease at sentinel lymph node biopsy got no survival advantage with completion axillary node dissection. We hypothesize that AXUSFNA may be sufficiently accurate for staging for some patients and sentinel lymph node biopsy need not be performed. We define the false negative rate (FNR) of AXUSFNA in different subsets of patients.Materials and Methods: This retrospective cohort study included node positive patients who also underwent AXUSFNA between 1/2006 and 12/2010 followed by axillary surgery. The FNR was calculated for the entire group and for subgroups determined by tumor, nodal, and ultrasound findings.Results: Out of similar to 700 AXUSFNA patients, 128 node positive patients were included in the study. The overall AXUSFNA FNR was 35.9% (95% confidence interval, 28.l%-44.6%). There was a significantly higher FNR with smaller tumors and presence of ductal carcinoma in situ on multivariate analysis. On ultrasound, benign-appearing nodes had a higher FNR than indeterminate nodes (78.9% vs 60.9%, P = 0.2) and significantly higher than suspicious nodes (78.9% vs. 2.9%, P<0.0001).Conclusions: In our cohort, the FNR for AXUSFNA was comparable with the rate of residual disease in the control arms of Z-0011 (27.4%) and after mapping of the axilla: radiotherapy or surgery (33%). However, our analysis suggests that we may be able to identify more appropriate patients for AXUSFNA and halve the FNR. As primary tumor characteristics and genomics drive systemic therapeutic recommendations, there may be an ongoing role for AXUSFNA in axillary staging.

AB  - Soil moisture is an importance parameter that is essential for decision-making process to improve soil resource and crop production. However, determining and monitoring of spatial variations of soil moisture by field research is too complicated and difficult in limited time. L-band of Microwave is known as penetrated satellite data as it can detect character of subsurface features in agriculture. This study aimed at initiating a relationship between soil moisture from field and L-band polarization from space. Both sources of statistical data were subjected to correlation analysis. To examine scattering properties of varied soil moisture. Furthermore, a series of tests were accomplished to derive the correlation of different polarizations of L-band. The methodology comprises three main steps; ground measurement data, analysis of the polarization of microwave data and, evaluation of the potential of L-band polarization relate with soil moisture. Soil moisture were analysis at two depths as 5 and 30 centimetre. The results illustrated that the correlations between L-bans and soil moisture depths predicted by each method were highly correlation. Furthermore, L-band polarizations were used able to predict the soil moisture for agricultural management. In particular, L-band polarization model developed for investigate of soil moisture have the potential to detect rapidly and inexpensively.

T2  - REVISTA DE CHIMIE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims at determining the influence of thermal shocks at high temperatures, over the allotropic temperature, on the microstructure, composition and hardness of the Zy-4 sheath. The thermal shocks have been applied at the temperatures between 900 and 1600 degrees C, in the air, lasting 30 and 60 s, through rapid heating in the solar furnace. The treated samples were microstructurally analyzed on the surface and in section by scanning electron microscopy and EDS, thickness measurement of the formed layers, the oxygen and hardness profile determination in section relative to the treated surface. At the microstructural level, the researches have revealed the evolution of the morphology of the oxide layers formed under high temperature thermal shock conditions and the evolution of the microstructure of the metallic mass as the temperature and shock duration increase, correlating this evolution with the oxygen diffusion process and with the evolution of the microhardness. Researches have provided information on the Zy-4 alloy behaviour under accidental conditions.

TI  - Modeling Eruption Source Parameters by Integrating Field, Ground-Based, and Satellite-Based Measurements: The Case of the 23 February 2013 Etna Paroxysm
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Volcanic plumes from Etna volcano (Italy) are governed by easterly winds driving ash over the Ionian Sea. The limited land tephra deposit makes total grain-size distribution (TGSD) assessment and its fine ash fraction highly uncertain. On 23 February 2013, a lava fountain produced a similar to 9-km-high column above sea level (a.s.l.). The atypical north-easterly wind direction dispersed the tephra from Etna to the Puglia region (southern Italy) allowing sampling up to very distal areas. This study uses field measurements to estimate the field-based TGSD. Very fine ash distribution (particle matter below 10mPM(10)) is explored parameterizing the field-TGSD through a bi-lognormal and bi-Weibull distribution. However, none of the two latter TGSDs allow simulating any far-traveling airborne ash up to distal areas. Accounting for the airborne ash retrieved from satellite (Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager), we proposed an empirical modification of the field-based TGSD including very fine ash through a power law decay of the distribution. The input source parameters are inverted by comparing simulations against measurements. Results suggest a column height of similar to 8.7kma.s.l., a total erupted mass of similar to 4.9x10(9)kg, a PM10 content between 0.4 and 1.3wt%, and an aggregate fraction of similar to 2wt% of the fine ash. Aerosol optical depth measurements from the AErosol RObotic NETwork are also used to corroborate the results at similar to 1,700km from the source. Integrating numerical models with field, ground-based, and satellite-based data aims at providing a better TGSD estimation including very fine ash, crucial for air traffic safety.Plain Language Summary On 23 February 2013, an intense lava fountain at Etna volcano, Italy, produced a similar to 9-km-high volcanic plume. The effect of a south-westerly winds dispersed the erupted material (tephra) from Etna to the Puglia region (similar to 410km from the source; southern Italy). These conditions permitted tephra sampling from the volcano up to Puglia. Field data are used to assess the total grain-size distribution (TGSD) to feed the FALL3D tephra dispersal model to reconstruct the tephra loading and airborne ash dispersal. To account for satellite data, we modified the TGSD adding the missing very fine ash content. Best simulations were selected by comparing computed and observed measurements in terms of tephra loadings and airborne ash mass. Results give an eruptive column height of similar to 8.7kma.s.l., a total erupted mass of similar to 4.9x10(9)kg, a very fine ash content between 0.4 and 1.3wt%, and an aggregated ash fraction of similar to 2wt% of the fine ash. Results are also compared with aerosol measurements. Integrating numerical models with field and satellite-based data aims at providing a better TGSD estimation including the very fine ash fraction (below 0.01mm), crucial for air traffic safety.

TI  - AN AGENTIAL REALIST APPROACH TO POSTHUMANIST RELATIONAL SUBJECTIVITY IN JEANETTE WINTERSON'S <i>THE STONE GODS</i>
T2  - METACRITIC JOURNAL FOR COMPARATIVE STUDIES AND THEORY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper examines, through the lenses of agential realism, the uncanny sense of posthumanist relational subjectivity that Winterson's utopia evokes through the twofold romantic encounter between female scientist Billie Crusoe and humanized she-robot Spike. This same-sex cross-species futuristic love affair that develops across two different space-times succeeds in blurring the boundaries between humans and machines, thus prompting readers to overcome their anthropocentric worldview and to abandon the deep yet narrow concern for the moral and cognitive implications of the humans' fate at the end of the de-centring process brought about by the posthuman turn, urging them to consider, instead, more significant and wider issues such as accountability and responsibility. Thus, it can be viewed as a fictional narrative embodiment of Karen Barad's theoretical reconfiguration of materiality as discursive and of performativity as a dynamic process of constraining iterative intra-actions rather than of determining interactions.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CHRISTIANITY & EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In Christian schools, leaders' roles include the integration of the particular beliefs of the community through all aspects of school life. This article describes an interpretive study into school leaders' perceptions of the essential features of Christian Education National (CEN) schools, how they integrated these features into school culture, and their understandings of the leadership by which they achieved this. This research identified that school leaders were aware of the beliefs of CEN. Despite leaders noting that these beliefs ought to be embedded holistically into school culture, the CEN services and resources available to support such inculcation were underutilized. Although servant leadership, shared leadership and vision-based leadership were all described in relation to CEN schools, the leadership within these schools is better understood as informed by the Christian faith rather than widely supported leadership theories mentioned in this study.

TI  - Integration of Airborne LiDAR and Hyperspectral Data for Maize FPAR Estimation Based on a Physical Model
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) is a key parameter in controlling mass and energy exchanges between vegetation and atmosphere. LiDAR data-derived canopy vertical structural information and hyperspectral image-derived vegetation spectral information can be considered as complementary for vegetation FPAR estimation. To the best of our knowledge, few studies have estimated vegetation FPAR by both LiDAR and hyperspectral data based on physical models. This letter aims to explore the ability of combining airborne LiDAR and hyperspectral data to retrieve maize FPAR based on the energy budget balance principle. First, canopy gap probability and openness were estimated from airborne LiDAR data. Next, canopy reflectance and soil background reflectance were retrieved from hyperspectral image. Then, we estimated maize FPAR based on the energy budget balance principle. Finally, model validity was assessed by in situ data and results showed the physical FPAR estimation model estimated maize FPAR accurately. These results indicated that the physical method proposed in this letter was efficient and reliable to estimate maize FPAR, and FPAR retrieval can benefit from the complementary nature of LiDAR-captured canopy structural information and hyperspectral-detected vegetation spectral characteristics.

TI  - Characteristic and Driving Factors of Aerosol Optical Depth over Mainland China during 1980-2017
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the reform and opening up of China, the increasing aerosol emissions have posted great challenges to the country's climate change and human health. The aerosol optical depth (AOD) is one of the main physical indicators quantifying the atmospheric turbidity and air pollution. In this study, 38-years (1980-2017) of spatial and temporal variations of AOD in China were analyzed using AOD records derived from MODIS atmosphere products and the MERRA-2 dataset. The results showed that the annual mean AOD values throughout China have gone through an increasing, but fluctuating, trend, especially in 1982 and in 1992 due to two volcano eruptions; the AOD values experienced a dramatically increasing period during 2000-2007 with the rapid economic development and "population explosions" in China/after 2008, the AOD values gradually decreased from 0.297 (2008) to 0.257 (2017). The AOD values in China were generally higher in spring than that in other seasons. The Sichuan Basin has always been an area with high AOD values owing to the strong human activity and the basin topography (hindering aerosol diffusions in the air). In contrast, the Qinghai Tibet Plateau has always been an area with low AOD values due to low aerosol emissions and clear sky conditions there. The trend analysis of AOD values during 1980-2017 in China indicated that the significant increasing trend was mainly observed in Southeastern China. By contrast, the AOD values in the northernmost of China showed a significant decreasing trend. Then, the contributions (AODP) of the AOD for black carbon aerosol (BCAOD), dust aerosol (DUAOD), organic carbon aerosol (OCAOD), sea salt aerosol (SSAOD), and SO4 aerosol (SO(4)AOD) to the total AOD values were calculated. The results showed that DUAOD (25.43%) and SO(4)AOD (49.51%) were found to be the main driving factors for the spatial and temporal variations of AOD values. Finally, the effects of anthropogenic aerosol emissions, socioeconomic factors, and land-use and land coverage changes on AOD were analyzed. The GDP, population density, and passenger traffic volume were found to be the main socioeconomic drivers for AOD distributions. Relatively larger AOD values were mainly found in urban land and land covered by water, while lower AOD values were found in grassland and permanent glacier areas.

TI  - Improving the Estimation of Daily Aerosol Optical Depth and Aerosol Radiative Effect Using an Optimized Artificial Neural Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosols can absorb and scatter surface solar radiation (SSR), which is called the aerosol radiative forcing effect (ARF). Great efforts have been made for the estimation of the aerosol optical depth (AOD), SSR and ARF using meteorological measurements and satellite observations. However, the accuracy, and spatial and temporal resolutions of these existing AOD, SSR and ARF models should be improved to meet the application requirements, due to the uncertainties and gaps of input parameters. In this study, an optimized back propagation (BP) artificial neural network (Genetic_BP) was developed for improving the estimation of the AOD values. The retrieved AOD values using the Genetic_BP model and meteorological measurements at China Meteorological Administration (CMA) stations were used to calculate SSR and bottom of the atmosphere (BOA) ARF (ARFB) using Yang's Hybrid model (YHM). The result show that the Genetic_BP could be used for estimating AOD values with high accuracy (R = 0.866 for CASNET (China Aerosol Remote Sensing Network) stations and R = 0.865 for AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network) stations). The estimated SSR also showed a good agreement with SSR measurements at 96 CMA radiation stations, with RMSE, MAE, R and R-2 of 29.27%, 23.77%, 0.948, and 0.899, respectively. The estimated ARFB values are also highly correlated with the AERONET ARFB ones with RMSE, MAE, R and R-2 of -35.47%, -25.33%, 0.843, and 0.711, respectively. Finally, the spatial and temporal variations of AOD, SSR, and ARFB values over Mainland China were investigated. Both AOD and SSR values are generally higher in summer than in other seasons. The ARFB are generally stronger in spring and summer than in other seasons. The ranges for the monthly mean AOD, SSR and ARFB values over Mainland China are 0.183-0.333, 10.218-24.196 MJ m(-2) day(-1) and -2.986 to -1.244 MJ m(-2) day(-1), respectively. The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau has always been an area with the highest SSR, the lowest AOD and the weakest ARFB. In contrast, the Sichuan Basin has always been an area with low SSR, high AOD, and strong ARFB. The newly proposed AOD model may be of vital importance for improving the accuracy and computational efficiency of AOD, SSR and ARFB estimations for solar energy applications, ecological modeling, and energy policy.

TI  - Effect of weakened diurnal evolution of atmospheric boundary layer to air pollution over eastern China associated to aerosol, cloud - ABL feedback
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Upon the effect of atmospheric stability on air pollution, this study highlights the weakened diurnal evolution of atmospheric boundary layer (ABL), which is crucial to the formation of regional fog-haze and air pollution episodes over eastern China (ECN). The decrease of atmospheric visibility (Vis) during 1973-2012 is found to be related to the more stable ABL with weakened diurnal evolution that is characterized by a concurrent weakening of surface wind, a decrease in ABL height, and a reduction of diurnal temperature range (DTR, - 0.26 and - 0.092 degrees C/10-years in the winter and summer, respectively). With a general synchronous variation, the increase in both aerosol loading and cloud cover might work in concert to reduce solar radiation reaching the surface, stabilize ABL and weaken the diurnal ABL evolution, thereby weakening the turbulent mixing of pollutants and enhancing air pollution. This conjecture of "aerosol, cloud - ABL - air pollution" feedback, with particular emphasis on the effect of cloud (in addition to the effect of aerosol) on the ABL evolution, is supported by our analysis of 40 years trends in the cloud, Vis and DTR from surface observation, the aerosol optical depth from MODIS, and the validated MERRA-2 reanalysis aerosol, cloud and boundary layer height (by surface observation and routine radiosonde sounding). Regarding the linkage between fog-haze and diurnal evolution of the ABL, the result emphasizes the effect of a persistent high relative humidity (RH), which is found to be important to the formation of regional persistent fog-haze episodes and must be carefully considered in future study. Therefore, a chain of processes is suggested to interpret the occurrence of regional persistent fog-haze episodes over ECN. First, during a polluted day, because of aerosol radiative effects, the high ABL stability and high RH can persist throughout the day, and consequently, favoring the accumulation of pollutants as well as the secondary formation and hygroscopic growth of aerosol. Second, the maintenance of such more stable, humid and polluted ABL is in contrast to a clear day when the ABL is more convective in the afternoon and facilitates the diffusion and dilution of pollutants. Third, under a persistent stable synoptic system, the increase of air pollution associated with the weakened diurnal evolution of ABL due to the "aerosol, cloud - ABL - air pollution" feedback, as described above, can be further strengthened, thereby renders more persistent and severe air pollution events. The DTR variation in relationship with the aerosol, cloud, ABL and air pollution is also discussed.

TI  - A New InSAR Phase Demodulation Technique Developed for a Typical Example of a Complex, Multi-Lobed Landslide Displacement Field, Fels Glacier Slide, Alaska
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides can have complex, spatially strongly inhomogeneous surface displacement fields with discontinuities from multiple active lobes that are deforming while failing on nested slip surfaces at different depths. For synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR), particularly at lower resolutions, these characteristics can cause significant aliasing of the wrapped phase. In combination with steep terrain and seasonal snow cover, causing layover and temporal decorrelation, respectively, traditional phase unwrapping can become unfeasible, even after topographic phase contributions have been removed with an external high-resolution digital surface model (DSM). We present a novel method: warp demodulation that reduces the complexity of the phase unwrapping problem for noisy and/or aliased, low-resolution interferograms of discontinuous landslide displacement. The key input to our warp demodulation method is a single (or several) reference interferogram(s) from a high-resolution sensor mode such as TerraSAR-X Staring Spotlight with short temporal baseline and good coherence to allow localization of phase discontinuities and accurate unwrapping. The task of constructing suitable phase surfaces to approximate individual to-be-demodulated interferograms from the reference interferogram is made difficult by strong and spatially inhomogeneous temporal, seasonal, and interannual variations of the landslide with individual lobes accelerating or decelerating at different rates. This prevents using simple global scaling of the reference. Instead, our method uses an irregular grid of small patches straddling strong spatial gradients and phase discontinuities in the reference to find optimum local scaling factors that minimize the residual phase gradients across the discontinuities after demodulation. Next, for each to-be-demodulated interferogram, from these measurements we interpolate a spatially smooth global scaling function, which is then used to scale the (discontinuous) reference. Demodulation with the scaled reference leads to a residual phase that is also spatially smooth, allowing it to be unwrapped robustly after low-pass filtering. A key assumption of warp demodulation is that the locations of the phase discontinuities can be mapped in the reference and that they are stationary in time at the scale of the image resolution. We carry out extensive tests with simulated data to establish the accuracy, robustness, and limitations of the new method with respect to relevant parameters, such as decorrelation noise and aliasing along phase discontinuities. A realistic parameterization of the method is demonstrated for the example of the Fels Glacier Slide in Alaska using a recent late-summer high-resolution staring spotlight interferometric image pair from TerraSAR-X to demodulate. We show warp demodulation results for also recent but early-summer, partially incoherent interferograms of the same sensor, as well as for older and coarser aliased interferograms from RADARSAT-2, ALOS-1, and ERS.

T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the penetration capacity of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data through clouds and hazy atmospheric circumstances like fog, smog, light rain, mist etc., it has ability to continuous observation of flood events for producing accurate, rapid and cost effective flood mapping. A study using time series RADARSAT SAR images in flood water detection, monitoring of spatial extent and propagation of flood inundation were described and analysed in this paper. The SAR images were first calibrated, geometrically corrected and filtered. Afterward, threshold method was applied to extract the inundated areas from the SAR images. In threshold method, density slicing technique was used to separate the open water and non-water (land) areas from the images. Later, to delineate the actual flooded area, permanent water bodies (e.g. river, lake, ponds etc.) were subtracted from the open water. Flood maps were superimposed and analysed to find out the nature of spatial extent, duration of flood and to show how flooding spread through time. This study illustrates that the SAR data along with GIS can be used effectively for flood water mapping, monitoring and analysing the propagation of flood water in a flood prone area. Therefore, the findings of this study will help to take initiative to reduce the flood hazard impact and increase the flexibility in the process of flood management.

TI  - Rationale and Efficacy of Assimilating Remotely Sensed Potential Evapotranspiration for Reduced Uncertainty of Hydrologic Models
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study is to systematically attribute sources of evapotranspiration uncertainty in a hydrologic model and accordingly propose a remote sensing-based solution. Using Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for three U.S. watersheds, representing different geophysical settings, this study first addresses the effects of parameter equifinality, energy-related weather input uncertainty, and limited process representation on evapotranspiration simulation. Remotely sensed 8-day total actual evapotranspiration (AET) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is used as a reference to evaluate the model outcome. Results indicate the likelihood of a pseudo-accurate model showing high streamflow prediction skill despite severely erroneous spatiotemporal dynamics of AET. As a remedial measure, a hybrid daily potential evapotranspiration (PET) estimate, derived from MODIS, is directly ingested at each hydrologic response unit of the model to create a new configuration called SWAT-PET. A key contribution is the modified SWAT source code that integrates the model (i.e., SWAT-PET) with an automatic remote sensing data processor. The underlying notion is that remotely sensed PET works as a surrogate of actual vegetation dynamics, biophysical processes, and energy balance, without overruling the model's built-in soil moisture accounting. Noticeably, increased accuracy of soil moisture, AET, and streamflow in SWAT-PET, compared to independent sources of observations/reference estimates (i.e., field sensor, satellite, and gauge stations), approves the efficacy of the proposed approach toward improved physical consistency of hydrologic modeling. While the idea is tested for a past period, the ultimate goal is to improve near-real-time hydrologic forecasting once such PET estimates become available.

TI  - The case for the omission of axillary staging in invasive breast carcinoma that exhibits a predominant tubular growth pattern on preoperative biopsy
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - True invasive tubular breast carcinoma (TBC) is unlikely to metastasize to axillary nodes, yet it is routinely subjected to sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), even if the diagnosis was suspected preoperatively. The positive predictive value (PPV) of core biopsy for TBC and the incidence and predictors of axillary metastasis in invasive breast carcinomas identified as tubular-rich on core biopsy are unknown. Prospective patient and tumor data regarding postoperatively confirmed TBCs, and tubular-rich carcinoma identified on preoperative core biopsy between January 2005 and May 2016 was analyzed retrospectively. Axillary metastasis occurred in only 4.2% (4/95) of TBCs, all of which measured >15 mm pathologically. In 11.1% (11/99) of TBCs, the initial core biopsy was either indeterminate/suspicious or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS); therefore, their true tubular histotype and size were ascertained following operative excision and before SLNB. Nine were 15 mm, and all were node-negative. Only 63.9% (46/72) of tubular-rich core biopsies were confirmed as TBCs; the remaining 36.1% (26/72) were well-differentiated invasive nontubular carcinomas. None of the preoperative patient or tumor features were predictive of true TBC on multivariable analysis; 10.1% (7/69) of carcinomas identified as tubular-rich on core biopsy (regardless of their true histotypes) were node-positive; 23.1% (6/26) in nontubular and 2.3% (1/43) in true tubular carcinomas. Preoperative ultrasound size >15 mm was associated with axillary metastasis in 40.0% (4/10) compared to 5.7% (3/53) in those 15 mm (OR = 11.11, 95% CI = 1.99-62.04; multivariable P = .010). Axillary metastasis in TBC is dependent on pathological size; therefore, a case is made for omitting SLNB in small true TBCs confirmed following excision. Preoperative tubular-rich core biopsy is not adequately diagnostic of TBC; however, it selects carcinomas that are well-differentiated, small, and unlikely to metastasize to the axilla, thus allowing for the selective omission of SLNB.

TI  - Relation between Urban Volume and Land Surface Temperature: A Comparative Study of Planned and Traditional Cities in Japan
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The horizontal two-dimensional (2D) urban land use approach is not sufficient to trace rapid changes in urban environment. Hence, a three-dimensional (3D) approach that is different from the traditional geographical method is necessary to understand the mechanism of compound urban diversity. Using remote sensing data captured in 2010/2011 and geospatial tools and techniques, we quantified the urban volume (UV, consisting of urban built volume (UBV) and urban green volume (UGV)) and retrieved and mapped the land surface temperature (LST) of two cities in Japan (Tsukuba, a planned city, and Tsuchiura, a traditional city). We compared these two cities in terms of (1) UBV and UGV and their relationships with mean LST; and (2) the relationship of the UGV-UBV ratio with mean LST. Tsukuba had a total UBV of 74 million m(3), while Tsuchiura had a total of 89 million m(3). In terms of UGV, Tsukuba had a total of 52 million m(3), while Tsuchiura had a total of 29 million m(3). In both cities, UBV had a positive relationship with mean LST (Tsukuba: R-2 = 0.31, p < 0.001; Tsuchiura: R-2 = 0.42, p < 0.001), and UGV had a negative relationship with mean LST (Tsukuba: R-2 = 0.53, p < 0.001; Tsuchiura: R-2 = 0.19, p < 0.001). Tsukuba also had a higher UGV-UBV ratio of 54.9% in comparison with Tsuchiura, with 28.7%. Overall, the results indicate that mean LST was more intense in the traditional city (Tsuchiura). This could have been due to the difference in urban spatial structure. As a planned city, Tsukuba is still a relatively young city that has more dispersed green spaces and a well-spread (so far) built-up area.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Monitoring of Shifting Cultivation Using Landsat Images: Soft Classification Approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The practice of shifting cultivation has been increased due to an increase in population and is affecting the global issues, such as land use/land cover, biodiversity loss and environmental degradation, etc. In this study, the area of shifting cultivation lands in 1996, 2001, 2006, 2011, and 2016 were analyzed in West Karbi Anglong district of Assam by using time series imagery of Landsat Thematic Mapper, Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus, and Operational Land Imagery with 30 m. The results showed that, from 1996 to 2016 the area under shifting cultivation has been increased from 149 to 215 km(2), and was mainly distributed at elevations of 250-500 and 500-750 m and on slopes of < 10A degrees, 10A degrees-20A degrees and 20A degrees-30A degrees. The area under permanent cultivation was increased from 10 to 72 km(2).

TI  - Dynamic Change Analysis of Surface Water in the Yangtze River Basin Based on MODIS Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of remote sensing to monitor surface water bodies has gradually matured. Long-term serial water change analysis and floods monitoring are currently research hotspots of remote sensing hydrology. However, these studies are also faced with some problems, such as coarse temporal or spatial resolution of some remote sensing data. In general, flood monitoring requires high temporal resolution, and small-scale surface water extraction requires high spatial resolution. The machine learning method has been proven to be effective against long-term serial surface water extraction, such as random forests (RFs). MODIS data are well suited for large-scale surface water dynamic analysis and flood monitoring because of its short return cycle and medium spatial resolution. In this paper, the Yangtze River Basin (YRB) in China was selected as the study area, and two MODIS products (MOD09A1 and MOD13Q1) and RF method were used to extract the surface water from 2000 to 2016. Considering the disadvantages of temporal or spatial resolution of these two MODIS products, this study also presents a data fusion method to combine them and get higher spatiotemporal resolution water results. Finally, 762 surface water maps from 2000 to 2016 are obtained, whose temporal and spatial resolution is every eight days and 250 m, respectively. In addition, water extent variation is analyzed and compared to observed precipitation data. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) this constructed approach for long-term serial surface water extraction based on the RF classifier is feasible, and a good fusion method is used to obtain the surface water body with higher spatiotemporal resolution; (2) the maximum area of the surface water extent is 48.53 x 10(3) km(2), and seasonal and permanent water areas are 20.51 x 10(3) km(2) and 28.01 x 10(3) km(2), respectively; (3) surface water area is increasing in the YRB, such that seasonal water area decreased by 3450 km(2), and the permanent water area increased by 3565 km(2) in 2001-2015; (4) precipitation is the main factor causing variation in the surface water bodies, and they both show an increasing trend in 2000-2016. As such, the approach is worth referring to other remote sensing applications, and these products are very both valuable for water resource management and flood monitoring in the study area.

TI  - PyTroll: An Open-Source, Community-Driven Python Framework to Process Earth Observation Satellite Data
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - PyTroll (http://pytroll.org) is a suite of open-source easy-to-use Python packages to facilitate processing and efficient sharing of Earth Observation (EO) satellite data. The PyTroll software is intended for both 24/7 real-time operations as well as research and development. PyTroll grew out of the need to provide a resilient and agile platform that can respond quickly to new user needs and new data sources. PyTroll, being open source, stimulates international collaboration, which is vital with the rapid increase of satellite information availability. The PyTroll software development is strongly user driven and has grown over the past eight years from a collaborative effort between the Danish and Swedish national meteorological services to encompass a worldwide community with active contributors. PyTroll is being used at least operationally in the national meteorological services of Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Estonia, and Latvia. However, given its simplicity, minimal demand on user resources, and community-driven approach, it also encourages and facilitates usage of EO data for individual applications. While PyTroll was originally developed to cater to the needs of the atmospheric remote sensing community, it could be equally useful for land and ocean applications and within hydrology. This article provides an overview of PyTroll, with examples showing the capability of some of the core packages.

TI  - MEANS OF AXIOLOGICAL POSITIONING OF MASCULINITY IN MEDIEVAL LITERARY DISCOURSE (ON THE MATERIAL OF DECT AND BFM-GRAAL CORPUSES)
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the axiological language portraying of the knight in literary discourse of the 11th-13th centuries in order to reconstruct the image of a medieval man. The gender category of masculinity is essential in the Middle Ages androcentric culture. Masculinity refers to a complex of socio-psychological components: samples of behavior, psycho-emotional traits and social status, which are determined by the basis of gender peculiar to man. The corpus linguistics methods are applied on the material of two francophone diachronic corpuses. The first one is the Electronic Dictionary of Chretien de Troyes, or DECT (Dictionnaire Electronique de Chretien de Troyes), which consists of five novels of the Old French author. The second one is the Base of the medieval French, or BFM-GRAAL (Base du Francais Medieval), containing a 13th-century anonymous novel Queste del Saint Graal. Together the two corpuses contain more than 330 000 language units. In addition to the representative volume, both corpuses have a morphosyntactic markup and automatic search tools. These analytical capabilities allow identifying and classifying the axiological language representation of masculinity in medieval writings. The masculine identity is analyzed by the example of the knight (chevalier) - a member of the elite military class who represents the reference personality with basic social and cultural values of that age. The linguistic reconstruction of the knight image allows reproducing the medieval mentality in terms of ideological, ethical-value and social representations. In the practical part of the article, a step-by-step computer analysis algorithm for each corpus is presented. As a result of DECT analysis, the key axiological characteristics used in the knight portrait are revealed: generalized ameliotory, positive military, moral, social-courteous, external and pejorative traits. The simulated value hierarchy demonstrates that the most important components of the masculine identity are ameliotory, physical, social-courteous and military traits; pejorative characteristics are the least common. It is shown that the medieval artistic text has an instructive function, as the reader perceives the knight as an anthropologic archetype who personifies some virtues. The results of the BFM-GRAAL corpus analysis are a three-part model of the knight masculine identity. It includes the following components: the ideal of a master - a member of the upper feudal class, the ideal of a Christian - a clergyman, and the ideal of a vassal - a warrior loyal to his lord. At the same time, in this corpus, ameliotory sociomoral and spiritual values seem more revealing than military ones. As a result, the article demonstrates the knight-Christian standard. The collective positive masculine identity contains a symbolic objectification of virtues and sins. Masculine identity is based on the fundamental opposition "good / bad", which allows to realize the moralizing goals and to spread the courteous Christian worldview.

TI  - Symptomatic Zika Virus Infection in Infants, Children, and Adolescents Living in Puerto Rico
T2  - JAMA PEDIATRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - IMPORTANCE Little information is available regarding Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in children.OBJECTIVE To describe patients younger than 18 years who were infected with ZIKV and were enrolled in the Sentinel Enhanced Dengue and Acute Febrile Illness Surveillance System (SEDSS).DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Children infected with ZIKV with 7 or fewer days of fever or emancipated minors aged 14 to 17 years with a generalized maculopapular rash, arthritis or arthralgia, or nonpurulent conjunctivitis were eligible for enrollment on or before December 31, 2016, in Puerto Rico. Patients were evaluated using ZIKV polymerase chain reaction testing at 7 or fewer days after the onset of symptoms. Available ZIKV polymerase chain reaction-positive specimens were evaluated to determine viral loads.EXPOSURES Confirmed polymerase chain reaction-positive ZIKV infection.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Clinical characteristics and viral loads of symptomatic children with confirmed ZIKV infection.RESULTS Of 7191 children enrolled in SEDSS on or before December 31, 2016, only those with confirmed ZIKV infection (351 participants) were included in this study. Participants who had confirmed ZIKV infection included 25 infants (7.1%), 69 children (19.7%) aged 1 to 4 years, 95 (27.1%) aged 5 to 9 years, and 162 (46.1%) aged 10 to 17 years. Among these, 260 patients (74.1%) presented for evaluation of ZIKV infection at fewer than 3 days after the onset of symptoms, 340 (96.9%) were discharged to home after evaluation, and 349 (99.4%) had fever, 280 (79.8%) had a rash, 243 (69.2%) had facial or neck erythema, 234 (66.7%) had fatigue, 223 (63.5%) had headache, 212 (60.4%) had chills, 206 (58.7%) had pruritus, and 204 (58.1%) had conjunctival hyperemia. Of 480 specimens collected (317 serum and 163 urine specimens) from 349 children, the median number of days after the onset of symptoms was lower for children who had serum specimens (1day [interquartile range (IQR), 1-2 days]) than for children who had urine specimens (2 [1-3] days) (P < .001). Of 131 children who had both serum and urine specimens collected on the same day, the median viral load was higher in serum than in urine (median [IQR], 23 098 [8784-88 242] copies/mL for serum vs 9966 [2815-52 774] copies/mL for urine; P = .02). When a single serum sample from each of 317 patients was analyzed, there were no statistically significant differences in median viral loads according to age, sex, or disposition. However, the median serum viral load varied significantly according to the number of days after the onset of symptoms (0 days, 106 778 [IQR, 9772-1571718] copies/mL; 1day, 46 299 [10 663-255 030] copies/ml; 2 days, 20 678 [8763-42 458] copies/ml; and >= 3 days, 15 901 [5135-49 248] copies/ml; P = .001).CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study represents the largest study to date of ZIKV infection in the pediatric population. Most children infected with ZIKV had fever, rash, and conjunctival hyperemia. The children usually presented for evaluation at fewer than 3 days after the onset of symptoms. Viral loads for ZIKV were higher in serum vs urine specimens. Median viral loads in serum specimens differed significantly according to the number of days after the onset of symptoms.

TI  - Effect of Age on Melanoma Risk, Prognosis and Treatment Response
T2  - ACTA DERMATO-VENEREOLOGICA
M3  - Review
AB  - As for all types of cancer, the incidence of melanoma increases with age. However, naevus counts (the principal risk factor for melanoma) decrease with age; hence the relationship between ageing and melanoma is complex. Subjects who maintain a high naevus count after the age of 50 years are more likely to be affected by melanoma, as their lesions do not senesce. Longer telomere length, which is strongly related to age, is linked to high naevus counts/melanoma risk; thus melanoma biology is influenced by factors that slow down ageing. Age is also an important prognostic factor in melanoma. Increasing age leads to worse survival in stages I, II and III. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) status, which is a strong predictor of melanoma survival, is also affected by age, as SLN positivity decreases with age. However, the prognostic value of SLN on survival increases with age, so, again, these relationships are complex. In patients with stage IV melanoma, age impacts on survival because it affects responses to treatment. This review examines the effects of age on melanoma risk, prognostic factors and responses to treatment.

T2  - JOURNAL OF CHRISTIAN NURSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explored Christian nurses' views of their source of caring (Deity or other), adherence to biblical faith practices, and view of nursing as a job, career, profession, or calling. Participants who reported Deity (God, Christ, Holy Spirit) as their source of caring were more likely to view nursing as a calling and report a higher degree of volunteering (serving), giving (financially to a religious community), devotions and prayer (personal walk), and fellowship (meeting with a community of other believers). Results have implications for understanding the concept of caring within the context of a Christian worldview.

TI  - The modernizing myth in the novel <i>El zorro de arriba y el zorro de abajo</i> by Jose Maria Arguedas
T2  - LETRAS
M3  - Article
AB  - The function of myth, as a modernizing mechanism in the novel, may seem a contradiction, since it has been traditionally linked, mainly, to archaic thought, to the worldview model of the first civilizations. For that reason, this concept or category would oppose the modernizing function of a novel in the context of "El boom latinoamericano". In this article, we are interested in arguing how Jose Maria Arguedas, in his latest novel El zorro de arriba y el zorro de abajo, uses some cliches of the myth to structure a proposal for a modern novel, such as the intertextual character, the dialogue, the timeless character, the sacrificial rite and the binary character. This audacious strategy corresponds to a logic linked to its poetic claim to indigenous culture. In this sense, you can design a proposal even more ambitious than that of the Boom writers, because not only do you experience the formats of the novel in the Western style, but you also assume a cultural element of your own to build your poetics. A task that the members of the Boom could not perform.

TI  - Effects of an Extreme Flood Event on Federally Endangered Diamond Darter Abundances
T2  - AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST
M3  - Article
AB  - Extreme flood events can substantially affect riverine systems, modifying in-stream habitat and influencing fish assemblages and densities. Rare species are especially vulnerable to these disturbance events because of their small population size and often reduced phenotypic heterogeneity. In June 2016 the lower Elk River in West Virginia experienced severe flooding, resulting in a peak discharge that exceeded the 0.005 annual exceedance probability (>200 y flood) in the main stem. We obtained pre-flood and post-flood population count data and estimated abundances for one cohort of the federally endangered Diamond Darter (Crystallaria cincotta) at 15 sites. While both the total count data and total estimated abundance decreased following the flood, our analyses did not indicate the extreme flood event strongly impacted Diamond Darter abundance. This indicates individuals are able to withstand high velocities and resist displacement or mortality. In addition site-level abundances were estimated at three sentinel sites during 2015 and 2016 using a multinomial N-mixture model that accounted for variation in detestability resulting from water temperature. Mean estimated abundance varied among the three sites and between the 2 y. Our results suggest there is substantial variation in year-class strength between the two cohorts we sampled. It is suggested that survey efforts at established sentinel sites be continued on an annual basis in order to help determine factors influencing year-class strength.

TI  - Association between Ki-67 expression and clinical outcomes among patients with clinically node-negative, thick primary melanoma who underwent nodal staging
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Patients with thick primary melanomas (>= 4mm) have highly variable survival outcomes. Cell proliferation marker Ki-67 has been identified as promising biomarker in thick melanoma but has not been evaluated since the wide spread adoption of sentinel lymph node biopsy. We revisit its prognostic relevance in the sentinel node era.Methods: We studied patients with thick (>= 4mm) primary melanoma prospectively enrolled in a clinicopathological biospecimen database from 2002 to 2015, and evaluated the prognostic value of Ki-67 expression while controlling for features included in the existing staging criteria.Results: We analyzed 68 patients who underwent lymph node sampling and who had an available tumor for Ki-67 immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. The median tumor thickness was 6.0 mm; the median follow-up was 2.6 years. In multivariable analysis including nodal status and primary tumor ulceration, Ki-67 expression was an independent predictor of worse recurrence-free survival (HR 2.19, P=0.024) and overall survival (HR 2.49, P=0.028). Natural log-transformed tumor thickness (ln [thickness]) was also significantly associated with worse OS (HR 2.39, P=0.010).Conclusion: We identify Ki-67 and ln (thickness) as potential biomarkers for patients with thick melanoma who have undergone nodal staging. If validated in additional studies, these biomarkers could be integrated into the staging criteria to improve risk-stratification.

TI  - Are Lymph Node Characteristics on Axillary Ultrasound Associated with ≥3 Positive Lymph Nodes in Patients Managed by the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011 Trial Criteria?
T2  - AMERICAN SURGEON
M3  - Article
AB  - Patients often receive axillary ultrasound-biopsy (AUS-B) before clinical evaluation. One positive biopsy in the absence of palpable disease rarely indicates additional nodal involvement, but it eliminates patients from being managed by the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011 trial criteria. To determine which patients may benefit from AUS-B, we analyzed whether characteristics on AUS were associated with large-volume axillary disease and, thus, the need for axillary lymph node (LN) dissection. A retrospective review identified patients who met Z0011 criteria and underwent AUS. Clinicopathologic and ultrasound characteristics were compared between patients with <= 2 versus >= 3 positive LNs. Two hundred and seven patients with cT1-2N0 tumors underwent preoperative AUS and breast-conserving surgery. On multivariate analysis, three AUS combinations were associated with >= 3 positive LNs: cortical thickness (CT) > 4 mm + loss of fatty hilum + round shape (P = 0.0218), CT > 4 mm + loss of fatty hilum (P = 0.0211), and CT > 4 mm + round shape (P = 0.0155). Preoperative axillary LN biopsy in patients with a single abnormal LN characteristic on AUS may be unnecessary because a positive finding will eliminate management according to Z0011 criteria. Cortical thickness >4 mm combined with any other abnormal characteristic was associated with >= 3 positive LNs, supporting the performance of AUS-B in this population.

T2  - ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY

CP  - International Symposium on Polar Ice, Polar Climate, and Polar Change
CL  - Boulder, CO
AB  - Knowledge of Arctic sea-ice conditions is of great interest for Arctic residents, as well as for commercial usage, and to study the effects of climate change. Information gained from analysis of satellite data contributes to this understanding. In the course of using in situ data in combination with remotely sensed data, the question of how representative local scale measurements are of a wider region may arise. We compare in situ total sea-ice thickness measurements from the Norwegian young sea ICE expedition in the area north of Svalbard with airborne-derived total sea-ice thickness from electromagnetic soundings. A segmented and classified synthetic aperture radar (SAR) quad-pol ALOS-2 Palsar-2 satellite scene was grouped into three simplified ice classes. The area fractions of the three classes are: 11.2% 'thin', 74.4% 'level', and 14.4% 'deformed'. The area fractions of the simplified classes from ground-and helicopter-based measurements are comparable with those achieved from the SAR data. Thus, this study shows that there is potential for a stepwise upscaling from in situ, to airborne, to satellite data, which allow us to assess whether in situ data collected are representative of a wider region as observed by satellites.

TI  - Sensing the ground: On the global politics of satellite-based activism
T2  - REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, satellite imagery, previously restricted to the defence and intelligence communities, has been made available to a range of non-state actors as well. Non-governmental organisations, journalists, and celebrities such as George Clooney now use remote sensing data like digital Sherlock Holmeses to investigate and reveal human rights abuses, political violence, environmental destruction, and eco-crimes from a distance. It is often said that the increasing availability and applicability of remote sensing technologies has contributed to the rise of what can be called 'satellite-based activism' empowering non-state groups to challenge state practices of seeing and showing. In this article we argue that NGO activism is not challenging the sovereign gaze of the state but, on the contrary, actually reinforcing it. We will bolster our arguments in this regard in two prominent fields of non-governmental remote sensing: human rights and environmental governance.

TI  - Systematic versus sentinel-lymph-node-driven axillary-lymph-node dissection in clinically node-negative patients with operable breast cancer. Results of the GF-GS01 randomized trial
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-lymph-node (SLN) resection seems to minimize systematic axillary-lymph-node dissection (sALND) side effects in operated breast cancer patients. We explored whether SLN resection achieves similar therapeutic outcomes as sALND but with fewer side effects.A randomized, controlled, open-label trial with parallel-group design compared sALND restricted to cases with positive SLN biopsy (test arm, n = 774) versus SLN biopsy followed by sALND (control arm, n = 770).The five-year overall survivals in control and test arms were 96.42 and 95.64% (P = 0.2925). The estimated difference was nearly zero (precisely, - 0.79%, one-tailed 95% confidence interval (CI) limit - 2.44%). In a multivariate Cox model, the adjusted hazard ratio in the test arm was HR 0.81 (upper 95% CI limit 1.17). Advanced age (HR 1.05 per additional year, CI [1.03-1.08]), negative progesterone receptor (HR 2.17 [1.35-3.45]), SLN metastasis (HR 1.69 [1.03-2.79]), and only one SLN identification technique (HR 4.14 [1.21-14.18]) were associated with lower survival. Patients with ae<yen> 1 severe side effect at 1 month in control and test arms were 173/703 = 24.6% [21.5-28.0%] and 91/693 = 13.1% [10.7-15.9%] (P < 0.001). The estimated sensitivity of SLN biopsy (control arm) was 145/178 = 81.5% [74.8-86.7%].Restricting ALND to cases with positive SLN biopsy does not affect the overall survival but reduces by 11.5% [7.5-15.6%] (P < 0.001) the risk of severe short-time side effects of sALND.

TI  - SO<sub>2</sub> trajectories in a complex terrain environment using CALPUFF dispersion model, OMI and MODIS data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Latest improvements in the resolution of atmospheric satellite sensors that measure chemical constituents from space have led to enhanced detection of trace gases. This paper explores the use of sulfur dioxide (SO2) level 2 dataset from OMI instrument, in conjunction with aerosol optical depth and Angstrom exponent data from MODIS spectroradiometer, to estimate SO2 loads under clear and turbid atmospheres. The spatial patterns of SO2 loads in polluted atmospheric conditions are compared with a regional pollutant dispersion model (CALPUFF) and field observations near the Andes Peruvian city La Oroya, which is one of the most polluted places in the world. The efficacy of this methodology is further examined incorporating synchronous wind vectors. Results show that the spatial-temporal dynamics of OMI SO2 is in agreement with field measurements and CALPUFF. The SO2 satellite data obtained under optimal viewing conditions and clear skies are also compared with field observations. A correlation is found between in-situ measurements and OMI estimations. The correlation increases for days with predominantly fine aerosols when Angstrom exponents are between 0.7 and 1. Moreover, pixel averaging techniques and low and high spatial frequency filtration, applied to OMI SO2 data, results in a more reliable representation of the mean SO2 plume. The paper concludes that anthropogenic SO2 can be monitored from space, even for turbid sky conditions. This demonstrates the potential for the use of satellite products to improve the air quality prediction models.

TI  - Analyzing urban spatial patterns and trend of urban growth using urban sprawl matrix: A study on Kolkata urban agglomeration, India
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This research paper analyzed urban spatial pattern and trend of urban growth in Kolkata urban agglomeration, India using urban sprawl matrix during 1990-2000 & 2000-2015. Seven urban classes viz. urban primary cure, urban secondary core, sub urban fringe, scatter settlement, urban open space, non-urban area and water body were chosen for analyzing the magnitude and direction of urban expansion. Landsat TM and Landsat 8 OLI satellite data for 1990, 2000 and 2015 were used for assessing land use land cover change, urban land transformation, urban spatial pattern and trend in urban growth. The study revealed that the built up area has increased drastically. This increase in built up area is attributed to decrease in prime agricultural land and open space. The land use/land cover change matrix showed that built up area has expanded by 16.6% during 1990-2000 and 24.5% during 2000-2015. The urban expansion is a result of large share of land transformation from agricultural land at the rate of 153.1% during 1990-2000 and 66.9% during 2000-2015. Analysis of trend of urban growth in 38 municipalities and 3 municipal corporations of Kolkata urban agglomeration revealed that municipalities located along the east bank of river Hooghly and surrounded by Kolkata Municipal Corporation have experienced a very fast urban growth. Urban primary and secondary cores have increased in newly developed municipalities. Sub urban fringe has increased in the municipalities located away from river Hooghly while open space has decreased in all the old municipalities. Pattern of land transformation and trend of urban growth of Kolkata urban agglomeration for the last 25 years may help in guiding future planning and policy-making for the urban agglomeration. Integrated approach of remote sensing GIS and urban sprawl matrix has proved instrumental in analyzing urban expansion and identifying priority areas for effectives planning and management.

TI  - Space-Time Cokriging Approach for Groundwater-Level Prediction with Multiattribute Multiresolution Satellite Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The availability of complete, continuous, and reliable groundwater data is essential for preparing a regional-scale groundwater model. Poor sampling of groundwater level is often encountered. Satellite-derived data can provide possible solution to such a problem. Better coverage and timely sampled data can be easily obtained from satellite-derived data. However, getting direct and exact groundwater-level measurements from satellite data is not possible. Satellite data, hence, are used as latent variables (or secondary attributes) to predict groundwater level. A geostatistical approach (cokriging) was brought into use to predict groundwater level by using the available secondary attributes. The study was carried out in the Indo-Gangetic Basin by using Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) anomaly data and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation data as secondary attributes. The study was carried out at the finest resolution available. Groundwater-level measurements measurements are available at seasonal scale at point support, and the analyses were performed for the premonsoon season of 2005 and 2008. Four performance indicatorsmean absolute error (MAE), bias, root-mean-square error (RMSE), and coefficient of variation of root-mean-square variation [CV(RMSE)]determined the best result obtained from the analyses. The cokriging analyses were carried out for different neighborhood search radii. Four different neighborhood search radii were chosen for the present study on the basis of range of variogram of the primary attribute: (1)less than the range of variogram; (2)range of variogram; (3)more than the range of variogram; and (4)infinite radius. Different neighborhood radii were chosen to visualize any changes in predictability of the different models prepared. The best prediction was obtained for the premonsoon of 2005 with very low error values at infinite neighborhood search radius [bias=1.61m; MAE=1.77m; RMSE=2.35m; and CV(RMSE)=0.32]. With a neighborhood search radius of less than the range of semivariogram, missing values were obtained for the premonsoon of both 2005 and 2008. The overall prediction was found to be satisfactory, suggesting very good predictability of the geostatistical approach.

T2  - BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Breast carcinoma arising in a benign fibroepithelial tumor is rare, and is usually discovered incidentally during examination of the breast mass.We evaluated the clinicopathological features, treatment, and prognosis of seven women with breast carcinomas within benign fibroepithelial tumors, diagnosed and treated at a single institution between 2011 and 2015.Seven women, aged 21-64 years, visited our hospital complaining of a breast mass detected by self-checking or screening examination. All patients had well-demarcated movable breast masses. Ultrasonography showed circumscribed masses suggesting benign tumors in all cases, and mammography revealed well-defined, high-density masses, with or without calcification. The masses progressed in two patients. A preoperative histological diagnosis of carcinoma was made following needle biopsy in four patients. Tumorectomy, breast-conserving surgery, and mastectomy were performed in three, two, and two patients, respectively. One patient underwent lymph node dissection and another underwent sentinel node biopsy. Histologically, the masses were diagnosed as invasive ductal carcinoma, ductal carcinoma in situ or lobular carcinoma in situ, arising in a benign phyllodes tumor, fibroadenoma, or fibroadenomatoid mastopathy. Lymph node metastasis was detected in two patients. There was no recurrence in any of the patients.Although a carcinoma within a preexisting benign fibroepithelial tumor is extremely rare, it is important to be aware of the possibility of invasive and metastatic disease.

T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-URBAN ANALYTICS AND CITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban expansion determines socioeconomic and environmental changes with unpredictable impacts on peri-urban land, especially in ecologically fragile areas. The present study assesses the impact of dense and, respectively, discontinuous urban expansion on high-quality land consumption in 76 metropolitan regions of Southern Europe. Land quality indicators and land-use maps were considered together with the aim to analyze urban growth and land take processes in Portugal, Spain, Southern France, Italy and Greece. Differences in the rate of selective land take (high- vs. low-quality soils) were observed at the metropolitan scale depending on the size of urban regions, the average level of land quality and the percentage of built-up areas and cropland in the total landscape. Discontinuous residential settlements were more frequently developed on high-quality soils in respect to both dense and mixed residential settlements and service settlements. Urbanization - especially discontinuous urban expansion - consumed high-quality land mainly in Spain and Greece. The approach presented in this paper may inform joint policies for urban containment and the preservation of high-quality soils in peri-urban areas.

T2  - RATIO JURIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The paradigmatic reality in Colombia has been a great field of analysis and sociopolitical reflection in recent times, marked by the strong presence of a long-term armed conflict, multiple violence practices of hegemonic groups in political power, organizations political-military antisystemic, drug cartels and paramilitary groups of old and new type. Nevertheless, the liberating praxis that emerges inside / outside the Colombian indigenous movement focused on the defense of land, territory, life and culture, responds to a broad articulation with the worldview and critical thinking, horizontal and decolonial in the social sciences of the region. The political actions developed by the indigenous communities and organizations represent a content of aspects / components of thinking from below, with the land and the left (Abya Yala) focused on rethinking their own dynamics, as well as the social sciences through experiences that establish a theoretical, conceptual and methodological weight beyond the colonialism - epistemic of the moment. The methodology used in the development of the article responds to the following processes: 1) theoretical revision on the decolonial studies, the indigenous movement and its link with critical Latin American thinking; 2) the analysis of the processes / mobilizations of the Colombian indigenous movement; and 3) the conceptual and methodological interrelation between the decolonial shift and the praxis of the indigenous movement as subject - collective in the civil society scenario. The most substantial aspect found was the field of opportunity in the study of indigenous movements as sentential, collective and communal subjects. In turn, the epistemic opportunity that constitutes decoloniality as a way of thinking alternately and from below the emerging reality of the indigenous movement with respect to the internal political dynamics of the institutions and sectors hegemonic in Colombia.

TI  - Epidemiology and molecular characterization of influenza viruses in Burkina Faso, sub-Saharan Africa
T2  - INFLUENZA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY VIRUSES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe importance of influenza viruses in respiratory infections in sub-Saharan Africa has been historically overlooked, including in Burkina Faso.ObjectivesThis study therefore aimed at evaluating the prevalence and seasonal occurrence of influenza viruses in children under 5years old, at risk of influenza-related complications, presenting with influenza-like illness (ILI) or severe acute respiratory infection (SARI). The study also aimed at identifying the periods with increased influenza transmission for vaccination recommendations in Burkina Faso.MethodsFrom January 2014 to December 2015, ILI and SARI (2015 only) patients were recruited in six healthcare centers in Burkina Faso. Influenza A and B molecular detection and subtyping were performed. Clade clustering of a subset of A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) strains was deduced by performing phylogenetic analyses on hemagglutinin gene sequences. Weekly surveillance data from FluNet (2011-2013; 2016) and this study (2014-2015) were used to identify periods of increased influenza activity.ResultsInfluenza A and B viruses were detected in 15.1% (112 of 743) of ILI and 6.6% (12 of 181) of SARI patients. Overall, influenza A viruses were largely predominant (81 of 124, 65.3%), with 69.1% of A(H3N2) and 30.9% of A(H1N1)pdm09 strains. Four waves of increased transmission were identified in 2014-2015, each dominated by different influenza subtypes and clades. Between 2011 and 2016, periods of increased influenza activity varied in their frequency, duration, and timing.ConclusionInfluenza A and B viruses were detected in a substantial number of ILI and SARI cases in Burkina Faso. Vaccination in September-October would likely protect the highest number of patients.

TI  - Ecosystem response in temperature fronts in the northeastern Arabian Sea
T2  - PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Productivity is low in tropical waters outside the traditional upwelling regimes, making temperature fronts a potential marker of fish. To test the hypothesis that all temperature fronts harbour high concentrations of nutrients and phytoplankton biomass, several fronts were sampled during winter 2014 in the northeastern Arabian Sea (NEAS). The data suggest that all the sampled temperature fronts are active biological spots owing to injection of subsurface nutrients into the surface layer. The plankton response, however, varied, with enhanced zooplankton biomass (total bacterial counts) in the shelf (open-ocean) fronts, suggesting that classical (micro. bial) food webs are active. The plankton response depended on the age of the front, and, more importantly, the initial or background conditions under which a front forms. Determination of the initial conditions for a front is complicated owing to advection by the mean current and mesoscale eddies and this advection itself modulates the background conditions. An increase in integrated Chlorophyll-alpha (Chl-alpha), but not surface Chl-alpha, was observed in both shelf and open-ocean fronts, suggesting that depth -integrated Chl-alpha is likely to be a better marker of potential fishery zones (PFZs). This study suggests that the PFZ advisories may be improved by including depth integrated Chl-a, the age of the front, and background conditions in the procedure.

AB  - Changing Arctic sea-ice extent and melt season duration, and increasing economic interest in the Arctic have prompted the need for enhanced marine ecosystem studies and improvements to dynamical and forecast models. Sea-ice melt pond fraction f(p) has been shown to be correlated with the September minimum ice extent due to its impact on ice albedo and heat uptake. Ice forecasts should benefit from knowledge of f(p) as melt ponds form several months in advance of ice retreat. This study goes further back by examining the potential to predict f(p) during winter using backscatter data from the commonly available Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar. An object-based image analysis links the winter and spring thermodynamic states of first-year and multiyear sea-ice types. Strong correlations between winter backscatter and spring f(p), detected from high-resolution visible to near infrared imagery, are observed, and models for the retrieval of f(p) from Sentinel-1 data are provided (r(2) >= 0.72). The models utilize HH polarization channel backscatter that is routinely acquired over the Arctic from the two-satellite Sentinel-1 constellation mission, as well as other past, current and future SAR missions operating in the same C-band frequency. Predicted f(p) is generally representative of major ice types firstyear ice and multiyear ice during the stage in seasonal melt pond evolution where f(p) is closely related to spatial variations in ice topography.

TI  - Quantifying variance across spatial scales as part of fire regime classifications
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The emergence of large-scale fire classifications and products informed by remote sensing data has enabled opportunities to include variability or heterogeneity as part of modem fire regime classifications. Currently, basic fire metrics such as mean fire return intervals are calculated without considering spatial variance in a management context. Fire return intervals are also only applicable at a particular grain size (defined as the spatial unit of interest) even though they are typically applied homogeneously. In this study, we utilized a 29-yr fire occurrence database to show how spatial variance changes with respect to grain as postulated by Wiens (1989) when reporting fire patterns within the Great Plains, USA. We utilized data from the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity database of fire occurrence for the years 1984-2012. We analyzed median numbers of fire along with their variance at four spatial grains ranging from small units (e.g., plots at 3 x 3 km resolution) to large units (e.g., landscapes at 1500 x 2700 km resolution). Median number of fire occurrences was consistently low, irrespective of grain. Despite the consistency in low median numbers of fires across grain, variance in the numbers of fires between units decreased. Variance within units, however, did not change as grain increased indicating fire-pattern-scale inconsistencies. Fire pattern interpretations depended entirely on the scale at which it is calculated. Given that the Great Plains region has a large disparity in fire patterns (i.e., some regions burn often, while others may never burn), fire regime classifications will benefit from including scale-specific variance estimates as a foundation for understanding changes in fire regimes and corresponding social-ecological and policy responses.

TI  - Flood loss estimation using 3D city models and remote sensing data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood loss modeling provides the basis to optimize investments for flood risk management. However, detailed object-related data are not readily available to generate spatially explicit risk information. Virtual 3D city models and numerical spatial measures derived from remote sensing data provide standardized data and hold promise to fill this gap. The suitability of these data sources to characterize the vulnerability of residential buildings to flooding is investigated using the city of Dresden as a case study, where also empirical data on relative flood loss and inundation depths are available. Random forests are used for predictive analysis of these heterogeneous data sets. Results show that variables depicting building geometric properties are suitable to explain flood vulnerability. Model validation confirms that predictive accuracy and reliability are comparable to alternative models based on detailed empirical data. Furthermore, virtual 3D city models allow embedding vulnerability information into flood risk sensitive urban planning. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Forecasting maize yield at field scale based on high-resolution satellite imagery
T2  - BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating maize (Zea mays L.) yields at the field level is of great interest to farmers, service dealers, and policy-makers. The main objectives of this study were to: i) provide guidelines on data selection for building yield forecasting models using Sentinel-2 imagery; ii) compare different statistical techniques and vegetation indices (VIs) during model building; and iii) perform spatial and temporal validation to see if empirical models could be applied to other regions or when models' coefficients should be updated. Data analysis was divided into four steps: i) data acquisition and preparation; ii) selection of training data; iii) building of forecasting models; and iv) spatial and temporal validation. Analysis was performed using yield data collected from 19 maize fields located in Brazil (2016 and 2017) and in the United States (2016), and normalised vegetation indices (NDVI, green NDVI and red edge NDVI) derived from Sentinel-2. Main outcomes from this study were: i) data selection impacted yield forecast model and fields with narrow yield variability and/or with skewed data distribution should be avoided; ii) models considering spatial correlation of residuals outperformed Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression; iii) red edge NDVI was most frequently retained into the model compared with the other VIs; and iv) model prediction power was more sensitive to yield data frequency distribution .than to the geographical distance or years. Thus, this study provided guidelines to build more accurate maize yield forecasting models, but also established limitations for up-scaling, from farm-level to county, district, and state-scales.

T2  - Journal of healthcare risk management : the journal of the American Society for Healthcare Risk Management
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Communication failure is a significant source of adverse events in health care and a leading root cause of sentinel events reported to the Joint Commission. The Veterans Health Administration National Center for Patient Safety established Clinical Team Training (CTT) as a comprehensive program to enhance patient safety and to improve communication and teamwork among health care professionals. CTT is based on techniques used in aviation's Crew Resource Management (CRM) training. The aviation industry has reached a significant safety record in large part related to the culture change generated by CRM and sustained by its recurrent implementation. This article focuses on the improvement of communication, teamwork, and patient safety by utilizing a standardized, CRM-based, interprofessional, immersive training in diverse clinical areas. The Teamwork and Safety Climate Questionnaire was used to evaluate safety climate before and after CTT. The scores for all of the 27 questions on the questionnaire showed an increase from baseline to 12 months, and 11 of those increases were statistically significant. A recurrent training is recommended to maintain the positive outcomes. CTT enhances patient safety and reduces risk of patient harm by improving teamwork and facilitating clear, concise, specific and timely communication among health care professionals.

TI  - Is extracapsular nodal extension in sentinel nodes a predictor for nonsentinel metastasis and is there an impact on survival parameters?A retrospective single center cohort study with 324 patients
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Z0011 trial has fundamentally changed axillary management in breast cancer patients. However, some important questions remain, like the role of extracapsular nodal extension (ENE) in positive sentinel nodes and the need for further axillary treatment. In this retrospective cohort study, we reviewed and analyzed data from 342 clinically node negative (cN0) breast cancer patients with a positive sentinel node and subsequent axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) from the BRENDA data base. The 104 (30.4%) ENE positive patients had a significantly higher proportion of 3 positive axillary lymph nodes (65.0%) compared to ENE negative patients with a positive sentinel node (21.4%). Likewise, ENE positive patients had significantly more often lymph node metastasis size >2mm (96.2%) than ENE negative patients (72.7%). T1 status was observed significantly more often in ENE negative patients (53.2%) than in ENE positive patients (24.0%). While ENE was linked to worse overall survival in univariate analysis, this effect disappeared when adjusting for nodal status, age, and comorbidities in multivariate analysis. ENE of the sentinel node is an important predictor for nonsentinel lymph node involvement. We suggest that ENE influences survival only via a higher number of positive nodes - one of the most predictive parameters for survival outcome in breast cancer.

TI  - Mapping and Monitoring Lakes Intra-Annual Variability in Semi-Arid Regions: A Case of Study in Patagonian Plains (Argentina)
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - In arid and semi-arid regions, the climatic impact on lakes is especially critical, as they are scarce and play an important role as a primary source of the water supply. However, in some extended regions with those climatic conditions, the implementation of an in-situ monitoring program of high temporal resolution of the water resources is not possible due to its logistics and costs. Thus, developing an accurate methodology to monitor the evolution of water bodies is especially critical in these areas. For example, with remote sensing images, lake area fluctuation can be analyzed. The main objective of this study was to identify an efficient remote sensing methodology, with a temporal resolution that allows for analyzing intra-annual lake area variations. For detecting lakes area changes six Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS, National Aeronautics and Space Administration products) indexes and layers were analyzed and compared. We applied the methods to the Musters (deep) and Colhue Huapi (shallow) lakes, which are located in the extra-Andean Argentine Patagonia plains (semi-arid region). The MODIS products have not been accurate to detect the areal variations of the deep lake, probably because the spatial resolution of these images is not specific enough to identify the slight variation that these lakes usually have on the extension of their area. On the contrary, MODIS products have been accurate to analyze the areal changes of the shallow lake. The Colhue Huapi lake area fluctuated between 105 km(2) to 797 km(2). The Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (a combination of green and middle infrared electromagnetic spectrum), as well as two bands that include a different range of middle infrared surface reflectance (2105-2155 nm; 1628-1652 nm), were the most accurate to identify the variation of the lake area.

T2  - WOUNDS-A COMPENDIUM OF CLINICAL RESEARCH AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is most commonly found on sun-damaged skin and less often occurs on the toes and feet. Case Report. A 41-year-old man with a history of human immunodeficiency virus and asthma, who had received highly active antiretroviral therapy for 7 years while incarcerated, presented to the emergency department with a primary SCC of the left foot with inguinal lymph node metastasis. The patient underwent a left foot transmetatarsal amputation; due to noncompliance, he underwent a below-the-knee amputation 17 days later as a result of surgical findings and extent of infection. The surgical site fully healed without further complications. The patient now has phantom limb pain of the left leg, sees oncology for palliative marijuana use, and refuses the recommended positron-emission tomography/computed tomography scan for completion of cancer staging. Conclusions. This case shows the importance of patient compliance and timely treatment of SCC and surgical wounds in an immunosuppressed individual.

TI  - The acquisition of impervious surface area from LANDSAT 8 satellite sensor data using urban indices: a comparative analysis
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid and irregular urbanization is an essential issue in terms of environmental assessment and management. The dynamics of landscape patterns should be observed and analyzed by local authorities for a sustainable environment. The aim of this study is to determine which spectral urban index, originated from old Landsat missions, represents impervious area better when new generation Earth observation satellite Landsat 8 data are used. Two datasets of Landsat 8, acquired on 2 September 2013 and 10 September 2016, were utilized to investigate the consistency of the results. In this study, commonly used urban indices namely normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), index-based built-up index (IBI), urban index (UI), and enhanced built-up and bareness index (EBBI) were utilized to extract impervious areas. The accuracy assessment of urban indices was conducted by comparing the results with pan-sharpened images, which were classified using maximum likelihood classification (MLC) method. The kappa values of MLC, IBI, NDBI, EBBI, and UI for 2013 dataset were 0.89, 0.79, 0.71, 0.59, and 0.49, respectively, and the kappa values of MLC, IBI, NDBI, EBBI, and UI for 2016 dataset were 0.90, 0.78, 0.70, 0.56, and 0.47, respectively. In addition, area information was extracted from indices and classified images, and the obtained outcomes showed that IBI presented better results than the other urban indices, and UI extracted impervious areas worse than the other indices in both selected cases. Consequently, Landsat 8 satellite data can be considered as an important source to extract and monitor impervious surfaces for the sustainable development of cities.

TI  - Understanding the spatial distribution of eroded areas in the former rural homelands of South Africa: Comparative evidence from two new non-commercial multispectral sensors
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we determine the most suitable multispectral sensor that can accurately detect and map eroded areas from other land cover types in Sekhukhune rural district, Limpopo Province, South Africa. Specifically, the study tested the ability of multi-date (wet and dry season) Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI images in detecting and mapping eroded areas. The implementation was done, using a robust non-parametric classification ensemble: Discriminant Analysis (DA). Three sets of analysis were applied (Analysis 1: Spectral bands as independent dataset; Analysis 2: Spectral vegetation indices as independent and Analysis 3: Combined spectral bands and spectral vegetation indices). Overall classification accuracies ranging between 80% to 81.90% for MSI and 75.71%-80.95% for 011 were derived for the wet and dry season, respectively. The integration of spectral bands and spectral vegetation indices showed that Sentinel-2 (OA = 83, 81%), slightly performed better than Landsat 8, with 82, 86%. The use of bands and vegetation indices as independent dataset resulted in slightly weaker results for both sensors. Sentinel-2 MSI bands located in the NIR (0.785-0.900 mu m), red edge (0.698-0.785 mu m) and SWIR (1.565-2.280 mu m) regions were selected as the most optimal for discriminating degraded soils from other land cover types. However, for Landsat 8011, only the SWIR (1.560-2.300 mu m), NIR (0.845-0.885 mu m) region were selected as the best regions. Of the eighteen spectral vegetation indices computed, NDVI and SAVI and SAVI and Global Environmental Monitoring Index (GEMI) were ranked selected as the most suitable for detecting and mapping soil erosion. Additionally, SRTM DEM derived information illustrates that for both sensors eroded areas occur on sites that are 600 m and 900 m of altitude with similar trends observed in both dry and wet season maps. Findings of this work emphasize the importance of free and readily available new generation sensors in continuous landscape-scale soil erosion monitoring. Besides, such information can help to identify hotspots and potentially vulnerable areas, as well as aid in developing possible control and mitigation measures.

T2  - SAINS MALAYSIANA
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing and GIS are robust tools in detection of fishing grounds which is important in providing fish sustainability for human being. This recent tool allows fishing grounds detection at minimal cost and optimizes effort. The objectives of this study were to investigate the relationship between R. kanagurta fishing grounds with environmental factors and to determine its potential fishing grounds. MODIS derived satellite data of Chl-a and sea surface temperature (SST) and fisheries catch data of 2008 and 2009 were analyzed using suitability index (SI) and generalized additive model (GAM) in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) off the East Coast of Peninsular Malaysia. Distribution of R. kanagurta was associated with preferred range of 0.20 to 0.30 mg/m(3) for Chl-a and 29 to 30 degrees C for SST. GAM indicated that these parameters influenced fish distribution (p<0.001). Potential fishing ground maps derived from the SI and GAM model indicated accuracy at 75% with kappa of 0.7 and accuracy at 87.6% with kappa of 0.8, respectively. This study indicated the capability of GAM as an exploratory tool to map the potential fishing grounds of R. kanagurta in the EEZ waters.

TI  - Using multi-source remote sensing data to classify larch plantations in Northeast China and support the development of multi-purpose silviculture
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to increasing timber demands, large areas of secondary forests have been converted to larch plantations (LPs) in Northeast China because the secondary forests could not produce timber as much as LPs. However, there are a series of ecological problems such as lower soil fertility, reduced water-holding capacity and acidification of surface runoff water occurring in LPs because of the single-species composition of LPs. Therefore, a guidance on how to transform LPs into larch-broadleaf mixed forests (LBMFs) at a large spatial scale is needed for local foresters. First, Landsat time series data set and SPOT-5 images were combined to map the spatial-temporal distribution of LPs in Northeast China. Then, the topographical characteristics of LPs in 2010s were determined. Furthermore, three sub-regions of LPs were divided closely linking to their ecosystem services and forest management aims. Finally, detailed information on how to transform the LPs into LBMFs was given according to the three sub-regions. The results showed that the area of LPs increased during 1980s and 2010s, and reached 2.61 million ha in 2010s. Of which, 0.72 million ha (27.6%) and 1.89 million ha (72.4%) LPs distributed in slopes less than 5A degrees and greater than 5A degrees, respectively. Of the LPs (72.4%) in slopes greater than 5A degrees, 48.7 and 23.7% located in downslope (LPs locating at the down slope of adjacent secondary forests in the same aspect) and upslope (LPs locating at the up slope of adjacent secondary forests in the same aspect), respectively; 0.10 million ha (3.8%) located in slopes greater than 25A degrees. The LPs were divided into Sub-Regions-I, II, III according to slopes. For Sub-region-I (top role is to produce timber), self-fertilizing shrub species can be introduced after clean cutting for young-aged LPs, and release thinning can be applied for middle-aged LPs, fast growth thinning for near-matured LPs, and clear cutting for matured LPs. For Sub-Region-II (the priority is to provide water conservation combined with timber production), the LPs should be induced into LBMFs. The LPs located the downslope positions in Sub-Region-II can be transformed to LBMFs by natural regeneration of broadleaved tree species after thinning because of enough seed sources of broadleaved tree species from the secondary forests locating the upslope positions. The LPs located the upslope positions or the region where seed sources of broadleaved tree species are unavailable in Sub-Region-II must be induced to LBMFs by artificial regeneration. For Sub-Region-III (the preference is only for water conservation because the slope is greater than 25A degrees), the LPs should be particularly protected from intensive disturbances, and induced into LBMFs by natural regeneration.

TI  - MODELING OF SATELLITE DATA TO IDENTIFY THE SEASONAL PATTERNS AND TRENDS OF VEGETATION INDEX IN KATHMANDU VALLEY, NEPAL FROM 2000 TO 2015
T2  - JURNAL TEKNOLOGI
M3  - Article
AB  - Normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) data were analysed to identify the seasonal patterns and the time series trends of vegetation in Kathmandu. The data were managed in three steps: reordering, removal of unreliable values and validating. A cubic spline function was used to examine annual seasonal patterns that revealed regular seasonal peaks (day 225 to 280) and troughs (day 50 to 81) of vegetation and start of greening from April and of browning from November. Linear regression models were fitted to seasonally adjusted NDVI, which statistically showed 40.70% of the grid cells had a significant increase and 24.71% of it had decreasing trends. To adjust for autocorrelation, generalized estimating equations (GEE) were fitted to the data for whole area that showed, the overall vegetation has been significantly declining at a rate of -0.005 degrees C and -0.006 degrees C per decade for 2000-2004 and 2010-2015 respectively. The recent period of decline is alarming for a growing city like Kathmandu.

TI  - Real-Time, Automated Detection of Ventilator-Associated Events: Avoiding Missed Detections, Misclassifications, and False Detections Due to Human Error
T2  - INFECTION CONTROL AND HOSPITAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE. To validate a system to detect ventilator associated events (VAEs) autonomously and in real time.DESIGN. Retrospective review of ventilated patients using a secure informatics platform to identify VAEs (ie, automated surveillance) compared to surveillance by infection control (IC) staff (ie, manual surveillance), including development and validation cohorts.SETTING. The Massachusetts General Hospital, a tertiary-care academic health center, during January-March 2015 (development cohort) and January-March 2016 (validation cohort).PATIENTS. Ventilated patients in 4 intensive care units.METHODS. The automated process included (1) analysis of physiologic data to detect increases in positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2); (2) querying the electronic health record (EHR) for leukopenia or leukocytosis and antibiotic initiation data; and (3) retrieval and interpretation of microbiology reports. The cohorts were evaluated as follows: (1) manual surveillance by IC staff with independent chart review; (2) automated surveillance detection of ventilator-associated condition (VAC), infection-related ventilator-associated complication (IVAC), and possible VAP (PVAP); (3) senior IC staff adjudicated manual surveillance-automated surveillance discordance. Outcomes included sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and manual surveillance detection errors. Errors detected during the development cohort resulted in algorithm updates applied to the validation cohort.RESULTS. In the development cohort, there were 1,325 admissions, 479 ventilated patients, 2,539 ventilator days, and 47 VAEs. In the validation cohort, there were 1,234 admissions, 431 ventilated patients, 2,604 ventilator days, and 56 VAEs. With manual surveillance, in the development cohort, sensitivity was 40%, specificity was 98%, and PPV was 70%. In the validation cohort, sensitivity was 71%, specificity was 98%, and PPV was 87%. With automated surveillance, in the development cohort, sensitivity was 100%, specificity was 100%, and PPV was 100%. In the validation cohort, sensitivity was 85%, specificity was 99%, and PPV was 100%. Manual surveillance detection errors included missed detections, misclassifications, and false detections.CONCLUSIONS. Manual surveillance is vulnerable to human error. Automated surveillance is more accurate and more efficient for VAE surveillance.

TI  - Assessment of Surface Urban Heat Island in Three Cities Surrounded by Different Types of Land-Cover Using Satellite Images
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-cover change is the main factor of Land Surface Temperature (LST) variation in urban areas. The temperature of man-made classes within cities is normally higher than natural classes in the surrounding areas which leads to the Urban Heat Island (UHI) phenomenon. In this study, LST maps of three cities (i.e. Paris, Riyadh and Manama) are analyzed to investigate how SUHI reacts in different cities. The SUHI intensity during summer and winter is also assessed to understand the seasonal changes of SUHI. The Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) images have been used as the main data source for investigating temperature variability in the urban areas. However, in order to define different types of land-cover and correlate those with AVHRR pixel values, one of Landsat sensors have also been used in each case. These include Thematic Mapper, Enhanced Thematic Mapper or Operational Land Imager, depending on their synchronization with the AVHRR images. The analysis of the temperature variation showed that the behavior of SUHI is not the same in different cities and is dependent on the land-covers surrounding the city.

TI  - Automatic Raft Labeling for Remote Sensing Images via Dual-Scale Homogeneous Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Raft-culture is a way of utilizing water for farming aquatic product. Automatic raft-culture monitoring by remote sensing technique is an important way to control the crop's growth and implement effective management. This paper presents an automatic pixel-wise raft labeling method based on fully convolutional network (FCN). As rafts are always tiny and neatly arranged in images, traditional FCN method fails to extract the clear boundary and other detailed information. Therefore, a homogeneous convolutional neural network (HCN) is designed, which only consists of convolutions and activations to retain all details. We further design a dual-scale structure (DS-HCN) to integrate higher-level contextual information for accomplishing sea-land segmentation and raft labeling at the same time in a uniform framework. A dataset with Gaofen-1 satellite images was collected to verify the effectiveness of our method. DS-HCN shows a satisfactory performance with a better interpretability and a more accurate labeling result.

TI  - Simulation of FY-2D infrared brightness temperature and sensitivity analysis to the errors of WRF simulated cloud variables
T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study simulated FY-2D satellite infrared brightness images based on the WRF and RTTOV models. The effects of prediction errors in WRF micro- and macroscale cloud variables on FY-2D infrared brightness temperature accuracy were analyzed. The principle findings were as follows. In the T+0-48 h simulation time, the root mean square errors of the simulated brightness temperatures were within the range 10-27 K, i.e., better than the range of 20-40 K achieved previously. In the T +0-24 h simulation time, the correlation coefficients between the simulated and measured brightness temperatures for all four channels were > 0.5. The simulation performance of water channel IR3 was stable and the best. The four types of cloud microphysical scheme considered all showed that the simulated values of brightness temperature in clouds were too high and that the distributions of cloud systems were incomplete, especially in typhoon areas. The performance of the THOM scheme was considered best, followed in descending order by the WSM6, WDM6, and LIN schemes. Compared with observed values, the maximum deviation appeared in the range 253-273 K for all schemes. On the microscale, the snow water mixing ratio of the THOM scheme was much bigger than that of the other schemes. Improving the production efficiency or increasing the availability of solid water in the cloud microphysical scheme would provide slight benefit for brightness temperature simulations. On the macroscale, the cloud amount obtained by the scheme used in this study was small. Improving the diagnostic scheme for cloud amount, especially high-level cloud, could improve the accuracy of brightness temperature simulations. These results could provide an intuitive reference for forecasters and constitute technical support for the creation of simulated brightness temperature images for the FY-4 satellite.

TI  - Distinguishing between Hazardous Flooding and Non-Hazardous Agronomic Inundation in Irrigated Rice Fields: A Case Study from West Java
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An accurate flood detection method is essential for obtaining areas of irrigated rice fields affected by flooding. This paper aims to distinguish between rice fields with flooding and rice fields with agronomic inundation using MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 8 day 500 m spatial resolution (MOD09A1) imageries over irrigated rice fields with complex cropping patterns in West Java. Over the past decade, Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) <= 0.1 derived from moderate resolution remote sensing imageries has been used for detecting flooding in irrigated rice fields. Without additional farming information, this paper argues that EVI <= 0.1 cannot estimate flood areas correctly, given the existence of both hazardous flooding and non-hazardous agronomic inundation in irrigated rice fields. Adding a threshold of 40-day duration representing land preparation and transplanting activities enables EVI <= 0.1 to distinguish between agronomic inundation and flooding in irrigated rice fields. The difference in the Start of Season (SOS) between the wet planting season 2013/2014 and long-term average (2000-2015) shows that the Overall Accuracy (OA) and F1 scores are 75.96% and 81.74%, respectively. The confusion matrix using the respondents' reports shows OA of 80.5% and Kappa of 60.16%. The quality of flood maps is partly influenced by environmental processes, human decisions, and mixed pixels.

TI  - Robotic lateral oropharyngectomy following diagnostic tonsillectomy is oncologically safe in patients with high risk human papillomavirus related squamous cell cancer
T2  - EUROPEAN ARCHIVES OF OTO-RHINO-LARYNGOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Diagnostic tonsillectomy is rarely an oncologic operation owing to close or positive margins. The standard of care is for further treatment to the primary site, typically with adjuvant radiotherapy.14 patients with close or positive margins following a diagnostic tonsillectomy underwent transoral robotic surgery (TORS) and lateral oropharyngectomy; five patients with the longest follow-up had their excision specimens examined with a step serial sectioning technique (SSS).Conventional histopathological examination of the TORS resection specimens did not demonstrate residual carcinoma in 13 patients, confirmed by examination using SSS in 5 patients. There were no post-operative complications or long-term functional deficit. Seven patients received surgery alone with 100% overall and disease specific survival, respectively (median follow-up 27.5 months; range 5.2-50.4).This prospective study suggests that TORS lateral oropharyngectomy alone is an oncologically safe treatment when close or positive margins are identified on diagnostic tonsillectomy in HPV-positive SCC.

TI  - SAR Tomography as an Add-On to PSI: Detection of Coherent Scatterers in the Presence of Phase Instabilities
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The estimation of deformation parameters using persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) is limited to single dominant coherent scatterers. As such, it rejects layovers wherein multiple scatterers are interfering in the same range-azimuth resolution cell. Differential synthetic aperture radar (SAR) tomography can improve deformation sampling as it has the ability to resolve layovers by separating the interfering scatterers. In this way, both PSI and tomography inevitably require a means to detect coherent scatterers, i.e., to perform hypothesis testing to decide whether a given candidate scatterer is coherent. This paper reports the application of a detection strategy in the context of tomography as an add-on to PSI. As the performance of a detector is typically linked to the statistical description of the underlying mathematical model, we investigate how the statistics of the phase instabilities in the PSI analysis are carried forward to the subsequent tomographic analysis. While phase instabilities in PSI are generally modeled as an additive noise term in the interferometric phase model, their impact in SAR tomography manifests as a multiplicative disturbance. The detection strategy proposed in this paper allows extending the same quality considerations as used in the prior PSI processing (in terms of the dispersion of the residual phase) to the subsequent tomographic analysis. In particular, the hypothesis testing for the detection of coherent scatterers is implemented such that the expected probability of false alarm is consistent between PSI and tomography. The investigation is supported with empirical analyses on an interferometric data stack comprising 50 TerraSAR-X acquisitions in stripmap mode, over the city of Barcelona, Spain, from 2007-2012.

TI  - Landsat-Based Land Use Change Assessment in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest: Forest Transition and Sugarcane Expansion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we examine the hypothesis of a forest transition in an area of early expansion of the agricultural frontier over the Brazilian Atlantic Forest in the south-central part of the State of SAo Paulo. Large scale land use/cover changes were assessed by integrating Landsat imagery, census data, and landscape metrics. Two Landsat multi-temporal datasets were assembled for two consecutive periods-1995-2006 and 2006-2013-to assess changes in forest cover according to four classes: (i) transition from non-forest cover to planted forest (NF-PF); (ii) transition from non-forest to secondary (successional) forest (NF-SF); (iii) conservation of planted forest (PF) and (iv) conservation of forest remnants (REM). Data from the two most recent, 1995/96 and 2006 agricultural censuses were analyzed to single out major changes in agricultural production. The total area of forest cover, including primary, secondary, and planted forest, increased 30% from 1995 to 2013, whereas forest planted in non-forest areas (NF-PF) and conservation of planted forest (PF) accounted for 14.1% and 19.6%, respectively, of the total forest area by 2013. Such results showed a relatively important forest transition that would be explained mostly by forest plantations though. Analysis of the landscape metrics indicated an increase in connectivity among forest fragments during the period of study, and revealed that nearly half of the forest fragments were located within 50 m from riverbeds, possibly suggesting some level of compliance with environmental laws. Census data showed an increase in both the area and productivity of sugarcane plantations, while pasture and citrus area decreased by a relatively important level, suggesting that sugarcane production has expanded at the expense of these land uses. Both satellite and census data helped to delineate the establishment of two major production systems, the first one dominated by sugarcane plantations approximately located in the NE part of the study area, and a second one concentrating most of the forest plantations in the SW portion of the study area, where most of the forest transition could be observed.

TI  - Present and Future Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance in Animals: Principles and Practices
T2  - MICROBIOLOGY SPECTRUM
M3  - Article
AB  - There is broad consensus internationally that surveillance of the levels of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) occurring in various systems underpins strategies to address the issue. The key reasons for surveillance of resistance are to determine (i) the size of the problem, (ii) whether resistance is increasing, (iii) whether previously unknown types of resistance are emerging, (iv) whether a particular type of resistance is spreading, and (v) whether a particular type of resistance is associated with a particular outbreak. The implications of acquiring and utilizing this information need to be considered in the design of a surveillance system. AMR surveillance provides a foundation for assessing the burden of AMR and for providing the necessary evidence for developing efficient and effective control and prevention strategies. The codevelopment of AMR surveillance programs in humans and animals is essential, but there remain several key elements that make data comparisons between AMR monitoring programs, and between regions, difficult. Currently, AMR surveillance relies on uncomplicated in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility methods. However, the lack of harmonization across programs and the limitation of genetic information of AMR remain the major drawbacks of these phenotypic methods. The future of AMR surveillance is moving toward genotypic detection, and molecular analysis methods are expected to yield a wealth of information. However, the expectation that these molecular techniques will surpass phenotypic susceptibility testing in routine diagnosis and monitoring of AMR remains a distant reality, and phenotypic testing remains necessary in the detection of emerging resistant bacteria, new resistance mechanisms, and trends of AMR.

TI  - Arctic Sea Ice Characterization Using Spaceborne Fully Polarimetric L-, C-, and X-Band SAR With Validation by Airborne Measurements
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) polarimetry has become a valuable tool for sea ice analysis. Here, we employ an automatic sea ice classification algorithm on two sets of spatially and temporally near coincident fully polarimetric acquisitions from the ALOS-2, Radarsat-2, and TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X satellites. Overlapping coincident sea ice freeboard measurements from airborne laser scanner data are used to validate the classification results. The automated sea ice classification algorithm consists of two steps. In the first step, we perform a polarimetric feature extraction procedure. Next, the resulting feature vectors are ingested into a trained neural network classifier to arrive at a pixelwise supervised classification. Coherency matrix-based features that require an eigendecomposition are found to be either of low relevance or redundant to other covariance matrix-based features, which makes coherency matrix-based features dispensable for the purpose of sea ice classification. Among the most useful features for classification are matrix invariant-based features (geometric intensity, scattering diversity, and surface scattering fraction). Classification results show that 100% of the open water is separated from the surrounding sea ice and that the sea ice classes have at least 96.9% accuracy. This analysis reveals analogous results for both X-band and C-band frequencies and slightly different for the L-band. The subsequent classification produces similarly promising results for all four acquisitions. In particular, the overlapping image portions exhibit a reasonable congruence of detected sea ice when compared with high-resolution airborne measurements.

TI  - Enhancement of Image Classification for Forest Encroachment Mapping With Destriped SWIR Band in the Wavelet Domain
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Commonly used destriping techniques in remote sensing applications have underlying Fourier transform process which tends to alter heavily the digital number values of surface features; thus, impacting its subsequent use in any image classification scheme. In this paper, we develop a novel destriping technique in the wavelet domain where statistical measures namely, standard deviation, signal-to-noise ratio, and entropy of the image and stripes are integrated in the wavelet filter design. Wavelet transform essentially keeps spatial information of the stripes in the transformed domain; thus, allowing a wavelet to filter stripes at different scales with minimal effect on image pixels relating to the surface features. We further propose a novel s for an environmental application, where a destriped band in the wavelet domain is included in image classification for forest encroachment mapping. The technique is implemented on IRS-1D LISS-III data for the mapping of forest encroachment in the Andaman and Nicobar Island, India, wherein the short wave infrared (SWIR) band is destriped and included in the image classification based on the linear support vector machine method. Statistical accuracy in terms of Kappa values for the resultant classified images by 1) including striped SWIR, 2) excluding SWIR, and 3) using destriped SWIR band are 0.97, 0.98, and 1, respectively. Z-tests indicate that the thematic map with destriped SWIR band is statistically significantly better than the other two maps.

TI  - Multi-polarized Radarsat-2 satellite sensor in assessing forest vigor from above ground biomass
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimates of forest biomass are increasingly important in relation to sequestration of carbon by forest trees. Satellite remote sensing is a useful tool for biomass estimation and monitoring of forest ecological processes. Microwave synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can increase the accuracy of estimations of forest biomass in comparison to optical remote sensing, due to the unique capacities of SAR, including high penetrability, volumetric scattering, interaction with surface roughness, and dielectric property. We studied the potential of multi-polarized C-band Radarsat-2, a SAR technology, with HH, HV and VV polarization for estimating biomass of moist tropical Indian forest. Backscatter values are correlated with field-based biomass values and are regressed to generate models for estimating biomass. HH polarization provided maximum information regarding tree biomass. A coefficient of determination of 0.49 was calculated for HH polarized C-band image with in situ measurements. An exponential model was proved to be best suited for estimating forest biomass. Correlation of 0.62 and RMSE of 24.6 t ha(-1) were calculated for the relationship between estimated and predicted biomass values for the best fit model. The average absolute accuracy of the model was 61%, while Willmott's index of agreement was 0.87. Results suggest that most of the biomass of the area ranged within 70 t ha(-1) a probably due to the saturation of C-band around 60-70 t ha(-1) for tropical forests.

TI  - Atmospheric Internal Gravity Waves Caused by Tsunamis over Kuril Islands
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - MODIS (Aqua and Terra) space images of the northwest part of the Pacific Ocean at instants of considerable tsunamis in 2009-2011 have been analyzed. Periodic cloud structures typical for internal gravity waves (IGWs) in the atmosphere have been revealed in the region of the Kuril Islands in five cases. It has been shown that the meteorological conditions observed during those events favored the appearance of such phenomena. The continuous oceanic upwelling in the region of the Kuril-Kamchatka Trench is a favorable factor for IGW generation due to the creation of temperature contrasts observed both in warm and cold seasons between the ground layer of the atmosphere and ocean surface. The estimate of the structure of cloud manifestations of atmospheric waves by satellite images testifies also to the influence of the Kuril Ridge orography on their appearance and propagation over the water area under study. The increase in amplitudes and duration of oscillations caused by the tsunami in the shelf zone can be an auxiliary factor for the IGW generation over coastal territories.

TI  - Classification and Mapping of Topogeosystems by the Method of Factorial-Dynamical Series of Facies
T2  - GEOGRAPHY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In studying the structure of geosystems within the key area (125.3 km(2)) on the northern slope of Khamar-Daban Range, we used the method of factorial-dynamical series of facies as developed by A. A. Krauklis. Because of the composite and mosaic pattern of the study area, the typization was carried out according to the commonalty of the functional attributes. Results of 83 comprehensive physical-geographical descriptions of test sites were used in compiling the hierarchical classification of geosystems and the map of the key site at the level of groups of facies at a scale of 1:50 000. Results of an automatic pixel-based classification of Landsat-8 and Aster images and a processing of the SRTM digital elevation model were used in delineating the boundaries of the landscape units. On the territory of the key area we identified 46 types of facies which were grouped together into the following hierarchical levels: groups of facies-classes of facies-geoms. The types of facies are represented on the territory by climax states as well as by succession stages. The entire diversity of the geosystems is represented by five geoms: the subgoletz shrub geom on rocky ground and corroms which includes one class of facies with one group of facies; the subalpinotype high-mountain-meadow geom (one class and three groups); the mountain-taiga dark-coniferous/open woodland geom (two classes and two groups); the mountain-taiga dark-coniferous geom (two classes and four groups), and the piedmont plain dark-coniferous geom (two classes and four groups). The territory is dominated by the following groups of facies: spruce-fir and fir-spruce forb and forb-fern forests with bilberries on steep slopes on combinations of Entic Podzols and Regosols; Siberian stone pine-spruce (with fir krummholz) subshrub small grass-sedge sphagnum forests on combinations of Folic Entic Podzols, Histic Cryosols and Fibric Histisols, and fir (with spruce and Siberian stone pine) forests with forbs and bergenia in the herbaceous layer on combinations of Humic Leptosols and Dystric Cambisols with rock outcrops on steep slopes. The resulting map of the geosystems makes it possible to take into account the characteristic properties of the mountainous territory in the process of planning and projecting the recreational activity emerging in this area.

TI  - More major earthquakes at the Nepal Himalaya? - Study on Coulomb stress perspective
T2  - PHYSICS OF THE EARTH AND PLANETARY INTERIORS
M3  - Article
AB  - On April 2015 a major earthquake of 7.9 Mw occurred in the Nepal Himalaya, followed by 553 earthquakes of local magnitude greater than 4.0 within the first 43 days including another major event of 7.3 Mw. We resolve the static coulomb failure stress (CFS) change onto the finite fault models of 7.9 Mw after Elliott et al. (2016) and Galezka et al. (2015) and its effect on associated receiver faults. Correlation of aftershocks with the enhanced CFS condition shows that the Elliott et al. (2016) model explains 60.4% and the Galezka et al. (2015) model explains about 47.7% of the aftershocks in high stress regions. Aftershocks were poorly spatially correlated with the enhanced CFS condition after the 7.9 Mw main shock and can be explained by correlation with release of seismic energy from the associated secondarily stressed prominent thrust planes and transverse faults. Stress resolved on the associated receiver faults show increased stress on both transverse and thrust fault systems with the potential of triggering significant aftershocks or subsequent main shocks.

TI  - Remote Sensing Images Stripe Noise Removal by Double Sparse Regulation and Region Separation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Stripe noise removal continues to be an active field of research for remote image processing. Most existing approaches are prone to generating artifacts in extreme areas and removing the stripe-like details. In this paper, a weighted double sparsity unidirectional variation (WDSUV) model is constructed to reduce this phenomenon. The WDSUV takes advantage of both the spatial domain and the gradient domain's sparse property of stripe noise, and processes the heavy stripe area, extreme area and regular noise corrupted areas using different strategies. The proposed model consists of two variation terms and two sparsity terms that can well exploit the intrinsic properties of stripe noise. Then, the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) optimal solver is employed to solve the optimization model in an alternating minimization scheme. Compared with the state-of-the-art approaches, the experimental results on both the synthetic and real remote sensing data demonstrate that the proposed model has a better destriping performance in terms of the preservation of small details, stripe noise estimation and in the mean time for artifacts' reduction.

TI  - From feedback loop transitions to biomarkers in the psycho-immune-neuroendocrine network: Detecting the critical transition from health to major depression
T2  - NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Biological pathways underlying major depressive disorder (MDD) can be viewed as systems biology networks. The psycho-immune-neuroendocrine (PINE) network comprises central nervous, immune, endocrine and autonomic systems, integrating biological mechanisms of MDD. Such networks exhibit recurrent motifs with specific functions, including positive and negative feedback loops, and are subject to critical transitions, influenced by feedback loop transitions (FLTs).Aims: We aim to identify critical feedback loops and their FLTs, as well sentinel network nodes (SNNs), key network nodes that drive FLTs, within the PINE network. Examples of biomarkers are provided which may reflect early warning signs of impending critical transition to MDD.Results: Disruption of homeostatic feedback loops reflects the physiological transition to MDD. Putative FLTs are identified within hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) and sympathetic-parasympathetic axes, the kynurenine pathway, gut function and dysbiosis.Conclusions: Progression from health to disease is driven by FLTs in the PINE network, which is likely to undergo changes characteristic of system instability. Biomarkers of system instability may effectively predict the critical transition to MDD.

TI  - Impact of human disturbance on bee pollinator communities in savanna and agricultural sites in Burkina Faso, West Africa
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - All over the world, pollinators are threatened by land-use change involving degradation of seminatural habitats or conversion into agricultural land. Such disturbance often leads to lowered pollinator abundance and/or diversity, which might reduce crop yield in adjacent agricultural areas. For West Africa, changes in bee communities across disturbance gradients from savanna to agricultural land are mainly unknown. In this study, we monitored for the impact of human disturbance on bee communities in savanna and crop fields. We chose three savanna areas of varying disturbance intensity (low, medium, and high) in the South Sudanian zone of Burkina Faso, based on land-use/land cover data via Landsat images, and selected nearby cotton and sesame fields. During 21months covering two rainy and two dry seasons in 2014 and 2015, we captured bees using pan traps. Spatial and temporal patterns of bee species abundance, richness, evenness and community structure were assessed. In total, 35,469 bee specimens were caught on 12 savanna sites and 22 fields, comprising 97 species of 32 genera. Bee abundance was highest at intermediate disturbance in the rainy season. Species richness and evenness did not differ significantly. Bee communities at medium and highly disturbed savanna sites comprised only subsets of those at low disturbed sites. An across-habitat spillover of bees (mostly abundant social bee species) from savanna into crop fields was observed during the rainy season when crops are mass-flowering, whereas most savanna plants are not in bloom. Despite disturbance intensification, our findings suggest that wild bee communities can persist in anthropogenic landscapes and that some species even benefitted disproportionally. West African areas of crop production such as for cotton and sesame may serve as important food resources for bee species in times when resources in the savanna are scarce and receive at the same time considerable pollination service.

TI  - Patterns and correlates of giant sequoia foliage dieback during California's 2012-2016 hotter drought
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Hotter droughts - droughts in which unusually high temperatures exacerbate the effects of low precipitation - are expected to increase in frequency and severity in coming decades, challenging scientists and managers to identify which parts of forested landscapes may be most vulnerable. In 2014, in the middle of California's historically unprecedented 2012-2016 hotter drought, we noticed apparently drought-induced foliage dieback in giant sequoias (Sequoiadendron giganteum Lind]. [Buchholz]) in Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks, California. Characteristics of the dieback were consistent with a controlled process of drought-induced senescence: younger (distal) shoots remained green while older (proximal) shoots were preferentially shed. As part of an ongoing interdisciplinary effort to understand and map sequoia vulnerability to hotter droughts, we reviewed historical records for evidence of previous foliage dieback events, surveyed dieback along trail corridors in eight sequoia groves, and analyzed tree-ring data from a high- and a low-foliage-dieback area. In sharp contrast to the greatly elevated mortality of other coniferous species found at low and middle elevations, we estimate that < 1% of sequoias died during the drought. Foliage dieback was notably elevated in 2014 - the most severe single drought year in our 122-year record - but much lower in subsequent years. We found no historical records of similar foliage dieback during previous droughts. Dieback in 2014 was highly variable both within and among groves, ranging from virtually no dieback in some areas to nearly 50% in others. Dieback was highest (1) at low elevations, probably due to higher temperatures, reduced snowpack, and earlier snowmelt; (2) in areas of low adult sequoia densities, which likely reflect intrinsically more stressful sites; and (3) on steep slopes, probably reflecting reduced water availability. Average sequoia ring widths were narrower at the high-dieback than the low-dieback tree-ring site, but for reasons that remain unclear the sites did not differ in their proportional ring-width responses to past droughts. Collectively, our results suggest that giant sequoia vulnerability to hotter droughts may be spatially quite variable, and that at least some of that variability can be explained by metrics related to site water balance. Future research will focus on integrating our results with physiological and remote-sensing data, including tracking sequoias as they recover from the drought.

TI  - TerraSAR-X Time Series Fill a Gap in Spaceborne Snowmelt Monitoring of Small Arctic CatchmentsA Case Study on Qikiqtaruk (Herschel Island), Canada
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The timing of snowmelt is an important turning point in the seasonal cycle of small Arctic catchments. The TerraSAR-X (TSX) satellite mission is a synthetic aperture radar system (SAR) with high potential to measure the high spatiotemporal variability of snow cover extent (SCE) and fractional snow cover (FSC) on the small catchment scale. We investigate the performance of multi-polarized and multi-pass TSX X-Band SAR data in monitoring SCE and FSC in small Arctic tundra catchments of Qikiqtaruk (Herschel Island) off the Yukon Coast in the Western Canadian Arctic. We applied a threshold based segmentation on ratio images between TSX images with wet snow and a dry snow reference, and tested the performance of two different thresholds. We quantitatively compared TSX- and Landsat 8-derived SCE maps using confusion matrices and analyzed the spatiotemporal dynamics of snowmelt from 2015 to 2017 using TSX, Landsat 8 and in situ time lapse data. Our data showed that the quality of SCE maps from TSX X-Band data is strongly influenced by polarization and to a lesser degree by incidence angle. VH polarized TSX data performed best in deriving SCE when compared to Landsat 8. TSX derived SCE maps from VH polarization detected late lying snow patches that were not detected by Landsat 8. Results of a local assessment of TSX FSC against the in situ data showed that TSX FSC accurately captured the temporal dynamics of different snow melt regimes that were related to topographic characteristics of the studied catchments. Both in situ and TSX FSC showed a longer snowmelt period in a catchment with higher contributions of steep valleys and a shorter snowmelt period in a catchment with higher contributions of upland terrain. Landsat 8 had fundamental data gaps during the snowmelt period in all 3 years due to cloud cover. The results also revealed that by choosing a positive threshold of 1 dB, detection of ice layers due to diurnal temperature variations resulted in a more accurate estimation of snow cover than a negative threshold that detects wet snow alone. We find that TSX X-Band data in VH polarization performs at a comparable quality to Landsat 8 in deriving SCE maps when a positive threshold is used. We conclude that TSX data polarization can be used to accurately monitor snowmelt events at high temporal and spatial resolution, overcoming limitations of Landsat 8, which due to cloud related data gaps generally only indicated the onset and end of snowmelt.

TI  - Satellite Remote Sensing Analysis of the Qasrawet Archaeological Site in North Sinai
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - North Sinai is of significant historical interest primarily because of its role since late prehistoric times as a land bridge between Egypt and the Levant. Access to this region is challenging due to its harsh geography and security concerns. Remote sensing constitutes a convenient method for archaeological prospection and monitoring over such regions with its low cost (relative to ground based sensing techniques), global coverage, and high temporal and spatial sampling. This paper describes part of a study to revisit a number of sites investigated during the North Sinai Survey (1972-1982) with very high resolution optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar satellite imagery. These were acquired throughout the summer of 2017 in the framework of a European Space Agency research project. The Synthetic Aperture Radar data includes Spotlight and Staring Spotlight modes of the TerraSAR-X mission, while the optical imagery was acquired by the Pleiades mission. The TerraSAR-X data were processed to derive filtered amplitude and consecutive coherence time series. The results of the TerraSAR-X data processing, and the pan-sharpened Pleiades data were compared with the results of the North Sinai Survey to detect possible additional buried structures in the radar data, or newly excavated sites in the optical data. While the analysis is still ongoing, results are reported here of the Qasrawet archaeological site, which was partially investigated by the North Sinai Survey expedition, but assumed to cover a much larger area. Herein, a number of newly excavated structures are apparent in the remote sensing data. The similarity of features in both the TerraSAR-X and Pleiades data suggest that all structures are surface residues, and therefore, that the subsurface mapping capabilities of the TerraSAR-X data in this area are limited. The utility of both data types for archaeological site monitoring are discussed.

TI  - A spatio-temporal analysis of fires in the Southern African Development Community region
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires are considered one of the most common disasters in southern Africa resulting in a high number of human fatalities and financial loss on an annual basis. It is believed that increased population growth, as well as more concentrated settlement planning, is likely to result in increased fire disasters and increased human fatalities as a direct result of wildfires. To better understand the spatial and temporal variations and characteristics of wildfires in the Southern African Development Community (SADC), an 11-year dataset of satellite-derived Active Fire Hotspots was analysed using an open source geographic information system. Results indicate that annual fire frequency for most SADC countries is highly variable. Increasing trends in annual fire frequency were observed in five out of 13 SADC countries with a decrease in annual fire frequency observed in four countries. An additional four countries displayed a somewhat stable trend in fire frequency. Temporally, fires have been observed in all months for the SADC region although distinct fire seasons were observed, largely driven by uni-modal rainfall seasons. The timing, location and strength of rainfall seasons have a marked influence on fire activity depending on the seasonal wet and dry (growing and desiccation) periods. Fire activity in vegetation eco-regions can be attributed to both natural and anthropogenic sources of ignition. However, increased anthropogenic agroforestry activities have resulted in increased fire activity in numerous SADC eco-regions with woodlands, savannahs and montane grassland eco-regions being most prone to wildfires.

TI  - Surface Water Dynamics in the North America Arctic Based on 2000-2016 Landsat Data
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - At high latitudes, lake and river ecosystems are predominant and these ecosystems are undergoing significant changes due to climate change. Although many scientists have studied lakes and rivers in the Arctic region, the inland water dynamics in this region at the continental scale remain unknown. In this study, the dynamics of the Arctic water were analyzed at the continental scale using Landsat ortho-rectified surface reflectance products of fine spatial and temporal resolutions for the period of 2000-2016, using the random forests method. The results of this study produced the following revelations: (i) the water area is decreasing year by year in the long term; (ii) the water loss and gain always show the same dynamic pattern spatially and temporally; (iii) the spatial distribution of the water budget is strongly linked to permafrost, which implies that permafrost determines the distribution pattern of the water dynamics more than climatic factors; and (iv) the dynamics of the water show a certain rule with surface temperature, but the pattern of the dynamics cannot be explained by temperature alone.

M3  - Article

CP  - 48th Annual Meeting on Women's Cancer of the Society-of-Gynecologic-Oncology
CL  - National Harbor, MD
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-utility of three lymphadenectomy strategies in the management of low-risk endometrial carcinoma.METHODS: A decision analysis model compared three lymphadenectomy strategies in women undergoing minimally invasive surgery for low-risk endometrial carcinoma: 1) routine lymphadenectomy in all patients, 2) selective lymphadenectomy based on intraoperative frozen section criteria, and 3) sentinel lymph node mapping. Costs and outcomes were obtained from published literature and Medicare reimbursement rates. Costs categories consisted of hospital, physician, operating room, pathology, and lymphedema treatment. Effectiveness was defined as 3-year disease-specific survival adjusted for the effect of lymphedema (utility=0.8) on quality of life. A cost-utility analysis was performed comparing the different strategies. Multiple deterministic sensitivity analyses were done.RESULTS: In the base-case scenario, routine lymphadenectomy had a cost of $18,041 and an effectiveness of 2.79 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Selective lymphadenectomy had a cost of $17,036 and an effectiveness of 2.81 QALYs, whereas sentinel lymph node mapping had a cost of $16,401 and an effectiveness of 2.87 QALYs. With a difference of $1,005 and 0.02 QALYs, selective lymphadenectomy was both less costly and more effective than routine lymphadenectomy, dominating it. However, with the lowest cost and highest effectiveness, sentinel lymph node mapping dominated the other modalities and was the most cost-effective strategy. These findings were robust to multiple sensitivity analyses varying the rates of lymphedema and lymphadenectomy, surgical approach (open or minimally invasive surgery), lymphedema utility, and costs. For the estimated 40,000 women undergoing surgery for low-risk endometrial carcinoma each year in the United States, the annual cost of routine lymphadenectomy, selective lymphadenectomy, and sentinel lymph node mapping would be $722 million, $681 million, and $656 million, respectively.CONCLUSION: Compared with routine and selective lymphadenectomy, sentinel lymph node mapping had the lowest costs and highest quality-adjusted survival, making it the most cost-effective strategy in the management of low-risk endometrial carcinoma.

TI  - Examining urban thermal environment dynamics and relations to biophysical composition and configuration and socio-economic factors: A case study of the Shanghai metropolitan region
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-scale assessment of urban thermal environment dynamics and its influencing factors have been considered an essential precondition for mitigation and regulation of urban heat island (UHI) effects. However, the annual cycle behavior of satellite-derived urban land surface temperature (LST) is still unclear due to the limitation of irregular and infrequent satellite LST data. This study investigated annual dynamics of LST and the UHI effects of Shanghai by using an annual temperature cycle (ATC) model to reconstruct the Moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) 8-day LST data with 1 km(2) resolution in 2015. Ordinary least squares (OLS) and spatial regression models were further applied to investigate the relationships between day/night LST and urban biophysical composition and configuration and socio-economic characteristics in the metropolitan area of Shanghai, China. The results indicate that ATC model performed well with overall root mean square errors (RMSE) of 2.6 K. The performance of ATC is better in night-time than that in day-time. The thermal gradient analysis showed the urban center was hotter than outskirts by up to 2.0 K in day and 0.8 K in night. Spatial patterns of UHI intensity between day-time and night-time had significant differences in central urban areas. We also observed higher amplitude of the annual temperature cycle in central urban areas than that in rural. Furthermore, our statistical model showed biophysical indicators and land composition had a stronger influence on LST than the other explanatory variables. Nighttime light composite data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on board Suomi National Polar-orbiting partnership (NPP) as a spatial proxy for socioeconomic factors had significant positive relationships with mean LST. Compared with OLS and spatial lag model (SLM), spatial error model (SEM) is more appropriate to predict the urban LST. We conclude that distinct control strategies between day-time and night-time may improve efficiency of attenuating the UHI for a metropolitan region, and the spatial and temporal elements should be considered in landscape and urban planning.

TI  - Ship Wake Components: Isolation, Reconstruction, and Characteristics Analysis in Spectral, Spatial, and TerraSAR-X Image Domains
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on a joint analysis of linear Kelvin wake kinematics and water dispersion relation, the features of several components of ship wake are identified in the spectral domain, such as the "X"-shaped Kelvin wake, the narrow "X"-shaped solitary wave packets, and the cross-shaped turbulent and near-field waves. Alternatively, these components can be separately reconstructed in spatial domain using the inverse Fourier transformation. These relations are verified through numerical simulation of the wakes of a ship moving at different speeds. This wake decomposition is now extended to wake feature analysis of real synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image. It reveals that although the images of ship wake have been modulated by SAR imaging mechanisms in various aspects, their spectral characteristics are closely analogous to that of wake surface elevation. Taking advantage of the loci and shape of the wake spectrum, the transverse wave, the divergent wave, the turbulent wave, and the solitary wave packets can be isolated from the original SAR image with full wake appearance. The reconstructed images of wake components facilitate the further estimation of the direction, speed, length, hull geometry, and propulsion system of the ship. This decomposition can also recover wake components from multiple ship wakes and provide an understanding of their roles on SAR image.

TI  - Deriving High Spatiotemporal Remote Sensing Images Using Deep Convolutional Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to technical and budget limitations, there are inevitably some trade-offs in the design of remote sensing instruments, making it difficult to acquire high spatiotemporal resolution remote sensing images simultaneously. To address this problem, this paper proposes a new data fusion model named the deep convolutional spatiotemporal fusion network (DCSTFN), which makes full use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to derive high spatiotemporal resolution images from remotely sensed images with high temporal but low spatial resolution (HTLS) and low temporal but high spatial resolution (LTHS). The DCSTFN model is composed of three major parts: the expansion of the HTLS images, the extraction of high frequency components from LTHS images, and the fusion of extracted features. The inputs of the proposed network include a pair of HTLS and LTHS reference images from a single day and another HTLS image on the prediction date. Convolution is used to extract key features from inputs, and deconvolution is employed to expand the size of HTLS images. The features extracted from HTLS and LTHS images are then fused with the aid of an equation that accounts for temporal ground coverage changes. The output image on the prediction day has the spatial resolution of LTHS and temporal resolution of HTLS. Overall, the DCSTFN model establishes a complex but direct non-linear mapping between the inputs and the output. Experiments with MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) images show that the proposed CNN-based approach not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, but is also more robust than conventional spatiotemporal fusion algorithms. In addition, DCSTFN is a faster and less time-consuming method to perform the data fusion with the trained network, and can potentially be applied to the bulk processing of archived data.

TI  - Assessing land use and land cover dynamics using composites of spectral indices and principal component analysis: A case study in middle Awash subbasin, Ethiopia
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - As of recent decades land use and land cover (LULC) change studies have received much attention partly because of the global effect on climate change and mainly because of the local effect on the health and sustainable provision of ecosystem services. Nonrenewable resources are deteriorating from time to time due to the coupled pressure from population growth and global climate change. Monitoring LULC dynamics and setting appropriate management plans have become crucial, which required timely and accurate information. In order to predict future LULC change impacts and simultaneously fulfill daily demand of the growing population, land use planners and policy makers require accurate information on regular basis. Since the last couple of decades application of remote sensing for earth resource management has become popular and a number of earth observation satellites have been developed and launched to the space to collect land resource data of varied temporal and spatial resolution. The knowledge level to interpret these data have also increased and helped to monitor ecosystem structure and its health status at low cost and less effort. In this study we have employed remote sensing and GIS techniques integrating with ground information to analyze LULC dynamics in Middle Awash subbasin from year 1995 to 2017. Eight different spectral indices were algebraically calculated and best composites were used for land feature identification. Principal component analysis (PCA) has also helped to extract the most useful spectral information by compressing redundant data embedded in each spectral channel. The result has greatly assisted to easily identify and trace training polygons for machine learning processes. An overall classification accuracy of 91.8% with kappa coefficient of 0.89 was achieved after applying the aforementioned techniques based on the chosen maximum likelihood supervised image classification algorithm. The change detection analysis has revealed that Middle Awash subbasin has undergone a significant change, which is attributed mainly to anthropogenic activities. Lake Beseka has expanded along with the expansion of irrigation development in the subbasin creating environmental, social and economic impacts. This study has depicted the importance of compositing spectral indices for better classification accuracy. It has also highlighted the current status of the subbasin from which policy makers could extract basic information for policy amendments.

TI  - The application of a Dempster-Shafer-based evidential belief function in flood susceptibility mapping and comparison with frequency ratio and logistic regression methods
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood is one of the most common natural disasters worldwide. The aim of this study was to evaluate the application of the Dempster-Shafer-based evidential belief function (EBF) for spatial prediction of flood-susceptible areas in Brisbane, Australia. This algorithm has been tested in landslide and groundwater mapping; however, it has not been examined in flood susceptibility modelling. EBF has an advantage over other statistical methods through its capability of evaluating the impacts of all classes of every flood-conditioning factor on flooding and assessing the correlation between each factor and flooding. EBF outcomes were compared with the results of well-known statistical methods, including logistic regression (LR) and frequency ratio (FR). Flood-conditioning factor data set consisted of elevation, aspect, plan curvature, slope, topographic wetness index (TWI), geology, stream power index (SPI), soil, land use/cover, rainfall, distance from roads and distance from rivers. EBF produced the highest prediction rate (82.60%) among all the methods. The research findings may provide a useful methodology for natural hazard and land use management.

TI  - Systematic review of the prevalence of nodal metastases and the prognostic utility of sentinel lymph node biopsy in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is the second most common skin cancer and its incidence is rising. The prognosis is mostly good but patients with high-risk cSCC have a greater risk of recurrence and death. The aim of the present study was to conduct a systematic review analyzing the prevalence, predictors and prognostic utility of sentinel lymph node (SLN) involvement in cSCC. We performed a published work search in Ovid MEDLINE and reviewed the reference lists of selected studies. Based on the 23 studies included in the systematic review, the proportion of patients with cSCC and positive SLN biopsy findings was 8% (95% confidence interval, 5.1-10.8%; I-2= 44.51%). We found no studies reporting on predictors of SLN involvement in cSCC or on the prognostic utility of this finding following adjustment for confounders. The rate of positive SLN in cSCC is less than previously reported. Criteria for recommending SLN biopsy as a staging tool for cSCC vary considerably from study to study, and none of the studies were large enough to reliably identify predictors of SLN positivity. No randomized controlled trials have yet analyzed whether SLN biopsy may improve the prognosis of cSCC. More studies are required on the prognostic value of SLN positivity and the associated risk factors in cSCC.

M3  - Article
AB  - Ancient hydrothermal systems are a high-priority target for a future Mars sample return mission because they contain energy sources for microbes and can preserve organic materials (Farmer, 2000; MEPAG Next Decade Science Analysis Group, 2008; McLennan et al.,2012; Michalski et al.,2017). Characterizing these large, heterogeneous systems with a remote explorer is difficult due to communications bandwidth and latency; such a mission will require significant advances in spacecraft autonomy. Science autonomy uses intelligent sensor platforms that analyze data in real-time, setting measurement and downlink priorities to provide the best information toward investigation goals. Such automation must relate abstract science hypotheses to the measurable quantities available to the robot. This study captures these relationships by formalizing traditional science traceability matrices into probabilistic models. This permits experimental design techniques to optimize future measurements and maximize information value toward the investigation objectives, directing remote explorers that respond appropriately to new data. Such models are a rich new language for commanding informed robotic decision making in physically grounded terms. We apply these models to quantify the information content of different rover traverses providing profiling spectroscopy of Cuprite Hills, Nevada. We also develop two methods of representing spatial correlations using human-defined maps and remote sensing data. Model unit classifications are broadly consistent with prior maps of the site's alteration mineralogy, indicating that the model has successfully represented critical spatial and mineralogical relationships at Cuprite.

TI  - Interdependent Dynamics of LAI-Albedo across the Roofing Landscapes: Mongolian and Tibetan Plateaus
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Mongolian Plateau (MP) and Tibetan Plateau (TP) have experienced higher-than-global average warming in recent decades, resulting in many significant changes in ecosystem structure and function. Among them are the leaf area index (LAI) and albedo, which play a fundamental role in understanding many causes and consequences of land surface processes and climate. Here, we focused on the spatiotemporal changes of LAI, albedo, and their spatiotemporal relationships on the two roofing landscapes in Eurasia. Based on the MODIS products, we investigated the spatiotemporal changes of albedo((VIS, NIR and SHO)) and LAI from 2000 through 2016. We found that there existed a general negative logarithmic relationship between LAI and three measures of albedo on both plateaus. No significant relationship was found for LAI-albedo(NIR) on the TP, due to more complex land surface canopy characteristics affected by the NIR reflection there. During 2000-2016, overall, annual mean LAI increased significantly by 119.40 x 10(3) km(2) on the MP and by 28.35 x 10(3) km(2) on the TP, while the decreased areas for annual mean albedo(VIS) were 585.59 x 10(3) km(2) and 235.73 x 10(3) km(2) on the MP and TP, respectively. More importantly, the LAI-albedo relationships varied substantially across the space and over time, with mismatches found in some parts of the landscapes. Substantial additional efforts with observational and/or experimental investigations are needed to explore the underlying mechanisms responsible for these relationships, including the influences of vegetation characteristics and disturbances.

TI  - Aerosol Optical Depth Retrieval From Landsat 8 OLI Images Over Urban Areas Supported by MODIS BRDF/Albedo Data
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This letter presents a new algorithm that allows the retrieval of the aerosol optical depth (AOD) at a high (500 m) spatial resolution from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data over urban areas. Because of the complex structure over urban surfaces, the bidirectional reflectance characteristic is obvious; however, most of the current aerosol retrieval algorithms over land do not account for the anisotropic effect of the surface. This letter improves the quality of AOD retrieval by providing the surface reflectance based on the multiyear MODIS bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF)/Albedo model parameters product (MCD43A1) and the RossThick-LiSparse reciprocal kernel-driven BRDF model. The ground-based Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) AOD measurements from five sites located in urban and suburban areas are used to validate the AOD retrievals, and the MODIS Terra Collection 6 (C6) dark target/deep blue AOD products (MOD04) at 10-km spatial resolution are obtained for comparison. The validation results show that the AOD retrievals from the Oil images are well correlated with the AERONET AOD measurements (R = 0.987), with a low root-mean-square error of 0.07, a mean absolute error of 0.036, and a relative mean bias of 1.029; approximately 95.3% of the collocations fall within the expected error. The analysis indicates that the BRDF is essential in ensuring the accuracy of AOD retrieval. Compared with the MOD04 AOD retrievals, the OLI AOD retrievals have better spatial continuity and higher accuracy. The new algorithm can provide continuous and detailed spatial distributions of the AOD over complex urban surfaces.

TI  - Fusion of Moderate Resolution Earth Observations for Operational Crop Type Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop type inventory and within season estimates at moderate (<30 m) resolution have been elusive in many regions due to the lack of temporal frequency, clouds, and restrictive data policies. New opportunities exist from the operational fusion of Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), Sentinel-2 (A & B), and Sentinel-1 (A & B) which provide more frequent open access observations now that these satellites are fully operating. The overarching goal of this research application was to compare Harmonized Landsat-8 Sentinel-2 (HLS), Sentinel-1 (S1), and combined radar and optical data in an operational, near-real-time (within 24 h) context. We evaluated the ability of these Earth observations (EO) across major crops in four case study regions in United States (US) production hot spots. Hindcast time series combinations of these EO were fed into random forest classifiers trained with crop cover type information from the Cropland Data Layer (CDL) and ancillary ground truth. The outcomes show HLS achieved high (>85%) accuracies and the ability to provide insight on crop location and extent within the crop season. HLS fused with S1 had, at times, a higher accuracy (5-10% relative overall accuracy and kappa increases) within season although the combination of fused data was minimal at times, crop dependent, and the accuracies tended to converge by harvest. In cloud prone regions and certain temporal periods, S1 performed well overall. The growth in the availability of time dense moderate resolution data streams and different sensitivities of optical and radar data provide a mechanism for within season crop mapping and area estimates that can help improve food security.

TI  - Effects of SBAR Communication through Telephone on the Improvement of Effective Communication in Implementing the Patient Safety Program
T2  - PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL & HEALTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Effective communication is a communication that can be understood by both parties who receive and provide the information. Ineffective communication between nurse and doctor becomes one of the causes of sentinel cases. SBAR (Situation, Background, Assessment, and Recommendation) can be used for the standards of effective communication between nurses and physicians; one of which is by using the telephone. SBAR communication via telephone is a simple communication framework between the nurse and doctor over the phone in the process of patient medical treatment.Aim: To analyze the effects of SBAR communication through the telephone to improve the effective communication in implementing the patient safety program in the hospital.Methods: This research uses quasi-experimental design with a pretest posttest design with a control group. The samples were 34 respondents recruited using the purposive sampling and were assigned to the intervention group (n = 17) and the control group (n = 17). The data were collected through the observations and analyzed using the t-test.Results: The effective communication in implementing the patient safety program before the intervention was 26.11 and it was 36.70 after the intervention, indicating an increase of 10.59. There were differences in effective communication between the intervention and control groups with a p-value of 0.001. The SBAR communication through the telephone improved the effective communication in implementing the patient safety program in the hospital.Conclusion: The use of SBAR communication by phone is important, as a solution to support effective communication in the patient safety implementation, and to improve hospital service quality.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study is to determine the land use and land cover changes in Khon Kaen city, Thailand, using landscape fragmentation analysis together with multi-temporal Landsat data acquired during 1990-2015. Using support vector machine techniques, multi-temporal Landsat imagery was classified to derive a map of land use and land cover change and subsequently analyze the landscape fragmentation to determine the factors driving this change. The results showed that most of the built-up area was converted from an agricultural area, illustrating the expansion of the urban area over the past twenty-five years. Consequently, the landscape has become more highly fragmented as indicated by an increase in the patch number and a decrease in the mean patch size of the agriculture land cover class. Economic development, education system development, population growth and the improvement of traffic infrastructure are main factors driving land use and land cover change in Khon Kaen city.

TI  - Assessment of Wind Speed Estimation From C-Band Sentinel-1 Images Using Empirical and Electromagnetic Models
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface wind speed estimation from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data is principally based on empirical (EP) approaches, e.g., CMOD functions. However, it is necessary and significant to compare radar backscattering modeling based on EP and electromagnetic (EM) approaches for enhancing the understanding of the physical processes between radar signal and sea surface, which is important for the design of radar sensors (e.g., cyclone global navigation satellite system). Indeed, through comparisons, it is worth noticing that the scattering of wave breaking is not taken into account in the physical modeling of radar backscattering. Surface wind speed is selected here as a reference parameter for investigating the difference between EP and EM models, due to its important role in radar backscattering modeling. In addition, wind speed estimates can be easily compared to in situ measurements. For EP approach, CMOD5. N and Komarov's model are selected for wind speed estimation from Sentinel-1 images. The CMOD5. N can offer wind speed estimates up to 25-35 m/s, while wind speed estimation based on Komarov's model does not require wind direction input. For EM approach, the asymptotic models, i.e., composite two-scale model, small-slope approximation (SSA), and resonant curvature approximation (RCA), are investigated for wind speed retrieval. They are studied with two models of surface roughness spectrum: semi-EP spectrum and EP model. In general, normalized radar cross section (NRCS) calculated by CMOD5. N and SSA/RCA is quite similar for incidence angles below 40 degrees in vertical polarized and below 30 degrees in horizontal polarized. For larger ones, significant NRCS deviations between two approaches are demonstrated, due to the lack of wave breaking scattering in EM models. As a result, wind speed estimates by CMOD5. N and SSA/RCA are very close for low and moderate incidence angles, while SSA-/RCA-based wind speeds are overestimated for larger ones.

TI  - The Impact of Saphenous Vein Sparing During Inguinal Lymphadenectomy on Postoperative Morbidity in Women With Vulval Cancer: An Updated Per-Groin Meta-analysis of Short-term Outcomes
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Objective Inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy (IFL) is included in the standard surgical management of early-stage vulval cancer (VC) but is often accompanied by surgical complications. Efforts have been made to limit the postoperative morbidity by adopting more conservative IFL techniques without compromising the surgical outcomes. Saphenous vein (SV) preservation during IFL for VC appears to reduce the incidence of postoperative complications including lymphedema. To ascertain the efficacy of SV preservation, we aimed to revisit the impact of SV preservation on short-term per groin complications by updating on a previous meta-analysis to further guide current clinical practice.Methods A systematic literature review was conducted to identify studies that reported postoperative complications following IFL with SV preservation and controls (SV ligation during IFL) in VC patients. We included articles in English language and avoided date restrictions. Direct-comparison meta-analysis was performed between the use of SV preservation and SV ligation for the short-term outcomes of lymphedema, cellulitis, and wound dehiscence/breakdown. Fixed- and random-effects models were fitted to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).Results Five studies were included in the final analysis. Direct-comparison per-groin meta-analysis between SV preservation and SV ligation significantly decreased the odds for developing lymphedema (OR, 0.363; 95% CI, 0.228-0.578; P < 0.001), cellulitis (OR, 0.481; 95% CI, 0.28-0.825; P = 0.008), and wound dehiscence/breakdown (OR, 0.296; 95% CI, 0.191-0.458; P < 0.001). When SV sparing was clearly the sole intervention, lymphedema was the only complication in which the positive effect of SV sparing is exerted (OR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.149-0.526; P < 0.001).Conclusions This per groin meta-analysis updates on the current evidence suggesting the SV sparing improves postoperative outcomes following IFL in VC patients. Where sentinel biopsy is not indicated, this risk-reducing strategy should be considered in selected VC patients undergoing IFL until a multicenter randomized controlled trial becomes available.

TI  - Reprojection of VIIRS SDR Imagery Using Concurrent Gradient Search
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The application of the gradient search method for reprojection of Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) satellite data record (SDR) imagery is described. The method is an extension of the scheme developed earlier for reprojection of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) L1B imagery. The new scheme has three important improvements: 1) the interscan and intrascan search steps are combined into a single step to save computational time; 2) onesided (left-right, up-down) gradients are utilized to improve convergence; and 3) the use of the map projection instead of the latitude-longitude coordinate system to improve performance and robustness. The scheme is computationally very fast, employing only basic arithmetic operations and precalculated matrices of spatial gradients. An average number of iteration steps for the reprojection of mid-latitude quadruple VIIRS SDR granule is less than 1.5, i.e., the scheme usually converges in less than 2 iterations. The ambiguity in the overlapping areas due to the bow-tie effect is resolved by forcing a solution located closer to the scan line center. In addition, the accuracy of VIIRS imagery geo-location was evaluated by comparison against MODIS 250 m images. Absolute geolocation biases of the VIIRS imagery over the 1-year period from June 01, 2016 to May 01, 2017 were found on average to be within 0.004 and -0.003 of the sample size (Delta line) in the along-track direction and 0.055 and 0.035 of the sample size (Delta pixel) in the along-scan direction for bands I2 and M7, respectively. These results demonstrate the excellent geometric performance of the VIIRS Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership sensor and are consistent with those reported by the VIIRS geolocation teams.

TI  - Large-Scale Flood-Inundation Modeling in the Mekong River Basin
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood impacts threaten the socioeconomic conditions of peoples' lives in the Mekong River Basin. In this study, the rainfall-runoff-inundation (RRI) model, capable of simulating rainfall runoff and flood inundation simultaneously, was used to enhance understanding of flooding characteristics in this region by using grid-satellite-based rainfall. Input data for the simulation included HydroSHEDS topographic data, APHRODITE precipitation data, MODIS land use data, and river cross sections. Moreover, the shuffled complex evolution developed at The University of Arizona (SCE-UA) global optimization method was integrated with the RRI model to calibrate sensitive parameters. In this study, the flood event in 2000 has been selected in the Mekong River Basin. The simulation results were compared with observed discharges at monitoring stations along the river and an inundation map from Landsat 7 satellite imagery and the Mekong River Commission (MRC) data. The results indicated good agreement between the observed and simulated discharges, for example, with Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE)=0.86 at the Stung Treng Station. The model predicted inundation extent with a success rate (SR)=67.50% and modified success rate (MSR)=74.53% compared with satellite Landsat 7, and SR=68.27% and MSR=75.11% compared with MRC data. Therefore, the RRI model was successfully used to simulate a large-scale inundation flood event in 2000 using a grid precipitation data set in the Mekong River Basin. However, the underestimation might be due to the uncertainties of input data, river geometry, the large scale of the basin, coarse resolution of topographic data, and error in remote sensing image in detecting the flood extent.

TI  - Sectoral Migration of Ganga River and Its Implication on the Stability of Phaphamau Bridge Near Allahabad, UP, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Comparative examination of Survey of India Topographical Map sheets of 1972-1973 survey and satellite data of 1999, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2017 period has revealed that the niche point of Ganga river has shifted about 2.9 km upstream (westward) from immediate west of Faizullahpur (in 1973) to the south of Rangpura (by 2017). The sectoral migration of the Ganga channel in Jahangirwa-Phaphamau-Faizullahpur-Jhusi sector has been characterised by oscillations and conspicuous westerly shift in Phaphamau-Faizullahpur segment. The channel oscillation has been very pronounced between 2008 and 2017. The relict channels in the immediate west (upstream) of Phaphamau bridge are evidences of the new pathway carved out by Ganga River during the recent years and may again serve as easy pathways for flood waters during heavy precipitation in the catchment area of the river. Digital Elevation Model of the study area highlights the conspicuous oscillations (of Ganga River) and consequent successive migration within the river valley. The oscillatory migration of the Ganga channel makes its future path very unpredictable and this is turn poses potential risk not only to both the northern and southern bank abutments (of the Phaphamau bridge) but also to the northern and eastern parts of the holy city of Allahabad. In view of this additional protection work is required in the upstream of Phaphamau bridge and also in Phaphamau-Jhusi stretch in the downstream.

TI  - Outcomes of "one-day" vs "two-day" injection protocols using Tc-99m tilmanocept for sentinel lymph node biopsy in breast cancer
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - No prior studies have compared Tc-99m tilmanocept (TcTM) one-day and two-day injection protocols for sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy in breast cancer (BC). We retrospectively identified patients with clinically node-negative BC undergoing SLN biopsy at our institution. Patients received a single, intradermal peritumoral injection of TcTM on day of surgery or day prior to surgery in addition to an intraoperative injection of isosulfan blue dye. Univariable and multivariable Poisson regression count models were constructed to assess the effects of injection timing, radiologist, patient and surgeon characteristics on the number of removed SLNs. A total of 617 patients underwent SLN biopsy with TcTM and blue dye. Sixty-seven (10.9%) patients were injected with the two-day protocol. Patients in the one-day protocol had a mean of 3.0 (standard deviation (SD) 1.9) SLNs removed compared with 2.7 (SD 1.4) SLNs in the two-day protocol, P-value=.13. On multivariable analysis, patient age and operating surgeon significantly affected the number of removed SLNs; however, the injection timing and the nuclear radiologist did not influence the number of removed SLNs. The performance of Tc-99m tilmanocept did not differ significantly between one-day and two-day injection protocols. These results are similar to other radiotracers used for SLN biopsy in BC.

TI  - Intercomparison of MODIS AQUA and VIIRS I-Band Fires and Emissions in an Agricultural Landscape-Implications for Air Pollution Research
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying emissions from crop residue burning is crucial as it is a significant source of air pollution. In this study, we first compared the fire products from two different sensors, the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) 375 m active fire product (VNP14IMG) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 1 km fire product (MCD14ML) in an agricultural landscape, Punjab, India. We then performed an intercomparison of three different approaches for estimating total particulate matter (TPM) emissions which includes the fire radiative power (FRP) based approach using VIIRS and MODIS data, the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED) burnt area emissions and a bottom-up emissions approach involving agricultural census data. Results revealed that VIIRS detected fires were higher by a factor of 4.8 compared to MODIS Aqua and Terra sensors. Further, VIIRS detected fires were higher by a factor of 6.5 than Aqua. The mean monthly MODIS Aqua FRP was found to be higher than the VIIRS FRP; however, the sum of FRP from VIIRS was higher than MODIS data due to the large number of fires detected by the VIIRS. Besides, the VIIRS sum of FRP was 2.5 times more than the MODIS sum of FRP. MODIS and VIIRS monthly FRP data were found to be strongly correlated (r(2) = 0.98). The bottom-up approach suggested TPM emissions in the range of 88.19-91.19 Gg compared to 42.0-61.71 Gg, 42.59-58.75 Gg and 93.98-111.72 Gg using the GFED, MODIS FRP, and VIIRS FRP based approaches, respectively. Of the different approaches, VIIRS FRP TPM emissions were highest. Since VIIRS data are only available since 2012 compared to MODIS Aqua data which have been available since May 2002, a prediction model combining MODIS and VIIRS FRP was derived to obtain potential TPM emissions from 2003-2016. The results suggested a range of 2.56-63.66 (Gg) TPM emissions per month, with the highest crop residue emissions during November of each year. Our results on TPM emissions for seasonality matched the ground-based data from the literature. As a mitigation option, stringent policy measures are recommended to curtail agricultural residue burning in the study area.

TI  - Mapping the Individual Trees in Urban Orchards by Incorporating Volunteered Geographic Information and Very High Resolution Optical Remotely Sensed Data: A Template Matching-Based Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a collective sensing approach that integrates imperfect Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) obtained through Citizen Science (CS) tree mapping projects with very high resolution (VHR) optical remotely sensed data for low-cost, fine-scale, and accurate mapping of trees in urban orchards. To this end, an individual tree crown (ITC) detection technique utilizing template matching (TM) was developed for extracting urban orchard trees from VHR optical imagery. To provide the training samples for the TM algorithm, remotely sensed VGI about trees including the crowdsourced data about ITC locations and their crown diameters was adopted in this study. A data quality assessment of the proposed approach in the study area demonstrated that the detected trees had a very high degree of completeness (92.7%), a high thematic accuracy (false discovery rate (FDR) = 0.090, false negative rate (FNR) = 0.073, and F-1 score (F-1) = 0.918), and a fair positional accuracy (root mean squareerror (RMSE) = 1.02 m). Overall, the proposed approach based on the crowdsourced training samples generally demonstrated a promising ITC detection performance in our pilot project.

TI  - Range-wide variation in the effect of spring snow phenology on Dall sheep population dynamics
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the underlying mechanisms of species distributions and range limits is critical to predicting species responses to climate change. The relationship between climate factors and population performance is often assumed to be constant across species' ranges, but factors that limit the persistence and abundance of species may vary spatially. We examined the consistency of climate effects on population performance across the global range of Dall sheep (Ovis dalli dalli) in northwestern North America. Using a linear mixed modeling approach, we evaluated the effects of temperature, precipitation, and snow cover on rates of lamb recruitment, which is a key measure of population performance. We used snow cover products derived from NASA's moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery and gridded climate data as predictors. Lamb recruitment rates were estimated using range-wide aerial survey data from2000-2015. These consisted of 127 833 records of sheep sightings from 1570 surveys conducted in 24 mountain units over an area of 634 271 km(2). MODIS-derived spring snow cover had stronger effects on lamb recruitment than did temperature or precipitation. Lamb recruitment increased with higher spring snowline elevations, earlier snow disappearance dates, and fewer snow-covered days per year, while the strength of these effects increased strongly with latitude. Simple population models indicate that, based on elasticity estimates, population growth would be reduced by 2% in years with late snow disappearance dates at intermediate northern latitudes, and by 5% at high latitudes. These results suggest that northern Dall sheep populations are more sensitive to changing snow conditions than their southern counterparts. In addition, variable relationships between climatic factors and population performance should be accounted for when modeling species distributions and projecting climate-induced range shifts.

TI  - Quantifying floristic and structural forest maturity: An attribute-based method for wet eucalypt forests
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Maintaining developmental heterogeneity of ecological communities within landscapes is crucial for sustainable native forest management. Consequently, methods to assess forest maturity (i.e. the degree to which the forest contains attributes and supports processes characteristic of late-successional forests) are valuable for making management decisions. However, no consistent, pragmatic method to quantify maturity that incorporates multiple ecosystem elements is available for many forest systems, including Australian wet eucalypt forests.2. We draw upon forest community dynamics theory to develop a method to quantify maturity based on forest attributes, and use this method to create two metrics of wet eucalypt forest floristic and structural maturity. We then test the ability of remotely sensed and field-collected variables to predict these metrics.3. Both the floristic and structural maturity metrics performed well at capturing underlying trends of forest maturation. Remotely sensed LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) and photo-interpretation data provided estimates of moderate accuracy for both floristic and structural maturity (R-2 = .57-.77). Field variables that are relatively efficient and accurate to measure provided greater model accuracy (R-2 = .73-.85). Including more complex field variables increased model accuracy to high levels (R-2 = .93). Therefore, while maturity predicted from remote-sensing data enables a useful and accessible large-scale maturity measure, field indices would provide a more accurate means of assessing maturity at the local stand level.4. Synthesis and applications. The metrics developed in this study provide a powerful tool for undertaking consistent assessments of wet eucalypt forest maturity. This assessment tool could improve forest management by providing information to optimise practices such as prioritising stands for retention or harvesting, determining the effectiveness of restoration or management practices and monitoring changes in maturity over time. The method could be adapted to any forest system that undergoes well-defined directional development.

TI  - Monitoring height and greenness of non-woody floodplain vegetation with UAV time series
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation in river floodplains has important functions for biodiversity, but can also have a negative influence on flood safety. Floodplain vegetation is becoming increasingly heterogeneous in space and time as a result of river restoration projects. To document the spatio-temporal patterns of the floodplain vegetation, the need arises for efficient monitoring techniques. Monitoring is commonly performed by mapping floodplains based on single-epoch remote sensing data, thereby not considering seasonal dynamics of vegetation. The rising availability of unmanned airborne vehicles (UAV) increases monitoring frequency potential. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the performance of multi-temporal high spatial-resolution imagery, collected with a UAV, to record the dynamics in floodplain vegetation height and greenness over a growing season. Since the classification accuracy of current airborne surveys remains insufficient for low vegetation types, we focussed on seasonal variation of herbaceous and grassy vegetation with a height up to 3 m. Field reference data on vegetation height were collected six times during one year in 28 field plots within a single floodplain along the Waal River, the main distributary of the Rhine River in the Netherlands. Simultaneously with each field survey, we recorded UAV true colour and false-colour imagery from which normalized digital surface models (nDSMs) and a consumer-grade camera vegetation index (CGCVI) were calculated. We observed that: (1) the accuracy of a UAV-derived digital terrain model (DTM) varies over the growing season and is most accurate during winter when the vegetation is dormant, (2) vegetation height can be determined from the nDSMs in leaf on conditions via linear regression (RSME = 0.17-0.33 m), (3) the multitemporal nDSMs yielded meaningful temporal profiles of greenness and vegetation height and (4) herbaceous vegetation shows hysteresis for greenness and vegetation height, but no clear hysteresis was observed for grassland vegetation. These results show the high potential of using UAV-borne sensors for increasing the classification accuracy of low floodplain vegetation within the framework of floodplain monitoring.

TI  - A component of lobular carcinoma in clinically lymph node-negative patients predicts for an increased likelihood of upstaging to pathologic stage III breast cancer
T2  - ADVANCES IN RADIATION ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Physical examination and diagnostic imaging are often less precise in determining the extent of disease in invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) relative to nonlobular histologies. Anecdotally, surgical axillary evaluation frequently reveals positive lymph nodes in clinically N0 patients with ILC; however, few studies quantify the likelihood of finding unsuspected disease at the time of surgery. In this study, we evaluate whether the presence of lobular histology increases the incidence of surgical upstaging to pathologic stage IIIA or greater in patients with a clinically node-negative axilla and positive sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy.Methods and materials: We examined patients from our institution between 1997 and 2009 treated specifically with mastectomy, SLN biopsy, and completion axillary lymph node dissection due to a positive SLN. For analysis, patients were grouped according to the presence of any lobular component on surgical pathology. The number of total positive lymph nodes, cancer stage, age, final tumor size, and ER/PR/HER2 status were assessed based on tumor histology.Results: We evaluated 345 previously untreated women with clinical T0-T2 and N0 disease at the time of surgery. A total of 110 patients (32%) had a component of ILC on surgical pathology. In addition, 295 patients (85.5%) had ER + breast carcinoma, 243 (70.4%) had PR + disease, 56 (16.2%) were HER2 +, and 28 (8.1%) were triple negative. At the time of surgery, women with lobular disease were observed to have a greater number of positive lymph nodes (2.79 vs 2.26; P = .009) and were more frequently upstaged to at least pathologic stage IIIA compared with nonlobular patients (30.9% vs 17.4%; P = .007).Conclusions: In this cohort, patients with a component of lobular carcinoma were more often surgically upstaged to pathologic stage IIIA or higher, which is a classical indication for postmastectomy radiation therapy. Our findings suggest that ILC is often more extensive than it appears clinically and has significant implications for management of patients with lobular carcinoma after the discovery of a positive SLN.

TI  - Dengue, chikungunya, and Zika virus infections imported to Paris between 2009 and 2016: Characteristics and correlation with outbreaks in the French overseas territories of Guadeloupe and Martinique
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Dengue virus (DENV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), and Zika virus (ZIKV) infections are rapidly expanding across countries and are being diagnosed in returned travellers who represent epidemiological sentinels. The French Territories of America (FTA) such as Guadeloupe and Martinique see high levels of tourism and have experienced three consecutive outbreaks by these viruses in the last decade.Objective: This study was performed to evaluate how ill returned travellers could have represented epidemiological sentinels for these three expanding arboviral diseases over eight consecutive years. The degree of correlation between the cases of ill returned travellers arriving at a French tertiary hospital in Paris and the three outbreaks that occurred in the FTA during the study period was estimated. Methods: All consecutive ill returned travellers diagnosed at the hospital in Paris with imported DENV, CHIKV, or ZIKV infections from January 2009 to December 2016 were included. Epidemiological and clinical variables were evaluated. Data concerning the incidence of arboviruses in the FTA, as well as the temporal relationship between the occurrence of imported cases and outbreaks in the FTA, were analyzed.Results: Overall, 320 cases of arboviral infection were reported: 216 DENV, 68 CHIKV, and 36 ZIKV. Most of the patients presented with fever and exanthema. One hundred and fifteen patients were exposed in Guadeloupe or Martinique, which were the at-risk destinations in 25% of patients with DENV, 59% of patients with CHIKV, and 58% of patients with ZIKV. The occurrence of cases diagnosed in returning travellers followed the same time pattern as the outbreaks in these areas.Conclusions: A temporal correlation was found between newly diagnosed imported cases of arboviruses and the three corresponding outbreaks that occurred in Martinique and Guadeloupe during 8 consecutive years. Thus, ill returned travellers act as epidemiological sentinels from the beginning up to the end of outbreaks occurring in touristic locations.(C) 2008 The Authors.

TI  - Assessment of the efficiency of a trophic state index in determining the water quality of public water supply reservoirs
T2  - ENGENHARIA SANITARIA E AMBIENTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study consists in the evaluation of the trophic state index (IET) efficacy as a tool in the water quality analysis of three reservoirs. The IET was calculated based on water transparency in the reservoir and on the surface concentrations of chlorophyll-a and total phosphorus (total P). To identify the correlation of the soil use with the reservoir aquatic pollution, the IET calculated for each reservoir was compared to the thematic mapping of land cover based on Landsat TM 5 satellite images from 2010. The main components analysis (ACP), focused on data correlation, was made using the software PAST (R), version 2.16. Initially, the behavior of the parameters associated with the IET was evaluated alone (total P, chlorophyll-a and transparency) on the reservoirs. Then, the other chemical and physical parameters associated with the reservoirs water quality (without the IET) were applied to the ACP. Finally, all the parameters underwent the ACP (IET and all the other parameters in conjunction). The IET used in this research seemed to be self-sufficient in the prediction of water quality using only three parameters (total P, chlorophyll-a and transparency). The satellite images analysis, in conjunction with the IET data, was sufficient to point out the water quality reduction by punctual sources of pollution even in environments with larger preserved vegetal coverage.

TI  - The applicability of animal health surveillance systems for post-market monitoring of potential adverse effects of genetically modified (GM) feed
T2  - FOOD AND CHEMICAL TOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A facultative post market monitoring of potential health impacts of genetically modified (GM) feedstuffs on livestock consuming these feeds after pre-market risk assessment is under ongoing consideration. Within the IPAFEED database, scientific studies on health effects beyond performance in livestock and the results of a systematic search for evidence of outcome effects due to GM feed are consolidated. These outcomes were reviewed and checked for consistency in order to identify plausible syndromes suitable for conducting surveillance. The 24 selected studies showed no consistent changes in any health parameter. There were no repeated studies in any species by GM crop type and animal species. As such, there is insufficient evidence to inform the design of surveillance systems for detecting known adverse effects. Animal health surveillance systems have been proposed for the post market monitoring of potential adverse effects in animals. Such systems were evaluated for their applicability to the detection of hypothetical adverse effects and their strengths and weaknesses to detect syndromes of concern are presented. For known adverse effects, applied controlled post-market studies may yield conclusive and high-quality evidence. For detecting unknown adverse effects, the use of existing surveillance systems may still be of interest. A simulation tool developed within the project can be adapted and applied to existing surveillance systems to explore their applicability to the detection of potential adverse effects of GM feed.

TI  - Full Scale Regression-Based Injection Coefficients for Panchromatic Sharpening
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON IMAGE PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pansharpening is usually related to the fusion of a high spatial resolution but low spectral resolution (panchromatic) image with a high spectral resolution but low spatial resolution (multispectral) image. The calculation of injection coefficients through regression is a very popular and powerful approach. These coefficients are usually estimated at reduced resolution. In this paper, the estimation of the injection coefficients at full resolution for regression-based pansharpening approaches is proposed. To this aim, an iterative algorithm is proposed and studied. Its convergence, whatever the initial guess, is demonstrated in all the practical cases and the reached asymptotic value is analytically calculated. The performance is assessed both at reduced resolution and at full resolution on four data sets acquired by the IKONOS sensor and the WorldView-3 sensor. The proposed full scale approach always shows the best performance with respect to the benchmark consisting of state-of-the-art pansharpening methods.

TI  - RUSSIAN NATIONAL MODEL FOR THE REGULATION OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES: RESEARCH METHODOLOGY AND SOCIAL REALITY
T2  - QUALITY-ACCESS TO SUCCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the reference to various sources on socio-cultural and socioeconomic problems, the methodology of the Russian national model of socio-economic activity management is conceptualized in the article. As a theoretical basis, the theoretical assumptions of M. Weber's interpretive sociology, the concept of structural-functionalism (R. Merton, T. Parsons, etc.), institutional methodologies, the theory of institutional matrices of S. G. Kirdina, etc. were used. As a social reality, the Russian national model of managing socio-economic activity is explored in the context of the specifics of interaction of basic institutions of power, property and management in the Russian society, within the framework of the study of the prospects for the transformation of world outlook patterns of the national economic culture, etc. It is concluded that that the worldview foundations of the functioning of Russian society and the basic institutions of culture are in constant interaction with leading economic practices. Therefore, the formation of a national socio-economic model is closely dependent on historically conditioned cultural and ideological patterns.

TI  - SCREEN-BASED GAME COMMUNICATIONS AS AN INDICATOR OF THE PERCEPTION OF MEDIA REALITY THE SOCIAL STATUS & GENERATION ASPECT
T2  - VESTNIK MOSKOVSKOGO UNIVERSITETA. SERIYA 10. ZHURNALISTIKA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article outlines the main directions in the study of on-screen game communications as system-organizing elements of the media environment. The author declares the game/screen/communications/multimedia conjugacy and tests the hypothesis about the status-generation gap in the perception of the game phenomenon by students and university teachers. The latter pass on their own worldview priorities in the process of training specialists for the field of media communications: journalism, advertising, public relations, etc. The discovery of this gap makes it possible to understand and evaluate from the positions of the game paradigm the problems of screen media reality, which is formed individually (the projection "student") and institutionally (the projection "teacher"). The game technology Boss Fight is regarded in the article as an indicator of potential conflicts in the training space as well as an actual method of their optimization. This technology was involved by the author in the training course Television Journalism (RUDN University, 2017/18 academic year).

TI  - Efficacy and safety of ABP 980 compared with reference trastuzumab in women with HER2-positive early breast cancer (LILAC study): a randomised, double-blind, phase 3 trial
T2  - LANCET ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background ABP 980 (Amgen Inc, Thousand Oaks, CA, USA) is a biosimilar of trastuzumab, with analytical, functional, and pharmacokinetic similarities. We compared the clinical safety and efficacy of ABP 980 with that of trastuzumab in women with HER2-positive early breast cancer.Methods We did a randomised, multicentre, double-blind, active-controlled equivalence trial at 97 study centres in 20 countries, mainly in Europe and South America. Eligible women were aged 18 years or older, had histologically confirmed HER2-positive invasive early breast cancer, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 0 or 1, and were planning to have surgical resection of the breast tumour with sentinel or axillary lymph node dissection and neoadjuvant chemotherapy. After four cycles of run-in anthracycline-based chemotherapy, patients were assigned 1: 1 to receive ABP 980 or trastuzumab with a permuted block design (blocks of four) computer-generated randomisation schedule. Patients received neoadjuvant therapy with a loading dose (8 mg/kg) of ABP 980 or trastuzumab plus paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) in a 90 min intravenous infusion, followed by three cycles of 6 mg/kg intravenous ABP 980 or trastuzumab plus paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks in 30 min intravenous infusions (or 80 mg/m(2) paclitaxel once per week for 12 cycles if that was the local standard of care). Randomisation was stratified by T stage, node status, hormone receptor status, planned paclitaxel dosing schedule, and geographical region. Surgery was completed 3-7 weeks after the last dose of neoadjuvant treatment, after which adjuvant treatment with ABP 980 or trastuzumab was given every 3 weeks for up to 1 year after the first dose in the study. Patients had been randomly assigned at baseline to continue APB 980, continue trastuzumab, or switch from trastuzumab to APB 980 as their adjuvant treatment. The co-primary efficacy endpoints were risk difference and risk ratio (RR) of pathological complete response in breast tissue and axillary lymph nodes assessed at a local laboratory in all patients who were randomly assigned and received any amount of neoadjuvant investigational product and underwent surgery. We assessed safety in all patients who were randomly assigned and received any amount of investigational product. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT01901146 and Eudra, number CT 2012-004319-29.Findings Of 827 patients enrolled, 725 were randomly assigned to receive ABP 980 (n=364) or trastuzumab (n=361). The primary endpoint was assessable in 696 patients (358 who received ABP 980 and 338 who received trastuzumab). Pathological complete response was recorded in 172 (48%, 95% CI 43-53) of 358 patients in the ABP 980 group and 137 (41%, 35-46) of 338 in the trastuzumab group (risk difference 7.3%, 90% CI 1.2-13.4; RR 1.188, 90% CI 1.033-1.366), with the upper bounds of the CIs exceeding the predefined equivalence margins of 13% and 1.318, respectively. Pathological complete response in the central laboratory assessment was seen in 162 (48%) of 339 patients assigned to ABP 980 at baseline and 138 (42%) of 330 assigned to trastuzumab at baseline (risk difference 5.8%, 90% CI -0.5 to 12.0, and RR 1.142, 90% CI 0.993 to 1.312). Grade 3 or worse adverse events during the neoadjuvant phase occurred in 54 (15%) of 364 patients in the ABP 980 group and 51 (14%) of 361 patients in the trastuzumab group, of which the most frequent grade 3 or worse event of interest was neutropenia, occurring in 21 (6%) patients in both groups. In the adjuvant phase, grade 3 or worse adverse events occurred in 30 (9%) of 349 patients continuing ABP 980, 11 (6%) of 171 continuing trastuzumab, and 13 (8%) of 171 who switched from trastuzumab to ABP 980, the most frequent grade 3 or worse events of interest were infections and infestations (four [1%], two [1%], and two [1%]), neutropenia (three [1%], two [1%], and one [1%]), and infusion reactions (two [1%], two [1%], and three [2%]). Two patients died from adverse events judged to be unrelated to the investigational products: one died from pneumonia while receiving neoadjuvant ABP 980 and one died from septic shock while receiving adjuvant ABP 980 after trastuzumab.Interpretation Although the lower bounds of the 90% CIs for RR and risk difference showed non-inferiority, the upper bounds exceeded the predefined equivalence margins when based on local laboratory review of tumour samples, meaning that non-superiority was non-conclusive. In our sensitivity analyses based on central laboratory evaluation of tumour samples, estimates for the two drugs were contained within the predefined equivalence margins, indicating similar efficacy. ABP 980 and trastuzumab had similar safety outcomes in both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant phases of the study. Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Correlation Between Contrast-enhanced Ultrasound Characteristics (Qualitative and Quantitative) and Pathological Prognostic Factors in Breast Cancer
T2  - IN VIVO
M3  - Article
AB  - Background/Aim: Little is known about the correlation between contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) characteristics and pathological prognostic factors in breast cancer. The aim of this study was to explore the correlation between CEUS characteristics and pathological prognostic factors. Patients and Methods: A retrospective study with 34 malignant breast lesions was conducted. CEUS characteristics included qualitative characteristics (e.g. lesion's enhancement degree and order, internal lesion homogeneity etc.) and quantitative characteristics (e.g. peak intensity, time to peak etc.). Also, pathological prognostic factors were included (e.g. tumor grade, estrogen receptor status etc.). Results: Blurred lesion margins were observed more often in tumors of high histological grade (p=0.01) and in estrogen receptor-negative tumors (p=0.049). Furthermore, perilesional enhancement was associated with positive Ki-67 expression (p=0.049), while heterogeneous internal sentinel lymph node enhancement was associated with malignant infiltration of the node (p=0.002). Conclusion: CEUS has the potential to provide a prevision of pathological prognostic factors in malignant breast lesions, helping in the better early patient management.

T2  - VETERINARY SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To compare ventral cervical and bilateral lateral incisions for extirpation of mandibular and medial retropharyngeal lymph nodes in dogs.Study design: Prospective randomized, crossover controlled cadaver trial.Sample population: Eight veterinarians with advanced surgical training.Methods: Study participants were randomized to perform both techniques on paired cadavers. Time to extirpation of the first and last lymph node, length of incisions, and complications were recorded for both techniques. Participants were asked to rate satisfaction with their ability to identify local anatomy and lymph nodes as well as overall preferred technique by using a 10-point numerical rating scale.Results: The total length of skin incised for the bilateral lateral approach exceeded that of the ventral cervical approach by 52.1mm (mean, P<.001). The surgical time for removal of all 4 lymph nodes did not differ between the 2 approaches. The bilateral lateral approach was preferred by 62.5% (5/8) of participants for visualization of mandibular lymph nodes, and the ventral cervical approach was preferred by 87.5% (7/8) of participants for visualization of local anatomy. Overall, 62.5% (5/8) preferred the ventral cervical approach and 37.5% (3/8) preferred the bilateral lateral approach.Conclusion: The ventral cervical approach was preferred by participants for its perceived superior visualization of local anatomy and access to lymph nodes for removal. This approach also resulted in an overall shorter incision length.Clinical significance: A ventral cervical or bilateral lateral approach allows successful removal of the medial mandibular and retropharyngeal lymph nodes in dogs, and surgical approach may be selected according to individual preference.

TI  - Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> triggers the generation of a retrograde signaling complex from sentinel mRNAs in axons
T2  - EMBO REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Neurons frequently encounter neurodegenerative signals first in their periphery. For example, exposure of axons to oligomeric A beta(1-42) is sufficient to induce changes in the neuronal cell body that ultimately lead to degeneration. Currently, it is unclear how the information about the neurodegenerative insult is transmitted to the soma. Here, we find that the translation of pre-localized but normally silenced sentinel mRNAs in axons is induced within minutes of A beta(1-42) addition in a Ca2+-dependent manner. This immediate protein synthesis following A beta(1-42) exposure generates a retrograde signaling complex including vimentin. Inhibition of the immediate protein synthesis, knock-down of axonal vimentin synthesis, or inhibition of dynein-dependent transport to the soma prevented the normal cell body response to A beta(1-42). These results establish that CNS axons react to neurodegenerative insults via the local translation of sentinel mRNAs encoding components of a retrograde signaling complex that transmit the information about the event to the neuronal soma.

TI  - Assessing local climate zones in arid cities: The case of Phoenix, Arizona and Las Vegas, Nevada
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The local climate zone (LCZ) classification scheme is a standardization framework to describe the form and function of cities for urban heat island (UHI) studies. This study classifies and evaluates LCZs for two arid desert cities in the Southwestern United States - Phoenix and Las Vegas - following the World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools (WUDAPT) method. Both cities are classified into seven built type LCZs and seven land-cover type LCZs at 100-m resolution using Google Earth, Saga GIS, and Landsat 8 scenes. Average surface cover properties (building fraction, impervious fraction, pervious fraction) and sky view factors of classified LCZs are then evaluated and compared to pre-defined LCZ representative ranges from the literature, and their implications on the surface UHI (SUHI) effect are explained. Results suggest that observed LCZ properties in arid desert environments do not always match the proposed value ranges from the literature, especially with regard to sky view factor (SVF) upper boundaries. Although the LCZ classification scheme was originally designed to describe local climates with respect to air temperature, our analysis shows that much can be learned from investigating land surface temperature (LST) in these zones. This study serves as a substantial new resource laying a foundation for assessing the SUHI in cities using the LCZ scheme, which could inform climate simulations at local and regional scales.(C) 2018 The Authors.

TI  - Assessing the Driving Forces in Vegetation Dynamics Using Net Primary Productivity as the Indicator: A Case Study in Jinghe River Basin in the Loess Plateau
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - An objective and effective method to distinguish the influence of climate change and human activities on vegetation dynamics has great significance in the design and implementation of ecosystem restoration projects. Based on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) remote data and the Miami and Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model, this study simulated and used net primary productivity (NPP) as an indicator to identify vegetation dynamics and their driving forces in the Jinghe River basin from 2000 to 2014. The results showed that: (1) The vegetation in the Jinghe River basin, which accounted for 84.4% of the study area, showed an increasing trend in NPP; (2) Human activities contributed most to vegetation restoration, which accounted for 54.5% of the areas; 24.0% of the areas showed an increasing trend in the NPP that was dominated by climate factors. Degradation dominated by human activities accounted for 4.3% of the study area, and degradation dominated by climate factors resulted in 17.2%; (3) The rate of vegetation degradation in areas dominated by climate factors rose with increased slope, where the arid climate caused shortages of water resources, and the human-dominated vegetation restoration activities exacerbated the vegetation's water demand further, which surpassed the carrying capacity of regional water resources and led ultimately to vegetation degradation. We recommend that future ecological restoration programs pay more attention to maintaining the balance between ecosystem restoration and water resource demand to maximize the benefits of human activities and ensure the vegetation restoration is ecologically sustainable.

T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) can change the spatio-temporal distribution of aerosols by influencing the aerosol horizontal and vertical transports and the wet deposition of aerosols over East Asia. In this paper, we examined the aerosol optical depth (AOD) during summer together with the intensity of the EASM based on moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer products on board the Terra satellite and the modeling results from the NCAR Community Atmospheric Model 5.1 in the mid-latitude monsoonal East Asia (20-45 degrees N, 105-130 degrees E). Our results from both observations and simulations show positive correlations of AOD with the monsoon intensity over the Northeast Asia sub-region (32.5-45 degrees N, 105-130 degrees E), and negative correlations with that over the southeast Asia sub-region (20-32.5 degrees N, 105-130 degrees E). The observed and simulated AODs were much larger over the northern sub-region and much smaller over the southern sub-region in the strongest monsoon years compared with those in the weakest monsoon years. The model results suggest that the mechanism responsible for the north-south difference in the aerosol distribution was mainly caused by lower-tropospheric meridional wind anomalies related to EASM. Compared with the weakest monsoon years, the strongest monsoon years experienced southerly wind anomalies, which enabled more aerosols to be transported northward and resulted in a convergence of aerosols over the northern sub-region. In addition, the wet deposition of aerosols reduced (enhanced) the aerosol concentrations in the northern (southern) sub-region during the strongest monsoon years compared with the weakest monsoon years, which partly offset the impact of the lower southerly winds on the aerosol distribution over East Asia.

TI  - Predictors of internal mammary lymph nodes (IMLN) metastasis and disease-free survival comparison between IMLN-positive and IMLN-negative breast cancer patients Results from Western China Clinical Cooperation Group (WCCCG) database (CONSORT)
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Limited studies performed a comprehensive assessment of risk factors for internal mammary lymph nodes (IMLN) metastasis, and disease-free survival (DFS) difference between IMLN-positive and IMLN-negative breast cancer (BC) patients undergoing IMLN dissection and systemic therapies was not clear.A retrospective study included 1977 BC patients from Western China Clinical Cooperation Group between January 2005 and December 2012. The impact of clinicopathological factors on the occurrence of IMLN metastasis was assessed in univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses, and a nomogram (model) was constructed to predict the IMLN status. DFS difference was evaluated in univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses between IMLN-negative and IMLN-positive patients, and univariate analysis was performed to compare DFS between individuals with high and low IMLN metastasis risk defined by proposed nomogram.Of 1977 enrolled patients, 514 cases underwent IMLN dissection and 1463 cases did not undergo IMLN irradiation or dissection. We found that initial disease symptoms and signs, mammographic calcification, tumor site, number of positive axillary lymph nodes (ALNs), American Joint Committee on Cancer pT stage, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status were associated with IMLN metastasis (all P<.05). Those variables were included in nomogram, whose predictive ability was better than that of ALN classification (area under the curve: 0.82 vs 0.76, P<.001). Univariate cox proportional hazards model indicated that better DFS was observed in IMLN-negative patients than IMLN-positive group (hazard ratio [HR]=1.87, 95% confidence interval [CI]= 1.05-3.34; P=.04), whereas no significant differences in DFS (HR=0.99, 95% CI=0.49-2.00; P=.97) were found after adjusting patient-, disease-, and treatment-related factors.Nipple inversion, mammographic calcification, larger tumor size, medial tumor site, negative HER-2 status, and more positive ALNs are independent risk factors for IMLN metastasis, and the individualized nomogram is a feasible tool to predict the status of IMLN. Equivalent DFS was found between positive and negative IMLN patients who all accepted IMLN dissection and systemic therapies.

TI  - Mapping permafrost landscape features using object-based image classification of multi-temporal SAR images
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Microwave imagery has a distinct advantage over optical imagery in high-latitude areas because it allows data to be acquired independently of cloud cover and solar illumination. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR)-based monitoring has become increasingly important for understanding the state and dynamics of permafrost landscapes at the regional scale. This study presents a permafrost landscape mapping method that uses multi-temporal TerraSAR-X backscatter intensity and interferometric coherence information. The proposed method can classify permafrost landscape features and map the two most important features in sub-arctic permafrost environments: permafrost-affected areas and thermokarst ponds. First, a land cover map is generated through the combined use of object-based image analysis (OBIA) and classification and regression tree (CART) analysis. An overall accuracy of 98% is achieved when classifying rock and water bodies, and an accuracy of 79% is achieved when discriminating between different vegetation types with one year of single-polarized acquisitions. Second, the distributions of the permafrost affected areas and thermokarst ponds are derived from the classified landscapes. Permafrost-affected areas are inferred from the relationship between vegetation cover and the existence of permafrost, and thermokarst pond distributions are directly inherited from the land cover map. The two mapped features exhibit good agreement with manually delineated references. The proposed method can produce permafrost landscape maps in complex sub-arctic environments and improve our understanding of the effects of climate change on permafrost landscapes. This classification strategy can be transferred to other time-series SAR datasets, e.g., Sentinel-1, and other heterogeneous environments.

TI  - Long-Term Trends of Carbon Monoxide Total Columnar Amount in Urban Areas and Background Regions: Ground- and Satellite-based Spectroscopic Measurements
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - A comparative study was carried out to explore carbon monoxide total columnar amount (CO TC) in background and polluted atmosphere, including the stations of ZSS (Zvenigorod), ZOTTO (Central Siberia), Peterhof, Beijing, and Moscow, during 1998-2014, on the basis of ground- and satellite-based spectroscopic measurements. Interannual variations of CO TC in different regions of Eurasia were obtained from ground-based spectroscopic observations, combined with satellite data from the sensors MOPITT (2001-14), AIRS (2003-14), and IASI MetOp-A (2010-13). A decreasing trend in CO TC (1998-2014) was found at the urban site of Beijing, where CO TC decreased by 1.14%+/- 0.87% yr(-1). Meanwhile, at the Moscow site, CO TC decreased remarkably by 3.73%+/- 0.39% yr(-1). In the background regions (ZSS, ZOTTO, Peterhof), the reduction was 0.9%-1.7% yr(-1) during the same period. Based on the AIRSv6 satellite data for the period 2003-14, a slight decrease (0.4%-0.6% yr(-1)) of CO TC was detected over the midlatitudes of Eurasia, while a reduction of 0.9%-1.2% yr(-1) was found in Southeast Asia. The degree of correlation between the CO TC derived from satellite products (MOPITTv6 Joint, AIRSv6 and IASI MetOp-A) and ground-based measurements was calculated, revealing significant correlation in unpolluted regions. While in polluted areas, IASI MetOp-A and AIRSv6 data underestimated CO TC by a factor of 1.5-2.8. On average, the correlation coefficient between ground- and satellite-based data increased significantly for cases with PBL heights greater than 500 m.

TI  - Decimeter-Level Geolocation Accuracy Updated by a Parametric Tropospheric Model with GF-3
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - GaoFen-3 (GF-3) is a multi-polarization C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite in China with a resolution of up to 1 m. Up to now, the geolocation accuracy of GF-3 could be improved to 3 m. According to the current study, there still exist meter-level geolocation residuals caused by atmospheric path delay after compensating with a static tropospheric model. In this paper, we compensate the residuals with the sophisticated tropospheric model based on real meteorological data. The experimental results show that the tropospheric model has an accuracy on the millimeter level, which can increase GF-3's geolocation accuracy to several decimeters compared with the static tropospheric model.

TI  - A scale self-adapting segmentation approach and knowledge transfer for automatically updating land use/cover change databases using high spatial resolution images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Automatic updating of land use/cover change (LUCC) databases using high spatial resolution images (HSRI) is important for environmental monitoring and policy making, especially for coastal areas that connect the land and coast and that tend to change frequently. Many object-based change detection methods are proposed, especially those combining historical LUCC with HSRI. However, the scale parameter(s) segmenting the serial temporal images, which directly determines the average object size, is hard to choose without experts' intervention. And the samples transferred from historical LUCC also need experts' intervention to avoid insufficient or wrong samples. With respect to the scale parameter(s) choosing, a Scale Self-Adapting Segmentation (SSAS) approach based on the exponential sampling of a scale parameter and location of the local maximum of a weighted local variance was proposed to determine the scale selection problem when segmenting images constrained by LUCC for detecting changes. With respect to the samples transferring, Knowledge Transfer (KT), a classifier trained on historical images with LUCC and applied in the classification of updated images, was also proposed. Comparison experiments were conducted in a coastal area of Zhujiang, China, using SPOT 5 images acquired in 2005 and 2010. The results reveal that (1) SSAS can segment images more effectively without intervention of experts. (2) KT can also reach the maximum accuracy of samples transfer without experts' intervention. Strategy SSAS + KT would be a good choice if the temporal historical image and LUCC match, and the historical image and updated image are obtained from the same resource.

TI  - Minor contribution of overstorey transpiration to landscape evapotranspiration in boreal permafrost peatlands
T2  - ECOHYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - e Evapotranspiration (ET) is a key component of the water cycle, whereby accurate partitioning of ET into evaporation and transpiration provides important information about the intrinsically coupled carbon, water, and energy fluxes. Currently, global estimates of partitioned evaporative and transpiration fluxes remain highly uncertain, especially for high-latitude ecosystems where measurements are scarce. Forested peat plateaus underlain by permafrost and surrounded by permafrost-free wetlands characterize approximately 60% (7.0x10(7)km(2)) of Canadian peatlands. In this study, 22 Picea mariana (black spruce) individuals, the most common tree species of the North American boreal forest, were instrumented with sap flow sensors within the footprint of an eddy covariance tower measuring ET from a forest-wetland mosaic landscape. Sap flux density (J(S)), together with remote sensing data and in situ measurements of canopy structure, was used to upscale tree-level J(S) to overstorey transpiration (T-BS). Black spruce trees growing in nutrient-poor permafrost peat soils wre found to have lower mean J(S) than those growing in mineral soils. Overall, T-BS contributed less than 1% to landscape ET. Climate-change-induced forest loss and the expansion of wetlands may further minimize the contributions of T-BS to ET and increase the contribution of standing water.

TI  - Coherence Change-Detection with Sentinel-1 for Natural and Anthropogenic Disaster Monitoring in Urban Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid, reliable, and continuous information is an essential component in disaster monitoring and management. Remote sensing data could be a solution, but often cannot provide continuous data due to an absence of global coverage and weather and daylight dependency. To overcome these challenges, this study makes use of weather and day/light independent Sentinel-1 data with a global coverage to monitor localized effects of different types of disasters using the Coherence Change-Detection (CCD) technique. Coherence maps were generated from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images and used to classify areas of change and no change in six study areas. These sites are located in Syria, Puerto Rico, California, and Iran. The study areas were divided into street blocks, and the standard deviation was calculated for the coherence images for each street block over entire image stacks. The study areas were classified by land-use type to reveal the spatial variation in coherence loss after a disaster. While temporal decorrelation exhibits a general loss in coherence over time, disaster occurrence, however, indicates a significant loss in coherence after an event. The variations of each street block from the average coherence for the entire image stack, as measured by a high standard deviation after a particular disaster, is an indication of disaster induced building damage.

TI  - Spatial and temporal change of fractional vegetation cover in North-western China from 2000 to 2010
T2  - GEOLOGICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Northwestern China is located at the core area of The Belt and The Road at present and it once has been an essential transportation hub of the ancient Silk Road. However, the north-western part belongs to arid and semi-arid region where water resource and vegetation cover are scarce, leading to soil erosion, desertification, and environmental degradation. So it is meaningful to study fractional vegetation cover in North-western China. Vegetation MODIS data of northwestern China from 2000 to 2010 were collected, and then, the pixel dichotomy model and simple linear regression model were applied in this research. The results were as follows. First, the fractional vegetation cover was decreasing from the margin to the middle and western part and the higher value shown in the north-east part of Inner Mongolia, the south part of Shaanxi, the north-west part of Ningxia, the south-east part of Gansu, and the north-west part of Xinjiang. Second, the overall trend of fractional vegetation cover was rising during 2000 to 2010, which is clearly shown in northern Shaanxi, south-eastern Qinghai and Gansu, and also south-western Inner Mongolia. Third, fractional vegetation cover varied differently with season changes. To be more specific, the index in spring and winter was considerably low; in contrast, the index in summer and autumn was improved dramatically.

TI  - Assessing the Impacts of Streamside Ordinance Protection on the Spatial and Temporal Variability in Urban Riparian Vegetation
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Preserving riparian vegetation is important for maintaining water quality and riparian functions. Streamside protection ordinances have been widely established in many rapidly urbanizing areas, however, there has been a lack of assessment of the effectiveness of such ordinances. A study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of riparian vegetation preservation with and without ordinance protection. SPOT imagery was used to classify landscape changes over time (1992 through 2012) across multiple jurisdictions and pre- and post-ordinance implementation periods. Results indicated the spatial and temporal patterns of vegetation change differed by administrative areas and ordinance boundaries. The rate of tree loss and gains in developed lands in ordinance-protected areas generally increased following implementation of ordinances but at a lower rate than in non-ordinance areas. These findings suggest spatial and temporal monitoring of riparian ordinance implementation across adjacent jurisdictions is important to ensure the full effects of the ordinance protection on stream systems. Such monitoring and assessments can be used by local decision makers to adapt existing ordinances or in the development of new ordinances.

TI  - Hitler's Worldview and the Interwar Kulturkampf
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - This conceptual historical investigation of Adolf Hitler's use of the term worldview' (Weltanschauung) opens new perspectives on the debate over the relationship of religion and National Socialism. Most studies of Hitler's worldview have focused on the genealogy of his beliefs, an approach that has led to an anachronistic understanding of worldview. By contrast, this article reveals that Hitler's own usage of the term worldview' was decisively shaped by the German culture wars that preceded his entrance into politics in 1919. The article shows how the varying Nazi religious policies, from supporting positive Christianity' during the Weimar Republic to suppressing elements within the churches once taking power, continued to be framed by the dynamics of the culture wars.

TI  - Assessing Vegetation Response to Soil Moisture Fluctuation under Extreme Drought Using Sentinel-2
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the extent to which Sentinel-2 Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) reflects soil moisture conditions, and whether this product offers an improvement over Landsat-8. Based on drought exposure, cloud-free imagery availability, and measured soil moisture, five sites in the Southwestern United States were selected. These sites, normally dry to arid, were in various states of drought. A secondary focus was therefore the performance of the NDVI under extreme conditions. Following supervised classification, the NDVI values for one-kilometre radius areas were calculated. Sentinel-2 NDVI variants using Spectral Bands 8 (10 m spatial resolution), 5, 6, 7, and 8A (20 m spatial resolution) were calculated. Landsat-8 NDVI was calculated at 30 m spatial resolution. Pearson correlation analysis was undertaken for NDVI against moisture at various depths. To assess the difference in correlation strength, a principal component analysis was performed on the combination of all bands and the combination of the new red-edge bands. Performance of the red-edge NDVI against the standard near infrared (NIR) was then evaluated using a Steiger comparison. No significant correlations between Landsat-8 NDVI and soil moisture were found. Significant correlations at depths of less than 30 cm were present between Sentinel-2 NDVI and soil moisture at three sites. The remaining two sites were characterised by low vegetation cover, suggesting a cover threshold of approximately 30-40% is required for a correlation to be present. At all sites of significant positive moisture to NDVI correlation, the linear combination of the red-edge bands produced stronger correlations than the poorer spectral but higher spatial resolution band. NDVI calculated using the higher spectral resolution bands may therefore be of greater use in this context than the higher spatial resolution option. Results suggest potential for the application of Sentinel-2 NDVI in soil moisture monitoring, even in extreme environments. To the best of our knowledge, this paper represents the first study of this kind using Sentinel-2.

TI  - Landscape features and potential heat hazard threat: a spatial-temporal analysis of two urban universities
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban universities are a microcosm of urban built-up areas, such as cities, but with a much smaller scale of spatial resolution. Within universities, there are many types of landscape features exhibiting different heat absorption and transmission capacities. These landscape features generate spatial-temporal heat signatures, and the knowledge about landscape features and urban heat hazard on university campuses is limited. The objective of this research is an assessment of landscape features and the potential heat hazard threats of two urban universities in ASEAN, located in the centre of the equatorial region. The focus of this research is on urban heat hazards in two urban universities in ASEAN, the University of Malaysia in Kuala Lumpur and the University of Indonesia in Jakarta, within the context of the spatial-temporal behaviour of urban heat and the urban heat effects on the environment and human well-being on campuses. The spatial and temporal analysis used to answer the objective of this research via data-gathering methods from image satellite, ground trough, and human perception study. The UM campus and UI campus, both urban campuses, had similar landscape features but had different total percentage areas of these features. The UM campus was 59.1% covered by the densely vegetated surface landscape feature, a percentage lower than that of the UI campus, which was 65.3% vegetation covered. The temporal results for the UHS of the UM campus in 2013-2016 show a maximum temperature of 39 A degrees C. Therefore, the UHS of the UI campus demonstrated temporal behaviour in 2013-2016, with a maximum temperature of 38 A degrees C. The UHS behaviour of the UM campus and UI campus had an air surface temperature with a maximum average temperature of 33 A degrees C. The air surface temperatures exceeding 32 A degrees C at the UM campus (12 pm until 6 pm = 5 h) lasted for a longer time than those at the UI campus (12 pm until 3 pm = 3 h). This study showed that, based on the perceptions on both campuses, if temperatures exceeded 30 A degrees C, respondents were very hot and very uncomfortable, which will impact health and decrease work or academic achievements, as perceptions of heat intensity impact human well-being. Students perceived that heat intensity impacted their health and they reported becoming tired and lethargic under maximum temperatures and were very hot and very uncomfortable, and this condition impacted their work activity. These results indicated that, at both the UM and UI campuses, heat intensity impacts human well-being, with risks associated with hot temperatures. These two urban campuses are significant for ASEAN university awareness of the urban heat hazard of the equatorial area.

TI  - Omitting radiotherapy in women ≥65 years with low-risk early breast cancer after breast-conserving surgery and adjuvant endocrine therapy is safe
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to verify if radiotherapy (RT) safely can be omitted in older women treated for estrogen-receptor positive early breast cancer with breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and endocrine therapy (ET).Patients and Methods: Eligibility criteria were: consecutive patients with age >= 65 years, BCS + sentinel node biopsy, clear margins, unifocal T1N0M0 breast cancer tumor, Elston-Ellis histological grade 1 or 2 and estrogen receptor-positive tumor. After informed consent, adjuvant ET for 5 years was prescribed. Primary endpoint was ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR). Secondary endpoints were contralateral breast cancer and overall survival.Results: Between 2006 and 2012, 603 women were included from 14 Swedish centers. Median age was 71.1 years (range 65-90). After a median follow-up of 68 months 16 IBTR (cumulative incidence at five-year follow-up; 1.2%, 95% CI, 0.6% to 2.5%), 6 regional recurrences (one combined with IBTR), 2 distant recurrences (both without IBTR or regional recurrence) and 13 contralateral breast cancers were observed. There were 48 deaths. One death (2.1%) was due to breast cancer and 13 (27.1%) were due to other cancers (2 endometrial cancers). Five-year overall survival was 93.0% (95% CI, 90.5% to 94.9%).Conclusion: BCS and ET without RT seem to be a safe treatment option in women >= 65 years with early breast cancer and favorable histopathology. The risk of IBTR is comparable to the risk of contralateral breast cancer. Moreover, concurrent morbidity dominates over breast cancer as leading cause of death in this cohort with low-risk breast tumors.

CP  - 61st Congress of the Deutsche-Gesellschaft-fur-Gynakologie-und-Geburtshilfe (DGGG)

AB  - Objective The requirement for and extent of lymphadenectomy in endometrial cancer is still controversial. Clinicopathological prognostic factors could be helpful to predict lymph node involvement and avoid therefore unnecessary lymphadenectomy. The aim of this study was to investigate which factors can predict lymph node involvement and how lymph node metastases are distributed in the pelvic and para-aortic regions.Methods This retrospective analysis was performed by analyzing data from patients with endometrial cancer treated with standard surgery and lymphadenectomy at the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics of the University Hospital Ulm in 2000 to 2013.Results One hundred twenty-five patients received pelvic lymphadenectomy with a median of 25 removed nodes, and 111 patients additionally received para-aortic lymphadenectomy with a median of 12 removed nodes. Metastatic lymph nodes were found in 24.8% of the patients, and a multivariate logistic regression showed that lymphovascular space invasion, histological type, and tumor stage significantly and independently predicted lymph node involvement. Of the 111 patients with both pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy, 18 (16.2%) patients had metastatic para-aortic nodes, and 3 (2.7%) patients had isolated positive para-aortic lymph nodes without involvement of pelvic lymph nodes.Discussion Lymphovascular space invasion, histological type, and tumor stage are significant predictors of lymph node involvement in endometrial cancer. In patients at high risk of nodal involvement, lymphadenectomy should be performed systematically up to the renal vein. Large and carefully designed prospective studies are needed to evaluate patient cohorts for which a complete lymphadenectomy provides a survival benefit. In the future, the increasing use of sentinel node biopsy may facilitate a more personalized treatment of patients with endometrial cancer.

TI  - Doppler Frequency Estimation of Point Targets in the Single-Channel SAR Image by Linear Least Squares
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a method and results for the estimation of residual Doppler frequency, and consequently the range velocity component of point targets in single-channel synthetic aperture radar (SAR) focused single-look complex (SLC) data. It is still a challenging task to precisely retrieve the radial velocity of small and slow-moving objects, which requires an approach providing precise estimates from only a limited number of samples within a few range bins. The proposed method utilizes linear least squares, along with the estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques (ESPRIT) algorithm, to provide optimum estimates from sets of azimuth subsamples that have different azimuth temporal distances. The ratio of estimated Doppler frequency to root-mean square error (RMSE) is suggested for determining a critical threshold, optimally selecting a number of azimuth subsample sets to be involved in the estimation. The proposed method was applied to TerraSAR-X and KOMPSAT-5 X-band SAR SLC data for on-land and coastal sea estimation, with speed-controlled, truck-mounted corner reflectors and ships, respectively. The results demonstrate its performance of the method, with percent errors of less than 5%, in retrieved range velocity for both on-land and in the sea. It is also robust, even for weak targets with low peak-to-sidelobe ratios (PSLRs) and signal-to-clutter ratios (RCSs). Since the characteristics of targets and clutter on land and in the sea are different, it is recommended that the method is applied separately with different thresholds. The limitations of the approach are also discussed.

TI  - An Improved Subpixel Mapping Algorithm Based on a Combination of the Spatial Attraction and Pixel Swapping Models for Multispectral Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - To obtain spatial feature distributions from the mixed pixels of remote sensing images and increase the accuracy of land-cover classification and recognition, a double-calculated spatial attraction model (DSAM) based on the combination of spatial attraction model (SAM) and pixel swapping model (PSM) is presented and verified by introducing the law of universal gravitation to describe the attraction between pixels. In DSAM, SAM was used to improve the initialization algorithm of PSM, and the optimization algorithm of PSM was improved accordingly. Using a SPOT-5 remote sensing image, related subpixel mapping (SPM) experiments were performed to verify the SPM effect of DSAM and to test its accuracy. The experimental results indicated that the DSAM SPM results were superior to the SPM results of SAM and PSM. DSAM was proven effective and applicable for the SPM of remotely sensed images, and the model can improve the accuracy of SPM and landcover classification.

TI  - Global cropping intensity gaps: Increasing food production without cropland expansion
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - To feed the world's growing population, more food needs to be produced using currently available cropland. In addition to yield increase, increasing cropping intensity may provide another promising opportunity to boost global crop production. However, spatially explicit information on the cropping intensity gap (CIG) of current global croplands is lacking. Here, we developed the first spatially explicit approach to measure the global CIG, which represents the difference between the potential and actual cropping intensity. Results indicate that the global average CIG around the year 2010 was 0.48 and 0.17 for the temperature- and temperature/precipitationlimited scenarios, respectively. Surprisingly, global harvest areas can be expanded by another 7.36 million km(2) and 2.71 million km(2) (37.55% and 13.83% of current global cropland) under the two scenarios, respectively. This will largely compensate the future global cropland loss due to increasing urbanization and industrialization. Latin America has the largest potential to expand its harvest area by closing the CIGs, followed by Asia. Some countries in Africa have a large CIG, meaning that some additional harvests can potentially be achieved. Our analysis suggests that reducing the CIG would provide a potential strategy to increase global food production without cropland expansion, thus also helping achieve other Sustainable Development Goals such as biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation.

TI  - Spatial Variation of Urban Thermal Environment and Its Relation to Green Space Patterns: Implication to Sustainable Landscape Planning
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid changes of land covers in urban areas are one of major environmental concerns because of their environmental impacts. Such land cover changes include the transformation of green space to impervious surface, and the increase of land surface temperature (LST). The objective of this study was to examine the spatial variation of urban landscape composition and configuration, as well as their influences on LST in Suzhou City, China. Landsat-8 image was processed to extract land covers and retrieve LSTs that were used to study relationship between spatial variation of LST and land covers. The results indicated that there was a significantly negative correlation between mean LST and green space coverage along the urban-rural gradients. With every 10% increased green space coverage, the mean LST drop was about 1.41 degrees C. A grid-base analysis performed at various grid sizes indicated that an increase in the percentage of surface water body area has a greater cooling effect of the mean LST than a vegetation increase. The mean LST had a significantly negative correlation with both the shape and aggregation indexes of the green space patches. Our results suggest that the sustainable landscape planning of green space in a typical city with a large water area should include both the vegetation and the surface water covers. The increased percentage of vegetation and surface water covers had the greatest cooling effect on an urban thermal environment, which is one of the ecosystem services that green space provides. A dense distribution of green space patches with complex shapes should be considered in urban sustainable landscape planning for increasing ecosystem services.

TI  - A new merged dataset of global ocean chlorophyll <i>a</i> concentration with higher spatial and temporal coverage
T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the ocean's role in the global carbon cycle and its response to environmental change requires a high spatio-temporal resolution of observation. Merging ocean color data from multiple sources is an effective way to alleviate the limitation of individual ocean color sensors (e.g., swath width and gaps, cloudy or rainy weather, and sun glint) and to improve the temporal and spatial coverage. Since the missions of Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS) and Medium-spectral Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) ended on December 11, 2010 and May 9, 2012, respectively, the number of available ocean color sensors has declined, reducing the benefits of the merged ocean color data with respect to the spatial and temporal coverage. In present work, Medium Resolution Spectral Imager (MERSI)/FY-3 of China is added in merged processing and a new dataset of global ocean chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration (2000-2015) is generated from the remote sensing reflectance (Rrs (lambda)) observations of MERIS, Moderate-resolution imaging spectra-radiometer (MODIS)-AQUA, Visible infrared Imaging Radiometer (VIIRS) and MERSI. These data resources are first merged into unified remote sensing reflectance data, and then Chl a concentration data are inversed using the combined Chl a algorithm of color index-based algorithm (CIA) and OC3. The merged data products show major improvements in spatial and temporal coverage from the addition of MERSI. The average daily coverage of merged products is approximately 24% of the global ocean and increases by approximately 9% when MERSI data are added in the merging process. Sampling frequency (temporal coverage) is greatly improved by combining MERSI data, with the median sampling frequency increasing from 15.6% (57 d/a) to 29.9% (109 d/a). The merged Chl a products herein were validated by in situ measurements and comparing them with the merged products using the same approach except for omitting MERSI and GlobColour and MEaSUREs merged data. Correlation and relative error between the new merged Chl a products and in situ observation are stable relative to the results of the merged products without the addition of MERSI. Time series of the Chl a concentration anomalies are similar to the merged products without adding MERSI and single sensors. The new merged products agree within approximately 10% of the merged Chl a product from GlobColour and MEaSUREs.

TI  - Improving Spatial-Temporal Data Fusion by Choosing Optimal Input Image Pairs
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial and temporal data fusion approaches have been developed to fuse reflectance imagery from Landsat and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), which have complementary spatial and temporal sampling characteristics. The approach relies on using Landsat and MODIS image pairs that are acquired on the same day to estimate Landsat-scale reflectance on other MODIS dates. Previous studies have revealed that the accuracy of data fusion results partially depends on the input image pair used. The selection of the optimal image pair to achieve better prediction of surface reflectance has not been fully evaluated. This paper assesses the impacts of Landsat-MODIS image pair selection on the accuracy of the predicted land surface reflectance using the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) over different landscapes. MODIS images from the Aqua and Terra platforms were paired with images from the Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) to make different pair image combinations. The accuracy of the predicted surface reflectance at 30 m resolution was evaluated using the observed Landsat data in terms of mean absolute difference, root mean square error and correlation coefficient. Results show that the MODIS pair images with smaller view zenith angles produce better predictions. As expected, the image pair closer to the prediction date during a short prediction period produce better prediction results. For prediction dates distant from the pair date, the predictability depends on the temporal and spatial variability of land cover type and phenology. The prediction accuracy for forests is higher than for crops in our study areas. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for crops is overestimated during the non-growing season when using an input image pair from the growing season, while NDVI is slightly underestimated during the growing season when using an image pair from the non-growing season. Two automatic pair selection strategies are evaluated. Results show that the strategy of selecting the MODIS pair date image that most highly correlates with the MODIS image on the prediction date produces more accurate predictions than the nearest date strategy. This study demonstrates that data fusion results can be improved if appropriate image pairs are used.

TI  - Effects of Wintertime Polluted Aerosol on Clouds over the Yangtze River Delta: Case Study
T2  - AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 10th Asian Aerosol Conference (AAC)
CL  - Korea Assoc Particle & Aerosol Res, SOUTH KOREA
AB  - The effects of aerosol on clouds are examined over the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) using 3 months of satellite data from the polluted wintertime from December 2013 to February 2014. The relationships between aerosol properties, and cloud micro-and macro-physical parameters are analyzed in detail to clarify the differences in cloud development under various aerosol and meteorological conditions. Complex relationships between the aerosol optical depth (AOD), and the cloud droplet radius (CDR), liquid water path (LWP) and cloud optical thickness (COT) exist in four regions of interest (ROIs). High aerosol loading does not obviously affect LWPs and COTs; in fact, aerosols inhibit development of low-and medium-low clouds over coastal areas-an effect that is more pronounced in low clouds (< 5 km) than high ones. Low aerosol loading plays a positive role in promoting the COT of high-and low-clouds over areas dominated by maritime aerosol. Aerosol loading exerts a significant influence on COTs, LWPs and CDRs in valley and coal industry districts except during high-cloud conditions. The ranges of COTs, LWPs and CDRs in dry-polluted areas are lower than in other places, which suggests that dust aerosol has little effect on cloud properties. Synoptic conditions also strongly impact cloud distribution, in particular, an unstable synoptic condition leads to cloud development on a larger horizontal and vertical scale. Ground pollution enhances the amount of low-level cloud cover even under stable conditions. Aerosol plays an important role in wintertime cloud evolution in the low layers of the troposphere (< 5 km) when the atmosphere is stable.

TI  - Diverse responses of different structured forest to drought in Southwest China through remotely sensed data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Global climate change leads to gradual increases in the frequency, intensity, and duration of extreme drought events. Human activities such as afforestation and deforestation have led to spatial variation in forest structure, causing forests to exhibit an age-spatial structure relationship. Thus, it is of great importance to accurately evaluate the effects of drought stress on forest ecosystems with different forest age structures. Because the spatial heterogeneity varies with drought stress intensity, forest age, there are still a lot of uncertainties in current studies. In this study, based on the field measurement, and the proxy index of stand age (based on forest canopy height from LiDAR and stock volume from inventory) at the regional scale, we analyzed the different drought responses of forest ecosystems with various forest ages across different scales in Yunnan province, southwest China from 2001 to 2014. At the local scale, significant differences in the effects of drought stress were found among forests with various ages, suggesting that older forests suffer more under drought stress than younger forests. At the regional scale, the investigation statistics of forest damage indicated a maximum damage ratio in the forest with tall trees (> 32 m), whereas damage was minimal in the forest with short trees (< 25 m). The stock volume of the forest exhibited the same pattern, that is, the forest damage ratio increased as the stock volume increased. These data demonstrate that the responses of forest drought could be affected by forest age. Under drought stress, older forests show greater vulnerability and risk of damage, which will require special attention for forest managers, as well as Unproved risk assessments, in the context of future climate change.

TI  - Impact of Ships and Ocean Fronts on Coastal Sea Surface Wind Measurements From the Advanced Scatterometer
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, the capability of the advanced scatterometer (ASCAT) in measuring surface wind speed in coastal waters of China was first evaluated by comparing with in situ wind observations from 13 moored buoys during the period from July 2013 to December 2015. The scatterometer performs well in most coastal regions of China. However, a sharp reduction in wind speed retrieval accuracy is found in areas adjacent to the Yangtze River estuary. The mean bias and root-mean-square error between ASCAT wind speeds and buoy measurements reach up to 3.44 and 4.06 m . s(-1), respectively. This large overestimation of surface wind is also observed in Sentinel-1A synthetic aperture radar (SAR) derived wind speeds. The analysis of quasi-synchronous SAR images and sea surface temperature observations shows that the overestimation of the scatterometer or SAR winds is mainly caused by the effects of ships or ocean thermal fronts due to the complicated thermodynamic and hydrodynamic characteristics of the study area on radar backscatter signal. These effects should be taken into account or marked as flags in activities generating or using scatterometer or SAR wind products.

TI  - Fain Ship Wake Detection in PolSAR Images
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Focusing on the faint turbulent wake detection in polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images, this letter introduces a novel two-step (coarse and fine processing) detector. Based on the polarization decomposition theory, a new parameter that enhances the contrast between wake and sea, which is called surface scattering randomness (SSR), is proposed. The coarse detection process extracts the regions of potential ship wakes by digital axoids transform of SSR. During the fine detection process, the regions detected by the coarse detection are segmented and processed independently in the polarization feature domain. Finally, by introducing the regularity least-squares method, the line parameters of ship wake are obtained, while the a priori knowledge is obtained from Radon transform. Experiments are performed on Radarsat-2 data, and the results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has strong ability to detect faint turbulent wake in PolSAR images compared with the current detectors, which are based on the Radon or Hough transform.

TI  - Realistic Lower Bound on Elevation Estimation for Tomographic SAR
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The noise in a tomographic synthetic aperture radar (Tomo-SAR) model is normally assumed to be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian. In this paper, the correlated Tomo-SAR model is introduced by studying the effect of random residual phase and correlated additive Gaussian noise, and a realistic and general hybrid Cramer-Rao bound (HCRB) on elevation estimation is derived for such a model. Then, a simplified calculation of the HCRB is proposed when the bound of elevation is the main focus. Computer simulations are performed to analyze the proposed HCRB for elevation estimation. The results obtained from estimators based on compressive sensing and distributed compressive sensing show that the proposed HCRB can provide a more realistic bound than the CRB derived with the white additive noise and perfect phase compensation assumption. This is also validated through processing results on real data acquired by TerraSAR-X/Tandem-X sensors.

TI  - Using 250-M Surface Reflectance MODIS Aqua/Terra Product to Estimate Turbidity in a Macro-Tidal Harbour: Darwin Harbour, Australia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Turbidity is an indicator of the quality of water and usually exhibits variability associated with changing hydrodynamic conditions, which can be reflected in the sediment dynamics in coastal regions. Darwin Harbour is a typical macro-tidal, well mixed, and complex environment influenced by industries, human activities, and natural factors-including winds, currents, river discharges, waves, and tides. As a case study, hydrodynamics and sediment dynamics in Darwin Harbour are investigated using moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) measurements. This study focuses on understanding the variability of turbidity, mechanisms that control the variations of turbidity and analyzing field data to determine the main factors that influence the sediment dynamics in Darwin Harbour. The results of this study illustrate the seasonal turbidity variation is mainly influenced by the wind waves. The dredging campaigns in 2013 and 2014 wet seasons contributed to the rise of turbidity in Darwin Harbour. The action of tidal currents appears to be the dominant factor controlling the turbidity pattern in a spring-neap cycle and the turbidity intra-tidal variation. In addition, the turbidity maximum zone (TMZ) near Charles Point is formed by the tidal current convergence based on the results of current modelling.

TI  - Field-based rice classification in Wuhua county through integration of multi-temporal Sentinel-1A and Landsat-8 OLI data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice is one of the most important cereals in the world. With the change of agricultural land, it is urgently neemcary to update information about rice planting areas. This study aims to map rice planting areas with a field-based approach through the integration of multi-temporal Sentinel-1A and Landsat-8 OLI data in Wuhua County of South China where has many basins and mountains. This paper, using multi-temporal SAR and optical images, proposes a methodology for the identification of rice-planting areas. This methodology mainly consists of SSM applied to time series SAR images for the calculation of a similarity measure, image segmentation process applied to the pan-sharpened optical image for the searching of homogenous objects, and the integration of SAR and optical data for the elimination of some speckles. The study compares the per-pixel approach with the per field approach and the results show that the highest accuracy (91.38%) based on the field-based approach is 1.18% slightly higher than that based on the pixel-based approach for VH polarization, which is brought by eliminating speckle noise through comparing the rice maps of these two approaches. Therefore, the integration of Sentinel-1A and Landsat-8 OLI images with a field-based approach has great potential for mapping rice or other crops' areas.

TI  - Identification of Stable Backscattering Features, Suitable for Maintaining Absolute Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Radiometric Calibration of Sentinel-1
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Measuring the absolute calibration constant is crucial for the radiometric calibration of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems. However, it is expensive to monitor the calibration constant continuously using manmade calibrators, and it is regionally restricted using the rainforest as the calibration field. In this study, the stability of SAR backscattering for common objects on the earth surface was analyzed, expecting to find the stable backscattering feature that could be used for maintaining absolute radiometric calibration. A database was established using Sentinel-1 dataset, and a classification model based on neural networks was proposed to extract the image slices of proper objects. Based on these, a temporal stable backscattering feature with a standard deviation of 0.19 dB was obtained from urban areas, and it was proved to be even more stable than the rainforest. Finally, the calibration scheme was given using this stable feature as a reference, which provided a new means of monitoring the SAR radiometric calibration constant.

TI  - Multi-Scale Analysis of the Relationship between Land Subsidence and Buildings: A Case Study in an Eastern Beijing Urban Area Using the PS-InSAR Technique
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Beijing is severely affected by land subsidence, and rapid urbanisation and building construction might accelerate the land subsidence process. Based on 39 Envisat Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) images acquired between 2003-2010, 55 TerraSAR-X images acquired between 2010-2016, and urban building information, we analysed the relationship between land subsidence and buildings at the regional, block, and building scales. The results show that the surface displacement rate in the Beijing urban area ranged from -109 mm/year to +13 mm/year between 2003-2010, and from -151 mm/year to +19 mm/year between 2010-2016; two subsidence bowls were mainly distributed in the eastern part of the Chaoyang District. The displacement rate agreed well with the levelling measurements, with an average bias of less than six mm/year. At the regional scale, the spatial pattern of land subsidence was mainly controlled by groundwater extraction, compressible layer thickness, and geological faults. Subsidence centres were located in the area around ground water funnels with a compressible layer depth of 50-70 m. The block-scale analysis demonstrated a clear correlation between the block construction age and the spatial unevenness of subsidence. The blocks constructed between 1998-2005 and after 2005 showed considerably more subsidence unevenness and temporal instability than the blocks constructed before 1998 during both time periods. The examination of the new blocks showed that the spatial unevenness increased with building volume variability. For the 16 blocks with a high building volume, variability, and subsidence unevenness, the building-scale analysis showed a positive relationship between building volume and settlement in most blocks, although the R-2 was lower than 0.5. The results indicate that intense building construction in urban areas could cause differential settlement at the block scale in Beijing, while the settlement of single buildings could be influenced by the integrated effects of building volume, foundation structures, and the hydrogeological background.

TI  - Moisture content estimation of forest litter based on remote sensing data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - As a fine fuel, forest litter plays an important role in fire danger rating systems, so forest litter moisture data are necessary and meaningful for fire risk management and prevention. An optical remote sensing technique can provide continuous and regional data for litter moisture estimates, but such an approach is restricted in separating the background reflectance of the forest floor from pixel reflectance because the litter moisture information is included only in background reflectance while pixel reflectance in the forest area consists of both canopy reflectance and background reflectance. Therefore, we present a geometrical-optical model to estimate forest litter moisture by separating contributions of background reflectance from the remote sensing image and use a statistical model to estimate the forest litter moisture content based on the calculated background reflectance. The results show that the model had an R (2), root mean square error (RMSE), and average precision of 0.595, 0.372, and 69.654%, respectively. This approach provides a new way of estimating forest litter moisture content from an optical remote sensing image, and it can potentially be applied in large-pping.scale forest litter moisture content ma

TI  - Less sensitive of urban surface to climate variability than rural in Northern China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the relationships between interannual variations of surface urban heal islands (SUHIs) and climate variability were studied in 31 cities of China for the period 2001-2016. For cold and dry Northern China, it was found that the interannual variations of SUHI intensity (SUHIL land surface temperature (LST) in urban minus rural) in urban cores was significantly (p < 0.05) and negatively correlated with rural LST in 9 (in summer days (SDs)) and 8 (in winter days (WDs)) of the 15 northern cities, respectively. In addition, the daytime LST differences between hot summers and other summers and between cold winters and other winters were generally lower in urban cores (1.141 degrees C for SDs and 2.535 degrees C for WDs) than in rural areas (1.890 degrees C for SDs and 3.377 degrees C for WDs). The standard deviation was further used to reflect the interannual stabilities of LST, enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and white sky albedo (WSA). Interestingly, the standard deviations of LST across 2001-2016 were generally lower in urban cores (0.994 degrees C for SDs and 1.577 degrees C for WDs) than in rural areas (1.431 degrees C for SDs and 2.077 degrees C for WDs). Similar results were observed for EVI and WSA (winter). The results suggested that the urban surface is less sensitive to climate variability than rural areas in Northern China. Comparatively, most findings were less evident in hot and humid Southern China. Despite the whole world would become warmer or colder in future, the insensitivity of urban surface may mitigate its impacts in cold and dry Northern China. However, it does not mean that urbanization is totally good due to its environmental problem. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - A review of accuracy assessment for object-based image analysis: From per-pixel to per-polygon approaches
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Object-based image analysis (OBIA) has gained widespread popularity for creating maps from remotely sensed data. Researchers routinely claim that OBIA procedures outperform pixel-based procedures; however, it is not immediately obvious how to evaluate the degree to which an OBIA map compares to reference information in a manner that accounts for the fact that the OBIA map consists of objects that vary in size and shape. Our study reviews 209 journal articles concerning OBIA published between 2003 and 2017. We focus on the three stages of accuracy assessment: (1) sampling design, (2) response design and (3) accuracy analysis. First, we report the literature's overall characteristics concerning OBIA accuracy assessment. Simple random sampling was the most used method among probability sampling strategies, slightly more than stratified sampling. Office interpreted remotely sensed data was the dominant reference source. The literature reported accuracies ranging from 42% to 96%, with an average of 85%. A third of the articles failed to give sufficient information concerning accuracy methodology such as sampling scheme and sample size. We found few studies that focused specifically on the accuracy of the segmentation. Second, we identify a recent increase of OBIA articles in using per-polygon approaches compared to per-pixel approaches for accuracy assessment. We clarify the impacts of the per-pixel versus the per polygon approaches respectively on sampling, response design and accuracy analysis. Our review defines the technical and methodological needs in the current per-polygon approaches, such as polygon-based sampling, analysis of mixed polygons, matching of mapped with reference polygons and assessment of segmentation accuracy. Our review summarizes and discusses the current issues in object-based accuracy assessment to provide guidance for improved accuracy assessments for OBIA.

TI  - A PolSAR Image Segmentation Algorithm Based on Scattering Characteristics and the Revised Wishart Distance
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel segmentation algorithm for polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images is proposed in this paper. The method is composed of two essential components: a merging order and a merging predicate. The similarity measured by the complex-kind Hotelling-Lawley trace (HLT) statistic is used to decide the merging order. The merging predicate is determined by the scattering characteristics and the revised Wishart distance between adjacent pixels, which can greatly improve the performance in speckle suppression and detail preservation. A postprocessing step is applied to obtain a satisfactory result after the merging operation. The decomposition and merging processes are iteratively executed until the termination criterion is met. The superiority of the proposed method was verified with experiments on two RADARSAT-2 PolSAR images and a Gaofen-3 PolSAR image, which demonstrated that the proposed method can obtain more accurate segmentation results and shows a better performance in speckle suppression and detail preservation than the other algorithms.

TI  - Seamless Upscaling of the Field-Measured Grassland Aboveground Biomass Based on Gaussian Process Regression and Gap-Filled Landsat 8 OLI Reflectance
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatially explicit aboveground biomass (AGB) generated through upscaling field measurements is critical for carbon cycle simulation and optimized management of grasslands. However, the spatial gaps that exist in the optical remote sensing data, underutilization of the multispectral data cube and unavailability of uncertainty information hinder the generation of seamless and accurate AGB maps. This study proposes a novel framework to address the above challenges. The proposed framework filled the spatial gaps in the remote sensing data via the consistent adjustment of the climatology to actual observations (CACAO) method. Gaussian process regression (GPR) was used to fully exploit the multispectral data cube and generated the pixelwise uncertainty concurrent with the AGB estimation. A case study in a 100 km x 100 km area located in the Zoige Plateau, China was used to evaluate this framework. The results show that the CACAO method can fill almost all of the gaps, accounting for 93.1% of the study area, with satisfactory accuracy. The generated AGB map from the GPR was characterized by a relatively high accuracy (R-2 = 0.64, RMSE = 48.13 g/m(2)) compared to vegetation index-derived ones, and was accompanied by a corresponding uncertainty map that provides a new source of information on the credibility of each pixel. This study demonstrates the potential of the joint use of gap-filling and machine-learning methods to generate spatially explicit AGB.

TI  - Spectral analysis and power spectral density evaluation in Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanofluid minimum quantity lubrication milling of 45 steel
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Nanofluid minimum quantity lubrication (NMQL) is one of the main modes of sustainable manufacturing. It is an environment-friendly, energy-saving, and highly efficient lubrication method. With the use of nanoparticles, the tribological properties of debris-tool and workpiece-tool interfaces will change. However, spectrum analyses of force and power spectral density (PSD) of surface microstructures are limited. In the present work, the milling force, friction coefficient, specific energy, surface roughness, and surface microstructure of debris were evaluated in milling of 45 steel for different lubrication conditions, namely, dry, flood, minimum quantity lubrication, and Al2O3 NMQL. Results demonstrated that compared with other lubrication conditions, NMQL achieves minimum milling force peak (F (x) = 270 N, F (y) = 160 N, F (z) = 50 N), friction coefficient (mu = 1.039), specific energy (U = 65.5 J/mm(3)), and surface roughness value (R (a) = 2.254 mu m, RSm = 0.0562 mm). Furthermore, a spectrum analysis of the milling force and PSD of the surface microstructure was conducted for validation. The spectral analysis of milling force revealed that NMQL obtained the lowest milling force and amplitude in the middle-frequency region, thereby indicating the minimum abrasion loss of the tool. Meanwhile, the PSD analysis indicated that NMQL had the lowest proportional coefficient in the low-frequency region (0.4766) and the highest proportional coefficient in the high-frequency region (0.0569). These results revealed that the workpiece surface gained by Al2O3 NMQL obtained higher wave fineness than other working conditions. By combining with the lowest R (a), NMQL contributes the best workpiece surface quality. Therefore, machining experiments using NMQL showed the best lubrication performance.

TI  - The Integration of GNSS/Leveling Data with Global Geopotential Models to Define the Height Reference System of Palestine
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - In GNSS, 3D geometric position is calculated with high accuracy. This position is the ellipsoidal latitude, longitude and ellipsoidal height with respect to WGS84 coordinates system. These coordinates are integrated with local horizontal/projected coordinates (X, Y) by mathematical coordinate's transformations and map projections. The geometric ellipsoidal height (h) obtained by means of GNSS has to be integrated with the physical/orthometric heights (H) obtained by means of precise leveling. The physical surface defining the difference between both height systems is the geoid represented by the geoid undulation (N) at a given position. Different methods are used to build geoid models. Global models using terrestrial and satellite data are available to calculate the geoid heights as function of the earth potential (W). The most recent high degree and order models are EGM2008, Eigen05c, Eigen06c4, etc. (GFZ-Potsdam, 'List of available global models. , 2017). Some regional geoid models are available like the European Gravimetric Geoid (EGG97). These models mostly do not fit the local datum due to datum definition problems. Here, a group of precise height reference benchmarks measured with GNSS is used to fit the global models with the local vertical datum to define the local height reference system of Palestine. The accuracy of the different global geopotential models is evaluated before and after the application of the geoid fitting.

TI  - Satellite observations of sub-mesoscale vortex trains in the western boundary of the South China Sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study uses high resolution MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) satellite data to analyze sub-mesoscale ocean vortex trains (OVTs) in the western boundary of the South China Sea (SCS). Thirteen cases of vortex trains on the lee side of the Phu Quy Island were observed in the boreal summer from May to August of 2005 - 2010. The average diameter of the vortices is 28.1 +/- 13.8 km. The average spacing distance estimated between two consecutive vortices is 66.3 +/- 27.8 km. The dynamic parameters of a case observed on July 26, 2009 were extracted using a theoretical model. The aspect ratio is 2.8. The ratio of the propagation velocity of the vortex to the undisturbed flow velocity is 0.73. We use a nested high-resolution numerical model with the finest grid of 500 m, to analyze the dynamics of OVT induced by the local topography in the western SCS (WSCS). The results give a propagation velocity of vortex 0.49 of m s(-1) and a mean current velocity of undisturbed flow 0.58 m s(-1). Therefore, the ratio is 0.84. The shedding frequency is determined to be 1.14 x 10(-5) s(-1), corresponding to 1.02 day. The results also suggest that the sub-mesoscale cyclonic vortices along the OVT in the WSCS are characterized by low temperature and high Rossby number. The strong vertical vorticity and associated horizontal velocity shear of an individual vortex brings uplifted cold water on its leading side and warm water on its trailing side, which could drive an enhanced vertical exchange between the surface and oceanic interior.

TI  - Comparison of split window algorithms to derive land surface temperature from satellite TIRS data
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data can be used as the basis for meteorological data. Due to the limitations of meteorological stations on the Earth, derivation of land surface temperature is one of the most important aspects of the remote sensing application in climatology studies. In the present study, Landsat-8 thermal infrared sensor data of the scene located over Khuzestan province with row/path of 165/38 were used to derive land surface temperature (LST). Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), fraction of vegetation cover, satellite brightness temperature, and land surface emissivity were calculated as the vital criteria to derive LSTs using the split window algorithms. LST determination was performed by nine different split window algorithms. Eventually, LST products were evaluated using ground-based measurements at the meteorological stations of the study area. The results showed that algorithm of Coll and Casselles had a highest accuracy with RMSE 1.97 degrees C, and Vidal's method presented the lowest accuracy to derive LST with RMSE 4.11 degrees C. According to the results, regions with high density of vegetation and water resources have lowest diurnal temperature and regions with bare soils and low density of vegetation have a highest diurnal temperature. Results of the study indicated that LST algorithm accuracy is an important factor in the environmental and climate change studies.

TI  - A two-step framework for reconstructing remotely sensed land surface temperatures contaminated by cloud
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is one of the most important parameters in land surface processes. Although satellite-derived LST can provide valuable information, the value is often limited by cloud contamination. In this paper, a two-step satellite-derived LST reconstruction framework is proposed. First, a multi-temporal reconstruction algorithm is introduced to recover invalid LST values using multiple LST images with reference to corresponding remotely sensed vegetation index. Then, all cloud contaminated areas are temporally filled with hypothetical clear-sky LST values. Second, a surface energy balance equation-based procedure is used to correct for the filled values. With shortwave irradiation data, the clear-sky LST is corrected to the real LST under cloudy conditions. A series of experiments have been performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed approach. Quantitative evaluation results indicate that the proposed method can recover LST in different surface types with mean average errors in 3-6K. The experiments also indicate that the time interval between the multi-temporal LST images has a greater impact on the results than the size of the contaminated area.

TI  - Ongoing quiescence in the Borborema Plateau Plague focus (Paraiba, Brazil)
T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Plague is a zoonosis caused by Yersinia pestis, whose cycle is based on a reservoir system composed of mammals and their fleas. Its transmission cycle presents long enzootic periods with undetected cases, sometimes misleading that the cycle is extinct. While surveillance activities in Brazil are being carried out only in some focal areas, the serologic results confirm the persistence of Y. pestis in all monitored areas. We studied the small mammal assembly and Y. pestis presence in the Borborema Plateau Focus within the state of Paraiba, which staged the last Brazilian plague outbreak (1986-1987), through an inventory and Y. pestis detection survey of small mammals in peridomestic and sylvatic areas from two municipalities in the state of Paraiba. The field sampling captured 45 specimens (27 marsupials, 18 rodents), of 10 species. Only two species (one marsupial, one rodent) were captured in both peridomestic and sylvatic ecotopes. The sylvatic ecotope had higher richness and abundance. No evidence of circulation of the pathogen was detected, however, this result does not discard the necessity of continuous epidemiological surveillance due to the risk of rekindling the foci after long dormant periods, especially given the current epidemiological transition occurring on a Global scale.

TI  - Laparoscopy in endometrial cancer
T2  - REVISTA PERUANA DE GINECOLOGIA Y OBSTETRICIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Surgical staging is essential in the management of patients with endometrial cancer apparently confined to the uterus. Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) with its conventional laparoscopic approach or more recently with laparoscopic-assisted robotics has become the standard of management with advantage in terms of blood loss, hospital stay and quality of life compared to laparotomy. The pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy as part of the surgical staging is determinant of the prognosis and sets the pattern of adjuvant treatment and although it is still controversial in terms of its therapeutic value, it is feasible through MIS. The performance of the sentinel lymph node with lower intraoperative complications and postoperative morbidity can be considered as an alternative to lymphadenectomy, especially considering the additional value of detecting low volume metastatic lymph node disease by means of immunohistochemistry.

TI  - FORAGE - An online system for generating and delivering property-scale decision support information for grazing land and environmental management
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Queensland grazing industries operate in one of the world's most variable climates and face enormous challenges to achieve profitability and sustainability. To assist grazing enterprises, the Queensland Government has developed an operational online information system - FORAGE, to facilitate best management practice for grazing land. The FORAGE system provides land managers with property-scale information relating to rainfall, ground cover, soil erodibility, land types, tree density, seasonal climate outlooks and pasture growth simulated using the GRASP grazing system model. This information is site-specific and tailored to facilitate on-ground management decisions common to Queensland grazing enterprises. The FORAGE system makes complex remotely-sensed data, information from a range of databases and pasture growth models more accessible and relevant to land managers. This paper describes the structure, resources (e.g. software, databases and models), information generating processes, delivery mechanisms and information products of the FORAGE system.

TI  - An analysis of the characteristics of crustal magnetic anomaly in China based on CHAMP satellite data
T2  - GEODESY AND GEODYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the observation data of CHAMP satellite from 2006 to 2009, a 2D crustal magnetic anomaly model in China is established to study the distribution characteristics of crustal magnetic anomaly. In this paper, the 2D anomaly model is derived from the Legendre polynomial expansion of harmonic term N = 6 - 50. The result shows that many elaborate structures reflected in magnetic anomaly map well correspond to the geologic structures in China and its adjacent area. The magnetic anomaly at low satellite height behaves complexly, which is mainly caused by the magnetic disturbance of shallow rocks. In contrast, the magnetic field isolines at high satellite height are relatively sparse and only magnetic anomalies of deep crust are reflected. This fact implies that the 2D model of crustal magnetic anomaly provides an important method of the space prolongation of geomagnetic field, and is of theoretical and practice importance in geologic structure analysis and geophysical prospecting.

TI  - Effective water surface mapping in macrophyte-covered reservoirs in NE Brazil based on TerraSAR-X time series
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Water supplies in northeastern Brazil strongly depend on the numerous surface water reservoirs of various sizes there. However, the seasonal and long-term water surface dynamics of these reservoirs, particularly the large number of small ones, remain inadequately known. Remote sensing techniques have shown great potentials in water bodies mapping. Yet, the widespread presence of macrophytes in most of the reservoirs often impedes the delineation of the effective water surfaces. Knowledge of the dynamics of the effective water surfaces in the reservoirs is essential for understanding, managing, and modelling the local and regional water resources.In this study, a two-year time series of TerraSAR-X (TSX) satellite data was used to monitor the effective water surface areas in nine reservoirs in NE Brazil. Calm open water surfaces were obtained by segmenting the backscattering coefficients of TSX images with minimum error thresholding. Linear unmixing was implemented on the distributions of gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) variance in the reservoirs to quantify the proportions of sub-populations dominated by different types of scattering along the TSX time series. By referring to the statistics and the seasonal proportions of the GLCM variance sub-populations the GLCM variance was segmented to map the vegetated water surfaces. The effective water surface areas that include the vegetation covered waters as well as calm open water in the reservoirs were mapped with accuracies > 77%. The temporal and spatial change patterns of water surfaces in the nine reservoirs over a period of two consecutive dry and wet seasons were derived. Precipitation-related soil moisture changes, topography and the dense macrophyte canopies are the main sources of errors in the such-derived effective water surfaces. Independent from in-situ data, the approach employed in this study shows great potential in monitoring water surfaces of different complexity and macrophyte coverage. The effective water surface areas obtained for the reservoirs can provide valuable input for efficient water management and improve the hydrological modelling in this region.

TI  - A survey of current surgical treatment of early stage breast cancer in China.
T2  - Oncoscience
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The purpose of this national survey is to explore the patterns of surgical management for early stage breast cancer patients in China. A paper questionnaire survey was sent to the representatives from 520 hospitals who attended an international symposium in Guangzhou, China, 2014. The questionnaire included demographic information, initials and most preferred approaches for breast cancer surgery. The results were presented descriptively. The response rate was 42.5%. Only 7% of hospitals with >50% rate of breast conserving surgery (BCS). Intraoperative frozen sections and additional cavity margins assessment were used at 88% and 30.9% of hospitals, respectively. For invasive carcinoma, 15% of participants defined an adequate margin as no tumor cells on the ink. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was routinely performed in 93.2% of hospitals. Only 16.6% of hospitals would embrace the conclusions of the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z0011 study and omit axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for patients who fit the Z0011 criteria. The current patterns for the management of breast cancer patients are still lagging behind. Chinese doctors need to catch up with the updated results of the cutting-edge clinical studies and multiple measures are in need to improve this situation.

TI  - Investigating slow-moving landslides in the Zhouqu region of China using InSAR time series
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Zhouqu region (Gansu, China), landslide distribution and activity exploits geological weaknesses in the fault-controlled belt of low-grade metamorphic rocks of the Bailong valley and severely impacts lives and livelihoods in this region. Landslides reactivated by the Wenchuan 2008 earthquake and debris flows triggered by rainfall, such as the 2010 Zhouqu debris flow, have caused more than 1700 casualties and estimated economic losses of some US$0.4 billion. Earthflows presently cover some 79% of the total landslide area and have exerted a strong influence on landscape dynamics and evolution in this region. In this study, we use multi-temporal Advanced Land Observing Satellite and Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (ALOS PALSAR) data and time series interferometric synthetic aperture radar to investigate slow-moving landslides in a mountainous region with steep topography for the period December 2007-August 2010 using the Small Baseline Subsets (SBAS) technique. This enabled the identification of 11 active earthflows, 19 active landslides with deformation rates exceeding 100 mm/year and 20 new instabilities added into the pre-existing landslide inventory map. The activity of these earthflows and landslides exhibits seasonal variations and accelerated deformation following the Wenchuan earthquake. Time series analysis of the Suoertou earthflow reveals that seasonal velocity changes are characterized by comparatively rapid acceleration and gradual deceleration with distinct kinematic zones with different mean velocities, although velocity changes appear to occur synchronously along the landslide body over seasonal timescales. The observations suggest that the post-seismic effects (acceleration period) on landslide deformation last some 6-7 months.

TI  - Observed Propagation Route of VLF Transmitter Signals in the Magnetosphere
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Signals of powerful ground transmitters at various places have been detected by satellites in near-Earth space. The study on propagation mode, ducted or nonducted, has attracted much attentions for several decades. Based on the statistical results from Van Allen Probes (data from October 2012 to March 2017) and DEMETER satellite (from January 2006 to December 2007), we present the ground transmitter signals distributed clearly in ionosphere and magnetosphere. The observed propagation route in the meridian plane in the magnetosphere for each of various transmitters from the combination of DEMETER and Van Allen Probes data in nighttime is revealed for the first time. We use realistic ray tracing simulation and compare simulation results against Van Allen Probes and DEMETER observation. By comparison we demonstrate that the observed propagation route, with partial deviation from the field lines corresponding to ground stations, provides direct and clear statistical evidence that the nonducted propagation mode plays a main role, although with partial contribution from ducted propagation. The propagation characteristics of VLF transmitter signals in the magnetosphere are critical for quantitatively assessing their contribution to energetic electron loss in radiation belts.Plain Language Summary The topic on signal propagation of ground-based VLF transmitter in ionosphere and magnetosphere has attracted much attention in several decades. But the question about the propagation mode (ducted or nonducted) has not been answered definitely due to lacks of direct support from statistical satellite data. In this paper, the observed propagation route in the meridian plane in the magentosphere for each of various transmitter from the combination of DEMETER and Van Allen Probes data is revealed for the first time. Based on satellite observation and ray tracing simulation, we provide a clear and strong proof that the nonducted mode of transmitter signal plays a main role. The determination of the propagation mode will play a significant role in many fields, including the wave propagation model development and electron population adjustment as radiation belt remediation, which aims at lowering the damage of relativistic particles to the spacecraft and astronaut.

TI  - A New Vegetation Index Based on Multitemporal Sentinel-2 Images for Discriminating Heavy Metal Stress Levels in Rice
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Heavy metal stress in crops is a worldwide problem that requires accurate and timely monitoring. This study aimed to improve the accuracy of monitoring heavy metal stress levels in rice by using multiple Sentinel-2 images. The selected study areas are in Zhuzhou City, Hunan Province, China. Six Sentinel-2 images were acquired in 2017, and heavy metal concentrations in soil were measured. A novel vegetation index called heavy metal stress sensitive index (HMSSI) was proposed. HMSSI is the ratio between two red-edge spectral indices, namely the red-edge chlorophyll index (CIred-edge) and the plant senescence reflectance index (PSRI). To demonstrate the capability of HMSSI, the performances of CIred-edge and PSRI in discriminating heavy metal stress levels were compared with that of HMSSI at different growth stages. Random forest (RF) was used to establish a multitemporal monitoring model to detect heavy metal stress levels in rice based on HMSSI at different growth stages. Results show that HMSSI is more sensitive to heavy metal stress than CIred-edge and PSRI at different growth stages. The performance of a multitemporal monitoring model combining the whole growth stage images was better than any other single growth stage in distinguishing heavy metal stress levels. Therefore, HMSSI can be regarded as an indicator for monitoring heavy metal stress levels with a multitemporal monitoring model.

TI  - Annual Glacier-Wide Mass Balance (2000-2016) of the Interior Tibetan Plateau Reconstructed from MODIS Albedo Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) play a crucial role in regulating agriculture irrigation, river discharge and the regional/global climate system. However, mass balance records of TP glaciers have remained scarce due to challenging mountainous terrain and harsh weather conditions, which limits our understanding of the influence of melting glaciers on local water resources and responses to climate change. Here, we present and assess an albedo-based method to derive annual mass balance for three glaciers in the interior TP from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) albedo data during 2000-2016. A strong linear correlation (R-2 = 0.941, P < 0.001) is found between annual minimum-averaged glacier-wide albedo (AMGA) values and annual mass balance measurements on the Xiao Dongkemadi glacier. Furthermore, the 17-year-long annual mass balance series of the Xiao Dongkemadi glacier and the Geladandong mountain region glaciers, and the Purogangri ice cap are reconstructed for the first time, with a mass loss rate of 535 +/- 63 mm w.e.a(-1), 243 +/- 66 mm w.e.a(-1) and 113 +/- 68 mm w.e.a(-1), respectively. The results are verified by geodetic estimates, with relative error ranging from 4.55% to 11.80%, confirming that the albedo-based method can be used to estimate specific mass budgets for interior TP glaciers. A strong correlation between the mass balance series and air temperature infers that increasing summer air temperature may be one of main reasons for glacier shrinkage of the three studied glaciers.

TI  - Landslide Identification and Monitoring along the Jinsha River Catchment (Wudongde Reservoir Area), China, Using the InSAR Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslide identification and monitoring are two significant research aspects for landslide analysis. In addition, landslide mode deduction is key for the prevention of landslide hazards. Surface deformation results with different scales can serve for different landslide analysis. L-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data calculated with Interferometric Point Target Analysis (IPTA) are first employed to detect potential landslides at the catchment-scale Wudongde reservoir area. Twenty-two active landslides are identified and mapped over more than 2500 square kilometers. Then, for one typical landslide, Jinpingzi landslide, its spatiotemporal deformation characteristics are analyzed with the small baseline subsets (SBAS) interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technique. High-precision surface deformation results are obtained by comparing with in-situ georobot measurements. The spatial deformation pattern reveals the different stabilities among five different sections of Jinpingzi landslide. InSAR results for Section II of Jinpingzi landslide show that this active landslide is controlled by two boundaries and geological structure, and its different landslide deformation magnitudes at different sections on the surface companying with borehole deformation reveals the pull-type landslide mode. Correlation between time series landslide motion and monthly precipitation, soil moisture inverted from SAR intensity images and water level fluctuations suggests that heavy rainfall is the main trigger factor, and the maximum deformation of the landslide was highly consistent with the peak precipitation with a time lag of about 1 to 2 months, which gives us important guidelines to mitigate and prevent this kind of hazard.

TI  - Detection flying aircraft from Landsat 8 OLI data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring flying aircraft from satellite data is important for evaluating the climate impact caused by the global aviation industry. However, due to the small size of aircraft and the complex surface types, it is almost impossible to identify aircraft from satellite data with moderate resolution, e.g. 30 m. In this study, the 1.38 mu m water vapor absorption channel, often used for cirrus cloud or ash detection, is for the first time used to monitor flying aircraft from Landsat 8 data. The basic theory behind the detection of flying aircraft is that in the 1.38 mu m channel most of the background reflectance between the ground and the aircraft is masked due to the strong water vapor absorption, while the signal of the flying aircraft will be attenuated less due to the low water vapor content between the satellite and the aircraft. A new composition of the Laplacian and Sobel operators for segmenting aircraft and other features were used to identify the flying aircraft. The Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) 2.1 mu m channel was used to make the method succeed under low vapor content. The accuracy assessment based on 65 Landsat 8 images indicated that the percentage of leakage is 3.18% and the percentage of false alarm is 0.532%.

TI  - The Spatial Patterns of Land Surface Temperature and Its Impact Factors: Spatial Non-Stationarity and Scale Effects Based on a Geographically-Weighted Regression Model
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the spatial distribution of land surface temperature (LST) and its impact factors is crucial for mitigating urban heat island effect. However, few studies have quantitatively investigated the spatial non-stationarity and spatial scale effects of the relationships between LST and its impact factors at multi-scales. The main purposes of this study are as follows: (1) to estimate the spatial distributions of urban heat island (UHI) intensity by using hot spots analysis and (2) to explore the spatial non-stationarity and scale effects of the relationships between LST and related impact factors at multiple resolutions (30-1200 m) and to find appropriate scales for illuminating the relationships in a plain city. Based on the LST retrieved from Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS images, the Geographically-Weighted Regression (GWR) model is used to explore the scale effects of the relationships in Zhengzhou City between LST and six driving indicators: The Fractional Vegetation Cover (FVC), the Impervious Surface (IS), the Population Density (PD), the Fossil-fuel CO2 Emission data (FFCOE), the Shannon Diversity Index (SHDI) and the Perimeter-area Fractal Dimension (PAFRAC), which indicate the vegetation abundance, built-up, social-ecological variables and the diversity and shape complexity of land cover types. Our findings showed that the spatial patterns of LST show statistically significant hot spot zones in the center of the study area, partly extending to the western and southern industrial areas, indicating that the intensity of the urban heat island is significantly spatial clustering in Zhengzhou City. In addition, compared with the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) model, the GWR model has a better ability to characterize spatial non-stationarity and analyze the relationships between the LST and its impact factors by considering the space-varying relationships of different variables, especially at the fine spatial scales (30-480 m). However, the strength of GWR model has become relatively weak with the increase of spatial scales (720-1200 m). This reveals that the GWR model is recommended to be applied in the analysis of UHI problems and related impact factors at scales finer than 480 m in the plain city. If the spatial scale is coarser than 720 m, both OLS and GWR models are suitable for illustrating the correct relationships between UHI effect and its influence factors in the plain city due to their undifferentiated performance. These findings can provide valuable information for urban planners and researchers to select appropriate models and spatial scales seeking to mitigate urban thermal environment effect.

TI  - Fatty acid based phosphite ionic liquids as multifunctional lubricant additives in mineral oil and refined vegetable oil
T2  - TRIBOLOGY INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Ionic liquids (ILs) are highly attractive lubricant additives for their nonflammability, low vapor pressures, structural diversity and reasonable tribological properties. A convenient synthesis route to oil-dispersible ILs has been presented in this paper. Phosphite binds to aliphatic acid as anion and triethylbenzylammonium serve as a cation, which could be applied as lubricant additives in mineral oil (5CST) and refined vegetable oil (RSO). Results demonstrated that these ILs could effectively enhance the antiwear, friction-reducing and extreme pressure properties of 5CST and RSO. The chain length and unsaturation of fatty acid is significant in improving the tribological properties of base oil. TEY and FY mode K-edge XANES analysis of the formed tribofllms showed that the improvement of anti-wear and friction-reducing properties was closely related to the content of phosphate species on the near surface.

The traditional approach is to verify each satellite individually. It is difficult to directly compare the difference in their accuracy. In order to evaluate geometric accuracy for multiple satellite images based on the same ground control benchmark, a reliable test field in Xianning (China) was utilized for geometric accuracy validation of HRSIs. Our research team has obtained multiple HRSIs in the Xianning test field, such as SPOT-6, Pleaides, ALOS, ZY-3 and TH-1. In addition, ground control points (GCPs) were acquired with GPS by field surveying, which were used to select the significant feature area on the images. We assess the orientation accuracy of the HRSIs with the single image and stereo models. Within this study, the geometrical performance of multiple HRSIs was analyzed in detail, and the results of orientation are shown and discussed. As a result, it is feasible and necessary to establish such a geometric verification field to evaluate the geometric quality of multiple HRSIs.

TI  - CONTRAST-ENHANCED ULTRASOUND-GUIDED FINE-NEEDLE ASPIRATION FOR SENTINEL LYMPH NODE BIOPSY IN EARLY-STAGE BREAST CANCER
T2  - ULTRASOUND IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess whether translymphatic contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) combined with fine-needle aspiration (FNA) can be used pre-operativcly to assess the status of axillary lymph oodes in early-stage breast cancer patients. Furthermore, we wanted to determine whether this less invasive method could potentially be a pre-operative surgical strategy. One hundred sixty-four sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) were detected by CEUS after intradermal injection of microbubbles in 126 cases. One hundred twenty of 126 cases (95.24%) were accurately diagnosed with the SLN-FNA method. All 6 false-negative cases were due to micrometastasis or macrometastasis. There were no false-positive results after CEUS-guided FNA biopsy based on post-operative histopathologicul results. In conclusion, translymphatic CEUS combined with SLN-FNA is a less traumatic approach that has high accuracy in the pre-operative evaluation of axillary lymph node status. It might have the potential to be as reliable an indicator for axillary lymph node dissection as SLN biopsy. (c) 2018 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology. All rights reserved.

TI  - Remote sensing of the urban heat island effect in a highly populated urban agglomeration area in East China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasingly urban agglomeration, representing a group of cities with a compact spatial organization and close economic links, can rise surface temperature in a continuous area due to decreasing distance between cities. Significant progress has been made in elucidating surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII) of a single city or a few big cities, but the SUHII's patterns remain poorly understood in urban agglomeration regions. Using Aqua/Terra MODIS data over 2010-2015, we examined the SUHII variations and their drivers in Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomeration (YRDUA) of east China. Instead of using the widely-used suburban/rural areas as references, this study predicted the unaffected reference temperature wall-to-wall from natural forests by a simple planar surface model. Results indicated that urbanization warmed the land surface regardless of urban area size in YRDUA, with the SUHII clearly larger in the day (2.6 +/- 0.9 degrees C) than night (0.7 +/- 0.4 degrees C). The SUHII varied markedly by cities, yet the largest did not happen in the presumed core cities. Also, the SUHII differed greatly in a seasonal cycle, with summer-winter difference of 4.2 +/- 0.9 degrees C and 2.0 +/- 0.5 degrees C in the day and night, respectively. Particularly, cooling effects of urban areas were observed in winter for the majority of cities at night. These spatiotemporal patterns depend strongly on the background climate (precipitation and air temperature), vegetation activity, surface albedo, and population density, with contrast mechanisms during the day and night. Further, we showed that ignoring urban agglomeration effect (using suburban/rural areas as the unaffected references) would lead to large biases of SUHII estimates in terms of magnitude and spatial distribution. Our results emphasize the necessity of considering cities altogether when assessing the urbanization effects on climate in an urban agglomeration area. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Four Decades of Estuarine Wetland Changes in the Yellow River Delta Based on Landsat Observations Between 1973 and 2013
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Yellow River Delta wetlands are essential for the migration of endangered birds and breeding. The wetlands, however, have been severely damaged during recent decades, partly due to the lack of wetland ecosystem protection by authorities. To have a better historical understanding of the spatio-temporal dynamics of the wetlands, this study aims to map and characterize patterns of the loss and degradation of wetlands in the Yellow River Delta using a time series of remotely sensed images (at nine points in time) based on object-based image analysis and knowledge transfer learning technology. Spatio-temporal analysis was conducted to document the long-term changes taking place in different wetlands over the four decades. The results showed that the Yellow River Delta wetlands have experienced significant changes between 1973 and 2013. The total area of wetlands has been reduced by 683.12 km(2) during the overall period and the trend of loss continues. However, the rates and trends of change for the different types of wetlands were not the same. The natural wetlands showed a statistically significant decrease in area during the overall period (36.04 km(2) year(-1)). Meanwhile, the artificial wetlands had the opposite trend and showed a statistically significant increase in area during the past four decades (18.96 km(2) year(-1)). According to the change characteristics revealed by the time series wetland classification maps, the evolution process of the Yellow River Delta wetlands could be divided into three stages: (1) From 1973-1984, basically stable, but with little increase; (2) from 1984-1995, rapid loss; and (3) from 1995-2013, slow loss. The area of the wetlands reached a low point around 1995, and then with a little improvement, the regional wetlands entered a slow loss stage. It is believed that interference by human activities (e.g., urban construction, cropland creation, and oil exploitation) was the main reason for wetland degradation in the Yellow River Delta over the past four decades. Climate change also has long-term impacts on regional wetlands. In addition, due to the special geographical environment, the hydrological and sediment conditions and the location of the Yellow River mouth also have a significant influence on the evolution process of the wetlands.

TI  - Retrieval of leaf area index of <i>Phyllostachys praecox</i> forest based on MODIS reflectance time series data
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the MODIS surface reflectance data, five vegetation indices, including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), simple ratio index (SR), Gitelson green index (GI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) were constructed as remote sensing variables, coupled with the seven original spectral reflectance bands of MODIS. Stepwise regression and correlation analysis were used to select the variables, and the stepwise regression and Back Propagation (BP) neural network models were constructed based on the measured LAI to retrieve the LAI time series data of Phyllostachys praecox (Lei bamboo) forest during the period from January 2014 to March 2017. The retrieval results were compared with MOD15A2 LAI products during the same period. The results showed that SR was the single variable selected for the stepwise regression model. The correlations of LAI with bands b(1), b(2), b(3), b(7) and five vegetation indices were significant, which could be used as input variables of BP neural network model. There was a significant correlation between the LAI estimated from BP neural network and measured LAI, with the R-2 of 0.71, RMSE of 0.34, and RMSEr of 13.6%. R-2 was increased by 10.9%, RMSE decreased by 5.6%, and RMSEr decreased by 12.3% compared with LAI estimated from stepwise regression method. R-2 was increased by 54.5%, RMSE decreased by 79.3%, and RMSE, decreased by 79.1% compared with MODIS LAI. The LAI of Lei bamboo forest could be accurately retrieved using BP neural network method based on MODIS reflectance time series data, which would be a feasible method for rapid monitoring of LAI in Lei bamboo forest.

TI  - An Efficient and Effective Approach for Georeferencing AVHRR and GaoFen-1 Imageries Using Inland Water Bodies
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - National Oceanography and Atmosphere Administration's Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) (1970s-present, similar to 1 km) and China's GaoFen-1 (GF-1) image series (2013-present, similar to 16 m), can both provide extremely useful information of land use and land cover, due to the long history and, wide scanning width of AVHRR and the high resolution of GF-1. However, both data sets have apparent weaknesses of large and inconsistent geometric and geolocation errors (AVHRR: 1-20 pixels, GF-1: 1-10 pixels), prohibiting them from many interdisciplinary applications. This paper, based on feature point detection method, presents a new approach to improve the georeferencing of AVHRR and GF-1 data using inland water bodies. No need of a prior knowledge of the error source and only based on the image information and the base map, this method is able to automatically search and find the optimal water threshold value (reflectance), conduct feature point detecting and matching, and perform affine transformation. In the case study of the Tibetan Plateau, water body (i.e., lake) with its lower reflectance and relatively stable location and shape, is used as the referencingmask (i.e., basemap) for detecting feature point pairs. The accuracy of the geometric correction is found within subpixel level, with average RMSE = 0.76 for AVHRR and RMSE = 0.91 for GF-1. The developed georeferencing method can be potentially applied to other less accessible areas that are difficult to derive ground control points for numerous applications with improved location and geometric accuracies.

TI  - Understanding the Influence of Crop Residue Burning on PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> Concentrations in China from 2013 to 2017 Using MODIS Data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, particulate matter (PM) pollution has increasingly affected public life and health. Therefore, crop residue burning, as a significant source of PM pollution in China, should be effectively controlled. This study attempts to understand variations and characteristics of PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations and discuss correlations between the variation of PM concentrations and crop residue burning using ground observation and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. The results revealed that the overall PM concentration in China from 2013 to 2017 was in a downward tendency with regional variations. Correlation analysis demonstrated that the PM10 concentration was more closely related to crop residue burning than the PM2.5 concentration. From a spatial perspective, the strongest correlation between PM concentration and crop residue burning existed in Northeast China (NEC). From a temporal perspective, the strongest correlation usually appeared in autumn for most regions. The total amount of crop residue burning spots in autumn was relatively large, and NEC was the region with the most intense crop residue burning in China. We compared the correlation between PM concentrations and crop residue burning at inter-annual and seasonal scales, and during burning-concentrated periods. We found that correlations between PM concentrations and crop residue burning increased significantly with the narrowing temporal scales and was the strongest during burning-concentrated periods, indicating that intense crop residue burning leads to instant deterioration of PM concentrations. The methodology and findings from this study provide meaningful reference for better understanding the influence of crop residue burning on PM pollution across China.

TI  - Red operculum spots, body size, maturation and evidence for a satellite male phenotype in non-native European populations of pumpkinseed <i>Lepomis gibbosus</i>
T2  - ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH
M3  - Article
AB  - Carotenoid-based pigmentation is a striking feature of many taxa, yet the function, if any, of colour traits is often unclear. Pumpkinseed Lepomis gibbosus, a widely introduced freshwater sunfish that exhibits alternative male mating strategies, express a striking, red operculum spot. To investigate the potential function of this red spot as a signal in this species' mating system, we determined the presence and measured the size of red operculum spots in fish collected from 12 populations in five European countries in which pumpkinseed is an established non-native species. We subsequently related the presence and size of the red spot to body size and mating strategy, based on an analysis of relative gonad size (gonado-somatic index, GSI), using a mixed modelling approach. The study demonstrated that the presence of a red operculum spot in pumpkinseed is associated with sexual maturation, with GSI frequency distributions suggesting that cuckolders in some non-native populations comprised both sneaker and satellite males, the latter not having previously been reported for this species. Further, the size of red spot correlated strongly with body size in parental and cuckolder males, although there was no difference in the presence or size of the red operculum spot between male mating strategies. The function of a red operculum spot in females is not clear but may be partly mediated by pleiotropic genetic mechanisms. Red operculum spots appear to function as signals of male maturation and body size in pumpkinseed, irrespective of mating strategy.

TI  - Trends in Livestock Numbers and Spectral Properties of the Pasture Surface: Case Study of the Middle Gobi <i>Aimag</i> of Mongolia
T2  - ARID ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper analyzes linear correlations between MODIS parameters, i.e., the albedo, surface temperature, NDVI, and evapotranspiration, and with annual livestock numbers on Mongolian pastures for June-August throughout 2000-2015. The degree of association between the annual livestock density and average spectral properties of pastures were determined at the level of the whole country, region (aimag), and district (sum). Linear trends were assessed in the annual livestock density and spectral properties of the pasture surface within the boundaries of the specified administrative units of Mongolia. The total density and density with consideration for a structure of the livestock population within the stated territories are weakly related to the average spectral parameters of the pasture surfaces for the territories. The exception is Gurvansaikhan district, in which the relationships are significant; an increase in livestock density increases the albedo, decreases NDVI, and eventually reduces the forage reserve. The R-2 coefficients of determination reveal insignificant linear trends in albedo, NDVI, and evapotranspiration as opposed to a significant positive trend in livestock density. A cooling trend and decreased precipitation was evident in 2000-2015. In the years of a sharp drop in livestock density (2000 and 2010), the spectral characteristics of pastures exhibit insignificant departures from the trend line, i.e. their sensitivity to a sharp drop in livestock numbers is minimal in the present situation.

TI  - MapReduce functions to remote sensing distributed data processingGlobal vegetation drought monitoring as example
T2  - SOFTWARE-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Global change models for different applications are developed, according to the principle of remote sensing technology. Data for these models are generally remote sensing image, which is multiplatform, multidimentional, multiband, and multisource. Moreover, such data may be in different parts of the world and perhaps up to terabyte or petabyte level. Therefore, a data-intensive computing problem in the global change has emerged. Distributed computing infrastructures are suitable to store large-scale datalike satellite images that have to be written only once and read frequently. The emergence of the cloud computing technology brings new information architecture, and global change models implemented in the cloud platform provide users with stable, effective, on-demand cloud computing services. In this paper, the experiment is carried out on the cloud framework based on open cloud computing platform-Hadoop. In addition, on this framework, it achieves a prototype example for monitoring global vegetation drought conditions. Oriented to a variety of remote sensing data, we propose an abstract data format to achieve the unified description of remote sensing data. The data abstraction is to discretize the multidimensional remote sensing data for easy-distributed storage and computation. Using MapReduce paradigm, the complexity of remote sensing algorithms is resolved. Experimental results show that based on the parallel programming method, good scalability changing with the amount of processed data in the Hadoop distributed environment.

TI  - Biological and climate factors co-regulated spatial-temporal dynamics of vegetation autumn phenology on the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is receiving mounting attentions from various fields and phenology is a commonly used indicator signaling vegetation responses to climate change. Previous phenology studies have mostly focused on vegetation greening-up and its climatic driving factors, while autumn phenology has been barely touched upon. In this study, vegetation phenological metrics were extracted from MODIS NDVI data and their temporal and spatial patterns were explored on the Tibetan Plateau (TP). The results showed that the start of season (SOS) has significantly earlier trend in the first decade, while the end of season (EOS) has slightly (not significant) earlier trend. In the spatial dimension, similar patterns were also identified. The SOS plays a more significant role in regulating vegetation growing season length than EOS does. The EOS and driving effects from each factor exhibited spatially heterogeneous patterns. Biological factor is the dominant factor regulating the spatial pattern of EOS, while climate factors control its inter-annual variation.

T2  - RUSSIAN METEOROLOGY AND HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Data of stratospheric ozone measurements with the AK-3 lidar over Obninsk in 2012-2015 are compared with Aura/MLS and Aura/OMI satellite data and parallel surface observations of total ozone (TO) with the Brewer spectrophotometer. The maximum difference in mean ozone concentration between the lidar and Aura/MLS data in the altitude range of 13 to 32 km does not exceed 0.2 x 10(12) mol./cm(3) (or the maximum of 9% at the altitude of 13 km). At the same time, Aura/OMI data have a positive bias of about 20% relative to lidar data in the range of 13 to 20 km that is associated with OMI measurement errors according to literature data. Total ozone values calculated from lidar measurements jointly with the known climatology data are compared with those measured with the Brewer spectrophotometer. It is demonstrated that the correlation between the results of measurements obtained by two methods is close to linear, and the mean relative difference in the overall measurement range does not exceed 5%.

TI  - Geospatial analysis of land use change in the Savannah River Basin using Google Earth Engine
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate and land use/cover change are among the most pervasive issues facing the Southeastern United States, including the Savannah River basin in South Carolina and Georgia. Land use directly affects the natural environment across the Savannah River basin and it is important to analyze these impacts. The objectives of this study are to: 1) determine the classes and the distribution of land cover in the Savannah River basin; 2) identify the spatial and the temporal change of the land cover that occurs as a consequence of land use change in the area; and 3) discuss the potential effects of land use change in the Savannah River basin. The land cover maps were produced using random forest supervised classification at four time periods for a total of thirteen common land cover classes with overall accuracy assessments of 79.18% (1999), 79.41% (2005), 76.04% (2009), and 76.11% (2015). The major land use change observed was due to the deforestation and reforestation of forest areas during the entire study period. The change detection results using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) indicated that the proportion areas of the deforestation were 5.93% (1999-2005), 4.63% (2005-2009), and 3.76% (2009-2015), while the proportion areas of the reforestation were 1.57% (1999-2005), 0.44% (2005-2009), and 1.53% (2009-2015). These results not only indicate land use change, but also demonstrate the advantage of utilizing Google Earth Engine and the public archive database in its platform to track and monitor this change over time.

TI  - Flooded area classification using pooled training samples: an example from the Chobe River Basin, Botswana
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In dryland systems, the flood pulse is the driving force in system dynamics but is highly variable in flow volume and landscape inundation features. Remote sensing can provide critical information fundamental to evaluating and forecasting flow behavior and population vulnerability; however, training and classifying an extensive time series of images is labor intensive, limiting the usefulness of these approaches in evaluating flood pulse dynamics and landscape interactions. Here, we provide an alternative approach that relies on only one set of "pooled" training samples for time series image classification and analysis. We test this approach by mapping the flood pulse in a time series of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) images from the Chobe River Basin of Botswana for the years 2014 to 2016. MODIS MOD09A1 images collected during the flooding season (February to July) were converted to Kauth-Thomas components, then sampled to form a training pool. Images were then classified using these pooled training samples. Results indicated that classification accuracies obtained using pooled training were statistically indistinguishable from classifications obtained from conventional training. Application of the method to another year's data (2013) also yielded comparably accurate results, suggesting that the training pool method remains robust when applied to image data other than that used to create the training pool.

TI  - Quantification of potential area of incursion of pine in oak forest in western Himalaya using fuzzy classification technique
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in the plant community composition due to biological invasion result in extensive changes to the ecosystem structure and functioning. Encroachment of Chir pine (Pinus roxburghii) in Banj oak (Quercus leucotrichophora) habitats in the western Himalaya is a well-established phenomenon and in due course eliminates the latter completely. Monitoring the impact of Chir pine incursion into Banj oak habitats is important for conservation and management of the oak ecosystems in western Himalaya. A remote-sensing-based classification method has been developed to precisely map and measure the potentially invaded forest areas in part of the western Himalaya. Timely identification of location and extent of invaded pine areas provides the opportunity to control the invasion. Temporal Landsat 8 OLI satellite data were used for temporal vegetation index database. Fuzzy-based, possibilistic C-means classifier is a soft classification technique used to identify the oak habitats and its coexistence with Chir pine. The outputs were validated using field data. A total of 33.16 +/- 10.01 km(2) was estimated as the mixed class showing coexistence of Banj oak and Chir pine. The overall accuracy was found to be 0.86 +/- 0.06 from the error matrix based on the estimated area proportion. In addition to providing a method for mapping coexistence of Banj oak and Chir pine, this study also provides information on the potential extent of the incursion of Chir pine in Banj oak forests in the western Himalaya. The critical information on potential area under invasion provides forest managers to take essential steps to minimize the incursion.

TI  - Impact of extreme drought and incentive programs on flooded agriculture and wetlands in California's Central Valley
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Between 2013 and 2015, a large part of the western United States, including the Central Valley of California, sustained an extreme drought. The Central Valley is recognized as a region of hemispheric importance for waterbirds, which use flooded agriculture and wetlands as habitat. Thus, the impact of drought on the distribution of surface water needed to be assessed to understand the effects on waterbird habitat availability.Methods: We used remote sensing data to quantify the impact of the recent extreme drought on the timing and extent of waterbird habitat during the non-breeding season (July-May) by examining open water in agriculture (rice, corn, and other crops) and managed wetlands across the Central Valley. We assessed the influence of habitat incentive programs, particularly The Nature Conservancy's BirdReturns and The Natural Resources Conservation Service's Waterbird Habitat Enhancement Program (WHEP), at offsetting habitat loss related to drought.Results: Overall, we found statistically significant declines in open water in post-harvest agriculture (45-80% declines) and in managed wetlands (39-60% declines) during the 2013-2015 drought compared to non-drought years during the period of 2000-2011. Crops associated with the San Joaquin Basin, specifically corn, as well as wetlands in that part of the Central Valley exhibited larger reductions in open water than rice and wetlands in the Sacramento Valley. Semi-permanent wetlands on protected lands had significantly lower (39-49%) open water in the drought years than those on non-protected lands while seasonal wetlands on protected lands had higher amounts of open water. A large fraction of the daily open water in rice during certain times of the year, particularly in the fall for BirdReturns (61%) and the winter for WHEP (100%), may have been provided through incentive programs which underscores the contribution of these programs. However, further assessment is needed to know how much the incentive programs directly offset the impact of drought in post-harvest rice by influencing water management or simply supplemented funding for activities that might have been done regardless.Discussion: Our landscape analysis documents the significant impacts of the recent extreme drought on freshwater wetland habitats in the Central Valley, the benefits of incentive programs, and the value of using satellite data to track surface water and waterbird habitats. More research is needed to understand subsequent impacts on the freshwater dependent species that rely on these systems and how incentive programs can most strategically support vulnerable species during future extreme drought.

TI  - Retained surgical sponges: a descriptive study of 319 occurrences and contributing factors from 2012 to 2017
T2  - PATIENT SAFETY IN SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Unintended retention of foreign bodies remain the most frequently reported sentinel events. Surgical sponges account for the majority of these retained items. The purpose of this study was to describe reports of unintentionally retained surgical sponges (RSS): the types of sponges, anatomic locations, accuracy of sponge counts, contributing factors, and harm, in order to make recommendations to improve perioperative safety.Methods: A retrospective review was undertaken of unintentionally RSS voluntarily reported to The Joint Commission Sentinel Event Database by healthcare facilities over a 5-year period (October 1, 2012-September 30, 2017). Event reports involving surgical sponges were reviewed for patients undergoing surgery, invasive procedures, or child birth.Results: A total of 319 events involving RSS were reported. Sponges were most frequently retained in the abdomen or pelvis (50.2%) and the vagina (23.9%). Events occurred in the Operating Room (64.1%), Labor and Delivery (32.7%) and other procedural areas (3.3%). Of the events reported, 318 involved 1 to 12 contributing factors totaling 1430 in 13 different categories, most frequently in human factors and leadership. In 69.6% of reports, the harm was an unexpected additional care or extended stay. Severe temporary harm was associated with 14.7% of the events. One patient died as a result of the retained sponge.Conclusions: Because of the complexity of perioperative patient care, the multitude of contributing factors that are difficult to control, and the potential benefit of radiofrequency sponge detection, we recommend that this technology be considered in areas where surgery is performed and in Labor and Delivery.

TI  - Causal Illusions in the Service of Political Attitudes in Spain and the United Kingdom
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The causal illusion is a cognitive bias that results in the perception of causality where there is no supporting evidence. We show that people selectively exhibit the bias, especially in those situations where it favors their current worldview as revealed by their political orientation. In our two experiments (one conducted in Spain and one conducted in the United Kingdom), participants who self-positioned themselves on the ideological left formed the illusion that a left-wing ruling party was more successful in improving city indicators than a right-wing party, while participants on the ideological right tended to show the opposite pattern. In sum, despite the fact that the same information was presented to all participants, people developed the causal illusion bias selectively, providing very different interpretations that aligned with their previous attitudes. This result occurs in situations where participants inspect the relationship between the government's actions and positive outcomes (improving city indicators) but not when the outcomes are negative (worsening city indicators).

TI  - Influence of Iron, Cobalt, and Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> Supply on Phytoplankton Growth in the Tropical East Pacific During the 2015 El Nino
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), and vitamin B-12 addition experiments were performed in the eastern Equatorial Pacific/Peruvian upwelling zone during the 2015 El Nino event. Near the Peruvian coastline, apparent photosystem II photochemical efficiencies (F-v/F-m) were unchanged by nutrient addition and chlorophyll a tripled in untreated controls over 2days, indicating nutrient replete conditions. Conversely, Fe amendment further away from the coastline in the high nitrate, low Fe zone significantly increased F-v/F-m and chlorophyll a concentrations. Mean chlorophyll a was further enhanced following supply of Fe+Co and Fe+B-12 relative to Fe alone, but this was not statistically significant; further offshore, reported Co depletion relative to Fe could enhance responses. The persistence of Fe limitation in this system under a developing El Nino, as previously demonstrated under non-El Nino conditions, suggests that diminished upwelled Fe is likely an important factor driving reductions in offshore phytoplankton productivity during these events.Plain Language Summary Phytoplankton productivity in the Equatorial Pacific is critical for curbing CO2 outgassing from upwelling waters and sustaining globally important fisheries. We tested which micronutrients were limiting phytoplankton growth in the Equatorial Pacific during the 2015 El Nino. To date evidence for nutrient limitation status during these events remains indirect. We show iron is limiting offshore of Peru and that cobalt or vitamin B-12 could be approaching limitation, with limitation by the latter micronutrients possibly becoming more important further offshore. Linked to satellite data, the new results shed light on critical controls on marine productivity in this biogeochemically/economically important region. Our results suggest reduced upwelled iron-predicted under El Nino conditions would be primarily responsible for observed offshore Peru productivity decreases.

TI  - Independent DEM of Antarctica Using GNSS-R Data From TechDemoSat-1
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The first digital elevation model (DEM) of the Antarctic ice sheet derived from Global Navigation Satellite Systems-Reflectometry (GNSS-R) data from the UK TechDemoSat-1 satellite is presented. This is obtained using 32months of data from the mission. This opportunistic and inexpensive method is shown to produce encouraging results from the technology demonstration platform of TechDemoSat-1, with median bias under 18m and root-mean-square difference under 91m when compared to the CryoSat-21-kmDEMv1.0. Discrepancies between the two data sets are explored along with possible causes of such differences and potential improvements to further optimize this technique for future GNSS-R missions.Plain Language Summary Obtaining measurements of the Antarctic ice sheet is critical for understanding the effects that climate change might be having on it and its potential future contribution to rising sea levels. The only practical way to do this is by using satellite data, and this has been done successfully previously from the CryoSat-2 satellite, which carries a radar altimeter. However, due to its orbit, it cannot measure an area near the South Pole. Here we demonstrate that measurements of the Antarctic ice sheet, including the vicinity of the South Pole, can be made by taking advantage of GPS signals that bounce off the ice sheet surface. The data are obtained from the UK's TechDemoSat-1 mission, which carries a simple low-cost receiver to pick up the reflected GPS signals. The results from this demonstration mission (which was not designed to survey ice sheets) are promising, showing the potential of this approach for measuring the ice sheet in the future with a dedicated satellite mission.

TI  - Immune System Dysregulation During Spaceflight: Potential Countermeasures for Deep Space Exploration Missions
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Recent studies have established that dysregulation of the human immune system and the reactivation of latent herpesviruses persists for the duration of a 6-month orbital spaceflight. It appears certain aspects of adaptive immunity are dysregulated during flight, yet some aspects of innate immunity are heightened. Interaction between adaptive and innate immunity also seems to be altered. Some crews experience persistent hypersensitivity reactions during flight. This phenomenon may, in synergy with extended duration and galactic radiation exposure, increase specific crew clinical risks during deep space exploration missions. The clinical challenge is based upon both the frequency of these phenomena in multiple crewmembers during low earth orbit missions and the inability to predict which specific individual crewmembers will experience these changes. Thus, a general countermeasure approach that offers the broadest possible coverage is needed. The vehicles, architecture, and mission profiles to enable such voyages are now under development. These include deployment and use of a cis-Lunar station (mid 2020s) with possible Moon surface operations, to be followed by multiple Mars flyby missions, and eventual human Mars surface exploration. Current ISS studies will continue to characterize physiological dysregulation associated with prolonged orbital spaceflight. However, sufficient information exists to begin consideration of both the need for, and nature of, specific immune countermeasures to ensure astronaut health. This article will review relevant in-place operational countermeasures onboard ISS and discuss a myriad of potential immune countermeasures for exploration missions. Discussion points include nutritional supplementation and functional foods, exercise and immunity, pharmacological options, the relationship between bone and immune countermeasures, and vaccination to mitigate herpes (and possibly other) virus risks. As the immune system has sentinel connectivity within every other physiological system, translational effects must be considered for all potential immune countermeasures. Finally, we shall discuss immune countermeasures in the context of their individualized implementation or precision medicine, based on crewmember specific immunological biases.

TI  - Water stable isotope spatio-temporal variability in Antarctica in 1960-2013: observations and simulations from the ECHAM5-wiso atmospheric general circulation model
T2  - CLIMATE OF THE PAST
M3  - Article
AB  - Polar ice core water isotope records are commonly used to infer past changes in Antarctic temperature, motivating an improved understanding and quantification of the temporal relationship between delta O-18 and temperature. This can be achieved using simulations performed by atmospheric general circulation models equipped with water stable isotopes. Here, we evaluate the skills of the high-resolution water-isotope-enabled atmospheric general circulation model ECHAM5-wiso (the European Centre Hamburg Model) nudged to European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis using simulations covering the period 1960-2013 over the Antarctic continent.We compare model outputs with field data, first with a focus on regional climate variables and second on water stable isotopes, using our updated dataset of water stable isotope measurements from precipitation, snow, and firn-ice core samples. ECHAM5-wiso simulates a large increase in temperature from 1978 to 1979, possibly caused by a discontinuity in the European Reanalyses (ERA) linked to the assimilation of remote sensing data starting in 1979.Although some model-data mismatches are observed, the (precipitation minus evaporation) outputs are found to be realistic products for surface mass balance. A warm model bias over central East Antarctica and a cold model bias over coastal regions explain first-order delta O-18 model biases by too-strong isotopic depletion on coastal areas and underestimated depletion inland. At the second order, despite these biases, ECHAM5-wiso correctly captures the observed spatial patterns of deuterium excess. The results of model-data comparisons for the inter-annual delta O-18 standard deviation differ when using precipitation or ice core data. Further studies should explore the importance of deposition and post-deposition processes affecting ice core signals and not resolved in the model.These results build trust in the use of ECHAM5-wiso outputs to investigate the spatial, seasonal, and inter-annual delta O-18-temperature relationships. We thus make the first Antarctica-wide synthesis of prior results. First, we show that local spatial or seasonal slopes are not a correct surrogate for inter-annual temporal slopes, leading to the conclusion that the same isotope-temperature slope cannot be applied for the climatic interpretation of Antarctic ice core for all timescales. Finally, we explore the phasing between the seasonal cycles of deuterium excess and delta O-18 as a source of information on changes in moisture sources affecting the delta O-18-temperature relationship. The few available records and ECHAM5-wiso show different phase relationships in coastal, intermediate, and central regions.This work evaluates the use of the ECHAM5-wiso model as a tool for the investigation of water stable isotopes in Antarctic precipitation and calls for extended studies to improve our understanding of such proxies.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: The pharmacological effect derived from herb-herb interaction is important to constitute the prescription especially in traditional oriental medicine. The relationship of two medicinal herbs is called "couplet medicinals" which is used in pair for the purpose of enhancing the therapeutic effect, reducing the toxic effect or the adverse effect. The "Eighteen Incompatible Medicaments" constitute one of the contents in the incompatibility of traditional oriental drugs in a prescription. Among the "Eighteen Incompatible Medicaments", the roots and rhizomes of Veratrum nigrum (VN), is incompatible with the roots and rhizomes of Panax ginseng (PG). However, definite evidences of adverse effect by these combinations has yet to be reported.Materials and methods: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of ethanol extracts of PG, VN, and their combination (P + V) on the metastatic ability of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells using WST assay, flow cytometry, western blot analysis, real-time RT-PCR, immunofluorescence, migration assay, invasion assay, zy-mography, and an in vivo experiment with a lung-metastasis mouse model.Results: The PG extract decreased cell proliferation by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of CRC cells. In addition, PG inhibited metastatic abilities of CRC cells including Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition, migration, and invasion. Additionally, the PG extract suppressed lung metastasis of the CRC cells in the mouse model. However, the P + V extract exhibited weaker anti-proliferative and anti-metastatic effects than PG alone.Conclusion: Based on these results, the P + V couplet medicinal attenuates the anti-metastatic effects of PG, both in vitro and in vivo.

TI  - A New Magnetic Field Activity Proxy for Mars From MAVEN Data
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The identification of magnetically quiet or noisy observations is important for data selection in a wide range of studies, including crustal field modeling and investigations of the ionosphere. However this remains a challenge when studying the magnetic field of Mars, as no continuous magnetic activity index is available. Such indices are widely used for studies of Earth's magnetic field, and they are largely based on data from ground observatories. We suggest a martian magnetic activity proxy based on satellite data, from the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN spacecraft (MAVEN). MAVEN has been in orbit since November 2014, providing measurements of the magnetic field that extend those from the Mars Global Surveyor mission. The proxy uses the magnitude of the interplanetary magnetic field upstream of the bow shock and is motivated by the correlation of the interplanetary magnetic field amplitude with the nightside magnetic field at 150- to 600-km altitude, measured on the same MAVEN orbit. We demonstrate the utility of the proxy, by producing a model of the surface crustal field in a previously mapped low-amplitude region in the vicinity of the InSight landing site. The proposed proxy successfully separates quiet and noisy data and will facilitate MAVEN data selection for higher-resolution crustal field models. Other applications include data selection for magnetic sounding studies using the InSight magnetometer, or studies of the ionosphere. The deployment of a ground-based magnetometer by InSight will also allow the refinement of the proxy, using simultaneous satellite and surface magnetic field measurements.Plain Language Summary The ability to distinguish between magnetically quiet and noisy data measured at or above the surface of a planet is important for a wide range of studies. For example, high fidelity models of the crustal magnetic field require data that contain minimal signals from other sourcesi.e., that are quiet. At Earth, such data selection uses estimates of magnetic activity (so-called activity indices or proxies) derived from ground-based magnetic observatories. We propose a proxy for magnetic field activity at Mars, where no ground-based measurements are yet available, that uses magnetic data from the MAVEN spacecraft. The proxy is based on the correlation of the magnetic field measured in the solar wind and that measured closer to the planet, out of the solar wind, on the nightside. We show an application of the proxy by developing an updated crustal field model in the vicinity of the InSight landing site. The InSight mission will provide the first surface magnetic field measurements at Mars, and the opportunity to refine the proposed proxy.

TI  - Ultralow Surface Temperatures in East Antarctica From Satellite Thermal Infrared Mapping: The Coldest Places on Earth
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We identify areas near the East Antarctic ice divide where <-90 degrees C surface snow temperatures are observed in wintertime satellite thermal-band data under clear-sky conditions. The lowest temperatures are found in small (<200km(2)) topographic basins of similar to 2m depth above 3,800m elevation. Approximately 100 sites have observed minimum surface temperatures of similar to-98 degrees C during the winters of 2004-2016. Comparisons of surface snow temperatures with near-surface air temperatures at nearby weather stations indicate that similar to-98 degrees C surfaces imply similar to-944 degrees C 2-m air temperatures. Landsat 8 thermal band data and elevation data show gradients near the topographic depressions of similar to 6 degrees Ckm(-1) horizontally and similar to 4 degrees Cm-1 vertically. Ultralow temperature occurrences correlate with strong polar vortex circulation. We discuss a conceptual model of radiative surface cooling that produces an extreme inversion layer. Further cooling occurs as near-surface cold air pools in shallow high-elevation topographic basins, moderated by clear-air downwelling radiation and heat from subsurface snow.Plain Language Summary The lowest measured air temperature on Earth is -89.2 degrees C (-129F) on 23 July 1983, observed at Vostok Station in Antarctica (Turner et al., 2009, ). However, satellite data collected during the Antarctic polar night during 2004-2016 reveal a broad region of the high East Antarctic Plateau above Vostok that regularly reaches snow surface temperatures of -90 degrees C and below. These occur in shallow topographic depressions near the highest part of the ice sheet, at 3,800 to 4,050-m elevation. Comparisons with nearby automated weather stations suggest that air temperatures during these events are near -944 degrees C or about -138F. Ultracold conditions (below -90 degrees C) occur more frequently when the Antarctic polar vortex is strong. This temperature appears to be about as low as it is possible to reach, even under clear skies and very dry conditions, because heat radiating from the cold clear air is nearly equal to the heat radiating from the bitterly cold snow surface.

TI  - Diurnal Variation of Liquid Water Path Derived From Two Polar-Orbiting FengYun-3 MicroWave Radiation Imagers
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - MicroWave Radiation Imagers (MWRIs) onboard the afternoon FengYun-3B (FY-3B) and midmorning FengYun-3C (FY-3C) satellites provide global observations almost 4 times a day at any location. This study examines the diurnal cycle of the liquid water path (LWP) over the southeast Pacific Ocean using MWRI data. A double-difference calibration method is first used to evaluate the MWRI calibration bias based on Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Microwave Imager (TMI) measurements. LWP diurnal cycle characteristics are derived from FY-3B/C MWRI data measured in 2014. The diurnal variation of LWP from combined FY-3B/C MWRI measurements are consistent with that derived from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Microwave Imager data. Maximum and minimum LWPs occurred in the early morning and afternoon, respectively. The largest diurnal amplitude (similar to 40% of the mean LWP) was located near 85 degrees W/20 degrees S. The diurnal amplitude varied from season to season. MWRI data can provide important constraints for models simulating the cloud diurnal cycle.Plain Language Summary MicroWave Radiation Imager (MWRI) dual-polarization measurements at 10.65, 18.7, 23.8, 36.5, and 89GHz can be combined to retrieve the liquid water path (LWP) in the atmosphere over ocean surfaces. The Chinese FengYun-3B and FengYun-3C satellites provide MWRI observations during their midmorning and afternoon orbits, respectively, allowing the diurnal variations of LWP to be observed globally by such polar-orbiting satellites. The diurnal variations of LWP are important for understanding hydrometeorological processes in the atmosphere and for validating LWP numerical weather prediction models. It is shown that in 2014, FengYun-3B and FengYun-3C MWRI-derived LWP retrievals compared well with those derived from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Microwave Imager over the southeast Pacific Ocean. The intensity of the diurnal cycle varied from season to season and the largest diurnal amplitude (similar to 40% of the mean LWP) was located near 85 degrees W/20 degrees S.

AB  - High mobility group box-1 (HMGb1) protein, a nuclear non-histone protein that is released or secreted from the cell in response to damage or stress, is a sentinel for the immune system that plays a critical role in cell survival/death pathways. This review highlights key features of the endogenous danger-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) protein, HMGb1 in the innate inflammatory response along with various cofactors and receptors that regulate its downstream effects. The evidence demonstrating increased levels of HMGb1 in human inflammatory diseases and conditions is presented, along with a summary of current small molecule or peptide-like antagonists proven to specifically target HMGb1. Additionally, we delineate the measures needed toward validating this protein as a clinically relevant biomarker or bioindicator and as a relevant drug target.

TI  - Automatic Correction of Contaminated Images for Assessment of Reservoir Surface Area Dynamics
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The potential of using Landsat for assessing long-term water surface dynamics of individual reservoirs at a global scale has been significantly hindered by contaminations from clouds, cloud shadows, and terrain shadows. A novel algorithm was developed toward the automatic correction of these contaminated image classifications. By applying this algorithm to the data set by Pekel et al. (2016, ), time series of area values for 6,817 global reservoirs (with an integrated capacity of 6,099km(3)) were generated from 1984 to 2015. The number of effective images that can be used in each time series has been improved by 81% on average. The long-term average area for these global reservoirs was corrected from 1.73x10(5)km(2) to 3.94x10(5)km(2). The results were proven to be robust through validation using observations, synthetic data, and visual inspection. This continuous reservoir surface area data set can provide benefit to various applications (both at continental and local scales).Plain Language Summary Understanding of water surface area dynamics is important for modern water resources management. Due to the difficulties collecting data from ground, remote sensing images from satellites have been widely used to map the water coverage and then to analyze the dynamics. However, one typical problem when using satellite images is that they are frequently contaminated by clouds, cloud shadows, and terrain shadows, which result in the underestimation of the water area. Thus, we developed a novel algorithm to remove the impacts of these contaminations for monitoring water area accurately. After comprehensive evaluations, the algorithm was proved to be able to effectively enhance the Landsat-based water area results. A data set containing monthly surface area time series for 6,817 global reservoirs from 1984 to 2015 was subsequently generated using the algorithm. This work (both the data set and the algorithm) can support many applications on both global and local scales to benefit the water management, hydrology, and remote sensing communities.

TI  - Quality assessment of the Ozone_cci Climate Research Data Package (release 2017) - Part 2: Ground-based validation of nadir ozone profile data products
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric ozone plays a key role in air quality and the radiation budget of the Earth, both directly and through its chemical influence on other trace gases. Assessments of the atmospheric ozone distribution and associated climate change therefore demand accurate vertically resolved ozone observations with both stratospheric and tropospheric sensitivity, on both global and regional scales, and both in the long term and at shorter timescales. Such observations have been acquired by two series of European nadirviewing ozone profilers, namely the scattered-light UV-visible spectrometers of the GOME family, launched regularly since 1995 (GOME, SCIAMACHY, OMI, GOME2A/B, TROPOMI, and the upcoming Sentinel-5 series), and the thermal infrared emission sounders of the IASI type, launched regularly since 2006 (IASI on Metop platforms and the upcoming IASI-NG on Metop-SG). In particular, several Level-2 retrieved, Level-3 monthly gridded, and Level-4 assimilated nadir ozone profile data products have been improved and harmonized in the context of the ozone project of the European Space Agency's Climate Change Initiative (ESA Ozone_cci). To verify their fitness for purpose, these ozone datasets must undergo a comprehensive quality assessment (QA), including (a) detailed identification of their geographical, vertical, and temporal domains of validity; (b) quantification of their potential bias, noise, and drift and their dependences on major influence quantities; and (c) assessment of the mutual consistency of data from different sounders. For this purpose we have applied to the Ozone_cci Climate Research Data Package (CRDP) released in 2017 the versatile QA and validation system Multi-TASTE, which has been developed in the context of several heritage projects (ESA's Multi-TASTE, EUMETSAT's O3M-SAF, and the European Commission's FP6 GEOmon and FP7 QA4ECV). This work, as the second in a series of four Ozone_cci validation papers, reports for the first time on data content studies, information content studies and ground-based validation for both the GOME-and IASI-type climate data records combined. The ground-based reference measurements have been provided by the Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC), NASA's Southern Hemisphere Additional Ozonesonde programme (SHADOZ), and other ozonesonde and lidar stations contributing to the World Meteorological Organisation's Global Atmosphere Watch (WMO GAW). The nadir ozone profile CRDP quality assessment reveals that all nadir ozone profile products under study fulfil the GCOS user requirements in terms of observation frequency and horizontal and vertical resolution. Yet all L2 observations also show sensitivity outliers in the UTLS and are strongly correlated vertically due to substantial averaging kernel fluctuations that extend far beyond the kernel's 15 km FWHM. The CRDP typically does not comply with the GCOS user requirements in terms of total uncertainty and decadal drift, except for the UV-visible L4 dataset. The drift values of the L2 GOME and OMI, the L3 IASI, and the L4 assimilated products are found to be overall insignificant, however, and applying appropriate altitude-dependent bias and drift corrections make the data fit for climate and atmospheric composition monitoring and modelling purposes. Dependence of the Ozone_cci data quality on major influence quantities-resulting in data screening suggestions to users-and perspectives for the Copernicus Sentinel missions are additionally discussed.

TI  - Pancreatic cancer as a sentinel for hereditary cancer predisposition
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Genes associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) and colorectal cancer (CRC) predisposition have been shown to play a role in pancreatic cancer susceptibility. Growing evidence suggests that pancreatic cancer may be useful as a sentinel cancer to identify families that could benefit from HBOC or CRC surveillance, but to date pancreatic cancer is only considered an indication for genetic testing in the context of additional family history.Methods: Preliminary data generated at the Huntsman Cancer Hospital (HCH) included variants identified on a custom 34-gene panel or 59-gene panel including both known HBOC and CRC genes for respective sets of 66 and 147 pancreatic cancer cases, unselected for family history. Given the strength of preliminary data and corresponding literature, 61 sequential pancreatic cancer cases underwent a custom 14-gene clinical panel. Sequencing data from HCH pancreatic cancer cases, pancreatic cancer cases of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and an unselected pancreatic cancer screen from the Mayo Clinic were combined in a meta-analysis to estimate the proportion of carriers with pathogenic and high probability of pathogenic variants of uncertain significance (HiP-VUS).Results: Approximately 8.6% of unselected pancreatic cancer cases at the HCH carried a variant with potential HBOC or CRC screening recommendations. A meta-analysis of unselected pancreatic cancer cases revealed that approximately 11.5% carry a pathogenic variant or HiP-VUS.Conclusion: With the inclusion of both HBOC and CRC susceptibility genes in a panel test, unselected pancreatic cancer cases act as a useful sentinel cancer to identify asymptomatic at-risk relatives who could benefit from relevant HBOC and CRC surveillance measures.

TI  - Comparisons of bispectral and polarimetric retrievals of marine boundary layer cloud microphysics: case studies using a LES-satellite retrieval simulator
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Many passive remote-sensing techniques have been developed to retrieve cloud microphysical properties from satellite-based sensors, with the most common approaches being the bispectral and polarimetric techniques. These two vastly different retrieval techniques have been implemented for a variety of polar-orbiting and geostationary satellite platforms, providing global climatological data sets. Prior instrument comparison studies have shown that there are systematic differences between the droplet size retrieval products (effective radius) of bispectral (e.g., MODIS, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and polarimetric (e.g., POLDER, Polarization and Directionality of Earth's Reflectances) instruments. However, intercomparisons of airborne bispectral and polarimetric instruments have yielded results that do not appear to be systematically biased relative to one another. Diagnosing this discrepancy is complicated, because it is often difficult for instrument intercomparison studies to isolate differences between retrieval technique sensitivities and specific instrumental differences such as calibration and atmospheric correction. In addition to these technical differences the polarimetric retrieval is also sensitive to the dispersion of the droplet size distribution (effective variance), which could influence the interpretation of the droplet size retrieval. To avoid these instrument-dependent complications, this study makes use of a cloud remote-sensing retrieval simulator. Created by coupling a large-eddy simulation (LES) cloud model with a 1-D radiative transfer model, the simulator serves as a test bed for understanding differences between bispectral and polarimetric retrievals. With the help of this simulator we can not only compare the two techniques to one another (retrieval intercomparison) but also validate retrievals directly against the LES cloud properties. Using the satellite retrieval simulator, we are able to verify that at high spatial resolution (50 m) the bispectral and polarimetric retrievals are highly correlated with one another within expected observational uncertainties. The relatively small systematic biases at high spatial resolution can be attributed to different sensitivity limitations of the two retrievals. In contrast, a systematic difference between the two retrievals emerges at coarser resolution. This bias largely stems from differences related to sensitivity of the two retrievals to unresolved inhomogeneities in effective variance and optical thickness. The influence of coarse angular resolution is found to increase uncertainty in the polarimetric retrieval but generally maintains a constant mean value.

TI  - Incessant erosion of high tidal mudflats in the northern Gulf of Khambhat
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Extensive erosion of high tidal mudflat along the northern parts of Gulf of Khambhat (GoK) was observed from the analysis of time series satellite images during the time period from March 2014 to September 2017. Around 28.66 sq. km area of high tidal mudflat eroded within this time period. Maximum erosion rates estimated have even peaked to about 4 km/year showing the severity of erosion. The mudflats under erosion are along the outer boundary of a meandering tidal channel connecting the Gulf with Mahi river. A possible cause of the incessant erosion of mudflats is the strong tidal currents along the outer boundary of the meandering tidal channel, that have carved the mudflats and pushed the tidal channel further landward. A subtle seasonal pattern of erosion was observed with decrease in erosion rates during the summer monsoon period when the high tidal currents are weak due to the river influx. Rapid erosion of the tidal mudflats has not only destroyed the vital habitat, but has also eventually exposed the inhabited land area to tidal flooding, making it vulnerable to erosion. The study shows the importance of assessing the stability of mudflats along the GoK, where large development activities are proposed.

TI  - Cloud heterogeneity on cloud and aerosol above cloud properties retrieved from simulated total and polarized reflectances
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Simulations of total and polarized cloud reflectance angular signatures such as the ones measured by the multi-angular and polarized radiometer POLDER3/PARASOL are used to evaluate cloud heterogeneity effects on cloud parameter retrievals. Effects on optical thickness, albedo, effective radius and variance of the cloud droplet size distribution and aerosol parameters above cloud are analyzed. Three different clouds that have the same mean optical thicknesses were generated: the first with a flat top, the second with a bumpy top and the last with a fractional cloud cover. At small scale (50 m), for oblique solar incidence, the illumination effects lead to higher total but also polarized reflectances. The polarized reflectances even reach values that cannot be predicted by the 1-D homogeneous cloud assumption. At the POLDER scale (7 km x 7 km), the angular signature is modified by a combination of the planeparallel bias and the shadowing and illumination effects. In order to quantify effects of cloud heterogeneity on operational products, we ran the POLDER operational algorithms on the simulated reflectances to retrieve the cloud optical thickness and albedo. Results show that the cloud optical thickness is greatly affected: biases can reach up to -70, -50 or +40 % for backward, nadir and forward viewing directions, respectively. Concerning the albedo of the cloudy scenes, the errors are smaller, between -4.7 % for solar incidence angle of 20 degrees and up to about +8 % for solar incidence angle of 60 degrees. We also tested the heterogeneity effects on new algorithms that allow retrieving cloud droplet size distribution and cloud top pressures and also aerosol above clouds. Contrary to the bi-spectral method, the retrieved cloud droplet size parameters are not significantly affected by the cloud heterogeneity, which proves to be a great advantage of using polarized measurements. However, the cloud top pressure obtained from molecular scattering in the forward direction can be biased up to about 60hPa (around 550m). Concerning the aerosol optical thickness (AOT) above cloud, the results are different depending on the available angular information. Above the fractional cloud, when only side scattering angles between 100 and 130 degrees are available, the AOT is underestimated because of the plane-parallel bias. However, for solar zenith angle of 60 degrees it is overestimated because the polarized reflectances are increased in forward directions.

TI  - Block compression of remote sensing image based on data-hiding
T2  - CHINESE SPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - At present, JPEG2000 and other image compression methods are limited by the compression multiple, which can not meet users' real-time transmission requirements for mass remote sensing data. Therefore, the amount of data generated by high-resolution remote sensing images needs to be further reduced to meet the spatial transmission requirements of remote sensing image data. Aiming at this situation, a method for block compression of remote sensing image based on data-hiding was proposed. By using the similarity of image blocks, the reference image blocks and similar image blocks were determined. The numbers of similar image blocks are hidden in the reference image blocks, and only the reference image block is subjected to JPEG2000 compression. The standard image library was used as the sample image to simulate. The experimental results show that this method can reduce increase the compression the amount of data before the image compression by 1/3 and ratio of the sample image by 1.5 times.

TI  - Studies of forest fire induced changes in atmosphere over Uttarakhand, India, using space based observations and model simulations
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The northern Indian state of Uttarakhand had witnessed an episode of intense forest fire during April-May 2016. The present study analyses the changes in trace gas and other atmospheric constituents induced by the forest fire using satellite data. The study reveals elevated levels of CO, NO2, ozone and aerosol optical depth (AOD) over the affected region. Higher levels of CO are observed at altitudes of 2-3 km. The column amount of CO has almost doubled from mean background values, whereas NO2 has increased by almost three times to values normally seen over highly polluted cities. Increase in ozone is only moderate and AOD has risen towards the end of the main phase of the fire episode. Weather research and forecasting simulations of wind and planetary boundary layer height are also performed and the results discussed. The study shows the potential of Earth-Observation Satellites to track and monitor such environmental impacts effectively.

TI  - Differing ecosystem responses of vegetation cover to extreme drought on the Big Sur coast of California
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Impacts of the extreme 2013 to 2014 drought on vegetation canopy cover in the Big Sur region of central coastal California were assessed using a combination of satellite image analysis and in situ measurements of soil moisture. Landsat and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer satellite images were analyzed and compared across six ecosystems representative of the predominant vegetation types of the region at the U.S. Forest Service's Brazil Ranch study site. Results showed that differing spatial densities of woody plants among these ecosystems corresponded to the observed changes in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) over the period of 2010 to 2016, with the herbaceous-dominated coastal terrace, open shrub, and ridge-top grassland ecosystems declining 30% in greenness during the extreme drought period of 2012 to 2014. Landsat images from the month of peak annual NDVI confirmed this as a statistically significant difference in the loss of green cover in open shrub and grassland ecosystems during the 2012 to 2014 drought, compared to the closed shrubland and redwood-dominated ecosystems that were relatively unaffected at the study site.

T2  - Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Background: Axillary lymph node metastasis is the most important predictive factor for recurrence risk andsurvival in patients with invasive breast carcinoma. The aim of this study was to determine factors associated withmetastatic involvement of axillary lymph nodes in Iranian women with early breast cancer. Methods: This article reportsa retrospective study of 774 patients with T1-T2 breast cancer who underwent resection of the primary tumor and axillarystaging by SLNB and/or ALND between 2005 and 2015 at our institution. Results: Of the 774 patients included in thisstudy, 35.5% (275 cases) had axillary lymph node involvement at the time of diagnosis. Factors associated with nodalinvolvement in univariate analyses were tumor size, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), tumor grade, ER/PR status andHER2 expression. All factors identified with univariate analyses were entered into a multivariate logistic regressionmodel and tumor size (OR= 3.01, CI 2.01-4.49, P <0.001), ER/PR positivity (OR = 1.74, CI 1.1.16-2.62, P = 0.007)and presence of LVI (OR = 3.3.8, CI 2.31-4.95, P <0.001) remained as independent predictors of axillary lymph nodeinvolvement .Conclusions: In conclusion, the results of this study suggests that positive hormonal receptor status, LVIand tumor size are predictive factors for ALNM in Iranian women with early breast cancer.

AB  - Rural settlements are critical ecological-production-living spaces in rural areas. Exploring its spatial pattern and evolution process are significant for optimizations of land resources. The spatial-temporal evolution characteristics and driving forces of rural settlements in Jiangxi Province between 2005 and 2015 were analyzed based on remote sensing data by using the methods including grid analysis, transect investigation and geographical detector. It has been found that there were a large number of rural settlements in Jiangxi province, which were highly dispersed in larger spatial scales and agglomerated in smaller spatial scales. The spatial pattern of rural settlements in Jiangxi Province showed a north-south differentiation, i.e. more patches and larger total areas in the north while less patches and smaller total areas in the south. It was also found that there were generally more settlements in lowlands and areas closing to cities and towns. Jiangxi Province has experienced accelerated rural-urban migration in the past decades. Nevertheless, the number and total area of rural settlements increased by 35. 8% and 21. 4%, respectively, showing an expansion to cities, towns and main roads. In contrast, the decrease of rural residential area happened in mountainous areas and the peripheral areas of big cities owing to ecological immi g rant project and rural residential land consolidation. Generally, the area of rural settlements was become more fragmentated. The geographical detector analysis indicate that the main factors influencing county level rural settlement patterns are agricultural and economic development, population growth and topographical conditions.

TI  - The importance of mixed-phase and ice clouds for climate sensitivity in the global aerosol-climate model ECHAM6-HAM2
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - How clouds change in a warmer climate remains one of the largest uncertainties for the equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS). While a large spread in the cloud feedback arises from low-level clouds, it was recently shown that mixed-phase clouds are also important for ECS. If mixed-phase clouds in the current climate contain too few supercooled cloud droplets, too much ice will change to liquid water in a warmer climate. As shown by Tan et al. (2016), this overestimates the negative cloud-phase feedback and underestimates ECS in the CAM global climate model (GCM). Here we use the newest version of the ECHAM6-HAM2 GCM to investigate the importance of mixed-phase and ice clouds for ECS.Although we also considerably underestimate the fraction of supercooled liquid water globally in the reference version of the ECHAM6-HAM2 GCM, we do not obtain increases in ECS in simulations with more supercooled liquid water in the present-day climate, different from the findings by Tan et al. (2016). We hypothesize that it is not the global supercooled liquid water fraction that matters, but only how well low-and mid-level mixed-phase clouds with cloud-top temperatures in the mixed-phase temperature range between 0 and -35 degrees C that are not shielded by higher-lying ice clouds are simulated. These occur most frequently in midlatitudes, in particular over the Southern Ocean where they determine the amount of absorbed shortwave radiation. In ECHAM6-HAM2 the amount of absorbed shortwave radiation over the Southern Ocean is only significantly overestimated if all clouds below 0 degrees C consist exclusively of ice. Only in this simulation is ECS significantly smaller than in all other simulations and the cloud optical depth feedback is the dominant cloud feedback. In all other simulations, the cloud optical depth feedback is weak and changes in cloud feedbacks associated with cloud amount and cloud-top pressure dominate the overall cloud feedback. However, apart from the simulation with only ice below 0 degrees C, differences in the overall cloud feedback are not translated into differences in ECS in our model. This insensitivity to the cloud feedback in our model is explained with compensating effects in the clear sky.

TI  - Performance assessment of ESTARFM with different similar-pixel identification schemes
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing images with high-spatial and high-temporal (HSHT) resolution are difficult to be consistently achieved with a single polar orbit satellite because of the trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution. However, blending algorithms have been developed to synthesize HSHT images from low-spatial but high-temporal resolution images and high-spatial but low-temporal resolution images. One example is a widely used weight-function-based method known as the enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (ESTARFM). Similar-pixels play a key role in the prediction accuracy of this model, and their identification is influenced by the method used, the number of classes, and the moving window size. However, influence of these parameters on the final prediction accuracy has not been thoroughly examined. Therefore, this study assesses the accuracy of ESTARFM when similar-pixels are identified by two separate methods using different numbers of classes and moving window sizes. The results indicated that the class-image-based method outperformed the threshold-based method in most cases and the increase of moving window size generally improved the accuracy for both methods. However, the improvement was minor and accuracy degraded in some cases if the moving window was too large. In addition, the ESTARFM program was optimized in this study, and its computational efficiency was improved compared with previous studies.

TI  - Applicability of Downscaling Land Surface Temperature by Using Normalized Difference Sand Index
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) in coarse spatial resolution derived from thermal infrared satellite images has limited use in many remote sensing applications. In this study, we improve our previous approach (multiple remote-sensing index approach of random forest) to downscale LST derived from Landsat 8 and MODIS in an arid oasis - desert ecotone of Zhangye city by designing a normalized difference sand index (NDSI), by the removal of land cover datasets and by the input of SAVI, NDBI and NDWI to downscale LST. Our result demonstrates that NDSI can determine the characteristic of the desert region, and that the distribution of downscaled LST matches those of oasis-desert ecosystems. Relative to the ground observation of HiWATER, our approach also produces relatively satisfactory downscaling results at July 21 (2013), with R-2 and root-mean-square error of 0.99 and 1.25 K, respectively. Compared with other methods, our approach demonstrates higher accuracy and minimization of the retrieved Landsat 8 LST in the desert region. Optimal availability occurs in the vegetation and desert region. Our approach is suitable to LST downscaling in all seasons, especially in spring and summer. The model can further be applied in middle-high and middle-low spatial resolutions. The usefulness of the model is relatively satisfactory in the humid region (Nanjing city) but less accurate in the arid region.

TI  - Mapping Volcanic Deposits of the 2011-2015 Etna Eruptive Events Using Satellite Remote Sensing
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimates of lava volumes provide important data on the lava flooding history and evolution of a volcano. For mapping volcanic deposits, including lava flows, the advancement of satellite remote sensing techniques offers a great potential. Here we characterize the eruptive events occurred at Mt Etna between January 2011 and December 2015 leading to the emplacement of numerous lava flows and to the formation of a new pyroclastic cone (NSEC) on the eastern flank of the South East Crater. The HOTSAT system is used to analyze remote sensing data acquired by the SEVIRI sensor in order to detect the thermal anomalies from active lava flows and calculate the associated radiative power. The time-series analysis of SEVIRI data provides an estimation of event magnitude and intensity of the effusive material erupted during each event. The cumulative volume estimated from SEVIRI images from 2011 to 2015 adds up to similar to 106 millions of cubic meters of lava, with a time-averaged rate of similar to 0.68 m(3) s(-1). This estimate is independently supported and bounded using a topographic approach, i.e., by subtracting the last topography of Etna updated to 2005 from a 2015 digital elevation model (DEM), produced using tri-stereo Pleiades satellite images acquired on December 18, 2015. The total volume of products erupted from 2005 to 2015, calculated from topography difference by integration of the thickness distribution over the area covered, is about 287 x 10(6) m(3), of which similar to 55 x 10(6) m(3) is the volume of the NSEC cone. This 10-year volume is below the typical erupted volumes on decadal scale at Mt Etna, interrupting its stable and resilient output trend.

TI  - The potential value of crowdsourced surveillance systems in supplementing sentinel influenza networks: the case of France
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Participatory surveillance systems provide rich crowdsourced data, profiling individuals and their health status at a given time. We explored the usefulness of data from GrippeNet.fr, a participatory surveillance system, to estimate influenza-related illness incidence in France. Methods: GrippeNet.fr is an online cohort since 2012 averaging ca. 5,000 weekly participants reporting signs/symptoms suggestive of influenza. GrippeNet.fr has flexible criteria to define influenza-related illness. Different case definitions based on reported signs/symptoms and inclusions of criteria accounting for individuals' reporting and participation were used to produce influenza-related illness incidence estimates, which were compared to those from sentinel networks. We focused on the 2012/13 and 2013/14 seasons when two sentinel networks, monitoring influenza-like-illness (ILI) and acute respiratory infections (ARI) existed in France. Results: GrippeNet.fr incidence estimates agreed well with official temporal trends, with a higher accuracy for ARI than ILI. The influenza epidemic peak was often anticipated by one week, despite irregular participation of individuals. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control ILI definition, commonly used by participatory surveillance in Europe, performed better in tracking ARI than ILI when applied to GrippeNet.fr data. Conclusion: Evaluation of the epidemic intensity from crowdsourced data requires epidemic and intensity threshold estimations from several consecutive seasons. The study provides a standardised analytical framework for crowdsourced surveillance showing high sensitivity in detecting influenza-related changes in the population. It contributes to improve the comparability of epidemics across seasons and with sentinel systems. In France, GrippeNet.fr may supplement the ILI sentinel network after ARI surveillance discontinuation in 2014.

TI  - Forcing the SURFEX/Crocus snow model with combined hourly meteorological forecasts and gridded observations in southern Norway
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - In Norway, 30 % of the annual precipitation falls as snow. Knowledge of the snow reservoir is therefore important for energy production and water resource management. The land surface model SURFEX with the detailed snowpack scheme Crocus (SURFEX/Crocus) has been run with a grid spacing of 1 km over an area in southern Norway for 2 years (1 September 2014-31 August 2016). Experiments were carried out using two different forcing data sets: (1) hourly forecasts from the operational weather forecast model AROME MetCoOp (2.5 km grid spacing) including post-processed temperature (500 m grid spacing) and wind, and (2) gridded hourly observations of temperature and precipitation (1 km grid spacing) combined with meteorological forecasts from AROME MetCoOp for the remaining weather variables required by SURFEX/Crocus. We present an evaluation of the modelled snow depth and snow cover in comparison to 30 point observations of snow depth and MODIS satellite images of the snow-covered area. The evaluation focuses on snow accumulation and snowmelt. Both experiments are capable of simulating the snowpack over the two winter seasons, but there is an overestimation of snow depth when using meteorological forecasts from AROME MetCoOp (bias of 20 cm and RMSE of 56 cm), although the snow-covered area in the melt season is better represented by this experiment. The errors, when using AROME MetCoOp as forcing, accumulate over the snow season. When using gridded observations, the simulation of snow depth is significantly improved (the bias for this experiment is 7 cm and RMSE 28 cm), but the spatial snow cover distribution is not well captured during the melting season. Underestimation of snow depth at high elevations (due to the low elevation bias in the gridded observation data set) likely causes the snow cover to decrease too soon during the melt season, leading to unrealistically little snow by the end of the season. Our results show that forcing data consisting of post-processed NWP data (observations assimilated into the raw NWP weather predictions) are most promising for snow simulations, when larger regions are evaluated. Post-processed NWP data provide a more representative spatial representation for both high mountains and lowlands, compared to interpolated observations. There is, however, an underestimation of snow ablation in both experiments. This is generally due to the absence of wind-induced erosion of snow in the SURFEX/Crocus model, underestimated snowmelt and biases in the forcing data.

TI  - Antarctic ice shelf disintegration triggered by sea ice loss and ocean swell
T2  - NATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the causes of recent catastrophic ice shelf disintegrations is a crucial step towards improving coupled models of the Antarctic Ice Sheet and predicting its future state and contribution to sea-level rise. An overlooked climate related causal factor is regional sea ice loss. Here we show that for the disintegration events observed (the collapse of the Larsen A and B and Wilkins ice shelves), the increased seasonal absence of a protective sea ice buffer enabled increased flexure of vulnerable outer ice shelf margins by ocean swells that probably weakened them to the;point of calving. This outer-margin calving triggered wider-scale disintegration of ice shelves compromised by multiple factors in preceding years, with key prerequisites being extensive flooding and miter-margin fracturing. Wave-induced flexure is particularly effective in outermost ice shelf regions thinned by bottom crevassing. Our analysis of satellite and ocean-wave data and modelling of combined ice shelf, sea ice and wave properties, highlights the need for ice sheet models to account for sea ice and ocean waves.

TI  - Effect of climate dataset selection on simulations of terrestrial GPP: Highest uncertainty for tropical regions
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Biogeochemical models use meteorological forcing data derived with different approaches (e.g. based on interpolation or reanalysis of observation data or a hybrid hereof) to simulate ecosystem processes such as gross primary productivity (GPP). This study assesses the impact of different widely used climate datasets on simulated gross primary productivity and evaluates the suitability of them for reproducing the global and regional carbon cycle as mapped from independent GPP data. We simulate GPP with the biogeochemical model LPJ-GUESS using six historical climate datasets (CRU, CRUNCEP, ECMWF, NCEP, PRINCETON, and WFDEI). The simulated GPP is evaluated using an observation-based GPP product derived from eddy covariance measurements in combination with remotely sensed data. Our results show that all datasets tested produce relatively similar GPP simulations at a global scale, corresponding fairly well to the observation-based data with a difference between simulations and observations ranging from -50 to 60 g m(-2) yr(-1). However, all simulations also show a strong underestimation of GPP (ranging from -533 to -870 g m(-2) yr(-1)) and low temporal agreement (r < 0.4) with observations over tropical areas. As the shortwave radiation for tropical areas was found to have the highest uncertainty in the analyzed historical climate datasets, we test whether simulation results could be improved by a correction of the tested shortwave radiation for tropical areas using a new radiation product from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP). A large improvement (up to 48%) in simulated GPP magnitude was observed with bias corrected shortwave radiation, as well as an increase in spatio-temporal agreement between the simulated GPP and observation based GPP. This study conducts a spatial inter-comparison and quantification of the performances of climate datasets and can thereby facilitate the selection of climate forcing data over any given study area for modelling purposes.

TI  - Influence of organic complexation on dissolved iron distribution in East Antarctic pack ice
T2  - MARINE CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Since Antarctic sea ice covers an area larger than the Antarctic continent itself, the discovery that it can fertilize the Southern Ocean with iron (Fe) has fostered a new breadth of research in recent years. In order to test the hypothesis that Fe-binding organic ligands control the distribution of dissolved iron (DFe) in Antarctic pack ice, iron organic speciation was investigated in samples collected during the Sea Ice Physics and Ecosystem eXperiment-2 (SIPEX-2) voyage in Austral winter/spring 2012. Dissolved Fe was measured using sector field inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, and iron organic speciation parameters were determined by competitive ligand equilibration - adsorptive cathodic stripping voltammetry method, using 1-nitroso-2-naphthol (NN) as the added ligand. The concentration of Fe-binding organic ligands (Lt) ranged from 4.9 nM to 41 nM (average of 14.9 +/- 8.4 nM, n = 34), and was always higher than the corresponding DFe (average of 7.5 +/- 4.5 nM, n = 34). Conditional stability constants (log K'(Fe'L) = 11.7-13.0) were similar to those previously observed in land-fast ice. Concentrations of DFe and Lt displayed similar depth profiles; their strong correlation (Spearman's rho = 0.80, p < 0.001) suggested that Fe-binding organic ligands control DFe distribution in Antarctic pack ice. Unlike results previously obtained for land-fast ice, Fe-binding organic ligands in pack ice were never saturated with iron (Lt/DFe > 1). Estimates showed that pack ice would have released 0.45 mu mol/m(2)/d of Lt during spring melt, 0.21 mu mol/m(2)/d of which are free from Fe binding, and hence available for further complexation. Therefore, it is suggested that this excess of Fe-free ligands may play a key role in controlling the solubility of free or newly formed Fe in surface waters before the peak of primary production, outcompeting the Fe-binding organic ligands already present in seawater.

T2  - LITERATOR-JOURNAL OF LITERARY CRITICISM COMPARATIVE LINGUISTICS AND LITERARY STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Yann Martel's Life of Pi recontextualises the traditional castaway narrative's rationalist and reductivist worldview by incorporating carnivalised writing, or the carnivalesque, to examine alternative or 'non-human' ways of encountering the world. It is this subversive and liberating approach towards dominant cultural forms and beliefs that is manifested in Life of Pi through grotesque realism. Grotesque realism, as defined in Mikhail Bakhtin's Rabelais and his world, is relevant to Martel's novel, as this convention purports that animals embody the raw physicality of existence through their instinctual and amoral nature. In the context of the novel, carnivalesque writing contributes to the blurring of boundaries between human and animal in a way that also reveals the transformative abilities of storytelling. The dissolution of boundaries that separate humans from animals and the rational from the irrational emphasises the redeeming potential in alternative - or imaginative - ways of interpreting existence and, ultimately, casts light on uncanny spaces of existence such as loss, suffering and deprivation.

Herein, we present fundamental energy yield limits based on 2015 global satellite data for solar cells with various band-gaps, including established technologies such as Si and CdTe and emerging materials such as perovskites. Based on an adapted detailed-balance model with experimental validation, we derive an empirical relation that allows approximating harvesting efficiencies from standard testing condition efficiencies. This equation provides a straightforward way to calculate energy yield for any new technology and enables a fair comparison of lab-measured devices with different band-gaps. We find that the ideal band-gap for maximizing energy yield is 1.35 eV. We show that harvesting efficiencies correlate with Koppen-Geiger climate zones, which indicates that results obtained in a given climate can be translated to other regions with similar climate.

TI  - Analysis of the Alaska Volcano Observatory's Response Time to Volcanic Explosions-1989 to 2016
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - A major goal of volcano monitoring is the rapid identification of volcanic explosions and subsequent warning of associated hazards. Between 1988 and 2016 the Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO) responded to at least 54 separate volcanic eruptions. During this period, AVO's monitoring program relied principally on seismic and satellite remote sensing data, supplemented with geodetic, gas, and visual observations to track volcanic unrest. In this study we focus on AVO's response time, or the time required for AVO to (1) identify seismic signals associated with large ash-producing volcanic explosions and (2) initiate public warnings. We restrict this analysis to volcanoes monitored by a local seismic network and explosive in character. We focus on the 1989-90 eruption of Redoubt Volcano (VEI 3), the 1992 eruption of Mount Spurr (VEI 4), the 1999 eruption of Shishaldin Volcano (VEI 3), the 2006 eruption of Augustine Volcano (VEI 3) and the 2016 eruption of Pavlof Volcano (VEI 2) as detailed records of the timing of formal warnings are preserved. These eruption sequences allow us to evaluate AVO's response time under a number of monitoring scenarios, including both expected (those with recognized precursory unrest) and surprise eruptions (those without identified precursory unrest) as well as individual and repetitive sequences of explosive events. Recorded response time ranges from similar to 1 to 86 min. The shorter response times (similar to 1-13 min) were achieved during sequences of explosive events at Redoubt (1989-90), Spurr (1992) and Augustine (2006). The longer response times (31- 86 min) are recorded for unexpected or surprise explosions such as Spurr (August 18, 1992) and Pavlof (2016) and the only or first explosions in an eruptive sequence such as Shishaldin (1999) and Augustine (2006).

TI  - Combination of Rainfall Thresholds and Susceptibility Maps for Dynamic Landslide Hazard Assessment at Regional Scale
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - We propose a methodology to couple rainfall thresholds and susceptibility maps for dynamic landslide hazard assessment at regional scale. Both inputs are combined in a purposely-built hazard matrix to get a spatially and temporally variable definition of landslide hazard: while statistical rainfall thresholds are used to accomplish a temporal forecasting with very coarse spatial resolution, landslide susceptibility maps provide static spatial information about the probability of landslide occurrence at fine spatial resolution. The test site is the Northern part of Tuscany (Italy), where a recent landslide susceptibility map and a set of recently updated rainfall thresholds are available. These products were modified and updated to meet the requirements of the proposed procedure: the susceptibility map was reclassified and the threshold set was expanded defining additional thresholds. The hazard matrix combines three susceptibility classes (S1, low susceptibility; S2 medium susceptibility; S3 high susceptibility) and three rainfall rate classes (R1, R2, R3), defining five hazard classes, from H0 (null hazard) to H4 (high hazard). A key passage of the procedure is the appropriate calibration and validation of the matrix, letting the hazard classes have a precise meaning in terms of expected consequences and hazard management. The employ of the proposed procedure in a regional warning system brings two main advantages: (i) it is possible to better hypothesize when and where landslide are expected and with which hazard degree, thus fostering a more effective hazard and risk management (e.g., setting priorities of intervention); (ii) the spatial resolution of the regional scale warning system is markedly re fined because from time to time the areas where landslides are expected represent only a fraction of the alert zone.

TI  - Monitoring monthly surface water dynamics of Dongting Lake using Sentinel-1 data at 10 m
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - High temporal resolution water distribution maps are essential for surface water monitoring because surface water exhibits significant inner-annual variation. Therefore, high-frequency remote sensing data are needed for surface water mapping. Dongting Lake, the second-largest freshwater lake in China, is famous for the seasonal fluctuations of its inundation extents in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River. It is also greatly affected by the Three Gorges Project. In this study, we used Sentinel-1 data to generate surface water maps of Dongting Lake at 10 m resolution. First, we generated the Sentinel-1 time series backscattering coefficient for VH and VV polarizations at 10 m resolution by using a monthly composition method. Second, we generated the thresholds for mapping surface water at 10 m resolution with monthly frequencies using Sentinel-1 data. Then, we derived the monthly surface water distribution product of Dongting Lake in 2016, and finally, we analyzed the inner-annual surface water dynamics. The results showed that: (1) The thresholds were -21.56 and -15.82 dB for the backscattering coefficients for VH and VV, respectively, and the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficients were above 95.50% and 0.90, respectively, for the VH backscattering coefficient, and above 94.50% and 0.88, respectively, for the VV backscattering coefficient. The VV backscattering coefficient achieved lower accuracy due to the effect of the wind causing roughness on the surface of the water. (2) The maximum and minimum areas of surface water were 2040.33 km(2) in July, and 738.89 km(2) in December. The surface water area of Dongting Lake varied most significantly in April and August. The permanent water acreage in 2016 was 556.35 km(2), accounting for 19.65% of the total area of Dongting Lake, and the acreage of seasonal water was 1525.21 km(2). This study proposed a method to automatically generate monthly surface water at 10 m resolution, which may contribute to monitoring surface water in a timely manner.

TI  - TAMSAT-ALERT v1: a new framework for agricultural decision support
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Early warning of weather-related hazards enables farmers, policy makers and aid agencies to mitigate their exposure to risk. We present a new operational framework, Tropical Applications of Meteorology using SATellite data and ground based measurements-AgricuLtural EaRly warning sysTem (TAMSAT-ALERT), which aims to provide early warning for meteorological risk to agriculture. TAMSAT-ALERT combines information on land-surface properties, seasonal forecasts and historical weather to quantitatively assess the likelihood of adverse weather-related outcomes, such as low yield. This article describes the modular TAMSAT-ALERT framework and demonstrates its application to risk assessment for low maize yield in northern Ghana (Tamale). The modular design of TAMSAT-ALERT enables it to accommodate any impact or land-surface model driven with meteorological data. The implementation described here uses the well-established General Large Area Model (GLAM) for annual crops to provide probabilistic assessments of the meteorological hazard for maize yield in northern Ghana (Tamale) throughout the growing season. The results show that climatic risk to yield is poorly constrained in the beginning of the season, but as the season progresses, the uncertainty is rapidly reduced. Based on the assessment for the period 2002-2011, we show that TAMSAT-ALERT can estimate the meteorological risk on maize yield 6 to 8 weeks in advance of harvest. The TAMSAT-ALERT methodology implicitly weights forecast and observational inputs according to their relevance to the metric being as- sessed. A secondary application of TAMSAT-ALERT is thus an evaluation of the usefulness of meteorological forecast products for impact assessment. Here, we show that in northern Ghana (Tamale), the tercile seasonal forecasts of seasonal cumulative rainfall and mean temperature, which are routinely issued to farmers, are of limited value because regional and seasonal temperature and rainfall are poorly correlated with yield. This finding speaks to the pressing need for meteorological forecast products that are tailored for individual user applications.

TI  - CYGNSS data map flood inundation during the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2017 Atlantic Hurricane Season was one of the most active and destructive on record, leading to significant flooding in many parts of the United States and the Caribbean. During flooding events such as these, there is an urgent need to quickly map in detail which areas have been severely affected, yet current satellite missions are not capable of sampling the global land surface at high enough spatio-temporal scales for flooding applications. Here, we demonstrate a novel approach to high-resolution flood mapping by repurposing data from the new NASA mission, CYGNSS. The CYGNSS multi-satellite constellation was designed for frequent temporal sampling of the ocean surface in the tropics. We demonstrate that CYGNSS data provide clear signals of surface saturation and inundation extent over land at higher spatio-temporal resolution than radiometers like SMAP. Using a simple thresholding technique, we are able to estimate that approximately 32,580 km(2) of land area in Texas flooded during Hurricane Harvey, and approximately 7210 km(2) of land area flooded in Cuba during Hurricane Irma, or about 7% of Cuba's total area.

TI  - The Impact of Smoke on the Ultraviolet and Visible Radiative Forcing Under Different Fire Regimes
T2  - AIR SOIL AND WATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The quantification of the UV characteristics of smoke aerosols is valuable to UV Index forecasting, air quality studies air chemistry studies, and assessments of the impacts on regional and global environmental changes. The wavelength dependence of the light absorption by smoke aerosol has been researched throughout the UV and visible spectral region and varies with fire type and aerosol composition. An objective of this study is to investigate the spectral optical properties (eg, extinction coefficient, single-scattering albedo, and asymmetry parameter), UV aclinic fluxes, and radiative forcing of smoke of different fire regimes. The smoke aerosol information (eg, simulated smoke fields from biomass burning emission and vertical distribution of the mass concentration of smoke components) from WRF-Chem is used to distinguish 2 smoke types' flaming and smoldering. To compute the spectral optical properties for the fire regimes, the representative size distribution and spectral refractive index have been implemented into the Mie code, and the optical properties are used to run the tropospheric ultraviolet and visible radiative transfer model. We make comparisons between simulated model and measured aclinic flux in the UV and visible spectra under smoke aerosol laden conditions. The WRF-Chem-SMOKE model simulates the smoke plume matched with fire locations and comparable aerosol optical depth (AOD) with satellite measurements. However, the correlation between the simulated and observed AOD is small which implies that adjusting the fire size for the emission inputs and improving meteorological fields are required for further research. The smoke at selected locations reduces the UV actinic flux and increases the visible actinic flux above the plume at small solar zenith angles. The specific spectral response is dependent on the smoke type. Overall the results of this investigation show that this approach is valuable to estimate the impact of smoke on UV and visible radiative fluxes.

TI  - Glacier Mass Changes of Lake-Terminating Grey and Tyndall Glaciers at the Southern Patagonia Icefield Derived From Geodetic Observations and Energy and Mass Balance Modeling
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study we demonstrate how energy and mass fluxes vary in space and time for Grey and Tyndall glaciers at the Southern Patagonia Icefield (SPI). Despite the overall glacier retreat of most Patagonian glaciers, a recent increase in mass loss has been observed, but individual glaciers respond differently in terms of spatial and temporal changes. In this context, the detailed investigation of the effect of mass balance processes on recent glacier response to climate forcing still needs refinement. We therefore quantify surface energy-fluxes and climatic mass balance of the two neighboring glaciers, Grey and Tyndall. The COupled Snow and Ice energy and MAss balance model COSIMA is applied to assess recent surface energy and climatic mass balance variability with a high temporal and spatial resolution for a 16-year period between April 2000 and March 2016. The model is driven by downscaled 6-hourly atmospheric data derived from ERA-Interim reanalysis and MODIS/Terra Snow Cover and validated against ablation measurements made in single years. High resolution precipitation fields are determined by using an analytical orographic precipitation model. Frontal ablation is estimated as residual of climatic mass balance and geodetic mass balance derived from TanDEM-X/SRTM between 2000 and 2014. We simulate a positive glacier-wide mean annual climatic mass balance of +1.02 +/- 0.52 m w.e. a(-1) for Grey Glacier and of +0.68 +/- 0.54 m w.e. a(-1) for Tyndall Glacier between 2000 and 2014. Climatic mass balance results show a high year to year variability. Comparing climatic mass balance results with previous studies underlines the high uncertainty in climatic mass balance modeling with respect to accumulation on the SPI. Due to the lack of observations accumulation estimates differ from previous studies based on the methodological approaches. Mean annual ice loss by frontal ablation is estimated to be 2.07 +/- 0.70 m w.e. a(-1) for Grey Glacier and 3.26 +/- 0.82 m w.e. a(-1) for Tyndall Glacier between 2000 and 2014. Ice loss by surface ablation exceeds ice loss by frontal ablation for both glaciers. The overall mass balance of Grey and Tyndall glaciers are clearly negative with -1.05 +/- 0.18 m w.e. a(-1) and -2.58 +/- 0.28 m w.e. a(-1) respectively.

TI  - Reduced Zebrafish Transcriptome Atlas toward Understanding Environmental Neurotoxicants
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Transcriptomic approaches monitoring gene responses at genome-scale are increasingly used in toxicological research and help to clarify the molecular mechanisms of adverse effects caused by environmental toxicants. However, their applications for chemical assessment are hampered due to high expenses required and more importantly the lack of in-depth data mining and mechanistic perspectives. Here, we described a reduced transcriptome atlas (RTA) approach which integrates transcriptomic data sets and a comprehensive panel of genes generated to represent neurogenesis and the early neuronal development of zebrafish, to determine the potential neurodevelopmental toxicities of environmental chemicals. Transcriptomic data sets of 74 chemicals and 736 related gene expression profiles were integrated resulting in 135 exposure signatures. Chemical prioritization demonstrated four sets of hits to be neurotoxic: neuro-active chemicals (representatively, Valproic acid, VPA and Carbamazepine, CAR), xenoestrogens (Bisphenol A, BPA; Genistein, GEN; 17-alpha ethinylestradiol, EE2), microcystins (cyanopeptolin, CP1020; microcystin-LR, MCLR) and heavy metals (AgNO3, AgNPs). The enriched biological pathways and processes were distinct among the four sets, while the overlapping functional enrichments were observed within each set, for example, over 25% differentially expressed genes and four of top five KEGG pathways were shared between VPA and CAR. Furthermore, gene expression index (GEI) analysis demonstrated that a gene panel with 300 genes was sufficient to effectively characterize and cluster chemicals and therefore offer an efficient and cost-effective tool for the prioritization of neurotoxicants. Thus, the RTA approach provides novel insights into the understanding of the in-depth molecular mechanisms of environmental neurotoxicants and can be used as an indication for potential adverse outcomes.

TI  - Application of a carbon nanoparticle suspension for sentinel lymph node mapping in patients with early breast cancer: a retrospective cohort study
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: To stage axillary lymph nodes in women with early-stage breast cancer, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB),rather than axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), has been employed. Moreover, different tracer methods have various advantages and disadvantages. In recent years, carbon nanoparticle suspensions (CNSs) have been used as lymph node tracers during surgeries for thyroid cancer, gastric cancer, and colorectal cancer. The study retrospectively analyzed the feasibility and accuracy of CNS for sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping in patients with early breast cancer.Methods: This single-center, retrospective study included breast cancer patients who underwent SLNB from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2017, in the Department of Breast Cancer, Guangdong General Hospital. All patients received standard SLNB surgery using a CNS tracer.Results: A total of 332 cases were included in this study. The SLN identification rate was 99.1% (329/332), and the mean number of SLNs was 2.6 (range, 1-6). SLN metastasis was found in 62 (18.8%) cases, of which 90.3% were found to be macrometastases. The sensitivity of SLNB was 95.9% (47/49), with a specificity of 100% (42/42), a positive predictive value of 100% (47/47), a negative predictive value of 95.5% (42/44), and a false-negative rate of 4.1% (2/49).Conclusion: The identification and predictive values of a CNS tracer for SLNB were satisfactory.

TI  - Assessing the multi-scale predictive ability of ecosystem functional attributes for species distribution modelling
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Global environmental changes are rapidly affecting species' distributions and habitat suitability worldwide, requiring a continuous update of biodiversity status to support effective decisions on conservation policy and management. In this regard, satellite-derived Ecosystem Functional Attributes (EFAs) offer a more integrative and quicker evaluation of ecosystem responses to environmental drivers and changes than climate and structural or compositional landscape attributes. Thus, EFAs may hold advantages as predictors in Species Distribution Models (SDMs) and for implementing multi-scale species monitoring programs. Here we describe a modelling framework to assess the predictive ability of EFAs as Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) against traditional datasets (climate, land-cover) at several scales. We test the framework with a multi-scale assessment of habitat suitability for two plant species of conservation concern, both protected under the EU Habitats Directive, differing in terms of life history, range and distribution pattern (Iris boissieri and Taxus baccata). We fitted four sets of SDMs for the two test species, calibrated with: interpolated climate variables; landscape variables; EFAs; and a combination of climate and landscape variables. EFA-based models performed very well at the several scales (AUC(median) from 0.881 +/- 0.072 to 0.983 +/- 0.125), and similarly to traditional climate-based models, individually or in combination with land-cover predictors (AUC(median) from 0.882 +/- 0.059 to 0.995 +/- 0.083). Moreover, EFA-based models identified additional suitable areas and provided valuable information on functional features of habitat suitability for both test species (narrowly vs. widely distributed), for both coarse and fine scales. Our results suggest a relatively small scale-dependence of the predictive ability of satellite-derived EFAs, supporting their use as meaningful EBVs in SDMs from regional and broader scales to more local and finer scales. Since the evaluation of species' conservation status and habitat quality should as far as possible be performed based on scalable indicators linking to meaningful processes, our framework may guide conservation managers in decision-making related to biodiversity monitoring and reporting schemes.

TI  - Technical note: A low-cost albedometer for snow and ice measurements - theoretical results and application on a tropical mountain in Bolivia
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTATION METHODS AND DATA SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a new instrument called a lowcost albedometer (LCA) composed of two illuminance sensors that are used to measure in situ incident and reflected illuminance values on a daily timescale. The ratio between reflected vs. incident illuminances is called the albedo index and can be compared with actual albedo values. Due to the shape of the sensor, the direct radiation for zenith angles ranging from 55 to 90 degrees is not measured. The spectral response of the LCA varies with the solar irradiance wavelengths within the range 0.26 to 1.195 mu m, and the LCA detects 85% of the total spectral solar irradiance for clear sky conditions. We first consider the theoretical results obtained for 10 different ice and snow surfaces with clear sky and cloudy sky incident solar irradiance that show that the LCA spectral response may be responsible for an overestimation of the theoretical albedo values by roughly 9% at most. Then, the LCA values are compared with two "traditional" albedometers, which are CM3 pyranometers (Kipp & Zonen), in the shortwave domain from 0.305 to 2.800 mu m over a 1-year measurement period (2013) for two sites in a tropical mountainous catchment in Bolivia. One site is located on the Zongo Glacier (i.e., snow and ice surfaces) and the second one is found on the crest of the lateral moraine (bare soil and snow surfaces), which present a horizontal surface and a sky view factor of 0.98. The results, at daily time steps (256 days), given by the LCA are in good agreement with the classic albedo measurements taken with pyranometers with R-2 = 0 : 83 (RMSD = 0.10) and R-2 = 0 : 92 (RMSD = 0.08) for the Zongo Glacier and the right-hand side lateral moraine, respectively. This demonstrates that our system performs well and thus provides relevant opportunities to document spatiotemporal changes in the surface albedo from direct observations at the scale of an entire catchment at a low cost. Finally, during the period from September 2015 to June 2016, direct observations were collected with 15 LCAs on the Zongo Glacier and successfully compared with LANDSAT images showing the surface conditions of the glacier (i.e., snow or ice). This comparison illustrates the efficiency of this system to monitor the daily time step changes in the snow and ice coverage distributed on the glacier. Despite the limits imposed by the angle view restrictions, the LCA can be used between 4 degrees N and 45 degrees S during the ablation season (spring and summer) when the melt rate related to the albedo is the most important.

TI  - Ice velocity of Jakobshavn Isbræ, Petermann Glacier, Nioghalvfjerdsfjorden, and Zacharias Isstrom, 2015-2017, from Sentinel 1-a/b SAR imagery
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Systematically monitoring Greenland's outlet glaciers is central to understanding the timescales over which their flow and sea level contributions evolve. In this study we use data from the new Sentinel-la/b satellite constellation to generate 187 velocity maps, covering four key outlet glaciers in Greenland: Jakobshavn Isbrae, Petermann Glacier, Nioghalvfjerdsfjorden, and Zacharia IsstrOm. These data provide a new high temporal resolution record (6-day averaged solutions) of each glacier's evolution since 2014, and resolve recent seasonal speedup periods and inter-annual changes in Greenland outlet glacier speed with an estimated certainty of 10 %. We find that since 2012, Jakobshavn Isbra: has been decelerating, and now flows approximately 1250 m yr(-1) (10 %), slower than 5 years previously, thus reversing an increasing trend in ice velocity that has persisted during the last decade. Despite this, we show that seasonal variability in ice velocity remains significant: up to 750 m yr(-1) (14 %) at a distance of 12 km inland of the terminus We also use our new dataset to estimate the duration of speedup periods (80-95 days) and to demonstrate a strong relationship between ice front position and ice flow at Jakobshavn Isbrx, with increases in speed of similar to 1800 m yr(-1) in response to 1 km of retreat. Elsewhere, we record significant seasonal changes in flow of up to 25 % (2015) and 18 % (2016) at Petermann Glacier and Zacharias Isstrom, respectively. This study provides a first demonstration of the capacity of a new era of operational radar satellites to provide frequent and timely monitoring of ice sheet flow, and to better resolve the timescales over which glacier dynamics evolve.

TI  - Opposite Aerosol Index-Cloud Droplet Effective Radius Correlations Over Major Industrial Regions and Their Adjacent Oceans
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) C6 L3 and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA-Interim reanalysis data from 2003 to 2016 are employed to study aerosol-cloud correlations over three industrial regions and their adjacent oceans, as well as explore the impact of meteorological conditions on the correlations. The analysis focusing on liquid and single-layer clouds indicates an opposite aerosol-cloud correlation between land and ocean; namely, cloud effective radius is positively correlated with aerosol index over industrial regions (positive slopes), but negatively correlated over their adjacent oceans (negative slopes), for a quasi-constant liquid water path. The positive slopes are relatively large under low lower-tropospheric stability (LTS; weakly stable condition), but much weaker or even become negative under high LTS (stable conditions) and high liquid water path. The occurrence frequency of cloud top height (CTH) and LTS suggests that positive correlations are more likely corresponding to relatively high CTH and low LTS, while negative to low CTH and high LTS.Plain Language Summary Aerosol-cloud interactions play an important role in climate prediction, but remain to have large uncertainties. The major industrial regions generally exhibit relatively high aerosol concentrations, and how aerosols impact cloud properties, and how aerosol-cloud interactions modulate cloud and precipitation processes, is an interesting and challenging topic. In this study, a new retrieval from long-term satellite data is employed to examine the correlation between aerosol concentration and cloud droplet size over the three industrial regions and their adjacent oceans. The results show the opposite aerosol-cloud correlation between land and ocean. Positive slopes are more likely associated with high cloud top height and low lower-tropospheric stability. This finding is very useful to the communities for an accurate prediction of weather and climate.

TI  - Characterizing Global Ozonesonde Profile Variability From Surface to the UT/LS With a Clustering Technique and MERRA-2 Reanalysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Our previous studies employing the self-organizing map (SOM) clustering technique to ozonesonde data have found significant links among meteorological and chemical regimes, and the shape of the ozone (O-3) profile from the troposphere to the lower stratosphere. Those studies, which focused on specific northern hemisphere midlatitude geographical regions, demonstrated the advantages of SOM clustering by quantifying O-3 profile variability and the O-3/meteorological correspondence. We expand SOM to a global set of ozonesonde profiles spanning 1980 to present from 30 sites to summarize the connections among O-3 profiles, meteorology, and chemistry, using the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2) reanalysis and other ancillary data. Four clusters of O-3 mixing ratio profiles from the surface to the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere (UT/LS) are generated for each site, which show dominant profile shapes and typical seasonality (or lack thereof) that generally correspond to latitude (i.e., tropical, subtropical, midlatitude, and polar). Examination of MERRA-2 output reveals a clear relationship among SOM clusters and covarying meteorological fields (geopotential height, potential vorticity, and tropopause height) for polar and midlatitude sites. However, these relationships break down within +/- 30 degrees latitude. Carbon monoxide satellite data, along with velocity potential, a proxy for convection, calculated from MERRA-2 wind fields assist characterization of the tropical and subtropical sites, where biomass burning and convective transport linked to the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) dominate O-3 variability. In addition to geophysical characterization of O-3 profile variability, these results can be used to evaluate chemical transport model output and satellite measurements of O-3 profiles.

TI  - Impact of Moisture Information From Advanced Himawari Imager Measurements on Heavy Precipitation Forecasts in a Regional NWP Model
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Information about moisture distribution and transportation in the preconvection environment is very important for nowcasting and forecasting severe weather events. The Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) onboard the Japanese Himawari-8/-9 provides high temporal and spatial resolution moisture information useful for weather monitoring and forecasting. Algorithms have been developed for three-layered precipitable water (LPW: surface to 0.9, 0.9-0.7, and 0.7-0.3 in sigma vertical coordinate) retrievals from AHI infrared band radiances using a Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-R series algorithm working group algorithm. The LPW products from AHI have been validated with in situ measurements. An important application of the AHI LPW product is to improve local severe storm forecasts through assimilating high temporal and spatial resolution moisture information into regional- and storm-scale numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. Assimilation techniques and approaches have been developed; the impact on precipitation forecasts for local severe storm over land from the assimilation of LPWs from AHI shows improvement on heavy precipitation forecasts over those from the assimilation of conventional data. Comparisons between AHI infrared band radiance assimilation and LPW assimilation show overall similar or comparable impact on precipitation forecast. The approaches for assimilating LPW can be applied to the assimilation of data from other advanced imagers such as the Advanced Baseline Imager onboard the U.S. next generation of Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites-R series, the Advanced Geosynchronous Radiation Imager onboard the Chinese FengYun-4 series, and the Flexible Combined Imager onboard the upcoming European Meteosat Third Generation.

TI  - Local Radiative Feedbacks Over the Arctic Based on Observed Short-Term Climate Variations
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We compare various radiative feedbacks over the Arctic (60-90 degrees N) estimated from short-term climate variations occurring in reanalysis, satellite, and global climate model data sets using the combined Kernel-Gregory approach. The lapse rate and surface albedo feedbacks are positive, and their magnitudes are comparable. Relative to the tropics (30 degrees S-30 degrees N), the lapse rate feedback is the largest contributor to Arctic amplification among all feedbacks, followed by surface albedo feedback and Planck feedback deviation from its global mean. Both shortwave and longwave water vapor feedbacks are positive, leading to a significant positive net water vapor feedback over the Arctic. The net cloud feedback has large uncertainties including its sign, which strongly depends on the data used for all-sky and clear-sky radiative fluxes at the top of the atmosphere, the time periods considered, and the methods used to estimate the cloud feedback.Plain Language Summary The Arctic has warmed dramatically in recent decades, with temperature increasing at a rate of about twice as fast as the global mean value. This phenomenon, commonly known as Arctic amplification, has been found in the observed and modeled climate changes. Several feedback mechanisms have been shown to contribute to Arctic amplification, but their relative importance is still very uncertain. Here we use a variety of reanalysis and satellite data sets to quantify the Arctic local feedbacks based on short-term climate variations, evaluate the feedbacks simulated in a global climate model, diagnose the impact of data set choices on the feedback estimates, and identify the sources of main uncertainties. The most disagreement is found in the estimate of cloud feedback.

TI  - A fusion-based methodology for meteorological drought estimation using remote sensing data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - An effective planning and management to deal with potential impacts of drought requires accurate estimation and analysis of this natural complex phenomenon. Application of new fusion approaches using high-resolution satellite-based products, unlike ground-based observations, can provide accurate drought analysis. This study examines three advanced fusion-based methodologies including Ordered Weighted Averaged (OWA) approach based on ORNESS weighting method (ORNESS-OWA) and ORLIKE weighting method (ORLIKE-OWA) as well as K-nearest neighbors algorithm (KNN) to fuse estimations by five individual estimator models using different remotely sensed data products. The precipitation data from Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP), CPC Merged Analysis of Precipitation (CMAP), CICS High-Resolution Optimal Interpolation Microwave Precipitation from Satellites (CHOMPS), Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate Data Record (PERSIANN-CDR), Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), The second Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-2) and Global Land Data Assimilation System Version-2 (GLDAS-2) products is utilized in estimating nonparametric-SPI as a meteorological drought index versus ground-based observations analysis. To achieve more accurate drought estimation, ground-based observations are classified in different clusters based on K-means clustering algorithm. Five individual Artificial Intelligence (AI) models including Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), M5P model tree, Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) are developed for each cluster and their best results are used in fusion process. In addition, the Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimization model is utilized to determine optimal weights in weighting methods. Estimation performance of all models are evaluated using statistical error indices of Mean Absolute Relative Error (MARE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and coefficient of determination (R-2). Application of proposed methodology is verified over Fars province in Iran and the results are compared. Results showed that ORNESS-OWA method with lowest estimation error (MARE of 2.51% and R-2 of 95%) had the superb performance in comparison with all other individual AI and fusion-based models. Also, the proposed framework based on remotely sensed precipitation data and fusion-based models demonstrated an effective proficiency in drought estimation.

TI  - Retrieving surface soil moisture at high spatio-temporal resolution from a synergy between Sentinel-1 radar and Landsat thermal data: A study case over bare soil
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Radar data have been used to retrieve and monitor the surface soil moisture (SM) changes in various conditions. However, the calibration of radar models whether empirically or physically-based, is still subject to large uncertainties especially at high-spatial resolution. To help calibrate radar-based retrieval approaches to supervising SM at high resolution, this paper presents an innovative synergistic method combining Sentinel-1 (Si) microwave and Landsat-7/8 (L7/8) thermal data. First, the S1 backscatter coefficient was normalized by its maximum and minimum values obtained during 2015-2016 agriculture season. Second, the normalized S1 backscatter coefficient was calibrated from reference points provided by a thermal-derived SM proxy named soil evaporative efficiency (SEE, defined as the ratio of actual to potential soil evaporation). SEE was estimated as the radiometric soil temperature normalized by its minimum and maximum values reached in a water-saturated and dry soil, respectively. We estimated both soil temperature endmembers by using a soil energy balance model forced by available meteorological forcing. The proposed approach was evaluated against in situ SM measurements collected over three bare soil fields in a semi-arid region in Morocco and we compared it against a classical approach based on radar data only. The two polarizations VV (vertical transmit and receive) and VH (vertical transmit and horizontal receive) of the S1 data available over the area are tested to analyse the sensitivity of radar signal to SM at high incidence angles (39 degrees-43 degrees). We found that the VV polarization was better correlated to SM than the VH polarization with a determination coefficient of 0.47 and 0.28, respectively. By combining Si (VV) and L7/8 data, we reduced the root mean square difference between satellite and in situ SM to 0.03 m(3) m(-3) which is far smaller than 0.16 m(3) m(-3) when using SI (VV) only.

TI  - Mapping soil moisture with the OPtical TRApezoid Model (OPTRAM) based on long-term MODIS observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Optical TRApezoid Model (OPTRAM) has recently been proposed for estimation of soil moisture using only optical remote sensing data. The model relies on a physical linear relationship between the soil moisture content and shortwave infrared transformed reflectance (SIR) and can be parameterized universally (i.e., a single calibration for a given area) based on the pixel distribution within the STR-Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) trapezoidal space. The main motivation for this study was to evaluate how the universal parameterization of OPTRAM works for long periods of time (e.g., several decades). This is especially relevant for uncovering the soil moisture and agricultural drought history in response to climate change in different regions. In this study, MODIS satellite observations from 2001 to 2017 were acquired and used for the analysis. Cosmic ray neutron (CRN) soil moisture data, collected with the Cosmic-ray Soil Moisture Observing System (COSMOS) at five different sites in the U.S. covering diverse climates, soil types, and land covers, were applied for evaluation of the MODIS-OPTRAM-based soil moisture estimates. The OPTRAM soil moisture estimates were further compared to the Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) (L-band), the Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) (L band), and the Advanced AScatterometer (ASCAT) (C-band) soil moisture retrievals. OPTRAM soil moisture data were also analyzed for potential monitoring of agricultural drought through comparison of the OPTRAM-based Soil Water Deficit Index (OPTRAM-SWDI) with the widely-applied Crop Moisture Index (CMI). Evaluation results indicate that OPTRAM-based soil moisture estimates provide overall unbiased RMSE and R between 0.050 and 0.085 cm(3) cm(-3) and 0.10 to 0.70, respectively, for all investigated sites. The performance of OPTRAM is comparable with the ASCAT retrievals, but slightly less accurate than SMAP and SMOS. OPTRAM and the three microvave satellites captured CRN soil moisture temporal dynamics very well for all five investigated sites. A close agreement was observed between the OPTRAM-SWDI and CMI drought indices for most selected sites. In conclusion, OPTRAM can estimate temporal soil moisture dynamics with reasonable accuracy for a range of climatic conditions (semi-arid to humid), soil types, and land covers, and can potentially be applied for agricultural drought monitoring.

TI  - Surveillance of sensitive fenced areas using duty-cycled wireless sensor networks with asymmetrical links
T2  - JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a cross-layer communication protocol for Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) enabled surveillance system for sensitive fenced areas, e.g., nuclear/oil site. Initially, the proposed protocol identifies the boundary nodes of the deployed WSN to be used as sentinel nodes, i.e., nodes that are always in active state. The remaining nodes are used as duty-cycled relay nodes during the data communication phase. The boundary nodes identification process and data routing are both performed using an enhanced version of the Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing (GPSR) protocol, which relies on a Non Unit Disk Graph (N-UDG) and referred to as GPSR over Symmetrical Links (GPSR-SL). Both greedy and perimeter modes of GPSR-SL forward data through symmetrical links only. Moreover, we apply the Mutual Witness (MW) fix to the Gabriel Graph (GG) planarization, to enable a correct perimeter routing on a N-UDG. Simulation results show that the proposed protocol achieves higher packet delivery ratio by up to 3.63%, energy efficiency and satisfactory latency when compared to the same protocol based on the original GPSR.

TI  - A novel method to retrieve the nocturnal boundary layer structure based on CCD laser aerosol detection system measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mixing layer height (MLH) is a key parameter for evaluating the transport and diffusion of atmospheric pollutants in both air quality forecasting and satellite data retrieval. However, there is a lack of methods for obtaining the nocturnal MLH. In this study, a novel instrument named the charge-coupled device-laser aerosol detection system (CCD-LADS) was developed to study the nocturnal MLH and boundary layer structure from the surface. The system mainly includes a continuous laser and a charge-coupled device camera with a fisheye lens. Structures of atmospheric layers characterized by the CCD-LADS were compared with those measured by a ceilometer. The heights of two atmospheric layers quantified by measurements with the CCD-LADS and the ceilometer show good agreement, with a relative difference of 5%. The results of this comparison demonstrated that the CCD-LADS is capable of distinctly identifying the nocturnal vertical structure of the atmosphere. The advantage of the CCD-LADS in retrieving the nocturnal MLH is that the CCD-LADS can provide the boundary layer structures under 100 m, while the ceilometer and other lidar measurements cannot retrieve the atmospheric structures below that altitude. CCD-LADS was deployed in a comprehensive field campaign measuring air pollution in the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, located at the border between the North China Plain and Yanshan Mountain, during January 2016. The fine characteristics and patterns of the nocturnal boundary layer structures were derived with the CCD-LADS measurements.
