AB  - The transparency of water bodies is an important indicator for evaluating water quality and plays an important role in the water ecosystem. With the help of remote sensing technology, large-scale, real-time data can be obtained, and it has the advantage of saving manpower and material resources. According to the Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat-8 OLI satellite data band settings, the Lake Daihai water body transparency retrieved model is established based on the measured transparency data and spectral data of Lake Daihai in this study. The results show that: 1) Among the transparency retrieved model established in this study, the blue-red band ratio quadratic model has the best retrieved accuracy than the quadratic model (R-2 = 0.66, RMSE = 24.02, MAPE = 21.24%). 2) Applying the blue-red band ratio quadratic model to Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI satellite data, the transparency retrieved accuracy is better (MAPE<28.82%, RMSE<23.26 cm, R-2>0.60). 3) This algorithm is applied to MSI and OLI images, and the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of the transparency of the Lake Daihai water body are obtained. The results showed that the average annual change range was 90.71-120.77 cm, the average transparency in 2015 was the highest, and the average transparency in 2013 was the lowest. The monthly range changed from 90.68 to 122.53 cm, the average transparency in July was the highest, and the average transparency in May was the lowest. The spatial distribution trend of Lake Daihai's water transparency is roughly high in the northwest, low in the southeast, high in the middle, and low in the central. 4) The main factors affecting the transparency of the Lake Daihai water body are wind speed and precipitation. The transparency and wind speed, pre-cipitation have a significant negative correlation and positive correlation, respectively.

TI  - Performativity and Expressive Dissent in Portugal in the 1980s and the case of Pop Dell'Arte
T2  - BIBLOS-REVISTA DA FACULDADE DE LETRAS DA UNIVERSIDADE DE COIMBRA
M3  - Article
AB  - The analysis of a diverse set of sociability and cultural trends of the 1980s in Portugal allows us to observe the expansion of a dissident type of experimentalism and aesthetic performance which, going back to the vanguards of the early 20th century, is extended, in this decade, to the Portuguese culture. These demonstrations are an artistic expression in which performativity lato sensu plays a major role in the country's cultural and artistic renewal. The present study frames this phenomenon as a specific cultural manifestation of the Portuguese worldview in the 1980s, building up the paradigmatic case of the Pop Dell'Arte band as well as on possible historical reasons for its unfolding.

TI  - Quantifying methane emissions in Delaware from field-based mid-IR sensors and satellite observations
T2  - GEOSPATIAL INFORMATICS XI
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Geospatial Informatics XI
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - It is estimated that about 60 percent of total global methane emissions are thought to be from anthropogenic sources and about 40 percent from natural sources. Anthropogenic sources encompass a wide range of human activities, including food and energy production and waste disposal. Livestock (through fermentation processes in their digestive system that generates methane and manure management), rice cultivation, landfills, and sewage account for 55-57 percent of global anthropogenic emissions. This paper investigates methane emissions from agricultural land-use and livestock (e.g., poultry and cattle) farming practices in Delaware. Laser-based point sensing can provide a higher spatial and temporal resolution that can complement satellite observations to identify individual sources and broader geographical areas. A detailed understanding of their sources and sinks is necessary to model emissions profile accurately. This paper shows field measurements of methane using mid-IR laser-based sensors and validation with satellite data. We conducted our field deployment locally in the Delaware, Kent, and Sussex county regions focusing on high methane emitting areas. We used the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) methane satellite data to get a unified emissions map of methane production in Delaware by comparing our ground-based measurements with the satellite data. Furthermore, we examined the satellite data for long-term methane emissions trends to quantify 2020 average methane emissions.

TI  - Land use and land cover changes (LUCC) in the tributary drainage basins of Escaba Reservoir during the period 1986-2010
T2  - Serie Conservacion de la Naturaleza
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover changes have been studied in different regions of the world and it has been demonstrated that their effects, combined to the current trends in climate change, have negative consequences for human societies and ecosystems. This paper presents the results of a study of changes in land use and land cover that took place over the period 1986-2010 in the drainage basins of Escaba reservoir, Tucuman, Northwest Argentina (NOA, for its acronym in Spanish). To meet the proposed objectives, the techniques employed were preprocessing and supervised classification of Landsat TM images of dates: 08/23/1986, 08/18/1996 y 08/21/2010. A confusion matrix analysis was performed on the land cover maps obtained to determine their adjustment to terrain characteristics. Also, the magnitude of change in the surface was quantified for each land cover type identified in the study area. The detected changes revealed that during the period 1986-1996, the processes of deforestation and forest recovery occurred simultaneously in different places across the study area. In the period 1996-2010, the processes were stabilized; however, the increase of forest surface in the upper areas of the studied basins was evident. The detected changes related to forest recovery would be related to rural-urban migration and the consequent abandonment of agricultural lands, while the advance of forests over areas previously covered by grasslands can be linked to the effects of global warming at a regional scale.

TI  - Surgical complications comparing extraperitoneal vs transperitoneal laparoscopic aortic staging in early stage ovarian and endometrial cancer
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. To determine whether the extraperitoneal approach for paraaortic staging lymphadenectomy results in a lower rate of surgical complications compared to the transperitoneal approach, without compromising oncological outcomes.Methods. Prospective randomized multicenter study of patients with early endometrial or ovarian cancer undergoing paraaortic lymphadenectomy in 2010-2019. Patients were randomized to minimally invasive surgery (laparoscopy or robotic-assisted) using an extraperitoneal or a transperitoneal approach. The primary end point measure was a composite outcome that included developing one or more of the following surgical complications: bleeding during paraaortic lymphadenectomy >= 500 mL, any intraoperative complication related to paraaortic lymphadenectomy, severe postoperative complication (Dindo >= IIIA), impossibility to complete the procedure, or conversion to laparotomy.Results. There were 103 patients in the extraperitoneal group and 100 in the transperitoneal group. Differences in the composite outcome (transperitoneal 26.0% vs, extraperitoneal 18.4%; P = 0.195) were not found. Differences in the operative time, conversion to laparotomy, intraoperative bleeding, or survival were not observed. A higher number of lymph nodes were retrieved through the extraperitoneal approached (median, interquartile range [IQR] 12 [7-17] vs, 14 [10-19]: P = 0.026). Older age and greater body mass index (BMI) or waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) increased the risk for surgical complications independently of the laparoscopic approach.Conclusions. The extraperitoneal approach did not show differences regarding surgical and oncological parameters compared with the transperitoneal approach, although the number of aortic nodes retrieved was higher. The decision to use one or another laparoscopic route is a matter of the surgeon preference. Published by Elsevier Inc.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - International Conference on Environment, Resources and Earth Sciences (ICERES)
CL  - Ho Chi Minh City, VIETNAM
AB  - This study used 487 MODIS MCD43A4 images, 1-day resolution, 500-meter spatial resolution to evaluate the efficiency of using the MODIS image series in monitoring the rice planting calendar in the Mekong Delta in 2019. The Savitzky-Golay filter method was applied to eliminate noise and smooth the time series of NDVI imagery. The rice plating date was then determined using TIMESAT software based on the threshold of increasing NDVI to 20% of the amplitude each season. The reliability of the model for mapping rice planting calendar was evaluated by compared to field data and local statistics. The results showed that the series of MODIS MCD43A4 images was used effectively in map of rice planting calendar for the Winter-Spring season, with area error was less than 10% and different of sowing date was less than 15 days (N = 21, MAE = 15 days, RMSE = 18 days). However, the series of MCD43A4 images was limited in monitoring the rice crop calendar of the other two remaining seasons (Summer-Autumn and Autumn-Winter) with an area error was greater than 30% and a higher difference in the time of sowing compared to the Winter-Spring season, especially in the Autumn-Winter season (N = 20, MAE = 22 days, RMSE = 23 days). The above results showed that the MODIS image series was effectively used in the dry season (Winter-Spring) and limited in the rainy season due to the influence of weather and clouds. Further studies combining the use of other types of satellite images or methods to replace cloud-affected pixels needed to be taken into consideration.

AB  - In Europe, the diversity in religions, cultures, languages and historical backgrounds is enormous. World War II and the Soviet Regime have played a large part in this and the flow of refugees from other continents increases the pluralism. How can religious education add to bridging between differences? The language across European countries is different, literally between countries, but also figuratively speaking and even inside individual countries. These differences occur in cultural sense and across age groups as well. Secondary education has the task to form young people to become firmly rooted people who can hold their own in society. It is essential that they learn to examine their own core values and their roots. Recognising their values should be a main focus of religious education. However, schools are currently accommodating increasing numbers of non-religious pupils. What role do religious values still play in this situation? How do pupils feel about active involvement in religious institutions, and about basing life choices on religious beliefs? Can other, non-religious values be detected which could form the basis for value-oriented personal formation? Research of these subjects has been ongoing in the Netherlands for more than twenty years and is currently being expanded to the Czech Republic and (former East) Germany. These are also secularized countries but have a very different history. Does the history and context of these countries play a role, and does this show in the values that are important to pupils? A comparative pilot study is being conducted as start of this broadening perspective geared towards greater insight into the values of pupils in these three European countries. This information helps to design appropriate new forms of religious value-oriented worldview education.

TI  - Detection of Forest Fire Risk Areas of Zonguldak and Eregli Regional Forest Directorate
T2  - GEOMATIK
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays, detecting the recent increase in naturally caused or human induced forest fires by using the techniques of Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems has become quite crucial for fire management and planning. Mapping the risk areas of forest fires for fighting will be very beneficial in terms of labour, time and cost. In relation with the fighting forest fire, the forest fire risk maps partially reveal the factors that affect the fire outbreak and its course. Under the conditions of our country, the crucial use and help of these maps, particularly the ones related with the human factors in the land categories for evaluating the forest fire risk, have been clearly comprehended. In this study, a total of 126 forest fires that occur within the Zonguldak and Eregli regional forest directorate between 2008 to 2019 were investigated using forest fire information form. Human factors, topographic factors and land use categories that caused fire in outbreak area were identified. The vector illustrations related to the settlements and road networks were made on Google Earth. For the topographic data, Digital Elevation Model input was used. The classification processes were carried out through Landsat 8 satellite data for the land usage data and the classes that had been subjected to the fires were identified, respectively. The congruity scores evaluated for corresponding factors were determined by Analytical Hierarchy Process method. The forest fire risk map was produced in Geographic Information Systems according to these results. Additionally, the low, medium and high risk groups were classified on it. It has been seen that 18% of the area was in low, 43% was in medium and %39 of it was in high forest fire risk group. For the accuracy validation of classified map, the discriminant analysis was performed. It has been observed that the importance of classifying fire risk groups of study area was 86% in relation with the assessment of fire risk index values obtained by the analysis that was conducted in this study. Being a significant base for interception of forest fires and fire management, this research might also be improved for other fire sensitive regions.

TI  - Development of GIS models via optical programming and python scripts to implement four empirical methods of reference and actual evapotranspiration (ETo, ETa) incorporating MODIS LST inputs
T2  - REMOTE SENSING FOR AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS, AND HYDROLOGY XXIII
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing for Agriculture, Ecosystems, and Hydrology XXIII
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - The purpose of the study was the development of GIS models implementing two empirical methods of reference evapotranspiration (ETo), namely FAO-56 Penman-Monteith (FAO-56 PM) and Hansen, and two empirical methods of actual evapotranspiration (ETa), namely Turc and Corrected Turc (CT). GIS software (ArcMap 10.6) model builder environment was used for model-implementation, though the models could be easily transferred in relative software types (e.g. QGIS, ERDAS). The affordances of the presented models are flexibility and applicability to any study area (using the corresponding raster images of remote-derived or interpolated data as inputs), cell-by-cell calculations (estimates for the continuum of space) and dual representation of the empirical formulae; as optical models and as python scripts. The first one constitutes a user-friendly interface of optical, schematical programming for interdisciplinary users with no programming cognitive pre-requirement. The second representation is in python language, a rather established and simple programming language which provides flexibility of additions and alterations of the proposed scripts. Models' application has been made on Peloponnese, Greece, a complex Land Use Land Cover (LULC) Mediterranean area, engaging MODIS LST Terra day and night inputs which have been acquired from USGS Earth Explorer and NASA EARTH DATA platforms. MODIS LST day and night products have been proved satisfactory proxies of maximum and minimum values (respectively) of local near surface air temperature (Tair). Alternatively, considering overpassing local time for each study-area Aqua or any other satellite products could be used as inputs. Furthermore, 8-day composites of MODIS net evapotranspiration (ET) (MOD16A2V6) have been acquired and compared to model outputs for different time scales and ET types. Corrected Turc and Hansen formulae exhibited estimates satisfactorily close to MODIS ET for different time scales. Overall, the proposed models proved quick and useful tools for water management applications that can be utilized by inexperienced to advanced users.

TI  - CROP TYPE MAPPING IN BULGARIA USING SENTINEL-1/2 DATA
T2  - AEROSPACE RESEARCH IN BULGARIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Advanced possibilities have emerged in the recent years for semi-automatic crop type mapping at national level due to the availability of Sentinel-1 and -2 satellite data. In this study, 14 crop type classes were mapped over Bulgaria using three bi-monthly composite image mosaics for 2019 generated in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform. The overall accuracy when both Sentinel-1 and -2 mosaics were used was 78%, while the accuracy was slightly less when only Sentinel-2 data was used (75%). The accuracy was highest for "Cereals", "Maize", "Sunflower", "Winter rapeseed", and "Rice" - over 80% for both user's and producer's. However, the accuracy for classes such as "Vegetables", "Technical crops", "Forage crops", "Fallow", etc. was low. These classes represent categories suitable for the agricultural practice and statistics but are too general and difficult to distinguish using satellite data. It was found also that accuracy tend to be higher for larger parcels. Using composites with higher frequency and adapting the legend classes to include only crops which are similar in phenology and morphology are suggested as possible ways forward.

TI  - Wide-field aurora imager onboard Fengyun satellite: Data products and validation
T2  - EARTH AND PLANETARY PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - New observations of auroras based on the wide-field aurora imager (WAI) onboard Fengyun-3D (FY-3D) satellite are exhibited in this paper. Validity of the WAI data is analyzed by comparing auroral boundaries derived from WAI observations with results obtained from data collected by the Special Sensor Ultraviolet Spectrographic Imager (SSUSI) aboard the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP F18). Dynamic variations of the aurora with the solar wind, interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) parameters, and the SYM-H index are also investigated. The comparison of auroral boundaries indicates that the WAI data are morphologically valid and suitable to the study of auroral dynamics. Effective responses to solar wind parameters indicate that the WAI data can be useful to monitor and predict the Earth's space weather. Since the configuration of aurora is a good indicator of the solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere (SW-M-I) coupling system, and can reflect the disturbance of the space environment, the WAI will provide important data to help us to study the physical processes in space.

TI  - DETECTING THE SHORELINE CHANGE PATTERN OVER 72 YEARS IN THE MEDITERRANEAN USING AERIAL PHOTOS AND SATELLITE IMAGES A CASE STUDY IN MERSIN, TURKEY
T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal regions can be very sensitive areas depending on their environmental conditions. The best indicator of this situation is the shoreline that has changed over the years. The Mediterranean is an inner sea with a long sandy beach. This beach, which had completely natural conditions in the past, has been under the influence of different uses in recent years including agricultural and other man-made uses. In this study, the aim was to evaluate the coastal movement pattern over the period between 1948 and 2020 (72 years) under different uses according to the current situation. Part of the 4.5 km long coastline that constitutes the study area is subject to industrial use (Track 2) and the other part remains natural (Track 1). It was observed that the pattern determined in the Track 1 field was more regular than the situation in Track 2, and the coastal change in all time intervals was created by the sea. On the other hand, it was observed that the shoreline change in Track 2 was more irregular and that the change in the shoreline between 1969 and 1985 was on the sea side compared to the current coastline (2020), and the others remained on the land side. The results showed that the uses in the coastal zone have affected the change in the shoreline over the years and that these patterns of change can be determined with appropriate dated and scaled aerial photographs and satellite data.

TI  - MONITORING THE CHANGE OF URBAN SETTLEMENT IN 72 YEARS BY USING REMOTE SENSING METHODS A CASE STUDY IN KAZANLI TURKEY
T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Residential areas in the world are tending to spread in general. There are many reasons for that rising such as their locations, physiographic units, closeness to a city or to trade areas, environmental conditions, urbanization plans. and agricultural politics. Each of these factors can affect the spread or stability of urban areas at different powers. For example; if there is the main trade port around a city, this city is under very powerful pressure by that transportation port. It means that city probably will spread too much in the future, On the other hand, if the agricultural policies of the relevant institutions are aimed at the protection and development of agricultural lands, this time there will he more stagnation in settlements. There is both commercial and agricultural pressure due to the location of the Kazanli District in the study area, The Kazanli is centered in the study area and it is only 1 km from the sea in the north direction. Agricultural uses (greenhouses. citrus garden and others) are predominant in this region. Secondly, there are residential use and finally small and large scale factories. The Kazanli settlement occupied 6 ha and 292 ha in 1948 and 2020, respectively. Any factory use has not been identified in the study area in 1948. While the area covered by Kazanli settlement in the study area was approximately 0.22% in 1948. this rate was 10.62% in 2020. The results show that the total increase of Kazanli district (both settlement and factories use) in the study area is 10.40% in 72 years. The biggest reasons for this increase seem to be the proximity of Kazan!" district to Mersin. which has a high commercial potential (port. main highway). On the other hand, it is predicted that the factor that stops the increase in these settlements in 72 years is intensive agricultural (mostly greenhouse) uses around Kazanli district, In this study, it has been observed that the contribution of both aerial photographs and satellite data within the framework of remote sensing methods is very important in detecting such changes in land use over the years.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - International Conference on Environment, Resources and Earth Sciences (ICERES)
CL  - Ho Chi Minh City, VIETNAM
AB  - Environmental quality (EQ) has always been paid more attention in big cities, where urbanization is on the rise because it greatly affects urban natural ecosystems and people's health. The paper presents the results of applying Landsat satellite images to evaluate the Natural Environmental Quality (NEQ) from the integrated index NEQI (Natural Environmental Quality Index) through the calculation of biophysical variables, including vegetation index NDVI, water surface index NDWI, construction index NDBI and land surface temperature LST. The study area is the north of Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), divided into 3 sub-regions for analysis, including 13 old inner-city districts, 6 new inner-city districts, and 4 suburban districts. The results showed that there is a difference in NEQI between inner and suburban areas. Low NEQI is concentrated in urban areas with high urbanization rate, industrial zones, areas with large impervious surface areas and low greenery density. In the suburbs, in contrast, NEQ is better than in the inner city. If considering by the acquisited time of two satellite images in February of 2005 and 2020, the NEQ of the study area showed signs of decreasing and gradually expanding area from the inner city to the suburbs. Particularly in the suburbs, due to the urbanization process in recent years, there are spontaneous and unplanned development areas, so NEQ has changed towards a decrease. The results of the study can be used to support urban environmental planning and management.

AB  - Over the most recent couple of years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has end up being an intriguing and promising worldview that means to add to endless applications by interfacing more physical "things" to the Internet. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) created RPL as the routing protocol for low power and lossy networks (LLNs). RPL (Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks) is a routing protocol for remote sensors with low power consumptions and is flexible to handle. To be useful in various applications of LLN, RPL isolates packet handling and sends information from the same routing objective. In this paper, we mainly focus on analysis and studying existing RPL routing protocol and performance is carried out using Contiki OS. Furthermore, the existing RPL objective function (MRHOF and OF0) are analysis under different metrics such as Packet Delivery, average delay and energy consumption conducted over Cooja with Z1 mote. Finally the result helps in better understanding of the existing objective functions and their performance towards the RPL protocol. This analysis will be useful in providing guidelines for improving the RPL protocol in future works.

TI  - Cultural frontier in the creative works of modern Mansi authors Ye. Anyamov and T. Bakhtiyarova
T2  - VESTNIK UGROVEDENIYA-BULLETIN OF UGRIC STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: the article considers the problem of interaction between folklore and literature from the point of view of the continuity of oral literature traditions and their transformation in the creative work of novice authors - Ye. Anyamov and T. Bakhtiyarova. These authors are the representatives of the Upper Lozva Mansi, the carriers of a cultural tradition, whose authentic folklore and language still preserve a living existence. In contrast to the experience of their predecessors in native literature, for whom the appeal to the oral and poetic heritage was still due to the activation of the process of returning to their historical roots, in the works by Ye. Anyamov and T. Bakhtiyarova folklore borrowings have become a "subtle tool" for revealing the laws of the natural world order. Native speech, which is a familiar form of expression and communication, helps them.Objective: to analyze the specifics of the artistic manifestation of the folklore worldview in the works of modern authors Ye. Anyamov and T. Bakhtiyarova.Research materials: poetic works by Ye. Anyamov; poetic works and fairy tales by T. Bakhtiyarova.Results and novelty of the research: in the Mansi literature, which has a history of less than a century, the folklore tradition is one of the leading ones. Writers who created their works at the intersection of two cultural and historical traditions (the national, rooted in the ancient pagan layers of human culture, and the modern literary and written tradition), enriched world literature with a new vision of the world. Their works, based on the knowledge of their native folklore, have their own figurative system and their own creative style.A new stage in Mansi literature is formed connected with the names of these young authors appealing to the native language and the special borrowing of the folklore heritage. In the continuation of the traditions of Mansi personal songs, the works of the authors captivate the audience not only with their amazing melody, but also with a kind of disclosure of the features of the national world picture, special comprehension of life and death, and the meaning of the ancestral cult.

TI  - A Novel Method for Automated Supraglacial Lake Mapping in Antarctica Using Sentinel-1 SAR Imagery and Deep Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Supraglacial meltwater accumulation on ice sheets can be a main driver for accelerated ice discharge, mass loss, and global sea-level-rise. With further increasing surface air temperatures, meltwater-induced hydrofracturing, basal sliding, or surface thinning will cumulate and most likely trigger unprecedented ice mass loss on the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. While the Greenland surface hydrological network as well as its impacts on ice dynamics and mass balance has been studied in much detail, Antarctic supraglacial lakes remain understudied with a circum-Antarctic record of their spatio-temporal development entirely lacking. This study provides the first automated supraglacial lake extent mapping method using Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery over Antarctica and complements the developed optical Sentinel-2 supraglacial lake detection algorithm presented in our companion paper. In detail, we propose the use of a modified U-Net for semantic segmentation of supraglacial lakes in single-polarized Sentinel-1 imagery. The convolutional neural network (CNN) is implemented with residual connections for optimized performance as well as an Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) module for multiscale feature extraction. The algorithm is trained on 21,200 Sentinel-1 image patches and evaluated in ten spatially or temporally independent test acquisitions. In addition, George VI Ice Shelf is analyzed for intra-annual lake dynamics throughout austral summer 2019/2020 and a decision-level fused Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 maximum lake extent mapping product is presented for January 2020 revealing a more complete supraglacial lake coverage (similar to 770 km(2)) than the individual single-sensor products. Classification results confirm the reliability of the proposed workflow with an average Kappa coefficient of 0.925 and a F1-score of 93.0% for the supraglacial water class across all test regions. Furthermore, the algorithm is applied in an additional test region covering supraglacial lakes on the Greenland ice sheet which further highlights the potential for spatio-temporal transferability. Future work involves the integration of more training data as well as intra-annual analyses of supraglacial lake occurrence across the whole continent and with focus on supraglacial lake development throughout a summer melt season and into Antarctic winter.

AB  - Mangrove ecosystems have crucial functions in the sustainability of coastal areas. However, land conversion from mangrove forest to other land cover is unavoidable - including mangrove forest areas in Muaragembong, Kabupaten Bekasi, West Java, Indonesia. Muaragembong has been facing physical and anthropogenic threats to its sustainability. Mangrove forest monitoring is, therefore, fundamental to determine the preventive and responsive actions. This study analyzed the mangrove cover changes of Muaragembong for the last 30 years (1990-2020) using Google Earth Engine (GEE). The extraction of 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020 images was from Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM+, Landsat 5 TM, and Landsat 8 OLI respectively. This study used Mangrove Vegetation Index (MVI) to enhance the images, which considers the greenness and humidity in itsequation. The results showed that the mangrove areas in Muaragembong decreased from 1991 to 2000 (41.16%), gradually increased from 2000 to 2010 (20.05%), strongly increased from 2010 to 2020 (181.39%). The mangrove area of Muaragembong was 550.52 hectares in 1991, 323.91 hectares in 2000, 388.85 hectares in 2010, and 1,094 hectares in 2020. The trends followed the presence and absence of mangrove conservation actions in the given year or period.

AB  - This paper overviews two interdependent issues important for mining remote sensing data (e.g. images) obtained from atmospheric monitoring missions. The first issue relates to building new public datasets and benchmarks, which are hot priority of the remote sensing community. The second issue is to investigate deep learning methodologies for atmospheric data classification based on vast amount of data and without ground truth or with very limited ground truth. The targeted application is air quality assessment and prediction. Air quality is defined as the pollution level linked with several atmospheric constituent such as gases and aerosols. Low levels of air quality and thus high levels of air pollution led to increase in public health issues. The target application is the development of a fast prediction model for local and regional air quality assessment and tracking. The results of mining data will have significant implication for citizen and decision makers by providing a fast prediction and reliable air quality monitoring system able to cover the local and regional scale through intelligent extrapolation of sparse ground-based in situ measurement networks.

AB  - This paper examines the political thoughts of Neo-Confucianists in the early Joseon period, especially around the 16th century, through their historical consciousness and philosophical grounds. And it is concluded that their practical discourse was the logic of reform to solve the problems of the previous period as a collective intelligence or spirit of the times, and it was not completed by any one individual at any one moment. At least, through Jeongam, Toegye, and Yulgok, they realized their logic. They had high ideals, but to that extent they tried to accurately read the problems of reality, and also tried to make the most of the social system established in the previous period. However, their goal was not simply to recover to a normal society before, but to realize more than a true human being. This has a clear difference from the discourses of governance in the previous period. Their sense of vocation and practice was the purifying of the spirit of the times, such as the emergence of reformists who did not deny their career path, the descendants who claimed to be the heir to the calling, and the rapidly Confucian lifestyle. It was after the 18th century that a flow beyond their worldview. However, until the 19th century, the Neo-Confucian worldview was still a social and political center. It can be said that it was the result of a realistic and ideal Dohak practice discourse.

CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - The NASA Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) project has provided the climate community more than a 20-year record of top of the atmosphere (TOA) reflected shortwave (SW) and emitted longwave (LW) fluxes. The fluxes are used to monitor the Earth's energy balance as well as for climate model validation and cloud feedback studies. One of the largest uncertainties in climate models is the response of clouds in feedback studies. Reducing this uncertainty requires a more stringent validation of model-generated fluxes by cloud-type. Rather than relying on radiative transfer model generated fluxes from observed cloud-type retrievals, the CERES FluxByCloudTyp (FBCT) product relies on MODIS empirical narrowband to broadband relationships to convert the cloudy portions of the CERES footprints into fluxes. The overcast footprint and sub-footprint cloud layer fluxes are then stratified by 7 pressure layers and 6 optical depth bins and temporally averaged into daily and monthly regional cloud-type fluxes.The CERES project analyzed a total of 19 MODIS channels for use in the next generation FBCT product narrowband to broadband conversion. This was accomplished by comparing the narrowband to broadband RMS errors from all possible 5-channel combinations. The SW and LW optimized channels were selected by also considering analogous geostationary, MODIS and VIIRS imager channels as well as channel combinations that provided the lowest RMS errors across all surface types. The optimized channel combinations will be tested in the FBCT algorithm to investigate any narrowband to broadband dependencies as a function of cloud fraction, effective pressure, optical depth, PW, solar and view angle, surface type.

T2  - APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Questions Is it possible to map floristic gradients in heterogeneous boreal vegetation by using remote-sensing data? Does a continuous vegetation map enable the creation of a spatially continuous map of seasonal permafrost soil thaw depth?Location Bonanza Creek LTER, Fairbanks, Alaska, USA.Methods Vegetation records are subjected to an ordination to extract the predominant floristic gradient. The ordination scores are then extrapolated using Sentinel 2 imagery and a digital elevation model (DEM). As the relation between vegetation pattern and seasonal thaw depth was confirmed in this study, the spatial distribution of ordination scores is then used to predict seasonal thaw depth over the same area.Results The first dimension of the ordination space separates species corresponding to moist and cold soil conditions from species associated with well-drained soils. This floristic gradient was successfully mapped within the sampled plant communities. The extrapolated thaw depths follow the typical distribution along a topographical and geomorphological gradient for this region. Besides vegetation information also DEM derivatives show high contributions to the thaw depth modeling.Conclusion We demonstrate that floristic gradient mapping in boreal vegetation is possible. The accuracy of the thaw depth prediction model is comparable to that in previous analyses but uses a more parsimonious set of predictors, underlining the efficacy of this approach.

TI  - The Problem of Scientific Approach to Studying Genealogy of the Muralist Sculptor, People's Artist of Russia V. M. Klykov
T2  - HERALD OF AN ARCHIVIST
M3  - Article
AB  - The famous Soviet and Russian sculptor V. M. Klykov (1939-2006), winner of state prizes of the RSFSR and the USSR, People's Artist of Russia, Honored Artist of the Russian Federation, was an ambiguous figure in the eyes of his contemporaries. His caught the attention not only of professional critics, but also of ordinary people. Many publications and memoirs dedicated to the sculptor were published during his lifetime. However, V. M. Klykov himself gave contradictory information on the history of his family in his interviews. At the same time, a complete and objective assessment of his life and work and his role in art is impossible without studying his social origin and family history, which determines the relevance of this work. Until now, the history of the Klykov family has been reconstructed from stories and memoirs of those who knew him personally. The study has also been hampered by the fact that there are misconceptions about V. M. Klykov's ancestors that often spring from the desire to create a certain image that fits the worldview of the famous sculptor. The purpose of the study has been to identify and analyze the documentary sources on the subject: archival materials, documents from the museum collection and periodicals. The fonds of the State Archive of the Kursk Region (GAKO) have provided most sources. However, destruction of the archives during the Civil War and the Nazi occupation resulted in a lack of documents and photographs from the early 20th century. Some information has been found in databases available on the Internet. A number of documents are being introduced into scientific use for the first time. The study is based on the key principles of historicism, consistency, and objectivity, which allows the author to avoid mythologization of the sculptor. Comparative analysis of the identified sources has allowed the author to trace V. M. Klykov's genealogy up to the mid-19th century, to identify the names of his ancestors, to note the family's difficult fate through the pivots of Russian history, to determine V. M. Klykov's ancestors and to explore their biographies, achievements, and social status. Several representatives of the Klykov family have been identified, who showed themselves worthily in the military service of the Fatherland. In addition, the author has refuted the tale of the sculptor's grandfathers' de-kulakization and persecution by the Soviet power. The author concludes that peasant origin and environment in which the sculptor grew up left an imprint on his worldview, and therefore, on the theme of his monumental creativity and ideas that he defended in public life.

TI  - Practice-oriented approach to the study of Russian classics in higher education
T2  - YAZYK I KULTURA-LANGUAGE AND CULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The article analyzes the possibility of using a practice-oriented approach in the process of studying Russian classical literature when teaching students-philologists, future teachers of language and literature; the issues of selection and structuring of the material are considered; reveals the features of organizing the content of thematic sections of individual methodological disciplines, aimed at improving the quality of training a competitive teacher in modem educational conditions. The appeal to Russian classical literature in the modem world is directly related to the spiritual and moral development of a person, the enrichment of his inner world, self-knowledge. In different historical periods, the attention of scientists, methodologists, language teachers has always been focused on the comprehension of the classical literary heritage and the search for effective models of interaction with the reader of a certain historical era. The need to rely on a practice-oriented approach in the process of studying Russian classical literature in a pedagogical university is caused by the actualization of the application of the acquired fundamental knowledge in the process of mastering philological, psychological, pedagogical, didactic and methodological disciplines in practice. The article summarizes the recent research experience, based on the assessment of the use of a practice-oriented approach in pedagogical and methodological science and the degree of readiness of future language teachers to understand the tasks facing education in the modern world. The use of this approach to the development of the content of educational methodological disciplines is explained by the intensive penetration of educational practice into solving professional problems of a person. This allows us to consider the approach stated in this article as the most effective, aimed at identifying, forming and developing various professional competencies that help to solve the most important problems of university teaching, namely, the development of students' styles of thinking, communication and behavior, memory, creative abilities; stimulation of educational and cognitive activity, cultivation of a scientific and professional worldview, the formation of a professional culture. The process of practical activity turns into a technological and strategic application of science. The development of innovative forms of activity is at the same time the formation of new levels of practice, and the emergence of each new level means and at the same time requires its theoretical understanding, which again generates a new level of practice and contributes to the use of a practice-oriented approach in all spheres of human life, including in higher pedagogical education. The article highlights structural markers (need; goal-setting; motivation; expedient activity in the form of its individual acts; the subject to which this activity is directed; the means by which the set goal is achieved; the result of the activity), the principles of organizing a practice-oriented approach to developing the content of methodological sections. disciplines (the creative nature of any kind of practical activity; the idea of the unity of theory and practice, and at the same time practice is a derivative of theoretical activity; subject-subject relationship between teacher and student in the implementation of this approach).The content of the thematic sections "Russian classics and modern literature: points of contact and repulsion", "Russian classical literature and digital learning technologies" proposed in the article can be integrated into the teaching of the following methodological disciplines: "Reading practices", "Modern literature lesson", "Study classical literature at school", etc. The use of a practice-oriented approach in the process of studying Russian classical literature at a pedagogical university is one of the ways to ensure high-quality interaction of the future language teacher with the works of Russian classics, taking into account its functioning in the modern educational environment.

TI  - Reforestation study based on high resolution satellite imagery
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - To study and analyze the reforestation process, we used high-resolution satellite images from the WorldView-2 apparatus with a spatial resolution of 0.5-1.0 m, made in the period from 2007 to 2020 and posted in the public domain on the Internet resource Google Earth Pro. The images were selected for dates (late spring - summer - early autumn), providing an analysis of the time series during the period of foliage on woody plants. The study of reforestation was carried out in the Orichevsky district of the Kirov region. The objects of research are the felling areas in woodlands.Recognition of clearings and stages of subsequent reforestation in the images was carried out by the method of visual identification of direct deciphering signs: brightness (phototone, color), geometric (shape, shadow, size), structural (texture, structure, pattern). At the same time, their change was analyzed within the same area in time, as well as taking into account the season of the year. Field observations were carried out to identify the objects revealed by decoding characteristics.The analysis of a time series of high-resolution satellite images in conjunction with field observations in the studied areas made it possible to identify characteristic deciphering signs for assessing separate stages of reforestation. This made it possible to reconstruct the chronology and degree of overgrowing of felling areas with trees, shrubs and herbaceous vegetation, as well as to assess the quality of reforestation. The most informative are satellite images taken in the autumn, when the leaves changed color, but did not fly around, as well as spring images, when the snow has already melted, but there is still no greenery from herbaceous plants. The texture pattern in conjunction with the phototone allows you to determine the state of forest cultures. The images clearly show the overgrowth of clearings with deciduous species, so there is an opportunity to take timely measures and get plantings with target characteristics. The results of the study can be used when converting lands intended for reforestation into lands occupied by forest plantations.The methodology proposed in the work makes it possible to assess reforestation quality, improve the monitoring system of forest plantations.

AB  - This paper investigates a multiple intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) aided integrated terrestrial-satellite network (ITSN), where the IRSs are deployed to cooperatively assist the low channel gain users in the co-existing transmission system. In such a network, the coordinated beamforming and frame based transmission scheme are considered for the terrestrial network and the satellite network, respectively. We aim at maximizing the weighted sum rate (WSR) of all users by jointly designing the frame based beamforming at the small base stations (SBSs) and the phase shifts at the IRSs, subject to the individual maximum SBS's transmit power constraints and the IRSs' reflection constraints. This non-convex problem is firstly decomposed via fractional programming (FP) technique in the objective function, then transmit beamforming vectors and reflective phase shifts matrix are optimized alternatingly. A block coordinate descent (BCD) method is proposed to obtain the stationary solution. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared with different benchmark schemes.

AB  - This paper investigates an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided integrated terrestrial-satellite network (ITSN) system for the low channel gain users, where an IRS is deployed to assist the co-existing transmissions of the terrestrial small base stations (SBSs) and the satellite. Because of the spectrum sharing in the ITSN, the interference between two systems should be carefully mitigated. We aim for maximizing the weighted sum rate (WSR) of all users through jointly optimizing the frame based coordinated transmit beamforming vectors at the SBSs and the phase shift matrix at the IRS, and the frame user scheduling subject to each SBS's power and unit modulus. To this end, we propose efficient algorithms based on alternating optimization, in which the transmit beamforming vectors and reflective phase shifts matrix are optimized in an alternating manner. In particular, we develop the second-order-cone programming (SOCP) for optimizing the coordinated transmit beamforming and propose the Riemannian conjugate gradient (RCG) for updating the reflecting shifts. For frame user scheduling, we propose the chordal distance measure method to improve the intra-fame correlation. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared with different benchmark schemes.

TI  - Improving snow retrieval performance by fusing multiple snow cover remote sensing data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ENVIRONMENTAL REMOTE SENSING AND BIG DATA (ERSBD 2021)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - International Conference on Environmental Remote Sensing and Big Data (ERSBD)
CL  - Wuhan, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - Remote sensing can be used to monitor snow cover in a large area, which has a major contribution to climate and environmental research, the establishment of hydrological models, and disaster prevention and mitigation. Multiple remote sensing data fusion is an important means to improve the efficiency of snow cover detection. This study used 192 SNOTEL stations in the northwestern United States to evaluate the commonly used MODIS datasets and IMS snow and ice product. It is found that the snow inversion effect in the cloud-free area of the MODIS datasets is better, and IMS snow and ice product has lower snow recognition rate but no cloud. Based on this, we integrated the snowy area of the MODIS datasets into the IMS snow and ice product, and generated a new product called MIMS. The results show that the SRP of MIMS is 72.93%, which is higher than the MODIS datasets (72.78%) and the IMS snow and ice procduct (70.46%). At the same time, the new product eliminates cloud pollution and improves the spatial resolution. It can be seen that the fusion of multiple remote sensing data can effectively improve the performance of snow inversion, and has important reference value for the accurate monitoring of snow in different regions.

AB  - This study is a harmony between special revelation and general revelation (natural revelation), which must be dealt with urgently in the present era entering the 4th industrial revolution era. In this thesis, a new method of “scientific theology” is included to fully reveal and explain God’s revelation in creation reflecting God’s revelation. This study focuses on『Scientific Theology』of Alister E. McGrath, a molecular biologist and theologian who is still active. This thesis intends to study two major themes, focusing on McGrath. First, ‘The History and Justice of Christian Revelation’. This is a very necessary part in developing “Scientific Methodology for Christian Natural Theology”. It contains 'The Definition of Revelation as insisted by McGrath' and 'Scientific Methodology for Natural Revelation'. Here, the two modes of special revelation and general revelation are presented as a monistic epistemology, and the revelation as a special way of God is revealed. While examining several modern and contemporary epistemological models of revelation, McGrath has made clear to what point Christian revelation has been discussed in history. McGrath emphasized the retrospective recognition of revelation, seeing that God's special revelation is revealed more clearly and abundantly through general revelation. The relationship between special revelation and general revelation, or 'monistic awareness', will become a new methodological foundation that lays the foundation for Christian natural theology. Second, it is a 'scientific methodology' based on a new epistemological foundation for Christian revelation. There are three topics covered here. 'Theory,' 'Nature,' and 'Reality'. How will this recognize and understand God's creation? It is a question of methodology. The scientific methodology for Christian natural theology consists of 'observation' of creation in a special way, the implications of the 'scientific theoretical system (doctrine)', and 'explanation (worldview)' of God's revelation in Christian faith. way out. This methodology is also McGrath's strategy for balancing Christian special and general revelation.

T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate monitoring of vegetation phenological information in meadow steppe has great significance for understanding regional and global climate change and the grassland ecosystem carbon cycle. We used the MODIS normalized different vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI). GOSIF solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) and carbon flux gross primary productivity (GPP) data to estimate the phenology of Changling meadow steppe in China from 2007 to 2010 and compared the differences in the NDVI, EVI and SIF in estimating the phenology of meadow steppe. The results showed that the R-2 of SIF and GPP was 0.82, which indicated that SIF could be used to monitor the growth of meadow steppe. Further analysis of the phenological information showed that the phenological information monitored by the NDVI, EVI and SIF lagged behind that of the carbon flux GPP. In addition, SIF was better than the NDVI and EVI in monitoring meadow steppe end date of the growing season (EOS) (R-2 = 0.72). Meanwhile, the NDV1, EVI, SIF and GPP of meadow steppe had the same sensitivities to environmental factors. Therefore, SIF has the potential to monitor the phenological information of meadow steppe and can better reflect the date of the EOS in meadow steppe, providing an important basis for the in-depth study of the terrestrial ecosystem carbon cycle and its response to climate change.

TI  - Cascaded multi-baseline interferometry with bistatic TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X observations for DEM generation
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As the spaceborne mission dedicated to bistatic SAR interferometry (InSAR), the TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X satellite constellation can acquire highly coherent data pairs with flexible baseline configurations and minimal atmospheric disturbances, which are well suited for high-accuracy DEM generation. However, hindered by the intrinsic contradiction between sensitivity of height measurement and reliability of phase unwrapping in terms of normal baseline length, as well as geometric distortions of layover and shadow, it is still difficult to generate high-quality DEM in mountainous areas using single-baseline InSAR data. Aiming at these two problems, we developed a cascaded multi-baseline InSAR processing framework for DEM generation from multiple bistatic InSAR observations with variable normal baselines and different imaging geometries. By starting from phase unwrapping and phase-to-height conversion for the interferogram with shortest normal baseline, this approach adopted a strategy of DEM updating assisted by a reference elevation dataset. The updated DEM is then used as the reference for processing interferograms with longer baselines successively. In this iterative way, the quality of the resultant InSAR DEM can be improved gradually. In addition, fusion between multiple geocoded InSAR DEMs derived from different orbits is carried out to further refine the results by filling data voids and reducing random height noise. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we apply it to four pairs of stripmap-mode TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X bistatic data covering the Mount Song area in central China. The vertical accuracies of the generated DEMs are evaluated using an aerial photogrammetric DEM, ICESat/GLAS measurements, and the standard TanDEM-X global DEM product. The experimental results show that the absolute height error of the generated multi-baseline InSAR DEM at 5 m posting is less than 10 m in typical mountainous areas and can meet the American HRTI-3 standard, which means the generated DEM has similar height accuracy and higher spatial resolution in comparison with the 12 m TanDEM-X global DEM products.

AB  - Two convolutional neural network binary classifiers were developed to classify images with and without hurricanes. These binary classifiers were modelled after ResNet, and AlexNet architectures. The cyclone data was gathered with the assistance of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Interagency Implementation and Advanced Concepts Team (NASA IMPACT). The IMPACT Team archived Tag Image File Format (TIFF) images from the NASA Worldview application. This data store containing over 250 TIFF files of cyclone data, with examples of true and false positives of this cyclone phenomena, was then augmented through shear transforms, random rotations, and additional techniques to generate the model data. With this augmented data set, batch normalization was implemented for model training to develop a model that could detect nuanced differences. Ultimately, the ResNet model overfit toward the classification of hurricanes and was unable to correctly classify the false hurricane labelled images.The AlexNet model correctly classified these same images with 75 percent accuracy. This final result proved more so an experiment on a classifier network's ability to generate improved feature detection when given prior false positive, and true positive data. Additionally, the results proved that when remote sensing rare phenomena use a representative, and stratified sample.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article is dedicated to the anniversary of Boris Vasilyevich Markov, the famous philosopher of Saint Petersburg, Russia. The author of the article, basing on many years of personal experience and professional communication with the hero of the day, presents an expressive and holistic image of Markov as a person and as a philosopher according to his biography and creativity. An attempt is made to consider the complex philosophical evolution of Markov, which took place in key periods for Russian philosophy when Russian thought actively absorbed the key philosophical texts of the 20th century that had become available. Markov is distinguished by a unique ability to creatively rethink a variety of philosophical trends - classical philosophical schools, phenomenology, existentialism, hermeneutics, analytical philosophy, structuralism - actualizing their significance for modern philosophy and synthesizing their experience in their original understanding. The specificity of Markov's oral and written language is distinguished by its expressiveness, brightness and aphorism. It is no coincidence that the philosophy of language had a great influence on his philosophical development, remaining as one of the main research topics throughout all his works. Touching upon some of the key books of Professor Markov, written by him at different times, the author strives to briefly mention and analyze the main features of his philosophical style, thinking, and worldview. Special attention is paid to philosophical anthropology, which is directly related to the philosophical activity of the hero of the day over the past few decades. In this regard, emphasis is given to Markov's book "Mind and Heart", which marked the beginning of the most productive period of his philosophical work, which is currently associated with the problems of visual anthropology of communication.

T2  - VOPROSY FILOSOFII
M3  - Article
AB  - The author refers to the most "mysterious" work of Vyacheslav Ivanov which was essentially his testament. It is shown that "The Tale of Tsarevich Svetomir" is the quintessence of Ivanov's philosophical worldview. The author maintains that some key concepts of Ivanov's cultural philosophy find their artistic embodiment in the "Tale": symbol, myth, Russian idea, element. The author examines the genre classification of the "Tale" and concludes that the Ivanov's choice of the genre of the work was determined by the use of folklore material in the framework of modernist literary experiments, which is characteristic of the poetics of Silver Age. The distinctive features of Ivanov's symbolism in relation to the artistic trends of the Silver Age are also indicated. The mythological form of the "Tale" reflects Ivanov's philosophy of mythology which can be therefore understood as a structure-forming principle of the artwork. This makes it possible to use the basic concepts of Ivanovs's symbolism as hermeneutic keys to "The Tale of Tsarevich Svetomir". The final part of the article justifies the hypothesis that the Russian idea qua myth constitutes the main content of "The Tale of Tsarevich Svetomir".

M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, focused on the Amazonas river's channel, that is, on the geographic slice where Para state's municipalities Santarem, Belterra and Mojui are located, some projects will be presented as priority (Henry Ford's project, with the foundation of Fordlandia (1928) and Belterra (1934) and the implantation and bankruptcy of TECEJUTA), short term projects, here called "ostrich flights"; and the arrival of the agribusiness in these lands of the north of the country. The methodology is supported by the application of the Geosystem-Territory-Landscape (GTP) model, which associates the source geo-system to the resource territory and the identity landscape, that is, a geographic attempt to simultaneously shade the globality, diversity and interactivity of the whole environmental system. Since 1997 soy agribusiness advances in Para's west region, chiefly due to government incentives and support from Banco da Amazonia (BASA), which supports mainly large rural farmers, leaving family farming on the sidelines. First, the mechanized agriculture will take possession of already deforested areas, because the occupation in the Amazonasriver channel region was already consolidated, - due to Instituto Nacional de Colonizacao e Reforma Agraria (INCRA) settlements, in the beginning of the 1970s. However, in the following years, deforestation of patches of the forest existing in the area was observed. Soybean producers adopted/adopt the strategy of deforesting from the borders of these patches, as recorded from Landsat images and also with photos taken in the locations. It is clear that the arrival of the agribusiness in the Amazonasriver channel brought significant socioenvironmental impacts; (b) increased deforestation of significant existing forest patches (which still exist, though reduced); (c) brought a culture totally different from that of the region; (d) and, worst of all, created needs for INCRA to collect forest areas to implant 'Corta Corda Settlement Project' in forest areas.

AB  - This article aims to discuss education in the field with reference to theoretical and methodological elements for the development of a pedagogical proposal from a counter-hegemonic perspective of education, which supports a materialist, historical and dialectical worldview. The central argument of this work comes from a research carried out in the doctoral program of one of the authors, which aimed to analyze the pedagogical conceptions that materialize in the practice of teachers in multigrade schools, having as theoretical reference the ideals of historical-critical pedagogy. Based on these assumptions, the following question arises: How can historical-critical pedagogy contribute to a pedagogical proposal for education in the countryside? For the methodological organization of the work, a qualitative approach was chosen, based on the bibliographical analysis of the main interlocutors of Historical-Critical Pedagogy - Saviani (2008, 2009, 2011, 2013 and 2017; Duarte (2011, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017) and Marx (2003, 2005 and 2016). It is concluded that Historical-Critical Pedagogy makes it possible to know the essence of things through successive approaches to understanding reality. A theory that brings, in its wake, a method to be understood in the apprehension of the phenomena of multiple determinations and diverse relationships in favor of human formation in line with social transformation. In this way, the study of this theory made it possible to associate the collective practices of the field for the construction of knowledge through readings, inquiries, dialogues and debates about the acquisition of cultural and material goods for a transformative education in the countryside.

TI  - MULTI-TEMPORAL ANALYSES OF THE CONFLUENCE OF THE RIVERS SOLIMOES AND NEGRO IN THE PERIOD 2008 TO 2018
T2  - GEOAMBIENTE ON-LINE
M3  - Article
AB  - This research deals with a multitemporal analysis that aims to show the intensity of the geomorphological changes verified in the perimeter comprised by the Costa do Rebojao, Xiborena Island and Costa da Terra Nova, the stretch where the waters of the Solimoes-Negro and Amazonas rivers occur in the vicinity of city of Manaus, from 2008 to 2018. The temporal analysis came from remote sensing using the Landsat satellite images (5 and 8), which allowed to analyze the intensity of the erosion and deposition processes. The intensity and dynamics of the Solimoes River moves a large sediment load in intense flow, causing erosion in areas of banks that receive this flow in a perpendicular way, where the Costa do Rebojao is located. Part of this sediment load is deposited further downstream, at the edges of the Amazon River. The research allowed to conclude that there were significant changes in the morphometry of the study area, in particular in the inflection of the confluence angle.

TI  - Detecting desertification in different years and rainfall regimes by 2D Scatter Plot
T2  - REVISTA CIENCIA AGRONOMICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The desertification process causes soil degradation and a reduction in vegetation. The absence of visualisation techniques and the broad spatial and temporal dimension of the data hampers the identification of desertification and rapid decision-making by multidisciplinary teams. The 2D Scatter Plot is a two-dimensional visual analysis of reflectances in the red (630 - 690 nm) and near-infrared (760 - 900 nm) bands to visualise the spectral response of the vegetation. The hypothesis of this study is that visualising the reflectances of the vegetation by means of a 2D scatter plot will allow desertification to be inferred. The aim of this study was to identify desertified areas and characterise the spatial and temporal dynamics of the vegetation and soil during dry (DP) and rainy (RP) periods between 2000 and 2008, using a 2D scatter plot. The 2D scatter plot generated by the Envi (R) 4.8 software and the reflectances in bands 3 and 4 of the TM5 sensor were used within communities in the Iraucuba hub (Ceara, Brazil). The concentration densities of the near-infrared reflectances of the vegetation pixels were observed. Each community presented pixel concentrations with reflectances of less than 0.4 (40%) during each of the periods under evaluation, indicating little vegetation development, with further degradation caused by deforestation, the use of fire and overgrazing. The 2D scatter plot was able to show vegetation with low reflectance in the near infrared during both dry and rainy periods between 2000 and 2008, thereby inferring the occurrence of desertification.

TI  - The Effect of Environmental Conditions on the Quality of UAS Orthophoto-Maps in the Coastal Environment
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine conservation and management require detailed and accurate habitat mapping, which is usually produced by collecting data using remote sensing methods. In recent years, unmanned aerial systems (UAS) are used for marine data acquisition, as they provide detailed and reliable information through very high-resolution orthophoto-maps. However, as for all remotely sensed data, it is important to study and understand the accuracy and reliability of the produced maps. In this study, the effect of different environmental conditions on the quality of UAS orthophoto-maps was examined through a positional and thematic accuracy assessment. Selected objects on the orthophoto-maps were also assessed as to their position, shape, and extent. The accuracy assessment results showed significant errors in the different maps and objects. The accuracy of the classified images varied between 2.1% and 27%. Seagrasses were under-classified, while the mixed substrate class was overclassified when environmental conditions were not optimal. The highest misclassifications were caused due to sunglint presence in combination with a rough sea-surface. A change detection workflow resulted in detecting misclassifications of up to 45%, on orthophoto-maps that had been generated under non-optimal environmental conditions. The results confirmed the importance of optimal conditions for the acquisition of reliable marine information using UAS.

AB  - As we all know, another trend in contemporary documentary photography is to express the photographer’s self-independent emotion and worldview, which brings new topics and higher pursuits to photographers. In this paper, by studying the Chinese documentary photographer Yang Yankang, taking his series of works “Mind Image” as an example, this article analyzes the photographer’s emotional state during shooting, and explores the ways in which he expresses religious thoughts in his photos, in order to make a difference to the photographer’s creation. This article adopts semiotic analysis methods, starting from the three semiotic structural levels of “linguistic message signs”, “coded message signs”, and “metaphoric signs”, deconstructing photographers conveying different levels of information signs to readers through photos, interpreting messages and readers the way to create an emotional connection. The article selects typical photos, specifically analyzes the construction process of Tibetan Buddhism-related information symbols in Yang Yankang’s photos, analyzes the content of the work and the expression of religious thoughts, finds the deep meaning of the photos from the information elements of the photos, and thinks based on this Documentary photography has more possibilities in the future.

T2  - The Journal of Korean Historical-folklife
T2  - 역사민속학
M3  - research-article
AB  - This study examined the table of Bulsa currently installed in gutdang. The table of Bulsa refers to a table treating a heavenly deity of a Bulsageori. The table of Bulsa forms a table setting by gathering individual foods containing appreciation and wishes to the gods. It has been set up with a certain table setting standard. It was confirmed that the symbol of individual food was a material culture that expressed the worldview of shamanism concretely.This study divided the table of Bulsa into the table of Bulsa of Seoul-gut for the living and the table of Bulsa of Seoul-gut for the dead according to the Seoul-gut type. Bangmangi-Rice Cake(방망이떡) was the most distinctive feature of the table of Bulsa. It was also found that the table settings of the past and the present were mixed or changed.It was also needed to define several concepts. The location and number of conical hats, considered to be the body of Bulsa, were unclear. Moreover, there was a disagreement with the number of baekseolgi (two or three). They need to be studied further. It is because baekseolgi can be considered as an indicator food of the table of Bulsa.The table of Bulsa refers to the manifestation of a god through food, and a god and human beings communicate and empathize through it. There is a belief that the purpose of the gut can be achieved by reconciling with the gods to resolve conflicts and maintaining mutual relations for a symbiotic relationship and coexistence. It was understood that the table setting or individual food of the table of Bulsa were ways of expressing the belief system of shamanism concretely. The religious view of Korean shamanism, the beliefs of the general people, and the sympathy of the food culture coexisted in it. Consequently, the ritual food of shamanism is the most important topic to study that can confirm the structure of shamanic thinking.

TI  - Specific learning disabilities: Challenges for meaningful access and participation at higher education institutions
T2  - JOURNAL OF EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The worldview on the rights of people with disabilities has changed in pursuit of social justice, resulting in an international increase in students with disabilities enrolling at Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). This supports the need to meet the challenge to transform and attain Education for All (EFA) as a global imperative. In this research, I focussed on the experiences of students with Specific Learning Disabilities (SLDs) at a South African university. My findings suggest that although HEIs have policies that promote inclusive education, many students with SLDs still experience exclusion from full access and participation in teaching and learning. I conclude that authentic inclusion of students with SLDs requires improved awareness of institutional support structures as well as an inclusive pedagogical stance from lecturers.

TI  - 21ST CENTURY BRITISH FICTION: THE REALISTIC TELEOLOGY OF DAVID MITCHELL AND IAN MCEWAN'S NOVELS
T2  - NOVYI FILOLOGICHESKII VESTNIK-NEW PHILOLOGICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - In the paper, I have identified and clarified the characteristics of post-postmodern realism outlined previously, manifested in British fiction: maximum details of reality by introducing non-literary and extra-life components, outlining the idea of integrity of the world (developed in the German Romanticism) in Ian McEwan and David Mitchell's fiction of the 21st century. By extra-life components, I mean scientific terms to denote organic foundations that are basic in human material, in its biochemical and psycho-neuro-physiological processes. Moreover, the exploitation of such concepts, the medicalized way of understanding the world enhances new realism: rational-metaphysical or positivist-metaphysical, which provides a scientific view of the nature of things around characters as molecules with consciousness. At the same time, such a vision does not deny metaphysical phenomena (God, providence). Typologically, it is similar to the Romantic worldview, which exploits the holistic capture of reality in fantastic, mystical and real (physical) phenomena. The idea of teleology is represented in McEwan's and Mitchell's fiction providing the return of grand narratives as post-postmodern discourses in which the characters seek for the senses that may help to understand the truth and find the explanation for the human and universe nature organization. "Cloud Atlas" is a representation of the metanarrative story that reinforces the German Romanticism concept of the unity between different parts of the work and the human being. In "Saturday", this unity is explained by the post-positivist mind of the protagonist who philosophically explains social and cultural phenomena using his medical knowledge.

TI  - Satellite Flood Inundation Assessment and Forecast Using SMAP and Landsat
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The capability and synergistic use of multisource satellite observations for flood monitoring and forecasts is crucial for improving disaster preparedness and mitigation. Here, surface fractional water cover (FW) retrievals derived from Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) L-band (1.4 GHz) brightness temperatures were used for flood assessment over southeast Africa during the Cyclone Idai event. We then focused on five subcatchments of the Pungwe basin and developed a machine learning based approach with the support of Google Earth Engine for daily (24-h) forecasting of FW and 30-m inundation downscaling and mapping. The Classification and Regression Trees model was selected and trained using retrievals derived from SMAP and Landsat coupled with rainfall forecasts from the NOAA Global Forecast System. Independent validation showed that FW predictions over randomly selected dates are highly correlated (R = 0.87) with the Landsat observations. The forecast results captured the flood temporal dynamics from the Idai event; and the associated 30-m downscaling results showed inundation spatial patterns consistent with independent satellite synthetic aperture radar observations. The data-driven approach provides new capacity for flood monitoring and forecasts leveraging synergistic satellite observations and big data analysis, which is particularly valuable for data sparse regions.

TI  - Adding contrast-enhanced ultrasound markers to conventional axillary ultrasound improves specificity for predicting axillary lymph node metastasis in patients with breast cancer
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) combined with conventional ultrasound of axillary lymph nodes (ALNs) in predicting metastatic ALNs in patients with breast cancer.Methods: This retrospective study included 259 patients with breast cancer who underwent conventional ultrasound and CEUS. The parameters and patterns evaluated on conventional ultrasound included short axis diameter (S), long axis/short axis (L/S) ratio, cortical thickness, resistive index (RI), lymph node (LN) morphology of greyscale ultrasound, hilum and vascular pattern. Meanwhile, enhancement pattern, wash-in time, time to peak (TP), maximum signal intensity, and duration of contrast enhancement were evaluated on CEUS. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent factors of ALN status. Three models (conventional ultrasound, CEUS, and combined parameters) were established. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were applied to evaluate the accuracy of the three predictive models.Results: On conventional axillary ultrasound, LN morphology and vascular pattern were independent factors in predicting metastatic ALNs. On CEUS, maxim um signal intensity, duration of contrast enhancement, and TP were independent factors in predicting metastatic ALNs. When combining conventional ultrasound and CEUS features, five independent factors obtained from the conventional ultrasound and CEUS were associated with ALN status. ROC curve analysis showed that the use of CEUS markers combined with conventional ultrasound features (AUC = 0.965) was superior to the use of CEUS markers (AUC = 0.936) and conventional ultrasound features alone (AUC = 0.851).Conclusion: Combining conventional ultrasound and CEUS features can enable discrimination of ALN status better than the use of CEUS and conventional ultrasound features alone.Advances in knowledge: The axillary lymph node status in breast cancer patients impacts the treatment decision. Our ultrasonic data demonstrated that CEUS features of ALNs in breast cancer patients could be image markers for predicting ALN status. Combining conventional ultrasound and CEUS features of ALNs can improve specificity discrimination of ALN status better than the use of CEUS and the conventional ultrasound features alone, which will help the treatment planning optimization.

TI  - Carbon use efficiency of terrestrial ecosystems in desert/grassland biome transition zone: A case in Ningxia province, northwest China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Terrestrial ecosystems play a critical role in the global carbon cycle and the feedbacks of carbon cycle will significantly impact future climate change. It's worth noting that semi-arid biomes in the Southern Hemisphere have driven the global carbon sink anomaly over the past 30 years. However, how does the desert/grassland biome transition zone, a part of arid and semi-arid biomes, respond to climate change and anthropogenic ac-tivities in carbon use efficiency (CUE) is still unclear. Therefore, based on the CUE of terrestrial ecosystem estimated by the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data from 2001 to 2017, the spatial and temporal characteristics of CUE in Ningxia province, a typical desert/grassland biome transition zone, were studied. The main driving factors in climate and ecosystem were also investigated by partial correlation analysis. Results showed that the CUE of terrestrial ecosystems in desert/grassland biome transition zone is higher than 0.5, a constant value of CUE defined in many ecological models. However, the CUE varies with the ecosystem types even when they are located in the same climatic zone. There is a decreasing trend of annual CUE in the period of 2001-2017 and most of them will persistently decrease in future at pixels scales, which could be mainly caused by the land use change. Comparing the habitat conditions, we found the lower canopy density and water stress could increase the CUE in the same ecosystem, which indicates the plant could increase their efficiency of transforming carbon from the atmosphere to terrestrial biomass in adverse environment. Finally, the CUE significantly correlated to net primary productivity (NPP) and autotrophic respiration (Ra) in ecosystem processes, meanwhile water stress (lower precipitation) and heat stress (higher temperature) could increase the CUE, but the temperature has variable impacts in different ecosystem.

TI  - First Investigation of the Relationship Between Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence Observed by TanSat and Gross Primary Productivity
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable estimation of gross primary production (GPP) of terrestrial ecosystems is crucial in the global carbon cycle and ecosystem functioning studies. Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) has emerged as an unprecedented proxy for terrestrial GPP estimation. TanSat SIF with a 2-km fine spatial resolution provides an excellent opportunity to investigate the relationships of satellite SIF and eddy covariance (EC) GPP at ecosystem or site scale, while has not been investigated. In this article, we investigated the relationship between TanSat SIF and EC GPP based on flux tower sites encompassing different biomes over the globe. TanSat SIF exhibited strong relationships with EC GPP at Fe and KI bands for instantaneous and daily timescales. The correlations between EC GPP and TanSat SIF (R-2 = 0.61) were much better than moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF)-corrected vegetation indices (VIs) (R-2 = 0.48-0.58). Further comparisons between SIF and GPP with absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) and two environmental factors (fTmin and fVPD) showed that SIF responded to APAR and was similarly affected by environmental factors as GPP. GPP derived from SIF (R-2 = 0.64) also performed slightly better than enhanced vegetation index and near-infrared reflectance of vegetation and even light use efficiency MODIS GPP algorithm (R-2 = 0.58-0.60). Therefore, our results demonstrated the feasibility of SIF on estimating GPP at sites or ecosystem levels; in addition, incorporating TanSat SIF with other satellite SIF products will open a new era for carbon cycling and ecosystem functioning studies.

TI  - Direction Dependence of the Fully Polarimetric Wind-induced Ocean Emissivity at L-band: Modeling and Anisotropy Analyses

M3  - Proceedings Paper

AB  - In this paper,a semi-theoretical model is proposed to numerically investigate the directional properties of L-bandwind-driven ocean emission for full polarizations. By incorporating the well-developed composite model of ocean polarimetric emission, a newly-retuned directional spectrum of short-gravity ocean waves, the advanced Anguelova and Gaiser 2013 model (AG13) for foam emissivity and a novel foam fraction model, the approach can simulate the fully polarimetric brightness temperature (TB) from ocean surface with wind speeds up to 35 m/s. The model is further validated and tuned against the observation data of two L-band radiometer missions, i.e., Soil Moisture Active-Passive (SMAP) mission and Aquarius mission. Comparisons of model simulations to satellite data suggest that the overall accuracy of model could reach 0.2 K. Particularly, the proposed model successfully reproduces the negative and positive upwind-crosswind (UC) asymmetries of L-band ocean surface TB and the transition of the phase signatures versus wind speed for all polarizations. In addition,numerical results also suggest that, at high wind speeds, the anisotropies of L-band ocean surface TB are saturated for vertical- (V-) and horizontal- (H-)polarizations. For the third (3rd) and fourth (4th) Stokes components, the ocean emission anisotropies increase almost linearly from around 10 m/s, and the saturation of anisotropy is only observed for the 3rd Stokes signals at about 24 m/s. The direction-induced L-band TB variations for the third Stokes parameter show less sensitivity to wind speed with the increase of observation angles, while those for the fourth Stokes are on the contrary.

TI  - Using Remote Sensing to Understand the Total Suspended Matter Dynamics in Lakes Across Inner Mongolia
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An exponential function model was developed based on the red band from Landsat and in situ data. The model performed well, the calibration determination coefficient (R-2) was 0.82 and validation metrics root-mean-square error, mean absolute percent error, and bias was 8.23 mg/L, 30% and -2.35 mg/L, respectively. Then, the time series of total suspended matter (TSM) concentrations for the lakes across Inner Mongolia were presented using the Landsat data from 1984-2019. The results showed that the number of the lakes with TSM decrease was slightly more than that with TSM increase (57% versus 43%). A total of 70.72% of those lakes had a changing rate less than 1 mg/L/yr in TSM, while the other 29.28% had a changing rate more than 1 mg/L/yr. In some lakes (24.2%), the coefficient of variation was greater than 102% indicating significant spatial variation. The TSM less than 20 mg/L mainly appeared in the reservoirs. Based on different environmental backgrounds, this study showed comprehensive estimates (increasing and decreasing regions) of TSM concentrations. Finally, the relative roles of several factors to the TSM changes were quantified and examined at different scales. The responses of TSM changes to NDVI representing vegetation coverage indicated that vegetation played an important role for most lakes. Whilst wind speed and precipitation significantly affected a few lakes. For most lakes, the TSM were affected by multiple factors, where a single factor could not be highlighted. Nevertheless, a comprehensive analysis of the factors surrounding a lake remains relevant for determining the possible trend (better or worse) of its TSM variation.

CP  - 3rd International Forum on Geoscience and Geodesy (IFGG)

AB  - The Yunnan power grid has the characteristics of wide distribution and large geometric size, which makes the power grid vulnerable to natural disasters such as wildfires. The unique topography and climatic conditions of transmission lines crossing mountains, forests and other zones can easily lead to the outbreak of mountain fires, or even the tripping of transmission lines. In serious cases, transmission towers may be destroyed, thus causing major power accidents. The occurrence of mountain fire is closely related to topographic factors, and the change of each topographic factor (elevation, slope, slope direction, etc.) has a certain influence on fire. This paper mainly studies the relationship between three terrain factors and fire. Based on the statistical analysis of remote sensing data from 2005 to 2020, the terrain features and their influence of fire spots in Yunnan province were analyzed. The results show that most of the fires occur within the range of 1000-2000m above sea level, and the fires occur frequently. The frequency of fire occurring below 1000m and above 2000m is low. The occurrence frequency of fire is higher in the gentle slope range, among which, the number of fire point samples is the largest within the range of 5 degrees-15 degrees, followed by 0 degrees-5 degrees and less than 15 degrees.In this paper, eight slopes are divided to make statistics of fire points, and the number of fires in different slopes also fluctuates, among which the south slope has the highest fire risk, accounting for 16.0%.The West Slope accounted for only 10.0%, with the lowest fire risk. Terrain factor is a fixed variable that has a fixed influence on the regional fire risk. Therefore, terrain analysis of fire is of great significance for the prevention of mountain fires in power grid.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth Resources and Environmental Remote Sensing/GIS Applications XII / SPIE Remote Sensing Conference
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - The use of vegetation indices to highlight archaeological features from remote sensing (RS) sensors is increasingly in demand, especially due to the possibility of obtaining high-resolution multispectral images with drones. The objective of this work is divided in two steps: i) to test techniques for the semi-automatic identification of crop marks in a study zone, in Salvada, Portugal, and; ii) to develop a Geographical Information Systems (GIS) open-source application, named ArchMarks, under QGIS software, to enhance the identification of archaeological crop marks using RS data/techniques, integrating the automatic creation of indices and the identification techniques tested before. ArchMarks aims to compute several vegetation and soil indices from multispectral imagery considering four bands (Red, Green and Blue and Near InfraRed (NIR)) for enhancing the identification of archaeological crop marks. In order to define the best approach to implement in the plugin, some tests were performed with two algorithms available in QGIS: ContrastEnhancement and WatershedSegmentation. High-resolution aerial imagery (25-50 cm spatial resolution) was obtained from Web Map Service (WMS) services in addition to Sentinel-2 satellite image, whose spatial resolution is of 10 meters in the Red Green Blue-Near InfraRed bands. The application is free and can be adapted to other region of interest. In the future, the plugin will be improved with a methodology to download remote sensing data (aerial images and satellite data) from WMS sources, band stacking, and machine learning algorithms, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, to automatically classify archaeological traces on the vegetation or bare soil.

TI  - Breast conservation and axillary management after primary systemic therapy in patients with early-stage breast cancer: the Lucerne toolbox
T2  - LANCET ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Primary systemic therapy is increasingly used in the treatment of patients with early-stage breast cancer but few guidelines specifically address optimal locoregional therapies. Therefore, we established an international consortium to discuss clinical evidence and to provide expert advice on technical management of patients with early-stage breast cancer. The steering committee prepared six working packages to address all major clinical questions from diagnosis to surgery. During a consensus meeting that included members from European scientific oncology societies, clinical trial groups, and patient advocates, statements were discussed and voted on. A consensus was reached in 42% of statements, a majority in 38%, and no decision in 21%. Based on these findings, the panel developed clinical guidance recommendations and a toolbox to overcome many clinical and technical requirements associated with the diagnosis, response assessment, surgical planning, and surgery of patients with early-stage breast cancer. This guidance could convince clinicians and patients of the major clinical advancements purported by primary systemic therapy, the use of less extensive and more targeted surgery to improve the lives of patients with breast cancer.

TI  - Offshore Oil slicks remote detection and discrimination from satellite data for routine monitoring
T2  - EARTH RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL REMOTE SENSING/GIS APPLICATIONS XII
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth Resources and Environmental Remote Sensing/GIS Applications XII / SPIE Remote Sensing Conference
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Being able to detect and identify offshore oil slicks and in particular oil pollutions is important to reduce the detrimental effect of pollution on ecosystems. For decades, SAR images have been used to detect pollutions. In some cases, SAR polarimetric derived parameters are used to improve detection or discrimination However, the acquisition of multipolarization channels is at the expense of the extent of the monitored area. Also, some papers question the effectiveness of polarization derived parameters for detection or identification. SAR single polarization is quite efficient to detect hydrocarbons but there are many look-alikes and in general SAR is not much sensitive to oil thickness which is a very important element for pollution remediation.Optical data on the other side have been shown to be sensitive to oil thickness and to some extent to the type of oil and the physical state of the oil: emulsion vs plain film. The main drawback of optical data is that they will not show the ocean surface when clouds are presents or during the night, which is a big constrain in tropical areas, Northern areas and winter high latitude spots. But when clouds are not hiding the area of interest, optical data offer good insight into the nature of the sea surface. Lab measurements helps us to find means to detect, identify, and qualitatively quantify oil on water. But in real life other features will impact the detection and identification: surface ripples, clouds, algae, smoke, shadows, glint. In this paper we will use airborne hyperspectral proprietary data and satellite multispectral data, to understand the spectral signature of oil and non-oil slicks, the impact of oil thickness and a combination of spectral indices to discriminate oil from look-alike on different case studies.When a big pollution occurs, planes are mobilized carrying optical, radar, thermal as well as UV systems which together will discriminate oil slicks from look-alikes. But in most cases only open-source satellite data will be available and it will be necessary to use them at best to identify and characterize the floating slicks.VV single pol SAR data remain the best images to detect hydrocarbons but with some potential false alarms. On the optical side, the hydrocarbon index and Area1700 index are good at detecting thick hydrocarbons but cannot be used with multispectral data. The Fluorescence index can discriminate hydrocarbons but rejection of clouds, and infrastructure require additional indices or processing. Some Algae are potentially the most difficult features to discriminate from hydrocarbon. A new index is proposed to discard them. The objective is to detect hydrocarbons with the minimum of insitu knowledge.

M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Considering the increased frequency of maternal deaths reported from 2001 to 2005 for Indigenous and mestizo women from the Ecuadorian rural area of Otavalo, where the Kichwa people has lived for centuries, the objective of the present article is to describe how the efforts of the local health community and hospital workers together with a propitious political environment facilitated the implementation of intercultural childbirth, which is a strategy that respects the Andean childbirth worldview.Methods: We evaluated a 3-year follow-up (2014-16) of the maternal mortality and the childbirth features (4,213 deliveries).Results: Although the Western-style (lying down position) childbirth was adopted by 80.6% of the pregnant women, 19.4% of both mestizo and Indigenous women adopted the intercultural delivery (squatting and kneeling positions). Both intercultural (42.2%) and Western-style (57.8%) childbirths were similarly adopted by Kichwa women, whereas Western-style childbirth predominated among mestizo women (94.0%). After the implementation of the intercultural strategy in 2008, a dramatic decrease of maternal deaths has been observed until now in both rural and urban Otavalo regions.Conclusion: This scenario reveals that the intermingling of cultures and respect for childbirth traditions have decreased maternal mortality in this World Health Organization-awarded program.

TI  - MOTIVE OF PPARTHENOGENESIS: THE URANIAN FACTOR AND FOLKLORE TRADITION
T2  - NAUCHNYI DIALOG
M3  - Article
AB  - The motive of parthenogenesis associated with the significance of the uranian factor in the beliefs of the nomadic societies of Central Asia and in the ideological attitudes of the ruling elite is considered. It is noted that the seal of the celestial origin of the steppe rulers - from the Huns to the Turks and Mongols - acted as the guarantor of the legitimacy and sacralization of their supreme power. A comparative analysis of this phenomenon is carried out using the example of the legends about Tanshihai and Ambagan - the founders of the Xianbei and Khitan powers, as well as about Bodonchar - the ancestor of Genghis Khan. Special attention is paid to the solar myth about Alan-goa, the ancestor of the khan's clan Borjigin, as well as the legend of the birth of Temujin with a wonderful sign of chosenness, which has analogies in the Turkic-Mongol epic legends. The novelty of the research is seen in the attraction for the analysis of oral genealogical myths of different times and the written version contained in the "Secret Legend of the Mongols" and also revealing folklore sources. It is stated that all these plots related to different eras and ethnic formations are typologically close to each other, united by a similar motive of parthenogenesis. It is concluded that this circumstance testifies to a single Tengrian dominant in the worldview and ethnocultural tradition of the nomads, which determined the relevance of the idea of the celestial genesis of the rulers of the Great Steppe and was reflected in folklore.

TI  - Semantic Labeling of Globally Distributed Urban and Nonurban Satellite Images Using High-Resolution SAR Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - While the analysis and understanding of multispectral (i.e., optical) remote sensing images have made considerable progress during the last decades, the automated analysis of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite images still needs some innovative techniques to support nonexpert users in the handling and interpretation of these big and complex data. In this article, we present a survey of existing multispectral and SAR land cover image datasets. To this end, we demonstrate how an advanced SAR image analysis system can be designed, implemented, and verified that is capable of generating semantically annotated classification results (e.g., maps) as well as local and regional statistical analytics such as graphical charts. The initial classification is made based on Gabor features and followed by class assignments (labeling). This is followed by inclusion. This can be accomplished by the inclusion of expert knowledge via active learning with selected examples, and the extraction of additional knowledge from public databases to refine the classification results. Then, based on the generated semantics, we can create new topic models, find typical country-specific phenomena and distributions, visualize them interactively, and present significant examples including confusion matrices. This semiautomated and flexible methodology allows several annotation strategies, the inclusion of dedicated analytics procedures, and can generate broad as well as detailed semantic (multi-)labels for all continents, and statistics or models for selected countries and cities. Here, we employ knowledge graphs and exploit ontologies. These components could already be validated successfully. The proposed methodology can also be adapted to other SAR instruments with different resolutions as well as to multispectral images.

AB  - The main goal of the research. Realization of general characteristics of epistolary heritage of the well-known artist-sixtier Opanas Zalyvakha and arrangement of postcards from private archives as text and visuals sources. Outlining the specifics of the authorial presentation of graphic images of postcards, identifying of semantic accents in the text with the help of lettering. Methodology. The author applied a systematic approach, deduction methods, historical and typological methods for a general analysis of the artist's epistolary in the context of the research of the sixtiers' correspondence. In the course of the research, a structural-typological method was used to systematize and study textual and visual sources, and an iconological method was used to outline the figurative and symbolic content of postcards images. Scientific novelty. Opanas Zalyvakha's epistolary was outlined as a valuable historical and artistic source. A part of the artist's authorial postcards from private archives was introduced into scientific circulation and the historical and cultural context of the time of their creation was comprehensively cleared. The interpretation of graphic images of postcards and accentuation of meanings in the textual material of the artist's autographs was comprehensively analyzed. Conclusions. The article is the first attempt to systematically consider the aesthetic, philosophical, and semantic meanings which are reproduced in the texts and images of the authorial graphic postcards of Opanas Zalyvakha. The postcards' textual information deepens these informational facts about the personalities who lived in the sixties and is a testament of the deep psychological introspection of the artist. These postcards allow us to understand the peculiarities of the artist's existence in totalitarian conditions and the specifics of their work. Postcards'visual images have powerful spiritual and aesthetic contents. These postcards allow us a more accurate understanding of the importance of intellectual and artistic heritage of the sixties in the formation of cultural and artistic national worldview of the second half of the 20th century.

TI  - 30-year changes of natural forests under human activities in the Indochina peninsula - case studies in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam
T2  - VIETNAM JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural forests are a basic component of the earth's ecology. It is essential for biodiversity, hydrological cycle regulation, and environmental protection. Natural forests are gradually degraded and reduced due to timber logging, conversion to cropland, production forests, commodity trees, and infrastructure development. Decreasing natural forests results in loss of valuable habitats, land degradation, soil erosion, and imbalance of water cycle on the regional scale. Thus, operational monitoring of natural forest cover change has been in the interest of scientists for a long time. Current forest mapping methods using remotely sensed data provide limited capability to separate natural forests and planted forests. Natural forest statistics are often generated using official forestry national reports that have different bias levels due to different methodologies applied in different countries in forest inventory. Over the last couple of decades, natural forests have been over-exploited for various reasons. This led to forest cover degradation and water regulation capability, which results in extreme floods and drought of a watershed in general. This situation demands an urgent need to develop a fast, reliable, and automated method for mapping natural forests. In this study, by applying a new method for mapping natural forests by Landsat time series, the authors succeeded in mapping changes of natural forests of Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam from 1989 to 2018. As a focused study area, three provinces: Ratanakiri of Cambodia, Attapeu of Laos, and Kon Tum of Vietnam were selected. The study reveals that after 30 years, 51.3% of natural forests in Ratanakiri, 27.8% of natural forests in Attapeu, and 50% of natural forests in Kon Tum were lost. Classification results were validated using high spatial resolution imagery of Google Earth. The overall accuracy of 99.3% for the year 2018 was achieved.

TI  - Monitoring of coastline change using Sentinel-2A and Landsat 8 data, a case study of Cam Pha city - Quang Ninh province
T2  - VIETNAM JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of Sentinel - 2A and Landsat 8 data in monitoring coastline change from 1999 to 2018 at Cam Pha city, Quang Ninh province. Both data were collected under similar conditions of time and weather features to minimize the differences in interpretation results caused by these factors. The coastline was extracted from Sentinel-2A and Landsat 8 in 2018 by using the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI). Coastline map from Quang Ninh Department of Natural Resources and Environment with a scale of 1: 50.000 in 1999 was used as a reference of the same mask and overlaid on coastline maps in 2018 to identify the changes in the study area. The data from fieldwork and Google Earth was used to evaluate the accuracy and make comparative comments. The results presented that changes dramatically occurred between 1999 and 2018 with the accretion process prevailing. This process took place quite strongly on the East and Southeast coast while the erosion process only occurred with small areas at scattered points in the study area. The results also showed that the overall classification accuracy of Sentinel-2A imagery (95.0%) was slightly higher than that of Landsat-8 (87.5%). The combined use of Landsat-Sentinel-2 imagery is expected to generate reliable data records for continuous detecting of coastline changes.

T2  - APPLICATIONS OF MACHINE LEARNING 2021
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Applications of Machine Learning
CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - In this work, we leverage deep learning to reproduce and expand Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) based deforestation detections generated using a probabilistic Bayesian model. Our Bayesian updating deforestation detections leverage SAR backscatter and InSAR coherence to perform change detection on forested areas and detect deforestation regardless of cloud cover. However, this model does not capture all deforestation events and is better suited to near-real time alerting than accurate forest loss acreage estimates. Here, we use SAR based probabilistic detections as deforested labels and Sentinel-2 optical composites as input features to train a neural network to differentiate deforested patches at various stages of regrowth from native forest. The deep learning model predictions demonstrate excellent recall of the original Bayesian label, and low precision due to providing better coverage of deforestation and detecting deforested patches not included in the imperfect Bayesian labels. These results provide an avenue to improve existing deforestation models, specifically with regards to their ability to quantify deforested acreage.

TI  - Estimation of Deglaciation through Remote Sensing Techniques in Chandra-Bhaga Basin, Western Himalaya
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers act as natural indicators of climate response and natural buffers of the hydrological cycle. Hence, continuous monitoring of glaciers is very crucial for which remote sensing techniques have emerged as a powerful tool to understand the micro-level variation and dynamics of glaciers. Unfortunately, a database involving complete basin-level approach and an extensive temporal range is not available for the entire Chandra-Bhaga (CB) sub-basin. Thus, the present investigation attempts to account for the extent of deglaciation in the CB basin showing that 16.7 percent of the glaciated area has been lost during 1989-2019. Moreover, the last three decades have witnessed a rapid rate of loss for small and medium-sized glaciers as compared to larger glaciers. Adding to it, the basin has also shown an upwards shift of mean elevation in this period. Over the last decade, an increasing temperature in the western Himalayas and Hindu Kush regions, as asserted by previous studies, have led to spatio-temporal changes in the glaciated area. The extent of deglaciation alongwith the glacier-climate behaviour and response can also provide a link to measure the topographical parameters.

TI  - "YAMSKAYA SLOBODA" BY ANDREI PLATONOV: TOPOI OF THE STEPPE
T2  - PHILOLOGICAL CLASS
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper investigates the symbolic-semantic content of the spatial ideas of Andrei Platonov formulated in his novel "Yamskaya Sloboda" (1927). The aim of the study is to assess the semantic significance of the image of the steppe associated with the inner life of the characters, based on modern interpretations of the concepts of "topos" and "locus". The paper looks at the dialogical interaction between poetic and philosophical forms of thinking, which makes up the basis of the author's style. The artistic world of the novel is interpreted on the basis of the diachronic principles of historical poetics. The study analyzes the personage of Filat and the main topoi of the story: "steppe", "steppe people", "humble person", and "return to his native place". The suggested method of analysis allows to identify stable mythopoetic and autointertextual configurations of the spatial worldview. The interpretation of the "Yamskaya Sloboda" in the light of the phenomenology of space convinces that intense micro-topoi, topoi-situations, and rhetorical figures serve as impulses for the development of Platonov's individual toposphere associated with national consciousness. The topoi of the steppe organize the plot structure of the story. They outline the possibility of restoring the social and natural unity of man. The reproduction of the whole (connection between the physical and spiritual) in its parts (characters, images of nature and everyday scenes) became the dominant law of composition and semantic form of the "Yamskaya Sloboda". The connection between the individual properties of the soul of the protagonist of the novel and the value-based foundations of popular-historical existence characterizes the originality of Platonov's artistic space. The novel actualizes the national topic: a centuries-old stock of motifs, plots, and mythologemes. With the help of the topoi of the steppe, Platonov translates events, images of memory, and phenomena of collective consciousness into an ideological and philosophical plan, considering the inner world of a person to be its center.

TI  - Downscaling MODIS Land Surface Temperature Product Using an Adaptive Random Forest Regression Method and Google Earth Engine for a 19-Years Spatiotemporal Trend Analysis Over Iran
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - MODIS land surface temperature (LST) product (MOD11A1) has been widely used in analysing spatiotemporal trends of LST. However, its applicability is limited, partially due to its coarse spatial resolution (i.e., 1 km). In this study, an Adaptive random forest regression (ARFR) method was developed for LST downscaling at national scale. This study also provided a framework to shift from downscaling single-time image sets to extensive time-series of MOD11A1 LST images in an operational approach (i.e., a 19-years spatiotemporal LST trend analysis over Iran) using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform. The performance of ARFR was assessed by comparing the results of the downscaled LSTs with the Landsat-8 LST data on different dates of six consecutive years (2014-2019) over ten different sub-areas in Iran. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method with an average root mean square error and mean absolute error of 2.22 degrees C and 1.59 degrees C, respectively. The results of spatiotemporal LST trend analysis showed that 25.08%, 10.05%, 56.68%, 1.04%, and 32.84% of Iran experienced significant positive trends during a full year, spring, summer, fall, and winter, respectively. Significant negative trends were also observed over the 3.09%, 23.84%, 7.54%, 17.38%, and 18.77% of Iran during a full year, spring, summer, fall, and winter, respectively. In summary, the outcomes of this study not only exhibit the spatiotemporal trends of LST across Iran, but also reveal the substantial benefits of the ARFR method in downscaling LST using GEE.

TI  - CULTS OF THE DEAD IN ARCHAEOLOGICAL CULTURES OF THE BARABA FOREST-STEPPE: SPATIAL AND CHRONOLOGICAL DYNAMICS
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA ISTORIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article examines features of the burial rituals of archaeological cultures that existed on the territory of the Baraba forest-steppe in the Bronze Age. The study of large necropolises of different times made it possible to trace the traditionality and variability of ritual activities within the framework of a cultural community.In the course of the research, we analyzed the materials of the autochthonous Neolithic, Ust-Tartas, Odinovo, Krotov, Andronovo, Irmen and Pakhomovo archaeological cultures. Similar elements in burial rites may indicate the similarity of certain aspects of the worldview among representatives of different cultures of the region which we are considering. Biritual and syncretic burials could personify a gradual transformation of ritual activity, when traditional and introduced elements were included in the cult. This testifies to the peaceful nature of the process. Ancestor cults were probably the basis of ideological concepts. The ceramic material, in addition to evidence of accompanying food, could indicate the performance of rites of sacrifice - to ancestors or higher powers. The existence of cult complexes on the necropolises and the traces of human sacrifice recorded on them indicate the degree of significance for society of ideas about the other world. The presence of tools, weapons and ornaments is a criterion of social status and evidence of belief in an afterlife, as well as, possibly, of the ambiguous connotations of certain artifacts. The emergence of cremation rites may indicate the growing role of fire as an element of purification or as a mediator in rites of passage. The appearance of ditches in the ritual indicates the need to localize the sacred space and clearly separate the world of the living from the world of the dead, where the ditch could perform both a restrictive and a protective function. The fact that monuments have disturbed burials, where the process of destruction is associated not only with grave robbing, but also with certain irrational views, seems to be of great importance.Thus, a review of the burial rites of the archaeological cultures of Baraba suggests the presence of complex ideological concepts associated with the other world among the ethnic groups who lived here. Similar features of the funeral rite that took place among the carriers of successive cultures here indicate the possible continuity of the most important aspects of the worldview for society and the transformation of funeral cults in accordance with the vector of ethno-cultural processes that took place here.

TI  - Long-term retrospective investigation of a large, deep-seated, and slow-moving landslide using InSAR time series, historical aerial photographs, and UAV data: The case of Devrek landslide (NW Turkey)
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a successful combination of different remote sensing data used in a long-term retrospective investigation of a large and destructive deep-seated, slow-moving landslide reactivated on 16 July 2015 in Devrek District (Zonguldak, Turkey). To this aim, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data were used for Interferometric SAR (InSAR) time-series analysis together with unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images and aerial photographs for digital photogrammetric analysis. The SAR dataset was divided into three sub-periods: 1) 1992-2001 for ERS-1 and ERS-2 satellites; 2) 2003-2010 for Envisat ASAR; and 3) 2014-2015 for Sentinel-1. Persistent Scatterers Interferometry (PSI) was applied for each sub-period. In total, 20 aerial photographs, dating from as early as 1944, were obtained, along with data from a UAV flight mission conducted on 23 June 2018. The historical aerial photographs revealed that the region has had a landslide problem since the 1940s. Between 1944 and 2018, a noticeable expansion of the settlement area towards the toe of the landslide was also observed. Aerial photographs (1984 and 2011) and UAV images (2018) were used to map landslide deformations using the M3C2 algorithm. Due to the high number of modelling errors, the 1984 and 2011 aerial photographs did not allow mapping of the landslide deformations. However, it was possible to determine them for the periods of 2011 and 2018. The M3C2 results between 2011 and 2018 were also compared to the PSI results, which were quite compatible with those obtained via photogrammetric methods. Moreover, two orthophotos belonging to 2011 and 2018 were used to reveal the horizontal displacement of buildings caused by the landslide. As a result, the complete investigation of the landslide performed in this study may serve to facilitate additional plans and strategies for prevention and mitigation of potential reactivations in the future.

M3  - Article
AB  - The multispectral image, of Landsat 7 and 8; Aster and Sentinel-2A, has good results in lithological, structural, hydrothermal and mineralogical alteration mapping. Segmentation and image classification are two complementary steps as they are allowed the most important operations in the field of image processing. In this sense, this work aims at evaluating the potential of segmentation and classification algorithms for the generation of surface geological maps, hydrothermal alterations and lineaments. Given the good resolution of the Sentinel 2A (10m), the three images, (11/12; 11/2; 11/8), 12.8.2, main component 1, 2 and 3 (11.12.2), processed by five algorithms (K-means, Isodata, watershed, efficient graph-based image segmentation, thresholding) for geological mapping and then mining exploration. The study displayed that 1) Watershed algorithm can be used for topographic and hydraulic studies, it can be very useful in the preparation phase of geological and mining infrastructures; 2) threshold segmentation does not give good results in terms of geological discrimination since it divides each image into two parts; 3) the same thing for the effective thresholding and segmentation of graph-based images; 4) The Isodata and K-means algorithms show good geological discrimination.

T2  - Cancer treatment and research communications
M3  - Journal Article

AB  - BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Skipped nodal metastasis (SNM) is a recognized phenomenon of visceral cancers when metastases bypass the regional basin and skip to a distant nodal basin without evidence of distant metastases. Its occurrence is undocumented in cutaneous melanoma patients but of potential prognostic significance. We therefore assessed the frequency of SNM in a large series of patients with limb melanomas.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied melanoma patients attending a tertiary oncology hospital in northwest England using two approaches. First, we systematically searched medical records of an unselected patient sample treated 2002-2015, and second, we studied lymphoscintigrams of all patients with limb melanoma who underwent sentinel node biopsy 2008-2019.RESULTS: Of 672 melanoma patients whose clinical records were examined, 16 had regional nodal metastases without apparent visceral spread and one appeared to have SNM but further scans were uncovered that showed concurrent pulmonary metastases. Of 667 limb melanoma patients with lymphoscintigrams, 7 showed dual lymphatic drainage patterns to distal as well as regional nodal basins, but none had micro-metastases solely in the distant basin.CONCLUSION: Occurrence of SNM in cutaneous melanoma is highly unlikely.

T2  - NEW SOCIAL STREET ECONOMY: An Effect of The COVID-19 Pandemic
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The Corona crisis today has made it possible to realise that the capitalist -system has transformed human life and the entire planet into a commodity. The new ecological consciousness, which has risen with environmental destruction, is against the destructive and wasteful practices that exploit nature because of the attitudes and values associated with the capitalist worldview. Social solidarity and active participation in the society nourish the social economy. Social solidarity contains a meaning that `people in wealth give, people in need take' style. This approach has shown to be an effective and common solidarity example both in Turkey also in the world during the Corona crisis. Social solidarity actually involves sharing resources equally or fairly. The corona epidemic has clearly demonstrated that an individualistic, self-interested approach of capitalism is not a life-saving strategy, but a socialist, solidarist approach, an approach that promotes the survival and health of the other is a life-saving strategy for all. A new cosmological and anthropological approach will be the formula of salvation, based on a social economy system in the post-corona world, which can see that life in nature, including humans, is protected through cooperation, mutual care and love. Capitalism will again come out of this crisis by adding billionaires to its billionaires, but different civilisations such as workers, producers and consumer cooperatives, solidarity networks, and street economy that grow in the heart of capitalism are the signs that we are progressing towards the evolution of the social economy.

AB  - The availability of gridded, screen-level air temperature data at an effective spatial and temporal resolution is important for many fields such as climatology, ecology, urban planning and design. This study aims at providing such data in a data-scarce, arid city within the greater Cairo region (Egypt), namely the Sixth of October, where, to our knowledge, no such data are available. By using (i) air temperature data, collected from mobile measurements, (ii) multiple spectral indices, (iii) spatial analysis techniques and (iv) random forest regression modelling, we produced air temperature maps (for both daytime and nighttime) at 30-m spatial resolution for the entire city. The proposed method is systematic and relies on low-cost instrumentation and freely-available satellite data and hence it can be replicated in similar data-scarce, arid areas to allow for better spatial and temporal monitoring of air temperature.

TI  - Change Detection Using Time and Look Angle Series of Geocoded Tandem-X Staring Spotlight Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article describes the analysis of changes in time and look angle series of TanDEM-X (TDX) and TerraSAR-X (TSX) staring spotlight images over the regions around Kjeller near Oslo in Norway and the town Nikel in Russia near the Norwegian border. It is shown that change detection may be done with TDX/TSX with shorter intervals than the repeat cycle using time series of geocoded images with varying look angles. Using look angle series of geocoded images can help to identify changes due to look angle variation. Accurate science orbit data and very good overlap of scenes both in time and look angle make the TDX/TSX data very attractive for both coherent and incoherent change detection.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING FOR AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS, AND HYDROLOGY XXIII
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing for Agriculture, Ecosystems, and Hydrology XXIII

AB  - Desertification and land degradation have severe negative effects on land-use, water resources, soil stability, agriculture and biodiversity. Especially, drylands cover 33.8% of northern Mediterranean countries: approximately 69% of Spain and 66% of Cyprus. The European Environment Agency (EEA) indicated that 8% of the territory of the European Union (mostly in Bulgaria, Cyprus, Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal) experience a 'very high' or 'high sensitivity' to desertification. For Cyprus Island, 9.68% of the land area was found to be susceptible to land degradation.The objective of this literature review is to provide a detailed synthesis of the main contributions of the global vegetation phenology research to the development of environmental knowledge, based on land degradation/ desertification and Earth observation (EO)-based science and technology. The study identifies the current fields of research and possible research gaps. To achieve this, more than 700 scientific papers were screened from which approximately 549 papers were reviewed, identifying and the state of land surfaces and vegetation phenology with remote sensing data.Most of the studies have as a central research object direct human-induced land degradation or the degradation of anthropogenic-modified landscapes, without having considered long-term un-altered natural vegetation, in order to assess the impact and the level of climate change. Hence, a detailed EO-based time-series monitoring and analysis of un-altered natural vegetation could provide indicators that may serve as early warning signals for the scale and level of climate change induced effects on vegetation and ecosystems that might lead to land degradation and even to desertification.

TI  - Consequences of the 2019 Greenland Ice Sheet Melt Episode on Albedo
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In mid-June 2019, the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) experienced an extreme early-season melt event. This, coupled with an earlier-than-average melt onset and low prior winter snowfall over western Greenland, led to a rapid decrease in surface albedo and greater solar energy absorption over the melt season. The 2019 melt season resulted in significantly more melt than other recent years, even compared to exceptional melt years previously identified in the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) record. The increased solar radiation absorbance in 2019 warmed the surface and increased the rate of meltwater production. We use two decades of satellite-derived albedo from the MODIS MCD43 record to show a significant and extended decrease in albedo in Greenland during 2019. This decrease, early in the melt season and continuing during peak summer insolation, caused increased radiative forcing of the ice sheet of 2.33 Wm(-2) for 2019. Radiative forcing is strongly influenced by the dramatic seasonal differences in surface albedo experienced by any location experiencing persistent and seasonal snow-cover. We also illustrate the utility of the newly developed Landsat-8 albedo product for better capturing the detailed spatial heterogeneity of the landscape, leading to a more refined representation of the surface energy budget. While the MCD43 data accurately capture the albedo for a given 500 m pixel, the higher spatial resolution 30 m Landsat-8 albedos more fully represent the detailed landscape variations.

TI  - Behaviour of Vegetation Health as a Response to Climate and Soil Dynamics between 2000 and 2015 in Different Ecological Zones of Rivers State, Nigeria
T2  - Journal of forest and environmental science
M3  - research-article
AB  - The study examined the influence of climate and soil dynamics on vegetation health across the ecological zones in Rivers State, Nigeria. MODIS imagery was used to assess the vegetation health through NDVI and point grid pattern of meteorological data for total precipitation (TP), air temperature (AT), soil moisture (SM) and soil temperature (ST) of 2000, 2003, 2006, 2009, 2012 and 2015 were used for the study. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used for data analysis. Findings showed that NDVI ranged between 0.420 and 0.612 in the freshwater swamp (FWS) while between 0.465 and 0.611 in the rainforest and the NDVI in the mangrove was generally low. The highest mean AT was experienced in the mangrove ecological zone and the least was experienced in the rainforest. The mean SM was generally highest in the rainforest with highest value in 2000 (774.44 m3/m3). The ST was highest in the mangrove and the least was experienced in the rainforest while the TP was highest in the mangrove. NDVI correlated significantly with SM (r=0.720; p＜0.05) and ST (r= -0.493; p＜0.05). NDVI, SM, TP and ST significantly varied among the ecological zones. Regression analysis showed that vegetation health was significantly related to the combination of soil temperature and soil moisture (R2=0.641; p=0.000). Thus, monitoring the factors that affect vegetation health in a changing climate and soil environments is highly required.

T2  - PSYCHOLOGY-JOURNAL OF THE HIGHER SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Some artificial intelligence methods for reliable identification of personality traits in speech can be useful for upgrade of psycho-diagnostics. Such tools should be developed by psychologists, linguists and computer scientists jointly, and therefore a preliminary special methodology and organization are required. The described in our paper original tool for analyzing written text was created at the Artificial Intelligence Research Institute of National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Control of RAS under the guidance of Dr. of Physical and Mathematical Sciences G.S. Osipov in collaboration with the members of Mental Health Research Center, the Institute of the Russian Language of the Russian Academy of Sciences and the Perm State University. G.S. Osipov proposed a method of relational-situational analysis of text (RSA) based on the ideas of the communicative grammar of the Russian language by G.A. Zolotova, and this approach is implemented in the tool. Analysis of the text using the tool "RSA Machine" turns it into a set of predicate-role structures that are associated with the specifics of the author's worldview. The RSA machine identifies 127 semantic features and semantic roles, and includes a set of psycholinguistic indicators and data of specially created groups of thematic lexis, extracts a total of 197 indicators from texts. The empirical studies have been conducted and have shown some singularities of texts written by people with certain psychological characteristics (according to psychodiagnostic methods and expert opinion), as well as with a psychiatric status (schizophrenia and clinical depression), and these results can be utilized for diagnosis and monitoring. By using the data that the RSA machine receives for further machine learning, it can adapt and develop according with specific research tasks.

T2  - REVISTA GEOGRAFICA DE AMERICA CENTRAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In Venezuela and worldwide, rice is a staple cereal that satisfies the caloric requirements of human beings. The productivity of this crop is significantly affected by weeds, among which Ischaemum rugosum Salisb. stands out due to its capacity of inducing modifications in the canopy geometry of rice plants, a disadvantageous condition termed lying down. The latter plant architecture alteration is analyzed and compared to that of a healthy rice plantation by means of spectral behavior analysis employing Sentinel 2A imagery. Under lying down conditions, the reflectance of rice plantations increases significantly in the red band (B4) whilst decreasing in near-infrared bands, the latter effect is characteristically detected at the beginning of the flowering phase, approximately 88 days after sowing. The use of vegetation indices (VIs), particularly RVI and NDVI, allowed differentiating healthy from lying down-afflicted rice plantations; the mayor discrimination spectral bands correspond to B4 in the visible region and B11 and B12 in the mid-infrared region.

TI  - Geomorphology of the Mirador-Calakmul Karst Basin: A GIS-based approach to hydrogeologic mapping
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper classifies the karst landscapes of the Peten Plateau and defines the Mirador-Calakmul Karst Basin by illustrating the distribution of its karst hydrologic features. Archaeological and spatial research of the Mirador-Calakmul area of Guatemala and Mexico has shown it to be a karst basin with geopolitical implications. Current research characterizes the karst landscapes of the Peten Plateau, maps the distribution of karst hydrologic features, and delineates the basin in geomorphological terms. To further this aim, multiple forms of remote sensing data including orthophotographs, a satellite Digital Elevation Model, satellite multispectral images, and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data have been integrated to interpret the karst features in the study area. Outcrop study and thin section analysis of the upper Buena Vista Formation document that the dominant lithologies are a shallow water algal boundstone interbedded with terrestrial caliche. Karst landforms have been mapped over the Peten Plateau and we identify five karst landscapes, the largest of which is a fluviokarst landscape dominated by karst valleys. We further map karst hydrologic features including seasonal swamps, dolines, intermittent lakes, intermittent streams, solution-enhanced fractures, and springs all of which are characteristic of drainage basins. Boundaries of the karst basin are mapped from multiple lines of evidence including distribution of the karst valleys, a line of springs along the western boundary of the fluviokarst landscape, and a surface drainage analysis. We capture and classify hydrologic data points and develop a regional groundwater map that indicates subsurface flow from east to west within the basin. A drainage map illustrates the extensive system of karst valleys, boundaries, and inferred groundwater flow paths of the Mirador-Calakmul Karst Basin. It was within this geomorphological setting that the ancient Maya developed an extensive civilization during the Middle and Late Preclassic periods (1000 BCE-150 CE).

TI  - Types and Characteristics of Evenki Natural Terrain Origin and Cultural Origin Myths
TI  - 에벤키족 자연지형물과 문화 기원신화의 유형과 특징
T2  - 유럽사회문화
M3  - research-article
AB  - This paper examines the development of the evenki people's worldview by analyzing the types and characteristics of the myths of the origin of natural features and the myths of cultural origin. According to the motif, the myth of the origin of natural features is divided into the myth of the completion of the earth and the myth of the battle motif. The myth of cultural origin is a myth about the origins of institutions, customs, economic activities, technological production tools, and daily necessities necessary for human cultural life. In the mythology of the cultural origins of the evenki people, the cultural heroes took the form of bears, half-humans, half-beasts, humans, and gods according to the stage of development of the worldview. The motif of the evenki bear-shaped cultural hero myth is body rebirth. In this type of mythology, the evenki and all the individuals in the universe were differentiated from the body of the bear, the original being, and the bear transferred its life force to each individual in nature, completing the creation and dying. Through this type of myth, we can get a glimpse of the evenki people's organic view of nature that all individuals in the universe are separate and independent beings, but they share the vitality of the original existence. In the myth of cultural origins of the evenki people, the cultural hero in the form of a half-human and half-beast is a complex creature of a human and a bear, and a human and a bear are related. Since the subject of the rituals and rituals from the cultural hero is male, this type of myth must have emerged in the patriarchal society. Cultural heroes in human form appeared later than bear or half-human and half-human figures, and the center of the myth is not individual life, but the fate of a group inseparable from nature. Nyungurmok, a cultural hero in the form of a woman, is a divine being who sent the ancestors of the evenki tribe as a relay and taught the basic elements of material and spiritual culture. The two brothers, or the motifs of Sebeki and Hargi, of cultural heroes in male form, are located in the final stage of the creation myth of the evenki people. This type of mythology is neutral in the value judgments of the actions of Sebeki and Hargi, and emphasizes that their coexistence makes the universe complete and harmonious.

TI  - Analysis of irrigation system performance based on an integrated approach with Sentinel-2 satellite images
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The improvement of performance of irrigation systems plays a fundamental role in increasing their efficiency in order to reach a sound use of irrigation water. The COPAM ( Combined Optimization and Performance Analysis Model) has proven its usefulness in performance evaluation of on-demand irrigation systems; however, in many cases, input data, such as water volumes delivered by hydrants, is not readily available. To support a wider application of the COPAM, we tested the possibility of using irrigation volumes estimated by means of space-borne remote sensing. The Sentinel-2 (S2) constellation provides high spatial resolution images with a frequency between 2 and 5 days, which is compatible with COPAM input requirements.In the present work, an irrigation sector in the Capitanata irrigation network (Foggia Province, no. 6 of District 10) in Italy was chosen to assess its performance by using COPAM with volumes estimated from Sentinel-2 data. As an input of COPAM, the upstream discharge was determined after a proper transformation of the estimated irrigation water requirement volumes and the recorded volumes into flowrates. The estimation of the irrigation water requirement volumes was accomplished through the estimation of crop evapotranspiration, Etcrop, and effective precipitation, Pn, by combining crop parameters (leaf area index - LAI, fractional vegetation cover - fc, and Albedo) derived from S2 images and the meteorological data from the ERA5 single levels reanalysis dataset collected for the whole study period, from June 1st to September 30th, 2019. The study comprised a comparison of the estimated irrigation water volumes and the corresponding recorded volumes. The results showed a good agreement between the estimated and the registered volumes in a large time scale for 10 days and a one-month period, while a large difference was observed in a daily time scale. The performance analysis was carried out for the overall system and at hydrant level. The estimated discharge was lower than the registered discharge, indicating better performance. Last but not least, some recommendations were proposed for improving performance in critical zones.

TI  - Suicide rates of migrants in United States immigration detention (2010-2020)
T2  - AIMS PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: We determined the annual suicide rate of migrants detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in the past decade. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of the annual suicide rates for ICE detainees from federal fiscal years (FY) 2010-2020. Death date and cause of death were directly extracted from publicly available ICE Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Library, ICE death reports, and ICE press releases. Annual suicide rates were calculated as suicides per 100,000 person-years and suicides per 100,000 admissions. Results: From 2010-2019, the mean number of suicides per 100,000 person-years was 3.3 (standard deviation (SD): 2.6). In 2020, the suicide rate increased 5.3 times the prior 10-year average to 17.4 suicides per 100,000 person years. When calculating suicide rate based on admissions per FY, the mean number of suicides from 2010-2019 per 100,000 admissions was 0.3 (SD: 0.3). In 2020, the suicide rate increased 11.0 times the prior 10-year average to 3.4 suicides per 100,000 admissions. Conclusion: In 2020, the detainee suicide rate increased substantially compared to the past decade. This may point to a worsening mental health crisis in ICE detention.

AB  - The preliminary attempts to develop of the geophysical model function (GMF) for the retrieval of wind speed and wind stress in hurricanes, based on a dependency between the cross-polarized satellite SAR data from Sentinel-1 and wind speed or turbulent stress obtained from collocated NOAA GPS-dropsondes data array. Field measurements in the Atlantic Ocean during hurricane season in the period 2001-2018 were analyzed. Using the data measured by GPS-dropsondes, due to the ensemble averaging, mean wind velocity profiles were obtained, and the atmospheric boundary layer parameters drag coefficient and turbulent stress (or friction velocity) were retrieved from the "wake" part of the velocity profiles taking into account a self- similarity property of the velocity profile "defect". The parameters were retrieved for 25 major hurricanes of categories 4 and 5. The collocation of Sentinel-1 images and GPS-dropsonde data was made for the hurricanes Irma 2017/09/07, Maria 2017/09/21 and 2017/09/23, taking into account the assumption that turbulent boundary layer parameters in the hurricanes remain quasistationary. The dependencies of the cross-polarized normalized radar cross-section (NRCS) on the wind speed and wind friction velocity were obtained, the results were compared to the data for small and moderate winds, represented in [1], a good agreement is demonstrated. In the region of high wind speeds the relation between NRCS and the wind friction velocity becomes ambiguous, it may be explained by the dependency on the hurricane sector.

TI  - Existential Foundations of the Clinical and Psychological Picture of Our Time Tragedy
T2  - CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY AND SPECIAL EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The study presents a model of the clinical and psychological picture of our contemporaries' experience of tragic events related to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is shown that the deformation of everyday life under the influence of threatening circumstances sharpened the features of the clinical and psychological picture of everyday life of our contemporaries. As the most significant features, the authors note experiences of the type of traumatic stress (fear of losing a job, experience of limited movement, concern about the problems of the near and distant future, in connection with the transition to remote work, fear of the lack of clear prospects for the future), as well as experiences that create a risk of reducing social interest (a decrease in the level of direct interpersonal contacts, boredom due to a decrease in social and intellectual activity, feelings of helplessness and impotence, fear of loss of autonomy and independence). It is shown that the psychological characteristics of modern people, especially young people and adolescents (representatives of Y and Z generations), create obstacles to the application of the experience of coping with the difficulties of previous generations due to the widespread postmodern worldview with its characteristic features. The tendency of modern existential psychotherapy and positive psychology to accept suffering as an experience necessary for personal growth is shown. As a metaphor for the spiritual life of a contemporary and the inability to help people in need of help, the authors cite the images of the film "Mirror for the Hero" (1987) because of their special relevance in our time. The directions of psychological assistance that allows to release the resources of coping with the situation are revealed. The prospects of studying the clinical and psychological picture of the mental life of people during the COVID-19 pandemic are considered.

TI  - Minimum summer temperatures in the southeast of the iberian peninsula through satellite thermographies
T2  - REVISTA DE ESTUDIOS ANDALUCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The latitudinal position of the southeast of the Iberian Peninsula generates high average temperatures (between 25 and 30 degrees C) during the summer season, although its complex orography and the important lapse rate (LR) give rise to important differences in minimum temperatures, influenced by intense processes of nocturnal temperature inversion (ITN) in inland valleys. The increase of new meteorological stations and the rise in the density of observation networks, together with the implementation of its own network in cold air pools (CAP) in the provinces of Murcia, Albacete or Jaen, leads to a greater understanding of the distribution of surface temperatures. The main objective of the research is the generation of cartography (thermographs) that reflects the distribution of night temperatures in the southeast of the Iberian Peninsula, carried out through the treatment of satellite products (VIIRS LST Band 1I5 of the SUOMI-NPP satellite). Together with the use of satellite images (thermography), it is possible to analyze in detail the thermal contrasts that exist during the hottest days of summer through 147 weather stations and recording thermometers (July 15 to August 15) of the year 2017 to 2020. Verification of the thermographs used (Band 15 product) shows a notable statistical adjustment (R2 of 0.87), with a Bias and RMSE of -0.2 and 1.83 degrees C respectively. The cartography is carried out for the differences in the provinces that make up the SE of the Iberian Peninsula (Alicante, Albacete, Murcia, Jaen, Granada and Almeria), with daily thermal differences in minimum temperatures of up to 23.4 degrees C between inland valleys and coastal areas.

TI  - ARTHROPOD MANAGEMENT Preliminary Approach in Detecting Cotton Fleahopper Induced Damage Via Unmanned Aerial Systems and Normalized Difference Vegetation Indices
T2  - JOURNAL OF COTTON SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) delivering imaging technologies in agricultural settings has become more prevalent over the past five years and is growing in pest management programs. Here, spectral data from a three-band consumer-grade camera with a filter to obtain Near Infrared (NIR) data, mounted on a fixed-winged UAS, was used to assess the ability to detect cotton fleahopper, Pseudatomoscelis seriatus (Reuter) (Hemiptera: Miridae), injury to immature fruiting bodies on cotton. In a small plot experiment conducted two years and two planting periods each year, cotton fleahopper densities were manipulated with insecticide. Variable populations of cotton fleahopper across the plots were achieved in 2015, ranging between 0 and 3.5 cotton fleahopper-days over a five-week period when squares were forming. Derived from spectral data of multiple UAS flights, unexpected but inconsistent trends (by regression analysis) of increasing Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), values with increasing cotton fleahopper days were detected in both plantings and years (five of 12 regressions were significant). Our preliminary data suggest that differences in cotton fleahopper activity on cotton may be reflected in NDVI values using a modified consumer-grade camera in-season. But the interpretation of NDVI may be complicated by the feeding site of cotton fleahopper, leading to unexpected and inconsistent regressions. Exploration of image resolution and bandwidth to define optical sensor needs appears important for cotton fleahopper, given its feeding habitat and injury to cotton. The application of UAS-derived remotely sensed data to detect insect-induced plant stress continues to have merit, but a merging of best suited UAS technology to the needs of detecting insect-induced cotton stress will be a research-intensive endeavor.

TI  - The relationship between distance of breast cancer from the skin and incidence of axillary nodal metastasis in female patients with early cancer breast: correlation between radiological and pathological distance
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe aim of this study was to evaluate the relation between proximity of breast cancer to the skin and incidence of axillary nodal metastasis in order to clarify a new guideline in the treatment of early cancer breast.Patients and methodsThis study included 50 female patients with early cancer breast (T1 and T2). All patients underwent breast ultrasonography, with special confirmation on the breast cancer distance from skin surface (radiological distance) in addition to pathological assessment of the distance (pathological distance) after surgical excision and its correlation with radiological distance. Breast conservative surgery with axillary clearance was done for 46 patients, whereas four patients underwent modified radical mastectomy.ResultsThis study showed that the more proximal the cancer from the skin, the higher the incidence of axillary lymph node metastasis, and the cut-off radiological distance was 1.55 cm, whereas cutoff pathological distance was 1.5 cm. It also proved that ultrasonography is an accurate and reliable method in assessing the breast cancer distance.ConclusionResults revealed that breast cancers located closer to the skin surface have a higher incidence of axillary lymph node metastasis.

AB  - Making the most of multispectral image time-series is a promising but still relatively under-explored research direction because of the complexity of jointly analyzing spatial, spectral and temporal information. Capturing and characterizing temporal dynamics is one of the important and challenging issues. Our new method paves the way to capture real data dynamics and should eventually benefit applications like unmixing or classification. Dealing with time-series dynamics classically requires the knowledge of a dynamical model and an observation model. The former may be incorrect or computationally hard to handle, thus motivating data-driven strategies aiming at learning dynamics directly from data. In this paper, we adapt neural network architectures to learn periodic dynamics of both simulated and real multispectral time-series. We emphasize the necessity of choosing the right state variable to capture periodic dynamics and show that our models can reproduce the average seasonal dynamics of vegetation using only one year of training data.

AB  - Woncheongangbonpuri is text that has not been fully interpreted. Woncheongangbonpuri is different from their episodyms, which are told by Pak Bongchun and Cho Sulsaeng; it has not yet been resolved how to establish the relationship between Pak Bongchun and the Cho Sulsaeng.By introducing examples of Jejudo atrial utilizing the source steel, we will use it as a clue to the relationship between Pak Bongchun and Cho Sulsaeng. Both Pak Bongchun and Cho Sulsaeng are talking about the birth of existence. Pak Bongchun’s Woncheongangbonpuri is deal with how the birth of existence is achieved by Onuel's visit to the source steel, and the Cho Sulsaeng’s Woncheongangbonpuri is deal with the birth of a new being Woncheongangbonpuri by accepting his destiny.In order to identify this in detail, chapter II was addressed the meaning of the source steel. Focused on the worldview settings of the source steel. The source has the meaning of a booklet and appears as a specific space and person in a particular mythical setting. The book is not only present in mythology, but is still used as an appropriate idiom in the context of the Bonpuri.Chapter III covered Woncheongangbonpuri birth of beings. The time of Onuel is only one continuous thing. When we separate and share this point, we are included in the universe and commit that separates us from the universe. Just as places occupy a point in the universe, Oneul exists in total time. The source lecture asks about the home of time, existence, and what our Woncheongangbonpuri is, and it is a mythical way of meaning.

AB  - During the last years, many studies related to Satellite-Derived Bathymetry (SDB) emphasize the potential use of optical satellite remote sensing sensors for bathymetric estimation. For this study, ten multispectral SPOT 6/7 satellite images with a medium resolution covering the coastal waters of the study areas were analyzed. These images were geometric, radiometric, and atmospheric corrected and acquired in three different sensing dates having coverage with at least 30% of lidar data. A number of 5284 random depth measurements with 0 to 50 meters depth were acquired for the ratio conversion algorithm with absolute depths and error assessment.A series of steps were performed to obtain reliable results using satellite optical data such as, sun glint process, land/sea extraction, kernel filters. The study area was divided into three sub-regions, based on the sensing date of the satellite imageries. The light attenuation in the water column increases at a depth of about thirty meters as seen in other related studies. This study identified the depth of light attenuation to determine the maximum depth that can be estimated through optical sensors. The results show that better correlation was identified up to 15 meters depth. Results of the regression analysis show the following correlation coefficients R-2 :0.90, 0.87, 0.80, and 0.89 with the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for the respective study areas to be 1.34, 1.53 1.70 and, 1.15.

TI  - Land Cover Change in the Blue Nile River Headwaters: Farmers' Perceptions, Pressures, and Satellite-Based Mapping
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The headwaters of the Blue Nile River in Ethiopia contain fragile mountain ecosystems and are highly susceptible to land degradation that impacts water quality and flow dynamics in a major transboundary river system. This study evaluates the status of land use/cover (LULC) change and key drivers of change over the past 31 years through a combination of satellite remote sensing and surveying of the local understanding of LULC patterns and drivers. Seven major LULC types (forest land, plantation forest, grazing land, agriculture land, bush and shrub land, bare land, and water bodies) from Landsat images of 1986, 1994, 2007, and 2017 were mapped. Agriculture and plantation forest land use/cover types increased by 21.4% and 368.8%, respectively, while other land use/cover types showed a decreasing trend: water body by 50.0%, bare land by 7.9%, grassland by 41.7%, forest by 28.9%, and bush and shrubland by 38.4%. Overall, 34.6% of the landscape experienced at least one LULC transition over the past 31 years, with 15.3% representing the net change and 19.3% representing the swap change. The percentage change in plantation forest land increased with an increasing altitude and slope gradient during the study period. The mapped LULC changes are consistent with the pressures reported by local residents. They are also consistent with root causes that include population growth, land tenure and common property rights, persistent poverty, weak enforcement of rules and low levels of extension services, a lack of public awareness, and poor infrastructure. Hence, the drivers for LULC should be controlled, and sustainable resources use is required; otherwise, these resources will soon be lost and will no longer be able to play their role in socioeconomic development and environmental sustainability.

M3  - Article
AB  - River channel blockage due to high siltation is common in most urbanised catchments, leading to frequent flooding experiences. This is the case in the Woji River Basin. This study set out to investigate the changing landuse characteristics in the Woji River Basin and its effect on the river channel dynamics and sediment yield. Channel morphometry was determined from remotely sensed data and correlationship was measured using the Spearman ranks and Pearson's product moment co relational statistics. The result showed high influence of urban processes/landuse change on the river sediment yield, channel discharge regimes and channel morphometry characteristics. Other secondary effects of urbanisation on the river dynamics found include: urban encroachment into the floodplains; deposition of wastes into the river course; and high runoff occasioned by increasing basin surface imperviousness - culminating in downstream flooding events. Treatment of river channel and headstream wetlands protection was among recommendations.

M3  - Article
AB  - Urban Heat Island (UHI) is a major challenge in urban environments that affects human activities. This phenomenon is caused and changed by various factors in urban environments, in which identification of such parameters requires fine-scale satellite images. This study, therefore, aimed at investigating spatiotemporal changes of UHIs as well as identification of important factors using remote sensing image fusion techniques in Rasht. The image dataset comprises of Landsat 5, 7, 8 and MODIS images from 2001 to 2018. After pre-processing, multi temporal and multi-sensor image fusion techniques were used to retrieve Landsat 7 images as well as Landsat-like medium spatial resolution images. The effects of built-up areas and surface biophysical characteristics such as brightness, greenness and wetness were also examined on LST changes through time. The results showed that multi-temporal and multi-sensor image fusion methods provide appropriate accuracies and the multi-temporal fusion method performs better than the multi-sensor fusion method. The results also showed that retrieval of sensor products is of higher accuracy than that of the spectral bands. The spatiotemporal changes of UHIs were indicative of an increasing trend over time. Of the surface biophysical parameters, the normalized difference built-up index exhibited the highest correlation with changes of normalized LST.

AB  - Indigenous Pacific knowledges embody creative modes of expression and sensibilities as meaning-making. Academia, as a Western-oriented institution, however, privileges intellectualisations that favour abstract critical thinking through more objective lenses. As Moana-Pacific-Pasifika researchers, being creatively critical in higher education begins from our Indigenous concepts and creative practices such as poetry. Talanoa malie provides a worldview of being-knowing-seeing-doing that we inhabit as Tongans within higher education beyond the boundaries of our ancestral fonua or whenua. Our critical autoethnographic reflections as early career academics are woven through and positioned within our wider talatalanoa, which ultimately seeks to defy, disrupt, and deconstruct dominant Western academic tools and practices within the university context in Aotearoa-New Zealand.

AB  - Two-years field experiments were carried out to compare uniform and variable rate nitrogen fertilization in durum wheat. Satellite images were used to create fertilization maps before the second topdress fertilization. The variable rate fertilizations were applied using simple approaches based on normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) and one combined approach based on nitrogen nutrition index (NNI). 65 kg/ha fertilizer was applied for NDVI based and uniform rates, while NNI rates were based on crop requirements. Crop production and nutrient efficiency were analyzed. Results indicated that differences between treatments in quality and quantity yield variables were not significant. However, the NNI approach showed an economic and environmental advantage.

TI  - 3D Computer-Assisted Geological Mapping: Testing WinGeol's FaultTrace for semi-automatic structural geological assessment
T2  - RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - WinGeol's FaultTrace is a software tool assisting in semi-automatic structural geological mapping of faults and bedding planes. Digital elevation models - such as, for instance, SRTM or ALOS data - are used in combination with satellite imagery for a first structural geological assessment without the requirement of being at the site. Therefore, it is well suited for inaccessible terrain. Borehole data, geological and seismic profiles can be displayed to support the mapping process. Plane elements can be assigned to single as well as to more complex composite geological structures. Moreover, previously mapped data can be densified by interpolation, which is useful to enhance the mapping quality. The tool aims to provide a virtual environment allowing for fast-track and optimized data generation for 3D geological models. The functionality of FaultTrace is demonstrated in two different case studies: The Richat Structure in Mauritania shows relatively planar fault structures within low-relief topography; the Vineh Structure in Iran shows a complex folding in high mountainous terrain. The studies discuss which structural geological settings let expect a satisfying performance of FaultTrace, and what factors limit the achievement of meaningful results. For the most part, the findings are independent of FaultTrace and, thus, valid for similar software tools.

TI  - Folded LDA: Extending the Linear Discriminant Analysis Algorithm for Feature Extraction and Data Reduction in Hyperspectral Remote Sensing
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rich spectral information provided by hyperspectral imaging has made this technology very useful in the classification of remotely sensed data. However, classification of hyperspectral data is typically affected by noise and the Hughes phenomenon due to the presence of hundreds of spectral hands and correlation among them, with usually a limited number of samples for training. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a well-known technique that has been widely used for supervised dimensionality reduction of hyperspectral data. However, the use of LDA in hyperspectral remote sensing is limited due to its poor performance on small training datasets and the limited number of features that can he selected i.e., c - 1, where c is the number of classes in the data. To solve these problems, this article presents a folded LDA (F-LDA) for dimensionality reduction of remotely sensed HSI data in small sample size scenarios. The proposed approach allows many more discriminant features to be selected in comparison to the conventional LDA since the selection is no longer hound by the limiting factor, leading to significantly higher accuracy in the classification of pixels under SSS restrictions. The proposed approach is evaluated on five different datasets, where the experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the F-LDA to the conventional IDA in terms of not only higher classification accuracy but also reduced computational complexity, and reduced contiguous memory requirements.

AB  - COVID-19 or Coronavirus Disease 2019 has become a global pandemic until several countries have implemented social distancing in restrictions on human activities. The Indonesian Government, in early 2020, set a PSBB (Large-Scale Social Restriction) policy. Still, as the COVID-19 Pandemic progressed, the Indonesian Government finally changed the PSBB and implemented the PPKM (Enforcement of Community Activity Restrictions) policy. COVID-19 has an impact on decreasing human and industrial activities. On the other hand, this will be beneficial due to a decrease in air pollutants. Pollutants come from motor vehicle fumes or other industrial activities. The types of pollutants carried out in this research are Carbon Monoxide (CO), Ozone (O3), Sulfur Dioxide (S02), and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2). Using Sentinel-5P Imagery, which can record pollutant activity with the daily temporal resolution, the effect of the number of pollutants on the COVID-19 Pandemic can be investigated using the Google Earth Engine and the correlation test method to relate the effect of pollutant concentrations to BMKG meteorological data. The correlation test of pollutant data on sentinel 5P images with BMKG data shows a strong correlation of 0.5045 and 0.795 in Central Java. In addition, changes in the decrease in CO, NO2, and O3 gases occurred in November 2020 - December 2020. Monitoring of pollutants in Java During the COVID-19 Pandemic was packaged in the Website and Google Earth Engine. According to users, the application obtained a usability test result of 89%

CL  - Yogyakarta, INDONESIA
AB  - Batam, one of the largest cities in Kepulauan Riau Province, Indonesia, has been established as a free-trade zone (FTZ). It is undergoing rapid development and is thus characterized by built-up areas expanding every year. This condition is due to the increasing demand for space and leads to conflicts of needs for land use and incompatibility with the allocation plans. The land cover maps of Batam City in 2000 and 2015 were obtained from the Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 OLI image interpretation and classification, which used maximum likelihood. These maps were also checked with high-resolution imagery (Google Earth image) to produce a confusion matrix to validate or test their accuracy. Land Change Modeler (LCM) was an instrument used to determine changes in land cover from 2000 to 2015. Based on land cover change from 2000 to 2015, the results showed a total increase of 2,401.65 hectares or 43.48% in the built-up area. From 2000 to 2015, it was persistently expanding toward the city's outskirts. The confusion matrixes revealed that the land cover maps in 2000 and 2015 had an overall accuracy of 95.5% and 96.3%, respectively.

TI  - Molecular type and maximal metastasis diameter influence risk of axillary recurrence in breast cancer patients after positive sentinel lymph node biopsy
T2  - REPORTS OF PRACTICAL ONCOLOGY AND RADIOTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Breast cancer patients with positive sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) may be spared axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in favour of irradiation. The aim of the study was to estimate local control probability in the axilla (axLCP).Materials and methods: We identified 1832 invasive breast cancer patients who had undergone SLNB at our centre. We measured maximal metastasis diameter (SLDmax) in the sentinel lymph nodes and lymph node metastasis volume (VALN) from ALND in 246 patients with one or two positive SLNs. We calculated axLCP after irradiation and systemic treatment for different molecular types.Results: VALN values are higher for high grade tumours and larger metastases in SLNs (> 5 mm). It is smaller in luminal A tumours. axLCP is high, nearly 100%, in all molecular types in radiation sensitive tumours (SF2 Gy = 0.45), except luminal B. Expected axLCP is relatively low (67%) in luminal B radiation sensitive tumours with no chemotherapy and nearly 100% with chemotherapy.Conclusion:VALN values differ among molecular tumour types.They depend on SLNDmax and tumour grade. New prognostic factors are needed for selected luminal B breast cancer patients (i.e. high grade tumours, large metastases in SLNs) after positive SLNB intended to be spared ALND and chemotherapy.

TI  - Impact of urban imperviousness on boundary layer meteorology and air chemistry on a regional scale
T2  - METEOROLOGISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT
M3  - Article
AB  - It has been long understood that land cover change from natural to impervious modifes the surface energy balance and hence the dynamical properties of the overlying atmosphere. The urban heat island is manifested in the formation of an urban boundary layer with distinct thermodynamic features that in turn govern transport processes of air pollutants. While many studies already demonstrated the benefit of urban canopy models (UCM) for atmospheric modelling, work on the impact on urban air chemistry is scarce. This study uses the state-of-the-art coupled chemistry-climate modelling system MECO(n) to assess the impact of the COSMO UCM TERRA_URB on the dynamics and gas phase chemistry in the boundary layer of the urban agglomeration Rhine-Main in Germany. Comparing the model results to ground observations and satellite and ground based remote sensing data, we found that the UCM experiment reduces the bias in temperature at the surface and throughout the boundary layer. This is true for ground level NO2 and ozone distribution as well. The application of MECO(n) for urban planning purposes is discussed by designing case studies representing two projected scenarios in future urban planning - densificati n of central urban areas and urban sprawl. Averaged over the core urban region and 10-days during a heat wave period in July 2018, model results indicate a warming of 0.7 K in surface temperature and 0.2 K in air temperature per 10 % increase in impervious surface area fraction. Within this period, a 50 % total increase of imperviousness accounts for a 3 K and 1 K spatially averaged warming respectively. This change in thermodynamic features results in a decrease of surface NO2 concentration by 10-20 % through increased turbulent mixing in areas with highest impervious fraction and highest emissions. In the evening and nighttime however, increased densificati n in the urban centre results in amplifie canyon blocking, which in turn results in average increase in near surface NO2 concentrations of about 10 %, compared to the status quo. This work intends to analyse regional scale features of surface-atmosphere interactions in an urban boundary layer and can be seen as preparatory work for higher resolution street scale models.

TI  - Influencing Factors of Spatial Heterogeneity of Land Surface Temperature in Nanjing, China
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The environment and climate significantly affect the land surface temperature (LST) of a city. Previous studies have revealed that LST exhibits significant spatial heterogeneity primarily caused by a combination of natural factors and human activities. Based on this, the introduction of point of interest data of the "production-living-ecological space" divides the influencing pattern into a comprehensive description of human activities supplemented by natural factors, resulting in the precise influencing factors of spatial heterogeneity of LST. Taking Nanjing (Jiangsu Province, China) as a case study, this study uses Landsat-8 remote sensing images, point of interest data, and other data to establish a geographically weighted regression model that combines natural factors and human activities. The main research results are as follows: First, the LST of Nanjing ranged from 19.9 degrees C to 47.6 degrees C, whereas the distribution trend was "low at both ends and high in the middle." Second, there is no multicollinearity of the influencing factors, the fitting degree of LST and each influencing factor reached 0.87. The regression coefficients were high and exhibited both positive and negative values, implying that spatial heterogeneity exists among the influencing factors and LST. Finally, the ranking of how all factors influence the LST followed the order of water area > forest and grassland > ecological space > slope > production space > elevation > living space. The research results have practical significance for improving the quality of life of urban residents and providing a critical theoretical basis for optimizing urban human settlements.

TI  - Estimation of Hourly Ground-Level PM. Concentration Based on Himawari-8 Apparent Reflectance
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) is a quantitative parameter frequently used to estimate ground-level fine particulate matters (PM<sub>2.5</sub>)at regional to global scales. In this article, Himawari-8 apparent reflectance (top-of-atmosphere reflectance) data were used to estimate the hourly ground-level PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations (Ref-PM<sub>2.5</sub>) using deep neural networks (DNNs), and comparison was conducted with the AOD-based PM<sub>2.5</sub> estimation method (AOD-PM<sub>2.5</sub>). In high-density site areas, the Ref-PM<sub>2.5</sub> method was closer to the actual situation and more capable of PM<sub>2.5</sub> estimation compared with the AOD-PM<sub>2.5</sub> method. The PM<sub>2.5</sub> samples used in the AOD-PM<sub>2.5</sub> method were less than one-half of the Ref-PM<sub>2.5</sub> method due to unavailability of AOD observations, which might be due to strict surface assumptions, cloud detection, and error in the aerosol scheme used in the AOD inversion method. This led to many missing values of AOD-derived PM<sub>2.5</sub> in the spatial distribution map of a single day. Moreover, similar hourly variations in PM<sub>2.5</sub> were observed for both the methods, and the highest concentration of PM<sub>2.5</sub> appeared at the junction of Jiangsu, Anhui, and Shandong at 08:00, 09:00, and 10:00 in local time, which gradually decreased at 11:00 and reached to a minimum value at 16:00 and 18:00.

TI  - A Thermal Infrared Land Surface Temperature Retrieval Algorithm for Thin Cirrus Skies Using Cirrus Optical Properties
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - To acquire daytime land surface temperature (LST) in thin cirrus cloudy skies, we have developed a three-channel LST retrieval algorithm based on a widely used two-channel LST retrieval algorithm for the clear-sky conditions. In this algorithm, the LST is expressed as a multiple linear function of MODIS channels 29, 31 and 32 with the coefficients of the linear function dependent on the cirrus optical depth (COD) and cirrus effective radius (R). The influences from land surface emissivities (LSEs) are also considered in this algorithm. The simulated dataset shows that the LST could be estimated using the proposed algorithm with the root mean squire error (RMSE) less than 2.2 K in thin cirrus cloudy skies (COD less than 0.7) when viewing zenith angle (VZA) equivalent to 0 degrees. As VZA is equivalent to 60 degrees, the maximum RMSE are 2.7 K. The widely used generalized split-window (GSW) algorithm proposed for clear-sky conditions are used in cirrus cloudy skies, and the RMSEs of GSW algorithm estimated LST are 16.89 K and 22.32 K for VZA =0 degrees and VZA =60 degrees respectively when COD is 0.7. It indicates that the proposed three-channel algorithm can significantly improve the LST retrieval accuracy using thermal infrared data in cirrus cloudy skies. To estimate the LST errors caused by the uncertainties of COD, R, LSE and instrument noise, a sensitivity analysis was performed. It shows that the accuracy of cirrus COD is more important for the retrieval of LST compared with other parameters. The maximum total LST errors, taking into account all the input parameters' uncertainty and algorithm error itself, are 3.8 K and 4.3 K when VZA =0 degrees and VZA =60 degrees respectively.

AB  - Snow albedo is an important factor affecting global climate change. Due to the limitation of atmospheric conditions and cloud cover, remote sensing products of snow albedo have data missing and error uncertainty. In this study, based on the method of directly inverting the reflectance of the top of the atmosphere, the difference and accuracy of the snow albedo derived from the Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 data were compared. we used two narrowband-to-broadband conversion algorithms to obtain a total of four snow albedo products. Then we use scatterplots and three indicators (the mean absolute value error, root mean square error, and pearson correlation coefficient) to compare the correlation and accuracy of the four products. The research results show that four snow albedo products derived from satellite (Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8) optical data have a strong correlation. Finally, we use IDL to check each field for regression analysis to obtain a linear regression equation. The fitting coefficient of the equation is between 0.85-0.90. The snow albedo is inverted by a variety of remote sensing data, which provides a solution to the problem of missing data.

AB  - To improve the accuracy of satellite data transmission, deep learning (DL) are applied to the Ka-band satellite communication system under complex channel conditions, and a satellite data transmission method for deep learning-based auto encoder (AE) is proposed in this paper. Specifically, the transmitter and receiver are integrated with deep neural network (DNN), and an interference layer is used to simulate the complex channels that may occur during the satellite data transmission. Finally, we trained the entire network iteratively. And optimized the entire network performance. The result exposed that the proposed method achieve an order of magnitude higher than traditional BPSK modulation, coherent demodulation, Hamming code (HC) and hard-decision decoding method, and two orders of magnitude higher than Hamming code and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) methods. It has been verified that the new network structure of the AE can improve the data transmission accuracy, thus providing new avenues for promoting the application of deep learning in wireless transmission, as well as new ideas for satellite data transmission.

TI  - Application of high-resolution remote sensing technology for the iron ore deposits of the West Kunlun Mountains in China
T2  - GEOLOGIA CROATICA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study focuses on the iron ore of Taxkorgan and Heiqia in the West Kunlun mountains as a case study, for the application of WorldView-2 and IKONOS remote sensing images as major data sources in the fabrication of a standard image map and in the adoption of image enhancement methods to extract information on the ore-controlling factors and mineralization, to interpret remote sensing for the mineral resources in these areas. ASTER, WorldView-2, and IKONOS data were applied for the extraction of alteration anomaly information. With an appropriate amount of field sampling and verification tests, this was used to establish a remote sensing geology prospecting model, that would provide the basis for future remote sensing of metallogenic belts in West Kunlun in the hope of discovering similar minerals. Survey results showed four additional iron ore mineralization belts could be delineated in the Taxkorgan area. A comparative analysis conducted for part of the field confirmation and the known mineral deposits indicated good reliability. In Heiqia, a siderite-haematite mineralization zone was observed with copperlead-zinc formation, 60-km in length and 200-500 m wide, which includes several mineralized bodies. The ore bodies, appear as stratoid, lenticular, or podiform morphologies and were located in the transition site from clastic to carbonate rocks of the D segment in the Wenquangou Group. The ore bodies generally occur within 40 degrees-50 degrees strike and 68 degrees-81 degrees dip, in accordance to the strata. The length of the single body varies from several hundred metres to more than 9500 m. Its exposed thickness on the surface ranges from 2-50 m, and the general thickness was approximately 15 m. The surface ore minerals were mainly haematite and limonite, with a small amount of siderite. Therefore, high-resolution remote sensing technology is suitable for iron ore geological and mineral remote sensing surveying. It is advantageous in both high-ground resolution of optical characteristics and a certain spectral recognition capability, and is effective not only for information extraction from a large area, but also for recognition of local mineralization outcrops. Therefore, high-resolution remote sensing technology is valuable for popularization.

TI  - Very High Spatial Resolution Downscaled SMAP Radiometer Soil Moisture in the CONUS Using VIIRS/MODIS Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing has been providing passive microwave soil moisture (SM) retrievals of a global spatial coverage and a high revisit frequency for research and applications in earth and environmental sciences, specifically after the soil moisture active and passive (SMAP) was launched in 2015. But, the spatial resolution of SM data is restricted to tens of kilometers, which is insufficient for regional or watershed scale studies. In this article, an SM downscaling algorithm was developed based on the vegetation modulated apparent thermal inertia relationship between SM and changes in land surface temperature (LST). The algorithm used data sets from the North America Land Data Assimilation System Noah model outputs and the advanced very high resolution radiometer data of the long term data record from 1981 to 2018. Here, the downscaling model was applied to visible/infred LST data from the visible infrared imaging radiometer suite at 400-m and the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer at 1 km to downscale the L2 radiometer half-orbit 9 km SMAP SM from 2018 to 2019 for the contiguous United States. The 400-m/1-km downscaled SM products were validated using 125 in situ SM ground measurements acquired from the International Soil Moisture Network. The validation results summarized by SM network show that the overall unbiased RMSE for 400-m of the improved/original downscaling algorithms and 1-km SM outperform 9-km SM by 0.01, 0.007, and 0.012 m(3)/m(3) volumetric soil moisture, respectively, which indicates a fairly good performance of the downscaling algorithm. It is also found that precipitation has an impact on the 9-km SMAP SM.

T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - To observe and analyze the application effect of breast-conserving therapy combined with sentinel lymph node biopsy in the treatment of early breast cancer. We selected 120 patients with early breast cancer who were treated in our hospital as subjects. Immediately thereafter, the patients were divided into study group and reference group, each with 60 cases. Different treatment plans were performed. The reference group was treated with conventional surgical mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection. The study group was treated with breast-conserving therapy combined with sentinel lymph node biopsy. The treatment results of the two groups were observed and compared. By observing intraoperative operative time and intraoperative blood loss of the two groups, the results showed the two were significantly less in the study group than the reference group, p<0.05. In comparison of the patients postoperative quality of life and breast cosmetic results, the study group was obviously superior to the reference group, p<0.05. In addition, comparison of postoperative local recurrence rate and distant metastasis rate revealed no significant difference and there was no statistical significance, p>0.05. Treatment of early breast cancer patients with breast-conserving therapy combined with sentinel lymph node biopsy can achieve relatively good results and can significantly improve patient's quality of life.

AB  - Forest vertical stratification directly affects the transfer of solar radiation and water evapotranspiration in the canopy. Consequently, leaf photosynthesis varies in different parts of the canopy, affecting the growth of trees and the succession process of the plant community. The vertical distribution of forest structural parameters, such as the leaf area index (LAI) and clumping index (CI), is critical not only for understanding of the forest carbon, nitrogen, and water cycles and remote sensing radiative transfer processes, but also for forest monitoring and management practices.Forest vertical LAI and CI can be obtained through field measurement and remote sensing inversion methods. For field measurements, LAI-2200, digital hemispherical photography, and photosynthetically active radiation sensors are frequently used instruments. Vertical structural measurements are usually carried out through destructive sampling, tower-base measurement, and mobile elevators. In general, field measurements are more accurate; however, they are time-consuming and laborious, making them unsuitable for large-scale applications.Remote sensing technology uses the passive optical method, the light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technology, and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) methods to estimate forest vertical LAI and CI. The classical passive optical method is based on either the empirical vegetation index estimation method or physical model inversion method. The vegetation index method establishes an empirical relationship between vegetation structural parameters and vegetation indices. Subsequently, the relationship is used to estimate the structural parameters for different layers. The physical model inversion method is based on a physical radiative transfer model. In general, the application of both passive optical and SAR methods in forest vertical parameter retrieval is limited.As an active remote sensing technology, the LiDAR technology has shown its unique advantages in the inversion of vertical structural parameters. Based on the platform used, LiDAR can be classified into three categories: Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), airborne laser scanning (ALS), and spaceborne laser scanning. The basic rationale of the LiDAR technology is based on the BeerLambert Law, which estimates canopy LAI and CI from the canopy gap fraction; both empirical statistical and physical inversion methods are used during the process. The use of LiDAR to estimate LAI and CI is gaining popularity worldwide, but most of the research is based on TLS and ALS. The development of new space-based LiDAR technologies, such as the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation on the International Space Station, will greatly advance the acquisition of forest vertical structural information on a global scale. However, the relatively complex operation and data processing requirements have limited its widespread application.The vertical distribution of forest LAI can be represented by the normal, Weibull, beta, chi-square, and Johnson's S-B distributions. The CI values usually decrease with the increase in canopy height because the upper part of the canopy usually has larger gaps. However, mature global vertical LAI and CI products that can meet the application requirements are currently unavailable. Due to the limits of ground measurements, forest vertical LAI and CI retrieved from remote sensing lack sufficient ground validation. In field measurements, the LAI values of trees, shrubs, and herbs should be acquired simultaneously in order to validate the remote sensing LAI. The development of wireless sensor networks and unmanned aerial vehicles provides convenient and effective methods to obtain a large amount of vertical structural information useful for validation purposes.Forest vertical LAI and CI have been applied in land surface and radiative transfer models and forest management studies. In future research, new field measurement and remote sensing inversion methods should be explored. Various LiDAR data sources can be used to generate high-quality vertical structural products, and these vertical products should be fully validated to better meet the requirements proposed by the research and management communities.

TI  - Laboratory measurement of simulated Martian soil thermal conductivity
T2  - CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE
M3  - Article
AB  - The distribution and evolution of water ice and other volatilcs on the surface of Mars are closely related to its surface's thermal physical properties. The thermal conductivity of Martian soils is the most apparent and flexible thermal physical property and has been a consistent focus of Martian water/ice cycle and surface temperature research The detection of soil properties and water ice is a major scientific objective of Tian en-I. China's fiat Mars mission. Because in-situ Mars exploration missions are rare, studies on the thermal physical properties of Martian soils remain largely limited to laboratory simulation experiments and the interpretation of remote sensing data. However, the latter approach is highly sensitive to the chosen model, which is based on theoretical predictions and experimental data. Although numerous experimental studies have sought to model the factors that affect the thermal conductivity of soils under Mars-like conditions, few have studied the influence of ice content. In this study, we measured the thermal conductivity of simulated Martian soils with variable water ice contents under Mars-like environmental conditions. The simulated Martian soil JMSS-1 was used as a base sample with physical properties and chemical components similar to those of Martian soils. The samples were pre-dried and carefully mixed with variable mass fractions of ultrapure water. Two groups of samples were used: (1) Dried samples and (2) samples mixed with 2% water. A vacuum freeze-dryer was adapted to apply low temperatures and pressures to resemble Martian surface conditions. Samples were then placed into the freeze-dryer chamber and cooled to as low as 40 degrees C. The two sample groups were measured under ambient air pressure varying from 100 to 900 Pa. Prior to each measurement, the samples were maintained under the same pressure and temperature conditions to ensure thermal equilibrium, thus avoiding any temperature drift effects. The transient hot-wire method was used to measure the thermal conductivity. Constantan wire was chosen as the heating wire owing to its low temperature resistance coefficient. The temperature was monitored using an ultrathin T-type thermocouple placed adjacent to the heating wire in the middle of the sample using the minimum thermocouple size to reduce unwanted heat loss. A high-accuracy current source was used to supply the designated power, and a 24-bit analog-to-digital converter module was used to interpret the thermocouple data. All of the data were sent to a computer via serial communication. Measurements under each condition were repeated multiple times and tlx mean values were used for data analysis. The accuracy and stability of the experimental data output were confirmed by comparing with values acquired using the transient plane source method. The experiment accuracy was similar to 2%-3% compared with the results obtained from the same samples tested using a commercial transient plane source thermal analyzer (HotDisk TPS 2500S). The obtained thermal conductivities of the thy soil samples under vacuum conditions agree with the fitted model of previous studies. The repeatability of this measurement approach is higher than 95%.The results show that for each sample group, the thermal conductivity increases with increasing ambient air pressure. The thermal conductivity data below 900 Pa are nearly four times higher than values obtained from the same samples below 100 Pa. The introduction of water ice into the samples also significantly altered the sample thermal properties. The thermal conductivities of samples with 2% water ice are 2-3 times higher than those of the thy soil samples measured under the same pressure conditions. This work provides an important foundation for interpreting China's Tianwen-1 Mars probe to model and predict the distribution of ice on the Martian subsurface. The experimental setup is also useful for future Mars in-situ ice detection and resource utilization.

TI  - Study of Persistent Pollution in Hefei during Winter Revealed by Ground-Based LiDAR and the CALIPSO Satellite
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - LiDAR and CALIPSO satellites are effective tools for detecting air pollution, and by employing PM2.5 observation data, ground-based LiDAR measurements, CALIPSO satellite data, meteorological data, and back-trajectory analysis, we analyzed the process of pollution (moderate pollution, heavy pollution, excellent weather, and dust transmission weather) in Hefei, China from 24 to 27 January 2019 and analyzed the meteorological conditions and pollutants causing heavy pollution. Observation data from the ground station showed that the concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 increased significantly on 25 January; the maximum value of PM10 was 175 mu g/m(3), and the maximum value of PM2.5 was 170 mu g/m(3). In this study, aerosol transboundary transport was observed using a combination of ground-based LiDAR and CALIPSO satellite observations. This method showed that aerosols were distributed at a height of 3-4 km over Hefei at 12:00 on 26 January, and it was found that the aerosols came from the desert region in northwest China. Moreover, we determined its transport pathway based on the backward trajectory, and the transportation of pollutants from the surrounding important industrial cities in central and eastern China led to severe pollution after aggregating and mixing with local aerosols in Hefei in the winter. Therefore, the method proposed in this paper can effectively monitor the optical properties and transportation process of aerosols, help to explore the causes of pollution under complex conditions, and improve environmental quality.

TI  - Predicting of Sentinel Lymph Node Status in Breast Cancer Patients with Clinically Negative Nodes: A Validation Study
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple SummarySentinel lymph node biopsy procedure is time consuming and expensive, but it is still the intra-operative exam capable of the best performance. However, sometimes, surgery is achieved without a clear diagnosis, so clinical decision support systems developed with artificial intelligence techniques are essential to assist current diagnostic procedures. In this work, we evaluated the usefulness of a CancerMath tool in the sentinel lymph nodes positivity prediction for clinically negative patients. We tested it on 993 patients referred to our institute characterized by sentinel lymph node status, tumor size, age, histologic type, grading, expression of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, HER2, and Ki-67. By training the CancerMath (CM) model on our dataset, we reached a sensitivity value of 72%, whereas the online one was 46%, despite a specificity reduction. It was found the addiction of the prognostic factors Her2 and Ki67 could help improve performances on the classification of particular types of patients.In the absence of lymph node abnormalities detectable on clinical examination or imaging, the guidelines provide for the dissection of the first axillary draining lymph nodes during surgery. It is not always possible to arrive at surgery without diagnostic doubts, and machine learning algorithms can support clinical decisions. The web calculator CancerMath (CM) allows you to estimate the probability of having positive lymph nodes valued on the basis of tumor size, age, histologic type, grading, expression of estrogen receptor, and progesterone receptor. We collected 993 patients referred to our institute with clinically negative results characterized by sentinel lymph node status, prognostic factors defined by CM, and also human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and Ki-67. Area Under the Curve (AUC) values obtained by the online CM application were comparable with those obtained after training its algorithm on our database. Nevertheless, by training the CM model on our dataset and using the same feature, we reached a sensitivity median value of 72%, whereas the online one was equal to 46%, despite a specificity reduction. We found that the addition of the prognostic factors Her2 and Ki67 could help improve performances on the classification of particular types of patients with the aim of reducing as much as possible the false positives that lead to axillary dissection. As showed by our experimental results, it is not particularly suitable for use as a support instrument for the prediction of metastatic lymph nodes on clinically negative patients.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Analysis of Drought in Rice Fields Using Normalized Difference Drought Index (NDDI) in Indramayu Regency
T2  - SEVENTH GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM 2021
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 7th Geoinformation Science Symposium
CL  - Yogyakarta, INDONESIA
AB  - Drought explains a stage of water scarcity at a particular time in a certain location. In land, drought has impacts in many ways. Crop failure or "puso" will occur from a short-term drought, while economic disruption might happen in a longterm drought period. Several parts of Indonesia were periodically impacted by drought during the dry season, including Indramayu Regency. As one of the largest rice barns in West Java, 63% of Indramayu is covered by the rice field. Therefore, monitoring agricultural drought in such locations is challenging due to the extensive damage caused by the event. This study aims to analyze the spatial and temporal distribution of drought in Indramayu's rice fields. This study utilizes the Normalized Difference Drought Index (NDDI) generated from Landsat 8 OLI-TIRS to identify drought locations. Observation is carried out during the dry months of July, August, September, and October. Most severe drought areas were found in October, especially in three sub-districts, including Gantar, Kroya, and Haurgeulis. Statistical-based correlation analysis shows a significant relationship between NDDI and distance from the irrigation network, although a relatively stronger correlation was found between NDDI and crop productivity. Conclusively, NDDI was successfully applied to identify drought areas in Indramayu Regency.

TI  - Identification of paddy fields based on temporal phase using Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) on Landsat-8 OLI
T2  - SEVENTH GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM 2021
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 7th Geoinformation Science Symposium
CL  - Yogyakarta, INDONESIA
AB  - Updating information on rice fields is very important to pay attention to environmental quality and food security. This is related to Indonesia's commitment to achieving Sustainable Development Goal number two in terms of agricultural data collection and analysis. Remote sensing can be used as an alternative method for identifying and mapping land cover, for instance paddy fields. Land cover in paddy fields varies greatly according to paddy growth phase, wherein these growth phase can be shown by different spectral reflectance values in remote sensing imagery. Mapping of paddy fields based on their spectral reflectance began to be widely carried out in Indonesia. Therefore, the aims of this study were to determine the spectral reflectance pattern of temporal paddy growth phase then form a map of the paddy fields based on those spectral libraries. This study used Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) method to identify paddy fields on Landsat-8 OLI determined from spectral reflectance pattern of paddy-growth phase in some areas of Subang and Indramayu Regency in one growing season. The results succeeded in classifying paddy fields and non-paddy fields area. Classified paddy fields consisted of several land covers comprising the bare-land, inundation-land, vegetative, generative, and ripening. The accuracy test showed an overall accuracy of 70.07%. Misclassification in this study occurred due to the existence of thin cloud cover, besides there was a misclassification between built-up area and the bare land.

TI  - Estimated change in the percentage of vegetation cover after the eruption of Mount Agung, Bali in 2017
T2  - SEVENTH GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM 2021
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 7th Geoinformation Science Symposium
CL  - Yogyakarta, INDONESIA
AB  - Vegetation is the key to the ecological conditions of an area, especially the highlands, which function as protected areas. The mapping of vegetation cover percentage is essential considering that highlands in Indonesia have massive changes, particularly in areas affected by eruptions. This study aims to map the changes in vegetation cover percentage of the area around Mount Agung after the eruption in 2017. Pre-eruption and post-eruption multi-temporal remote sensing data were used to extract the percentage of vegetation cover using an empirical model built from regression of NDVI values and visual observation of vegetation cover percentage based on high-resolution imagery. The estimated error value is 9.67% of pre-eruption condition cover and 14.45% of post-eruption condition cover, used as a threshold value to determine the area and location of percentage changes of vegetation cover. The area of 1.93 km(2) decreases vegetation cover percentage due to the eruption on the southern and southwest slopes of Mount Agung. The area that has not changed because of the eruption dominates at 24.92 km(2). The area that experienced increasing vegetation cover percentages was minimal due to vegetation growth during the temporal difference of imagery (5 months).

TI  - The Media as Part of a Detached Elite? Exploring Antimedia Populism Among Citizens and Its Relation to Political Populism
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Populism research usually addresses politicians as part of the criticized elite, but neglects the media. This study explores populist attitudes against the media and their relation to political populism. The study validates the proposed antimedia populism scale and shows that antimedia populist attitudes apply to a specific and small group of German society. Confirming a relationship between political populism and antimedia populist attitudes, the results indicate that citizens who have developed a populist worldview tend to evaluate the media in congruence with this overall ideology and include the media in their conception of a detached elite. Moreover, antimedia populist attitudes are more common among individuals with feelings of relative deprivation and those with antipluralist and authoritarian submission attitudes.

TI  - Assessment of GEDI's LiDAR Data for the Estimation of Canopy Heights and Wood Volume of Eucalyptus Plantations in Brazil
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past two decades spaceborne LiDARsystems have gainedmomentumin the remote sensing community with their ability to accurately estimate canopy heights and aboveground biomass. This article aims at using the most recent global ecosystem dynamics investigation (GEDI) LiDAR system data to estimate the stand-scale dominant heights (H-dom), and stand volume (V) of Eucalyptus plantations in Brazil. These plantations provide a valuable case study due to the homogenous canopy cover and the availability of precise field measurements. Several linear and nonlinear regression models were used for the estimation of H-dom and V based on several GEDI metrics. H-dom and V estimation results showed that over low-slopped terrain the most accurate estimates of H-dom and V were obtained using the stepwise regression, with an root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 1.33m(R-2 of 0.93) and 24.39 m(3).ha(-1) (R-2 of 0.90) respectively. The principal metric explaining more than 87% and 84% of the variability (R-2) of H-dom and V was the metric representing the height above the ground at which 90% of the waveform energy occurs. Testing the postprocessed GEDI metric values issued from six available different processing algorithms showed that the accuracy on H-dom and V estimates is algorithm dependent, with a 16% observed increase in RMSE on both variables using algorithm a5 vs. a1. Finally, the choice to select the ground return from the last detected mode or the stronger of the last two modes could also affect the H-dom estimation accuracy with 12 cm RMSE decrease using the latter.

T2  - GEOGRAPHIA CASSOVIENSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The geographic data play an important role in atmospheric and weather forecasting. They influence input physical parameters defining the energy balance and heat and moisture fluxes in the planetary boundary layer. The goal of this paper is to increase the accuracy of the widely used Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) numerical prediction model using a more detailed, 100 m resolution Corine Land Cover 2018 (CLC) and Japanese Space Agency (JAXA) elevation data in comparison to global data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) containing the MODIS LULC land cover and elevation data. The WRF-ARW variant of the model is applied to a study area of 50x50 km in the Kosice region at a microscale level with a spatial resolution of 250 m for June 24, 2020. The GIS4WRF module in QGIS and other GIS tools are used to perform modelling and input and output data preparation and result analysis. The results for both datasets are compared to data measured in local weather stations and statistically evaluated. The use of higher-resolution geographical data improves the overall accuracy of the model for this microscale level.

M3  - Article
AB  - The work presents the comprehensive methodology for assessment of the state of the urban aquatic environment such as Lakes Opechen, Verbne, and Redkyne in Kyiv using the methods of system analysis. The methodology includes structural-textural analysis of the satellite images and the method based on statistical criteria. The spectral-texture analysis of the satellite images was used to get input information for remote assessment of reservoirs as index images: Normalized Difference Pond Index (NDPI), Normalized Difference Turbidity Index (NDTI), and Normalized Difference Algae Index (NDAI) computed from the Sentinel-2. The surface temperature distribution was estimated from the Landsat 8. The method based on statistical criteria is used for a detailed assessment of the aquatic environment using the obtained indexed images and the corresponding cartographic representation of the water quality. The probabilistic and statistical approaches were used to present the statistical criterion for recognizing classes of objects based on the results of measuring their informative features. These approaches are used to solve optimization problems in statistical theories of identification and recognition. This method allowed the cartographic representing of the change in the water quality and aquatic ecosystem in accordance with the reference areas of the state of the reservoir in 2017. temperature map.

TI  - NATIONAL AND CULTURAL SPECIFICITY OF BIBLICAL ANTHROPONYMS IN THE COMPOSITION OF SPANISH AND RUSSIAN PHRASEOLOGICAL UNITS: DINAMIC ASPECT
T2  - VESTNIK VOLGOGRADSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-SERIYA 2-YAZYKOZNANIE
M3  - Article
AB  - The article presents a synchronous comparative analysis of the semantic structure of biblical anthroponyms Matusalen / Mafusail (Methuselah), Adan / Adam, Lazaro / Lazar as part of the Spanish and Russian phraseological units. The research aims at determining and comparing the national-and-cultural specifics of biblical anthroponyms in the Spanish language worldview against the background of the Russian one, and elucidates the cognitive basis of this specificity. The methods of phraseological identification, vocabulary definitions analysis, functional and pragmatic interpretation have been used. The main methods applied are component, discursive, linguo-cultural and comparative analysis. It is concluded that national and cultural specificity of biblical-anthroponyms in the Spanish language picture of the world is manifested in the contradiction between the actual and etymological meanings of biblical anthroponyms, in the stylistic detraction of biblical images, their habitation and desacralization with the predominance of pejorative assessment. In Russian linguoculture, biblical anthroponyms mostly retain their original etymology, relate to moral categories and internal characteristics of a person, while in Spanish they are associated with external, physical characteristics. In everyday Spanish discourse, there is a further expansion and detraction in the semantics of bibleisms, their reinterpretation within the tendency to carnivality, resulting from implementation of humorous attitude to reality comprehension.

TI  - Doctor of Physical Therapy Student Perceptions of Domestic Versus International Service-Learning Experiences: A Mixed-Methods Approach.
T2  - Journal of allied health
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) students' perceptions of service-learning between domestic and international service-learning experiences (SLEs).METHODS: DPT students participated in semi-structured interviews (n=35) and completed the Service-Learning Benefit (SELEB) scale (n=21). Focus group questions targeted the impact of the SLE on topics related to PT services, social responsibility, cultural competence, and personal commitment to engaging in future service-related activities. The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed. Incident coding processes analyzed transcripts of the focus groups. Differences in the students' perceptions of the benefit of SLEs using the SELEB were examined using Wilcoxon signed-rank test.RESULTS: Perceived advantages of an international SLE included improved relationship building, social responsibility, citizenship skills, cultural competence, gaining trust of others, and expansion of worldview. Perceived different benefits of the domestic SLE were planning and organizing the experience and improved commitment to the community. Additionally, students who participated in the international SLE cited more barriers (e.g., cost) than in the domestic SLEs.CONCLUSION: DPT students participating in domestic vs international SLEs appear to have different perceptions of SLE. Further research is needed to examine the perspective of other stakeholders involved in domestic and international SLEs.

TI  - Spatial and temporal variations in two vegetation spectral indexes in the National Botanic Garden of Cuba, during 1984-2020
T2  - Revista del Jardin Botanico Nacional
M3  - Article
AB  - The Cuban National Botanic Garden is divided in 26 zones, with floristic representation from different phytogeographical regions, requiring a considerable effort for it maintenance. In the present paper, based on satellite imagery, the vegetation cover was spectrally characterized in the different areas of the garden and its trends since 1984 to 2020 were described. Using digitized maps and mean composition maps of NDVI and EVI per decade, from 535 Landsat (4/5/ 7/8) images, we extract indexes values in 2 455 random points, separated more than 30 m each. During the studied period the area of this garden show a mean NDVI of 0.635, with extreme values from 0.417 to 0.805. Places of higher NDVI index values were Central-Cuban Semideciduous Forest, Pine Forest, Dry Forest and Eastern Cuban Semideciduous Forest. For EVI index higher values corresponded to Eastern Cuban Semideciduous Forest, Central America Zone, South America Zone and Africa Zone. In the last decade, NDVI median per zone vary from 0.808 in Mogote Zone up to 0.613 in Cultivated Plants Zone, and in EVI index, maximum values were at Coastal Shrub with 0.537. The patterns of variation differed between zones, according to tree cover presence or absence, which generally increased when moving away from the roads. The historical trend show a sustained increase in indexes values suggesting a positive evolution of the vegetation cover. The results obtained can contribute to the proper management of the Cuban National Botanic Garden collections.

TI  - Seasonal behavior of vegetation determined by sensor on an unmanned aerial vehicle
T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Geographic information systems make it possible to obtain fine scale maps for environmental monitoring from airborne sensors on aerial platforms, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which offer products with low costs and high spacetime resolution. The present study assessed the performance of an UAV in the evaluation of the seasonal behavior of five vegetation coverages: Coffea spp., Eucalyptus spp., Pinus spp. and two forest remnants. For this, vegetation indices (Excess Green and Excess Red minus Green), meteorological data and moisture of surface soils were used. In addition, Sentinel-2 satellite images were used to validate these results. The highest correlations with soil moisture were found in coffee and Forest Remnant 1. The Coffea spp. had the indices with the highest correlation to the studied soil properties. However, the UAV images also provided relevant results for understanding the dynamics of forest remnants. The Excess Green index (p = 0.96) had the highest correlation coefficients for Coffea spp., while the Excess Red minus Green index was the best index for forest remnants (p = 0.75). The results confirmed that low-cost UAVs have the potential to be used as a support tool for phenological studies and can also validate satellite-derived data.

AB  - While querying of structured geo-spatial data such as Google Maps has become commonplace, there remains a wealth of unstructured information in overhead imagery that is largely inaccessible to users. This information can be made accessible using machine learning for Visual Question Answering (VQA) about remote sensing imagery. We propose a novel method for Earth observation based on answering natural language questions about satellite images that uses cross-modal attention between image objects and text. The image is encoded with an object-centric feature space, with self-attention between objects, and the question is encoded with a language transformer network. The image and question representations are fed to a crossmodal transformer network that uses cross-attention between the image and text modalities to generate the answer. Our method is applied to the RSVQA remote sensing dataset and achieves a significant accuracy increase over the previous benchmark.

TI  - Analyzing the Effect of the Spectral Interference of Mixed Pixels Using Hyperspectral Imagery
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The widespread presence of mixed pixels in remotely sensed images is a pressing challenge for accurate target detection and classification. Linear spectral mixture analysis (LSMA) is commonly used to address this problem by deriving remotely sensed information at the subpixel level. In the implementation of LSMA, the effects of mixed-pixel spectral interference need to be taken into account; mixed spectra would exhibit as a pure spectral characteristic when the abundance of one endmember in a mixed pixel exceeds a specific threshold. However, the thresholds of endmember abundance resulting in mixed-pixel spectral interference remain unclear. Thus, this study designed an experiment to analyze the effect of the spectral interference of mixed pixels and to identify the thresholds causing such interference by spectral similarity measures (spectral angle and spectral distance). Four types of pure endmember spectra (vegetation, high-albedo impervious surface (HIS), low-albedo impervious surface (LIS), soil) and corresponding representative mixed spectra with endmember abundances of 95%-5% at intervals of 5% were collected from Earth Observing-1 Hyperion imagery. Spectral similarity measures among the pure endmember spectra and representative mixed spectra were used to determine the thresholds of endmember abundance that cause spectral interference. The results verified the effect of the spectral interference of mixed pixels. The thresholds of abundance causing mixed-pixel spectral interference in vegetation, HIS, LIS, and soil endmembers were 70%, 75%, 80%, and 70%, respectively. Therefore, when the endmember abundance within mixed pixels exceeds the abovementioned thresholds, these mixed spectra are interfered and would exhibit as a pure spectral characteristic. Accordingly, interfered mixed pixels have to be removed before applying LSMA or other unmixing methods to avoid the effect of spectral interference.

CP  - 7th Symposium on Novel Photoelectronic Detection Technology and Applications
CL  - Kunming, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - The Advanced Hyper-spectral Imager (AHSI) data on-board GF-5 satellite fills up China's lack of hyper-spectral earth observation technology. However, using GF-5 AHSI data for remote sensing applications, especially quantitative remote sensing applications, a challenging problem is to retrieve surface reflectance through atmospheric correction. In this paper, the MODerate spectral resolution atmospheric TRANsmittance algorithm and computer model (MODTRAN) radiative transfer model was used to perform atmospheric correction experiments (AHSI-AC) for GF-5 AHSI data. And we validated the atmospheric correction results based on measured surface reflectance and Landsat 8 surface reflectance data. Using field-measure spectra for validation the AHSI-AC method has a relative error of about 10% in most bands. Compared with the ENVI-FLAASH algorithm, the accuracy of the blue-green bands and the short-wave infrared bands are significantly improved, and the red and near-infrared bands are similar. Using Landsat 8 data for intercomparison, the large homogeneous, non-vegetated pixels were selected, and the overall accuracy of the 515 selected validation points reached 81.7%.

TI  - Satellite-Based Monitoring of Annual Coastal Reclamation in Shenzhen and Hong Kong since the 21st Century: A Comparative Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - To solve the shortage of land resources, many coastal cities have implemented coastal reclamation projects over the past few decades. Coastal reclamation can promote the economic development of coastal cities and improve human well-being in coastal zones. However, it can inevitably cause a series of ecological and environmental issues, such as coastal water pollution, ecosystem destruction, habitat loss, and land subsidence. Shenzhen and Hong Kong are two large neighboring Chinese coastal cities in southern China with different systems. As densely populated and economically developed cities, they face similar land shortage issues. However, recent coastal reclamation changes in Shenzhen and Hong Kong are unclear under different social and political systems. To fill this gap, this study aimed to monitor and compare recent annual coastal reclamation in Shenzhen and Hong Kong with totally different systems using free and open satellite products. Then, to compare the results of coastal reclamation between Shenzhen and Hong Kong. Large-scale coastal reclamation in Shenzhen and Hong Kong from 2000 to 2018 can be observed. The total area of coastal reclamation was 4140.7 hm(2), of which the total coastal reclamation area in Shenzhen was 3409.8 hm(2) and the total coastal reclamation area in Hong Kong was 730.9 hm(2). Coastal reclamation in Shenzhen showed a temporal characteristic of "increasing slightly and then decreasing sharply". Before and after 2010, the area of accumulated coastal reclamation were 3202.9 hm(2) and 206.9 hm(2). Comparatively, coastal reclamation in Hong Kong exhibited a temporal characteristic of "first decreasing and then increasing and then decreasing". In 2002 and 2014, the scale of coastal reclamation was relatively large, with a total area of 501.8 hm(2), accounting for 69.19% of its total area of coastal reclamation. The comparison between our produced coastal reclamation and the official area on coastal reclamation exhibited a good agreement based on correlation analysis (r = 0.99) and RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) (0.72). Since the 21st century, Shenzhen and Hong Kong have shown different, even opposite, policies on coastal reclamation. It will be necessary to continuously monitor future coastal reclamation driven by policies for better conducting sustainable coastal development in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.

TI  - Detection of Urban Built-Up Area Change From Sentinel-2 Images Using Multiband Temporal Texture and One-Class Random Forest
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detection of urban land expansion is important for understanding the urbanization process and improving urban planning. Spatio-temporal contextual information derived from multitemporal high-resolution imagery is useful for highlighting urban land cover changes. This article proposes a new method for detecting urban built-up area change from multitemporal high spatial resolution imagery by combining spectral and spatio-temporal features. A multiband temporal texture measured using pseudo cross multivariate variogram (PCMV) is adopted to quantify the local spatio-temporal dependence between bitemporal multispectral images. The PCMV textures at multiple scales, bitemporal spectral features, and normalized difference vegetation indices are together input to an improved one-class random forest classifier for urban built-up area change mapping. The proposed method is evaluated in urban built-up area change detection using multitemporal Sentinel-2 images of Tianjin area acquired from 2015 to 2019. It is also compared with three feature combinations and an existing postclassification comparison method based on one-class support vector machine. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperformed the traditional ones, with increases of 2.15%-7.38%, 2.07%-5.45%, 1.93%-6.76%, and 5.98%-13.11% in overall accuracy. Moreover, the proposed method also achieves the best performance using the bitemporal Sentinel-2 images over the east of Beijing area. The proposed method is promising as a simple and reliable way to detect urban built-up area change with multitemporal Sentinel-2 imagery.

TI  - Do reconstructed landforms have multifractal characteristics? A case study at an opencast coalmine dump in the loess area of China
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Opencast coal mining causes large changes in landform. The geomorphological features of the reconstructed landform have not been fully understood in the loess area. To quantify the characteristics of the reconstructed landform, multifractal analysis and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were applied to classify three soil dumps, located at the Antaibao opencast coalmine in China. Most parts of the reconstructed soil dumps had multifractal characteristics. Multifractal parameters reflected heterogeneity of the reconstructed landform from surface relief, regularity and variance in elevation, and the results of PCA further provided a good explanation of the differences and similarities among the three soil dumps. Sub-areas of the South Dump (S-1, S-2, S-3, and S-4) were clustered together and this grouping was explained by relatively high D(0), a(max) and D(q)(min), whereas subareas of the remaining dumps were sparsely distributed. Long-term restoration and soil erosion may cause the homogenization of the reconstructed landform. Moreover, multifractal parameters, D(q)(min), D(0), D(1), D(2), a(min) and f(a(min)) were significantly correlated with Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), suggesting susceptibility of the restored vegetation to landform development. Therefore, to improve revegetation practice, micro-topographic measures and silviculture technology are both needed in post-mining areas. The micro-geomorphological patterns could not only improve the efficiency of water use, but also provide a basis for the evolution of geomorphological research in the loess area of China.

TI  - PROSPECT-PRO for estimating content of nitrogen-containing leaf proteins and other carbon-based constituents
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Models of radiative transfer (RT) are important tools for remote sensing of vegetation, allowing for forward simulations of remotely sensed data as well as inverse estimation of biophysical and biochemical traits from vegetation optical properties. Estimation of foliar protein content is the key to monitor the nitrogen cycle in terrestrial ecosystems, in particular to assess the photosynthetic capacity of plants and to improve nitrogen management in agriculture. However, until now physically based leaf RT models have not allowed for proper spectral decomposition and estimation of leaf dry matter as nitrogen-based proteins and other carbon-based constituents (CBC) from optical properties of fresh and dry foliage. Such an achievement is the key for subsequent upscaling to canopy level and for development of new Earth observation applications.Therefore, we developed a new version of the PROSPECT model, named PROSPECT-PRO, which separates the nitrogen-based constituents (proteins) from CBC (including cellulose, lignin, hemicellulose, starch and sugars). PROSPECT-PRO was calibrated and validated on subsets of the LOPEX dataset, accounting for both fresh and dry broadleaf and grass samples. We applied an iterative model inversion optimization algorithm and identified the optimal spectral ranges for retrieval of proteins and CBC. When combining leaf reflectance and transmittance within the selected optimal spectral domains, PROSPECT-PRO inversions revealed similarly accurate CBC estimates of fresh and dry leaf samples (respective validation R-2 = 0.96 and 0.95, NRMSE = 9.6% and 13.4%), whereas a better performance was obtained for fresh than for dry leaves when estimating proteins (respective validation R-2 = 0.79 and 0.57, NRMSE = 15.1% and 26.1%). The accurate estimation of leaf constituents for fresh samples is attributed to the optimal spectral feature selection procedure.We further tested the ability of PROSPECT-PRO to estimate leaf mass per area (LMA) as the sum of proteins and CBC using independent datasets acquired for numerous plant species. Results showed that both PROSPECT PRO and PROSPECT-D inversions were able to produce comparable LMA estimates across an independent dataset gathering 1685 leaf samples (validation R-2 = 0.90 and NRMSE = 16.5% for PROSPECT-PRO, and R-2 = 0.90 and NRMSE =18.3% for PROSPECT-D). Findings also revealed that PROSPECT-PRO is capable of assessing the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio based on the retrieved CBC-to-proteins ratio (R-2 = 0.87 and NRMSE = 15.7% for fresh leaves, and R-2 = 0.65 and NRMSE= 28.1% for dry leaves). The performance assessment of newly designed PROSPECT-PRO demonstrates a promising potential for its involvement in precision agriculture and ecological applications aiming at estimation of leaf carbon and nitrogen contents from observations of current and forthcoming airborne and satellite imaging spectroscopy sensors.

T2  - ARAUCARIA-REVISTA IBEROAMERICANA DE FILOSOFIA POLITICA Y HUMANIDADES
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to show that the male control system of the Renaissance had cracks that some women were fully aware of, an analysis of El libro de la vida by St. Theresa of Jesus is conducted taking into account the main concepts of classical philosophical anthropology, assuming that one of the feminine tools of political expansion is the publication of an autobiography in which it is explained not only what the world is like but also how it should be. Thus, this book by Teresa de Avila is established to be an ethical proposal of life in which behavioral patterns are offered while the author configures herself as a female-being-in-the-world (society and history), as a woman-in-the-hereand-now (space and time) and as a woman-locuens (language and ego). The key is to understand that several female intellectuals used the autobiography to give their voice to the world throughout history, since their theological or philosophical discourses were banned -as these were conceived within the patriarchal worldview.

TI  - Sentinel-3 Super-Resolution Based on Dense Multireceptive Channel Attention
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The unprecedented availability of remote sensing data from different complementary Sentinel missions provides increasing opportunities to alleviate the spatial limitations of Sentinel-3 (S3) from an intersensor perspective. Nonetheless, effectively exploiting such intersensor synergies still raises important challenges for super-resolution (SR) algorithms in terms of operational data availability, sensor alignment and substantial resolution changes, among others. In this scenario, this article sets a new SR framework for spatially enhancing S3 ocean and land color instrument (OLCI) products by taking advantage of the higher spatial resolution of the Sentinel-2 (S2) multispectral instrument (MSI). To achieve this goal, we initially study some of the most important deep learning-based approaches. Then, we define a novel Level-4 SR framework which integrates a new convolutional neural network specially designed for super-resolving OLCI data. In contrast to other networks, the proposed SR architecture (termed as SRS3) employs a dense multireceptive field together with a residual channel attention mechanism to relieve the particularly low spatial resolution of OLCI while extracting more discriminating features for the large spatial resolution differences with respect to MSI. The experimental part of the work, conducted using ten coupled OLCI and MSI operational data, reveals the suitability of the presented Level-4 SR framework within the Copernicus programme context as well as the advantages of the proposed architecture with respect different state-of-the-art models when spatially enhancing OLCI products. The related codes will be publicly available at https://github.com/rufernan/SRS3.

M3  - Article
AB  - The estimation of biophysical variables from remote sensing data raises important challenges in terms of the acquisition technology and its limitations. In this way, some vegetation parameters, such as chlorophyll fluorescence, require sensors with a high spectral resolution that constrains the spatial resolution while significantly increasing the subpixel land-cover heterogeneity. Precisely, this spatial variability often makes that rather different canopy structures are aggregated together, which eventually generates important deviations in the corresponding parameter quantification. In the context of the Copernicus program (and other related Earth Explorer missions), this article proposes a new statistical methodology to manage the subpixel spatial heterogeneity problem in Sentinel-3 (S3) and FLuorescence EXplorer (FLEX) by taking advantage of the higher spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 (S2). Specifically, the proposed approach first characterizes the subpixel spatial patterns of S3/FLEX using inter-sensor data from S2. Then, a multivariate analysis is conducted to model the influence of these spatial patterns in the errors of the estimated biophysical variables related to chlorophyll which are used as fluorescence proxies. Finally, these modeled distributions are employed to predict the confidence of S3/FLEX products on demand. Our experiments, conducted using multiple operational S2 and simulated S3 data products, reveal the advantages of the proposed methodology to effectively measure the confidence and expected deviations of different vegetation parameters with respect to standard regression algorithms.

AB  - Olive groves have high socioeconomic impacts in Spain. Global warming is leading to changes in agrarian systems, affecting phenology and productivity. Remote Sensing data is useful to study the current trends in olive groves. The MED-GOLD project, funded by the European Union's H2020 programme (No. 776467), aims to develop climate services for the Mediterranean agri-food sector (grape, olives and durum wheat). In this work, images from the MODIS sensor have been used to study the status of olive groves in 2000-2020 in Southern Spain. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and Normalized Multi-band Drought Index (NMDI) were computed and correlated with precipitation and temperature using datasets provided by the Environmental Information Network of Andalusia (REDIAM) and scenarios based on the MED-GOLD outcomes. Additionally, some annual indicators were derived from NDVI to study trends: maximum (MAX), minimum (MIN), mean (MEAN), relative range (RREL), date of the maximum (DMAX) and date of the minimum (DMIN). Reported good and bad production years were reflected on vegetation indices. Trends were observed in annual indicators. The average photosynthetic activity increased, especially in MIN (Delta(year) = 0.0025; r2 = 0.68). The trend of RREL (Delta(year) = -0.012; r2 = 0.52) indicated that vegetation is moving to a more constant seasonal behaviour. The beginning and end of the season tend to occur earlier each year, as showed by DMAX (Delta(year) = -2.7 days) and DMIN (Delta(year) = -1.7 years). Management practices may require adaptations to the new seasonal behaviour of herbaceous vegetation, which could affect soil properties.

AB  - The oceans have always been an essential source of resources for humankind, however there are numerous activities and harmful phenomena such as ocean acidification and overfishing that are severely threatening the health of the world's oceans. Ocean farming could both diminish the pressure on providing food from natural, already endangered ecosystems by offering an alternative to catching seafood; and also help to recover some areas of the ocean by growing specific species that can improve the quality of the water. This promising industry must be encouraged by facilitating its development and protecting it from hazards.This study focuses on the design of a model for estimating the viability of ocean farms in specific regions, considering the parametrization of relevant aspects of the model for the ecosystem, with special attention paid to sea level and tidal movement evaluation. A large amount of data is required to enable the monitoring of these parameters. This research addresses this challenge by proposing a methodology to densify the available data, by combining GNSS-R altimetry estimations and Earth Observation data gathered by specialized satellites.Global Navigation Satellite System Reflectometry (GNSS-R) has demonstrated its effectiveness at measuring ocean roughness by characterization of the reflected sea surface [1-5]. This paper shows the results of combining GNSS-R estimations using the RINEX files from the EUREF GNSS base station located in Vigo (Spain) with altimetry data provided by Sentinel-3, Jason-3, and Sentinel-6 satellites.The understanding of the water dynamics and general status of the ocean area can improve performance and minimize the risks for entrepreneurs when developing farms on a sustainable basis, by applying a priori knowledge about the suitability of different seafood species.

AB  - The mapping of cropland helps to make decisions due to the intensification of its use, where the conditions of the crops change due to climatic variability and other socio-economic factors. In this way, the implementation of modern sustainable agriculture is essential to prevent soil degradation as measures to guarantee food security, propose sustainable rural development and protect the provision of different ecosystem services associated with the soil. NASA's Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICES at-2) launched September 15, 2018, offers new possibilities for the mapping of global terrain and vegetation. An additional science objective is to measure vegetation canopy height as a basis for estimating large-scale biomass and biomass change. The Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS) instrument on-board ICES at-2 utilizes a photon-counting LIDAR and ancillary systems (GPS and star cameras) to measure the time a photon takes to travel from ATLAS to Earth and back again and to determine the photon's geodetic latitude and longitude. ICES at-2 ATL08 (Along-Track-Level) data product is developed for vegetation mapping with algorithms for along-track elevation profile of terrain and canopy heights retrieval of the from ATLAS point clouds. Thus, this study presents a brief look at the ATL08 product highlight the broad capability of the satellite for vegetation applications working with data of study area Seis de Julio de Cuellaje (SDJC), province of Imbabura, Ecuador. The study used Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) by the year 2020 time-series at 30 m resolution by employing a Machine Learning (ML) approach. The results of this research indicate that the ATL08 data from the ICES at-2 product provide estimates of canopy height, show the potential for crop biomass estimation, and a machine learning land cover classification approach with a precision of 95.57% with Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data.

TI  - Towards Forage Resource Monitoring in subtropical Savanna Grasslands: going multispectral or hyperspectral?
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forage supply of savanna grasslands plays a crucial role for local food security and consequently, a reliable monitoring system could help to better manage vital forage resources. To help installing such a monitoring system, we investigated whether in-situ hyperspectral data could be resampled to match the spectral resolution of multi- and hyperspectral satellites; if the type of sensor affected model transfer; and if spatio-temporal patterns of forage characteristics could be related to environmental drivers. We established models for forage quantity (green biomass) and five forage quality proxies (metabolisable energy, acid/neutral detergent fibre, ash, phosphorus). Hyperspectral resolution of the Hyperion satellite mostly resulted in higher accuracies (i.e. higher R-2, lower RMSE). When applied to satellite data, though, the greater quality of the multispectral Sentinel-2 satellite data leads to more realistic forage maps. By analysing a three-year time series, we found plant phenology and cumulated precipitation to be the most important environmental drivers of forage supply. We conclude that none of the investigated satellites provide optimal conditions for monitoring purposes. Future hyperspectral satellite missions like EnMAP, combining the high information level of Hyperion with the good data quality and resolution of Sentinel-2, will provide the prerequisites for installing a regular monitoring service.

TI  - Calculation of surface urban heat index from LANDSAT-8 TIRS data and its relation with land cover
T2  - 2021 XIX WORKSHOP ON INFORMATION PROCESSING AND CONTROL (RPIC)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 19th Workshop on Information Processing and Control (RPIC)
CL  - ARGENTINA
AB  - Urban localities are mainly covered by concrete and asphalt paving material, which are impermeable surfaces with higher heat absorption capacity and a lower albedo, thus absorbing more radiation compared to the surrounding countryside. The urban surface heat island effect is described as a higher surface temperature in cities compared to a cooler temperature in surrounding areas. Canopy layer urban heat island (HI) are typically detected by in situ sensors at standard (screen-level) meteorological height. Ont he other hand, thermal remote sensors observe the surface urban heat island index (SUHI). The aim of this work is to calculate the spatial distribution of the SUHI index in Cordoba city and in its metropolitan area, and to analyse its relationship with different land covers using satellite information. Cordoba city, located in the central region of Argentina, is the second most populated city in the country. A LANDSAT-8 image of the study area was used to calculate urban heat island index, UHII, and SUHI. Urban and Non-urban region were defined and compared. It was observed that the same type of land use has significant different temperature mean value depending on whether it is located on an urban island or in a rural or open environment.

TI  - CHANGES IN LAND USE AND COVER IN THE WESTERN REGION OF BAHIA AS FROM AGRICULTURAL EXPANSION
T2  - REVISTA FORMACAO ONLINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The conversion of natural vegetation into agricultural areas is recurrent in various parts of the world, Today, this is particularly the case in places where the production of raw materials is the primary means of balance of trade support. In Brazil, this process has been ongoing since the colonial times. However, at the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century, even with the extension of environmental discussions and the pursuit of sustainability, has intensively reached major borders, deforesting and causing the destruction of biomes, as well as increased pollution and the unbridled use of water resources. Among these new farm fronts is the far west of Bahia, which houses twelve out of the twenty-four cities of the mesoregion. In light of this, from remote sensing and geoprocessing techniques, this research has sought to quantify changes in land use over thirty years (1985-2015). To this end, images from the Landsat 5 and 8 Satellite series were used, which after being automatically segmented in the Spring software have been manually sorted, creating thematic maps. The results pointed out that between 1985 and 2015, the extreme west of Bahia has lost approximately 21,7 thousand km(2) of native vegetation from the 385% increase in agricultural areas, with emphasis on those watered by pivots.

AB  - Three-dimensional data of the Earth's surface can support several types of studies, such as hydrological, geomorphological, environmental monitoring, among many others. But, due to the difficulty of acquiring these data in the field, freely available Digital Elevation Models (DEM) have been widely used, and therefore, it is increasingly necessary to check their accuracy to ensure their correct applicability according to the appropriate scale. However, there are no studies which have assessed specifically the vertical accuracy of the ALOS PALSAR, GMTED2010, SRTM and Topodata DEMs according to Brazilian Cartographic Accuracy Standard (PEC). In this sense, this paper aims to evaluate the quality of the above-mentioned DEMs by using the official high accuracy altimetric network data of the Brazilian Geodetic System. Statistical analysis of errors results demonstrated that the DEMs have applications compatible with 1:100,000 scales or smaller than this, and although the GMTED2010 presented a lower accuracy than the other DEMs, it also could be classified in the same accuracy category according to the Brazilian PEC. We conclude that DEMs assessment is very important to ensure their correct application as they can be used in many researches since these data are available for practically all areas of the planet.

TI  - On the Use of Multipolarization Satellite SAR Data for Coastline Extraction in Harsh Coastal Environments: The Case of Solway Firth
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study deals with coastline extraction using multipolarization spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery acquired over coastal intertidal areas. The latter are very challenging environments where mud flats lead to a large variability of normalized radar cross section, which may trigger a significant number of false edges during the extraction process. The performance of SAR-based coastline extraction methods that rely on a joint combination of multipolarization information (either single- or dual-polarization metrics) and speckle filtering (either local and nonlocal approaches) are analyzed using global positioning system (GPS) samples and colocated SAR imagery collected under different incidence angles. Our test site is an intertidal zone with a wetland (i.e., salt marsh) in the Solway Firth, south-west along the Scottish-English border. Experimental results, obtained processing a pair of RadarSAT-2 full-polarimetric and a pair of Sentinel-1 dual-polarimetric SAR imagery augmented by colocated GPS samples, show that: first, the multipolarization information outperforms the single-polarization counterpart in terms of extraction accuracy; second, among the single-polarization channels, the cross-polarized one performs best; third, both single- and dual-polarization methods perform better when nonlocal speckle filtering is applied; fourth, the joint combination of nonlocal speckle filter and dual-polarization information provides the best accuracy; and finally, the incidence angle plays a role in the extraction accuracy with larger incidence angles resulting in the best performance when dual-polarization metric is used.

AB  - Irrigation enterprises who manage the irrigated water distribution need to anticipate farmer's demands to minimize the evaporation amounts from irrigation pools, as well as storing enough water to accomplish crop's water needs at any time and farmer's management approach Crop coefficient Kc has proved to be essential when estimating evapotranspiration with FAO56 procedure, but it varies locally. The purpose of this study is to estimate the local corn crop coefficient with remote sensing to estimate the water crop needs in 164 plots in an area of the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula and to identify different farmer's ways to manage the land. For this purpose, 25 images from Sentinel-2 were analyzed to create their NDVI images. Therefore, the temporal Kc values were estimated and a Kc-curve for each corn field was calculated. Results allowed to differentiate the four crop growth stages and their corresponding Kc values for the study area. Besides, the 164 corn fields were clustered into 31 groups according to their different Kc curves as a result of farmer's management. Therefore, the method has proved to help in the future to anticipate the local irrigation needs of the corn crops and to improve the farmer's assessment to reduce their water demands without diminishing their crop production.

CP  - OCEANS Conference
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - INFORE EU H2020 project has the objective of developing a real-time, interactive extreme-scale analytics and forecasting system capable of handling and analysing massive data streams. The system is validated in three different real-world use cases, In this paper we describe one of them, presenting the development of the INFORE system for a coastal surveillance Maritime Situational Awareness (MSA) application. The MSA INFORE system exploits the synergy between global view (AIS data, ESA Sentinel satellite data), providing contextual information over a wider area, and local view produced by a sensorised hybrid robotic network. The network is composed of an RGB/thermal camera onshore and of two Wave Gliders robots equipped with passive sonars. We focus on the development of this network, describing the cooperative autonomy framework to control the robots. The framework enables the robots to make decisions on their navigation for improving vessel detection and tracking. The INFORE MSA network demonstrates the benefits that the synergy between machine learning, AI and autonomous robots can bring in this kind of monitoring systems. The developed autonomy strategies increase the quality of the information produced by robots. These high-quality real-time observations are fused with the global view in the INFORE MSA and decision-support platform. Data fusion from multimodal data sources results crucial for the detection of complex events (e.g. illegal fishing), which can then be communicated to decision-makers. Different modules of the systems are ready and under testing. The whole system will be validated in a trial in 2022.

AB  - The article discusses human changes during the transition to an information and digital civilization. The transformation of the industrial and social spheres, economy, and education affect the style and ways of human life. A civilization created on the basis of digital technologies produces new values, norms, behavioral practices, and ultimately changes human nature. A new view of a human place in the world is being formed. It is emphasized that a human of the future is an intellectual with high professional qualities, the ability to conceptually think and make non-standard decisions. This human is distinguished by mobility in the sphere of intellectual work, by the ability to retrain and adapt to new professions. Obtaining fundamental knowledge for generating new knowledge, developing the intellectual and creative abilities of a person is impossible without a radical change in the existing education system. The article shows how the intellectualization of labor and the expansion of high-tech technologies form a new motivation system for a human: intellectual abilities and the quality of education determine both the level of income and social status. The intellectual elite is becoming the wealthiest stratum of society. The authors compile a list of strategic tasks that ensure the information and intellectual culture, scientific worldview, new ethical norms, as well as the change of the value system. If solved comprehensively, these tasks provide for the harmonious development of man and sustainable development of civilization. (C) 2021 Published by European Publisher.

TI  - Literary Relations between S.M. Gorodetsky and N.S. Gumilev in the Aspect of Acmeism Development (based on the Material of Magazine and Newspaper Journalism of 1911-1914)
T2  - NOVYI FILOLOGICHESKII VESTNIK-NEW PHILOLOGICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The article examines the development of literary and personal relations between S.M. Gorodetsky and N.S. Gumilev in times of the foundation of the "Guild of Poets" and the emergence of Acmeism theory, as well as in the first years of of this poetic movement. The material of critical and literary articles and correspondence of the two poets demonstrates their desire not only to establish the principles of a new literary school even before its proclamation in the press, but also to theoretically justify the appearance of Acmeism in the modern literary process. A comparison of the reviews of the "Anthology" (1911) by "Musaget" publishing house, in which both poets took part, suggests that Gorodetsky was more interested in strengthening relations with Gumilev than his future ally, Gorodetsky highlights the artistic value of Gumilev's "Abyssinian Songs", while he himself does not receive high praise from their author. In the reviews of the books of poems "Willow" (1912) and "Alien Sky" (1912), both poets put emphasis upon a synthetic nature of Acmeism, accumulating the achievements of previous trends, as well as its status as a literary school that opposes symbolism. The analysis of the one-day correspondence between Gorodetsky and Gumilev in April 1914 enables us to conclude that it was the presence of two leaders with different aesthetic and philosophical views in Acmeism that caused the conflict between them. The author puts forward an assumption that Gorodetsky's accusations are based on an incorrect understanding of the words of Gumilev, who continued to consider Acmeism a school with its own poetics and artistic worldview.

T2  - PLANET CARE FROM SPACE
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Satellite Earth Observation plays a fundamental role within the context of integrated monitoring of coastal and marine waters, providing quantitative estimates of oceanographic and bio-geophysical parameters. Water quality parameters estimated from satellite optical multispectral imaging allow to identify spatial variability of bio-geophysical variables, like near-surface concentrations of Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and Total Suspended Matter (TSM), which is higher in coastal areas due to riverine freshwater input, sediment resuspension processes, human activities, thermal conditions and fine scale circulation patterns.This research study presents a data analysis system that integrates processing chains to regionally calibrate retrieval algorithms for the estimation of seawater bio-geophysical parameters from various optical multispectral satellite data, and to analyze satellite time series in order to extract meaningful information and maps. A test case for central Adriatic coastal zone has been realized in order to demonstrate the operational capability for monitoring water quality, and depending on this, the nutrient availability and the sanitary status of the farmed species in aquaculture sites. In situ data, acquired within a monitoring sampling plan that ARTA Abruzzo carried out along the central Adriatic coast, have been used to calibrate retrieval algorithms, exploited to produce time series maps of Chl-a and turbidity. Results show performances of calibrated algorithms and the data system suitability to contribute to the production of monitoring maps and indicators, informing domain specific decision making and supporting services for integrated coastal zone management.

TI  - Cultural Codes: Representations about the Sky and Celestial Bodies in Yakut Riddles
T2  - AGATHOS-AN INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF THE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The idea of the anthropocentric nature of language predetermines and shapes the character of the paper. The article overviews riddles as a unique cumulative material that contains culturally important information about the worldview of Yakut ethnic group. The purpose of our research is to single out the lexical units representing cultural codes that metaphorically describe denotations (answers) of riddles. In the paper, we analyze the codes that cipher the denotations connected with the sky and celestial bodies. Such codes reflect some archaic representations of the Yakuts of the world and its structure. In order to achieve the purpose of the research we applied the methods of semiotic, semantic, descriptive and interpretational analyses that revealed the key cultural codes that encrypt references to celestial bodies and the sky. These codes are zoomorphic, anthropomorphic, spatial, color, somatological, attributive, numerical and object-related.

TI  - Developing a model to predict individualised treatment for gonorrhoea: a modelling study
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To develop a tool predicting individualised treatment for gonorrhoea, enabling treatment with previously recommended antibiotics, to reduce use of last-line treatment ceftriaxone. Design A modelling study. Setting England and Wales. Participants Individuals accessing sentinel health services. Intervention Developing an Excel model which uses participants' demographic, behavioural and clinical characteristics to predict susceptibility to legacy antibiotics. Model parameters were calculated using data for 2015-2017 from the Gonococcal Resistance to Antimicrobials Surveillance Programme. Main outcome measures Estimated number of doses of ceftriaxone saved, and number of people delayed effective treatment, by model use in clinical practice. Model outputs are the predicted risk of resistance to ciprofloxacin, azithromycin, penicillin and cefixime, in groups of individuals with different combinations of characteristics (gender, sexual orientation, number of recent sexual partners, age, ethnicity), and a treatment recommendation. Results Between 2015 and 2017, 8013 isolates were collected: 64% from men who have sex with men, 18% from heterosexual men and 18% from women. Across participant subgroups, stratified by all predictors, resistance prevalence was high for ciprofloxacin (range: 11%-51%) and penicillin (range: 6%-33%). Resistance prevalence for azithromycin and cefixime ranged from 0% to 13% and for ceftriaxone it was 0%. Simulating model use, 88% of individuals could be given cefixime and 10% azithromycin, saving 97% of ceftriaxone doses, with 1% of individuals delayed effective treatment. Conclusions Using demographic and behavioural characteristics, we could not reliably identify a participant subset in which ciprofloxacin or penicillin would be effective. Cefixime resistance was almost universally low; however, substituting ceftriaxone for near-uniform treatment with cefixime risks re-emergence of resistance to cefixime and ceftriaxone. Several subgroups had low azithromycin resistance, but widespread azithromycin monotherapy risks resistance at population level. However, this dataset had limitations; further exploration of individual characteristics to predict resistance to a wider range of legacy antibiotics may still be appropriate.

CL  - Edinburgh, SCOTLAND
AB  - This study aims at estimating the Earth surface deformations due to the nuclear tests carried out by Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea from the 3rd of September 2017 by processing a time series of synthetic aperture radar images acquired by the COSMO-SkyMed satellite constellation. For active satellite sensors working in the X-band, phase information can be unreliable if scenarios with dense vegetation are observed. This uncertainty makes difficult to correctly estimate both the interferometric fringes and the phase delay generated by the variation in the space-time domain of the atmospheric parameters. To this end, in our research we apply the Sub-Pixel Offset Tracking technique, so that the displacement information is extrapolated during the coregistration process. Our results demonstrate the capability of spaceborne remote sensing to help characterize large underground nuclear tests in revealing an accurate estimate of the spatial displacement due to the explosions. The work also reveals the presence of a possible underground tunnel network.

TI  - Treatment and Survivorship Interventions to Prevent Poor Body Image Outcomes in Breast Cancer Survivors.
T2  - Breast cancer (Dove Medical Press)
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - Body image concerns often arise during and after treatment and are a major concern in up to 67% of breast cancer survivors. Negative changes in body image are a predictor of worse satisfaction with appearance and poor quality of life outcomes. Opportunities to mitigate the negative impact of cancer treatment on a patient's body image present during preoperative education or in the neoadjuvant setting, or during surgical management, adjuvant therapy delivery, and survivorship. The surgical management of breast cancer has evolved from breast amputations to procedures that provide improved cosmesis without compromising the oncologic outcome. The advent of the sentinel lymph node biopsy and lymphatic reconstruction techniques has led to decreased axillary morbidity. Modified radiation techniques and systemic therapies tailored to subtype limit unnecessary exposure to skin and systemic toxicities. Finally, incorporating prehabilitation and survivorship support optimizes the physical and psychosocial well-being of these patients. Setting expectations, treatment de-escalation when appropriate, morbidity risk reduction and improved screening and management of psychological sequelae during survivorship can decrease breast cancer treatment's negative impact on body image. The following review synthesizes interventions during preoperative planning, local and systemic treatment, and survivorship to prevent poor body image outcomes without compromising oncologic success.

TI  - Effect of stroke early supported discharge on length of hospital stay: analysis from a national stroke registry
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective The first observational study to investigate the impact of early supported discharge (ESD) on length of hospital stay in real-world conditions.Design Using historical prospective Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme (SSNAP) data (1 January 2013-31 December 2016) and multilevel modelling, cross-sectional (2015-2016; 30 791 patients nested within 55 hospitals) and repeated cross-sectional (2013-2014 vs 2015-2016; 49 266 patients nested within 41 hospitals) analyses were undertaken.Setting Hospitals were sampled across a large geographical area of England covering the West and East Midlands, the East of England and the North of England.Participants Stroke patients whose data were entered into the SSNAP database by hospital teams.Interventions Receiving ESD along the patient care pathway.Primary and secondary outcome measures Length of hospital stay.Results When adjusted for important case-mix variables, patients who received ESD on their stroke care pathway spent longer in hospital, compared with those who did not receive ESD. The percentage increase was 15.8% (95% CI 12.3% to 19.4%) for the 2015-2016 cross-sectional analysis and 18.8% (95% CI 13.9% to 24.0%) for the 2013-2014 versus 2015-2016 repeated cross-sectional analysis. On average, the increased length of hospital stay was approximately 1 day.Conclusions This study has shown that by comparing ESD and non-ESD patient groups matched for important patient characteristics, receiving ESD resulted in a 1-day increase in length of hospital stay. The large reduction in length of hospital stay overall, since original trials were conducted, may explain why a reduction was not observed. The longer term benefits of accessing ESD need to be investigated further.

AB  - In this paper, we evaluate the possibility of using optical remote sensing techniques to survey remote glacier areas, where conventional surveying techniques are difficult to carry out. The extent of different spectral classes on the Tyndall glacier area in the Southern Patagonian icefield, Chile, is evaluated through classification with respect to five different snow and ice types on the surface of the glacier. Different classification approaches are tested for their eligibility to identify these snow and ice types. As no labeled data is available for the investigated remote area, a novel method is tested to obtain labeled Sentinel-2 compliant data from theoretical spectral reflectance curves. The achieved classification results show that all examined classification approaches are suitable for detecting different spectral snow and ice classes on the glacier surface.

AB  - Evapotranspiration is one of the most important variables in the hydrological cycle. In this sense, its precise quantification is necessary in the field of climatology, meteorology, hydrology, ecology, environmental sciences and agronomy. In this work, the potential and actual evapotranspiration are calculate with Priestley-Taylor equation by satellite data, used in differents world zones with diverse climates and coverages. Respect to potential evapotranspiration, better results are obtained in humid/subhumid areas (R-RMSE around 0.4 mm d(-1)) than arid/semiarid areas (R-RMSE is 1.0 mm d(-1)). On the other hand, respect to actual evapotranspiration, the errors are smaller in humid/subhumid areas (between 0.6 to 1.1 mm d(-1)) than equatorial areas (between 1.2 to 3.4 mm d(-1)). As well as, a systematic underestimation is observed by calculate method.

TI  - Mixed Compressive Sensing Back-Projection for SAR Focusing on Geocoded Grid
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents a new scheme called 2-D mixed compressive sensing back-projection (CS-BP-2D), for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging on a geocoded grid, in a single measurement vector frame. The back-projection linear operator is derived in matrix form and a patched-based approach is proposed for reducing the dimensions of the dictionary. Spatial compressibility of the radar image is exploited by constructing the sparsity basis using the back-projection focusing framework and fast solving the reconstruction problem through the orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm. An artifact reduction filter inspired by the synthetic point spread function is used in postprocessing. The results are validated for simulated and real-world SAR data. Sentinel-1 C-band raw data in both monostatic and space-borne transmitter/stationary receiver bistatic configurations are tested. We show that CS-BP-2D can focus both monostatic and bistatic SAR images, using fewer measurements than the classical approach, while preserving the amplitude, the phase, and the position of the targets. Furthermore, the SAR image quality is enhanced and also the storage burden is reduced by storing only the recovered complex-valued points and their corresponding locations.

TI  - THE WORLD AS FABLE, STORY AND PICTURE: THE MEANING AND SENSE OF THE CONCEPT OF FABLE IN RENE DESCARTES' PHILOSOPHY
T2  - LOGOS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is an attempt to interpret one of the most complicated concepts in Rene Descartes' philosophy and writing-the lexeme "fable which refers to a kind of text that uses the figure of a first-person narrator to blend scientific reasoning and a philosophical moral into a work of literature. The world in Descartes' thinking appears in four types. First, there is the world created by God and recreated by the philosopher in his writings. Second, the world is the book of the world itself, an image so precious to Descartes that he calls it "My World." This leads to the third meaning of "world" in Descartes' thinking, which involves secular life and a community of learned men and women. The philosopher's inner world is hidden behind the three worlds already presented. It unfolds in the philosopher's letters, through which he communicates with those close to him and those afar, with both like-minded people and his opponents. The letters reveal the philosopher's strange, bizarre and sometimes phantasmagorical inner world. They show Descartes as a secular and public philosopher, who toward the end of his life also became a court philosopher. Learned women, including royal personages, sought his company, and his inner circle consisted of the hardened freethinkers characterized as libertines in the pamphlets and society of the time. His way of life came under criticism from theologians and pedants.

T2  - PAMIETNIK LITERACKI
M3  - Article
AB  - The study is an analysis of the 1925 work through the prism of Camille Flammarion's philosophical conceptions, especially the theories contained in his astronomical romance Uranie (Urania). The author of the article also examines the protagonist's ontological status, and arrives at the conclusion that the dreaming Swida represents the "weak" subjectivity which refers to Young Poland's worldview and practice. The paper also touches the issue of masochism as the paradigm that characterises the most seminal female-male relationships in the novel. This relationship is set contrasted with Urania, idealised by the protagonist, a symbol of Flammarion's cosmic utopia and an expression of yearning for the order projected by the 19th century.

Camel case field names from the USGS API are converted to snake case for consistency (i.e. acquisition_date instead of acquisitionDate). Numeric fields are converted to integers or floats if possible, and dates are converted to Python datetimes. CLI: landsatxplore search now prints the display_id instead of the entity_id by default. In landsatxplore search, --output option now accepts entity_id and display_id values instead of scene_id and product_id.

AB  - Python API: Names of scene identifiers have been harmonized for consistency with the USGS API and the use of multiple datasets. entity_id and display_id are now used instead of scene_id and product_id, as those IDs may now refer to Landsat Collection 1, Landsat Collection 2, or Sentinel products. Metadata returned by api.search() and api.metadata() have been harmonized to be more consistent across the datasets. entity_id, display_id, acquisition_date and cloud_cover fields are always present regardless of the dataset. Camel case field names from the USGS API are converted to snake case for consistency (i.e. acquisition_date instead of acquisitionDate). Numeric fields are converted to integers or floats if possible, and dates are converted to Python datetimes. CLI: landsatxplore search now prints the display_id instead of the entity_id by default. In landsatxplore search, --output option now accepts entity_id and display_id values instead of scene_id and product_id. Added a --skip flag to landsatxplore download to skip download and only print remote filename for testing purposes. Copyright: Open Access

TI  - Toward Cloud Tomography from Space Using MISR and MODIS: Locating the "Veiled Core" in Opaque Convective Clouds
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - For passive satellite imagers, current retrievals of cloud optical thickness and effective particle size fail for convective clouds with 3D morphology. Indeed, being based on 1D radiative transfer (RT) theory, they work well only for horizontally homogeneous clouds. A promising approach for treating clouds as fully 3D objects is cloud tomography, which has been demonstrated for airborne observations. However, more efficient forward 3D RT solvers are required for cloud tomography from space. Here, we present a path forward by acknowledging that optically thick clouds have "veiled cores" (VCs). Sunlight scattered into and out of this deep region does not contribute significant information about the inner structure of the cloud to the spatially detailed imagery. We investigate the VC location for the MISR and MODIS imagers. While MISR provides multiangle imagery in the visible and near-infrared (IR), MODIS includes channels in the shortwave IR, albeit at a single view angle. This combination will enable future 3D retrievals to disentangle the cloud's effective particle size and extinction fields. We find that, in practice, the VC is located at an optical distance of similar to 5, starting from the cloud boundary along the line of sight. For MODIS's absorbing wavelengths the VC covers a larger volume, starting at smaller optical distances. This concept will not only lead to a reduction in the number of unknowns for the tomographic reconstruction but also significantly increase the speed and efficiency of the 3D RT solver at the heart of the algorithm by applying, say, the photon diffusion approximation inside the VC.

TI  - IN SITU ( TREE TALKER) AND REMOTELY- SENSED MULTISPECTRAL IMAGERY (SENTINEL-2) INTEGRATION FOR CONTINUOUS FOREST MONITORING: THE FIRST STEP TOWARD WALL-TO-WALL MAPPING OF TREE FUNCTIONAL TRAITS
T2  - PLANET CARE FROM SPACE
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Monitoring tree functional traits is essential for understanding forest ecosystems' capability to respond to climate change. Advancements in continuous proximal sensors and IoT technologies hold great potential for monitoring forest and tree ecosystem processes at the finest spatial and temporal scale. An example is the TreeTalker (TT) technology, which features sensors for measurements of the radial growth, sap flow, multispectral light transmission, air temperature, and humidity at tree level with an hourly frequency rate. Such information can be linked with remote sensing data acquired by the Sentinel-2 (S2) mission, allowing for scaling results over more spatially extensive areas. Firstly, we compared six TT with four S2 spectral bands with similar wavelengths. No correlation was found for blue, green and red channels (R-2 ranged between 0.04 and 0.09) while higher values were found for the near-infrared channel (R-2 = 0.9). To obtain an accurate prediction of TTs bands, also for those TTs bands which wavelengths are not similar to that of S2 bands, we implemented a Sentinel-2 to TreeTalker model (S2TT) by using an 8-layers fully connected deep neural network. The model was tested by using 23 Sentinel-2 imagery and data acquired by 40 TreeTalkers located in two different sites in Tuscany (a beech and a silver fir forest stand) in the period between 2020-07-15 and 2020-11-15. The R-2 ranged between 0.61 (B7, blue) and 0.96 (B6, near-infrared band). The S2TT model represents the first link between remote sensing and TreeTalkers, which might allow predicting tree functional traits using Sentinel-2 imagery.

TI  - National-scale mapping of building height using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 time series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban areas and their vertical characteristics have a manifold and far-reaching impact on our environment. However, openly accessible information at high spatial resolution is still missing at large for complete countries or regions. In this study, we combined Sentinel-1A/B and Sentinel-2A/B time series to map building heights for entire Germany on a 10 m grid resolving built-up structures in rural and urban contexts. We utilized information from the spectral/polarization, temporal and spatial dimensions by combining band-wise temporal aggregation statistics with morphological metrics. We trained machine learning regression models with highly accurate building height information from several 3D building models. The novelty of this method lies in the very fine resolution yet large spatial extent to which it can be applied, as well as in the use of building shadows in optical imagery. Results indicate that both radar-only and optical-only models can be used to predict building height, but the synergistic combination of both data sources leads to superior results. When testing the model against independent datasets, very consistent performance was achieved (frequency-weighted RMSE of 2.9 m to 3.5 m), which suggests that the prediction of the most frequently occurring buildings was robust. The average building height varies considerably across Germany with lower buildings in Eastern and South-Eastern Germany and taller ones along the highly urbanized areas in Western Germany. We emphasize the straightforward applicability of this approach on the national scale. It mostly relies on freely available satellite imagery and open source software, which potentially permit frequent update cycles and cost-effective mapping that may be relevant for a plethora of different applications, e.g. physical analysis of structural features or mapping society's resource usage.

TI  - Tracking Urban Expansion Using Random Forests for the Classification of Landsat Imagery (1986-2015) and Predicting Urban/Built-Up Areas for 2025: A Study of the Kumasi Metropolis, Ghana
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Kumasi is a nodal city and functions as the administrative and economic capital of the Ashanti region in Ghana. Rapid urbanization has been experienced inducing the transformation of various Land Use Land Cover (LULC) types into urban/built-up areas in Kumasi. This paper aims at tracking spatio-temporal LULC changes utilizing Landsat imagery from 1986, 2013 and 2015 of Kumasi. The unique contribution of this research is its focus on urban expansion analysis and the utilization of Random Forest (RF) Classifier for satellite image classification. Change detection, urban land modelling and urban expansion in the sub-metropolitan zones, buffers, density decay curve and correlation analysis were methodologies adopted for our study. The classifier yielded better accuracy compared to earlier works in Ghana. The evaluation of LULC changes indicated that urban/built-up areas are continually increasing at the expense of agricultural and forestlands. The urban/built-up areas occupied 4622.49 hectares (ha) (23.78%), 13,447.50 ha (69.18%) and 14,004.60 ha (72.05%) in 1986, 2013 and 2015, respectively of the 19,438 ha area of Kumasi. Projection indicated that urban/built-up areas will occupy 15,490 ha (79.70%) in 2025. The urban expansion was statistically significant. The results revealed the importance of spatial modeling for environmental management and city planning.

TI  - Scattering-Keypoint-Guided Network for Oriented Ship Detection in High-Resolution and Large-Scale SAR Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ship detection in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is a significant and challenging task. Recently, deep convolutional neural networks have been applied to solve the detection problem and made a great breakthrough. Previous works mostly rely on the manually designed anchor boxes to search for the region of interests, which is less flexible and suffers from a heavy computational load. Moreover, these detectors have limited performance in large-scale and complex scenes due to the strong interference of inshore background and the variability of object imaging characteristics. In this article, a novel ship detection method based on the scattering-keypoint-guided network is proposed to remedy these problems. First, an anchor-free network is built to eliminate the effect of anchor boxes, in which a more robust representation scheme is designed for the arbitrary oriented objects. Second, a context-aware feature selection module is introduced to dynamically learn both local and context features. In this process, the semantic information of objects can be enhanced while suppressing the background interference. Third, according to the SAR imaging mechanism, a set of scattering keypoints is defined to describe the local scattering regions and reflect the discriminative structural characteristics of ships. Based on this conception, a novel feature adaption method is proposed with the purpose of dealing with the imaging variability issue. Furthermore, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed improvements, we build the Gaofen-3 ship detection dataset. Meanwhile, the public SAR ship detection dataset is introduced to verify the robustness and generalization ability of the detector. Experimental results on these two datasets show that the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

TI  - Qualitative and Quantitative Wall Enhancement on Magnetic Resonance Imaging Is Associated With Symptoms of Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms
T2  - STROKE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Purpose:Aneurysmal wall enhancement (AWE) on vessel wall magnetic resonance imaging (VW-MRI) has been described as a new imaging biomarker of unstable unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs). Previous studies of symptomatic UIAs are limited due to small sample sizes and lack of AWE quantification. Our study aims to investigate whether qualitative and quantitative assessment of AWE can differentiate symptomatic and asymptomatic UIAs.Methods:Consecutive patients with UIAs were prospectively recruited for vessel wall magnetic resonance imaging at 3T from October 2014 to October 2019. UIAs were categorized as symptomatic if presenting with sentinel headache or oculomotor nerve palsy directly related to the aneurysm. Evaluation of wall enhancement included enhancement pattern (0=none, 1=focal, and 2=circumferential) and quantitative wall enhancement index (WEI). Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify the parameters associated with symptoms.Results:Two hundred sixty-seven patients with 341 UIAs (93 symptomatic and 248 asymptomatic) were included in this study. Symptomatic UIAs more frequently showed circumferential AWE than asymptomatic UIAs (66.7% versus 17.3%, P<0.001), as well as higher WEI (median [interquartile range], 1.3 [1.0-1.9] versus 0.3 [0.1-0.9], P<0.001). In multivariate analysis, both AWE pattern and WEI were independent factors associated with symptoms (odds ratio=2.03 across AWE patterns [95% CI, 1.21-3.39], P=0.01; odds ratio=3.32 for WEI [95% CI, 1.51-7.26], P=0.003). The combination of AWE pattern and WEI had an area under the curve of 0.91 to identify symptomatic UIAs, with a sensitivity of 95.7% and a specificity of 73.4%.Conclusions:In a large cohort of UIAs with vessel wall magnetic resonance imaging, both AWE pattern and WEI were independently associated with aneurysm-related symptoms. The qualitative and quantitative features of AWE can potentially be used to identify unstable intracranial aneurysms.

AB  - In mid-February of 2021, a harmful algal bloom (HAB) dominated by the Noctiluca scintillans occurred and lasted several days in the Beibu Gulf, South China Sea. Here in this work, we investigated the HAB event using optical and thermal infrared remote sensing data from multi satellites. The bloom spatial information of location and areal extent were determined based on bloom image features from the optical measurements of HY-1C/D and MODIS Aqua. The thermal infrared images from MODIS Aqua, NPP VIIRS and Himawari-8 were used to obtain the sea surface temperature (SST) characteristics in the study area during the bloom period. Then, short-term temperature changes of the bloom and normal sea areas were further analyzed. The SST images showed a warming anomaly between the bloom and surrounding normal sea areas on February 14. The warming anomaly appeared at 10 : 00 and then changed through the course of a day, finally it disappeared after 21 : 00, with a maximum temperature difference (Delta T) of 2.5 degrees C around 15 : 00. Considering the close time-space correlation between SST and bloom, the bloom outbreak may have caused the SST anomalies. This study demonstrates the unique value of multi-satellite remote sensing data in revealing short-term changes related to HABs.

AB  - Conceptual modeling plays a fundamental role to capture information about complex business domains (e.g., finance, healthcare) and enables semantic interoperability. To fulfill their role, conceptual models must contain the exact set of constraints that represent the worldview of the relevant domain stakeholders. However, as empirical results show, modelers are subject to cognitive limitations and biases and, hence, in practice, they produce models that fall short in that respect. Moreover, the process of formally designing conceptual models is notoriously hard and requires expertise that modelers do not always have. This paper falls in the general area concerned with the development of artificial intelligence techniques for the enterprise. In particular, we propose an approach that leverages model finding and inductive logic programming (ILP) techniques. We aim to move towards supporting modelers in identifying domain constraints that are missing from their models, and thus improving their precision w.r.t. their intended worldviews. Firstly, we describe how to use the results produced by the application of model finding as input to an inductive learning process. Secondly, we test the approach with the goal of demonstrating its feasibility and illustrating some key design issues to be considered while using these techniques.

AB  - Estuaries supply direct and indirect multi-sectoral opportunities including for transport, natural resource use and climate protection. These provisions support livelihoods and contribute to social and economic development. The Bons Sinais Estuary in Zambezia Province, central Mozambique, is adjacent to the provincial administrative capital Quelimane, some 25 km from the coast. The rapid growth of Quelimane has increased the demand for natural resources from the estuary, including space, food, fuelwood, transport and raw materials for construction and economic activities. Expansion of the built environment has extended into low-lying lands, mostly within the critical estuarine functional zone with inevitable consequences, such as damage to natural habitats and flooding of occupied areas during rainy seasons. The aim of this study was to analyse three decades of change (1991 - 2018) in land use and land cover (LU/LC) in the Bons Sinais Estuary, focussing on the growth of Quelimane city and the transformation of estuarine and surrounding habitats. The method relied on open-access satellite images and a LU/LC change analysis to quantify the spatio-temporal changes brought about by economic development and related human activities. A combination of low-intensity fieldwork and satellite-derived data (Landsat-5, sensor: Thematic Mapper and Landsat-8; sensors: Operational Land Imager, Thermal Infra-Red Scanner) was used to generate LU/LC information classified according to the features: mangrove trees; wetlands; estuary intertidal areas; built-up area; cultivated trees; and cultivated land. From 1991 onwards, there was an overall increase in cultivated crops (66 %), development (79 %) (including rural human settlements) and intertidal mudflats (12 %) with a concomitant decline in critical wetlands (16 %) and mangroves (12 %). The study predicts a worsening of the impacts on the estuarine ecosystem with further growth of Quelimane city. To reverse the negative trend on estuary health, the recommendation is for management interventions that promote sustainable LU, and urban development plans that consider ecosystem conservation and active restoration.

AB  - Urban growth estimation is an essential part of urban planning in order to ensure sustainable regional development. For such purpose, analysis of remote sensing data can be used. The difficulty in analysing a time series of remote sensing data lies in ensuring that the accuracy stays stable in different periods. In this publication, aerial images were analysed for three periods, which lasted for 9 years. The main issues arose due to the different quality of images, which lead to bias between periods. Consequently, this results in difficulties in interpreting whether the urban growth actually happened, or it was identified due to the incorrect segmentation of images. To overcome this issue, datasets were generated to train the convolutional neural network (CNN) and transfer learning technique has been applied. Finally, the results obtained with the created CNN of different periods enable to implement different approaches to detect, analyse and interpret urban changes for the policymakers and investors on different levels as a map, grid, or contour map.

TI  - Monitoring the hourly actual evapotranspiration through the energy balance and a weighing lysimeter
T2  - BOLETIN GEOLOGICO Y MINERO
M3  - Article
AB  - By having sufficient knowledge about evapotranspiration in space and time, it is possible to manage and plan the water management of a basin. Evapotranspiration can be obtained indirectly at a local scale through information recorded in agrometeorological stations, or regionally with the use of satellite data. In order to have reliable models, it is very important to validate the information generated with direct measures of evapotranspiration. Therefore, direct measurements of evapotranspiration in clay secano-soils covered by grasses and the use of the data generated for the validation of indirect measurements are presented in this study. To achieve this, hourly data from an energy balance station and direct measurements of a weighing lysimeter were used to study the water loss during two experimental campaigns carried out in Tandil (Argentina), in the months February-March and September 2017 The comparison of the methods was made for different moisture conditions of the soil. The energy balance model estimates approximate values of actual evapotranspiration for maximum values of soil moisture (0.01-0.15 mm hour-1), showing greater differences (0.1-0.35 mm hour-1) when the soil moisture tends to minimum values. However, it was demonstrated that a simple one-level model to determine the latter variable is applicable for areas with reference coverage, allowing simplifications in aerodynamic and crop resistance measurements (Allen et al. 1998). This contribution provides necessary information for the validation of satellite models applied to plains areas, where evapotranspiration is a term of great importance.

TI  - The illusion of the One. Childhood as "free space" and humor as a vehicle for the transcendent in Mario Levrero's narrative
T2  - PALABRA
M3  - Article
AB  - We propose to analyze the role that humor plays in the work of the Uruguayan writer Mario Levrero. From the critical reading of stories from different moments of his career, we highlight that it is an indispensable resource for the construction of his poetic that allows him to delimit himself from the aesthetic presuppositions of what Angel Rama (19) calls the critical generation. The Uruguayan conceives his writing as a therapeutic device and humor as a vehicle towards the transcendent. From a worldview that appropriates remains of romanticism, parapsychology and Jungian psychoanalysis, Levrero pursues in his texts access to the Spirit/Unconscious, an (im)possible path to the (self)knowledge. Literature then becomes a "free space" that associates with childhood, is realized in writing and is opposed to the alienated life of adults, in particular, that of the everyday self of the author, Jorge Varlotta.

TI  - A New Soil Degradation Method Analysis by Sentinel 2 Images Combining Spectral Indices and Statistics Analysis: Application to the Cameroonians Shores of Lake Chad and Its Hinterland

AB  - This paper aims to model the soil degradation risk along the Cameroonian shores of Lake Chad. The processing is based on a statistical analysis of spectral indices of sentinel 2A satellite images. A total of four vegetation indices such as the Greenness Index and Disease water stress index and nine soil indices such as moisture, brightness, or organic matter content are computed and combined to characterize vegetation cover and bare soil state, respectively. All these indices are aggregated to produce one image (independent variable) and then regressed by individual indices (dependent variable) to retrieve correlation and determination coefficients. Principal Component Analysis and factorial analysis are applied to all spectral indices to summarize information, obtain factorial coordinates, and detect positive/negative correlation. The first factor contains soil information, whereas the second factor focuses on vegetation information. The final equation of the model is obtained by weighting each index with both its coefficient of determination and factorials coordinates. This result generated figures cartography of five classes of soils potentially exposed to the risk of soil degradation. Five levels of exposition risk are obtained from the "Lower" level to the "Higher": the "Lower" and "Moderate to low" levels occupy respectively 25,214.35 hectares and 130,717.19 hectares; the "Moderate" level spreads 137,404.34 hectares; the "High to moderate" and "Higher" levels correspond respectively to 152,371.91 hectares and 29,175.73 hectares.

TI  - Predicting subsurface sonar observations with satellite-derived ocean surface data in the California Current Ecosystem
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Vessel-based sonar systems that focus on the water column provide valuable information on the distribution of underwater marine organisms, but such data are expensive to collect and limited in their spatiotemporal coverage. Satellite data, however, are widely available across large regions and provide information on surface ocean conditions. If satellite data can be linked to subsurface sonar measurements, it may be possible to predict marine life over broader spatial regions with higher frequency using satellite observations. Here, we use random forest models to evaluate the potential for predicting a sonar-derived proxy for subsurface biomass as a function of satellite imagery in the California Current Ecosystem. We find that satellite data may be useful for prediction under some circumstances, but across a range of sonar frequencies and depths, overall model performance was low. Performance in spatial interpolation tasks exceeded performance in spatial and temporal extrapolation, suggesting that this approach is not yet reliable for forecasting or spatial extrapolation. We conclude with some potential limitations and extensions of this work.

TI  - FUNCTIONALITY OF EDUCATIONAL AND EDUCATIONAL CONTENT OF TRIO: LITERATURE, MUSIC AND PAINTING IN TEACHING A FOREIGN LANGUAGE OF STUDENTS OF A NOT-LANGUAGE UNIVERSITY
T2  - YAZYK I KULTURA-LANGUAGE AND CULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of this work, the functionality of the educational and enlightening content of the trio is studied: literature, music, and painting in teaching a foreign language to students of a non-linguistic university. The poliological principle of the interconnection of the language of the trio: music, literature and painting can be one of the methodological foundations in building a modern system of teaching a foreign language. It is a part of the linguistic-culturological approach, based on the intellectual and creative activity of students, and is successfully implemented in the educational process of a regional non-linguistic university. The value-semantic content of this polylogue is revealed in the creativity of students, showing their inner, hidden abilities; facilitates their assimilation of more information; activates, as reference patterns, effective ways of their learning activities; forms their social and personal useful social positions. The acquaintance of students with the process of rapprochement and polylogical interpenetration of music, literature and painting on the basis of the commonality and specificity of their figurative-semantic structures, has a combined aesthetic impact on them and contributes to the formation of both linguistic competence, the ability to solve communicative problems, and emotionally artistic perception, spiritual and moral integrity, the skills to fix key statements and reflect them properly, to reveal the structure of the argument relations and evaluate the content of information. Students learn to extract content, respond positively to the proposed teaching methodology. The poliological principle of teaching a foreign language takes into account the cognitive and emotional capabilities of students to acquire specific competencies, achieve the expected, tangible result in their learning, offers new impulses, informative classical and modern texts and innovative materials for classes, clarifies relevant issues of subject didactics. The teacher places emphasis and carefully studies all the teaching materials for their practical orientation. Our teaching practice has shown the advantages of the proposed methodology of teaching foreign languages in a not-linguistic university: the possibility of methodological innovations, the necessary language awareness, a creative approach to language learning, linguistic and cultural competence, enrichment of the general culture.

AB  - Multi-temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) is a space-borne monitoring technique able to detect cumulative surface displacements with a millimetre accuracy within the line of sight (LOS) of the radar sensor. Several developments in the processing methods and an increase in the availability of SAR data sets from different satellite missions have proven the viability of this technique in the near-real-time assessment of bridges and the health monitoring of transport infrastructure. This research aims to demonstrate the potential of satellite-based remote sensing techniques in developing an innovative health-monitoring method for structural assessment of bridges and the prevention of subsidence damage, using high-resolution SAR data sets and complementary ground-based (GB) non-destructive testing (NDT) techniques. To this purpose, high-resolution COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) products provided by the Italian Space Agency (ASI) were acquired and processed. A multitemporal InSAR analysis was developed to identify and monitor the structural displacements of the Rochester Bridge, located in Rochester, Kent, U.K. This bridge is composed by four separate bridge decks carrying the A2 Road, a railway, and a service-bridge carrying service pipes and cable. The outcomes of this study demonstrate how multitemporal InSAR remote sensing techniques can be synergistically applied to complement the traditional GB analyses (e.g., ground penetrating radar, laser scanner, and accelerometers) and information on river bridges (e.g., river levels from monitoring stations). This can provide an extended spatial coverage and an effective identification and monitoring of defects and decays at reduced costs, compared to traditional monitoring techniques.

AB  - Continuous monitoring of critical infrastructures is crucial to prevent catastrophic events such as collapse of viaducts and prioritising maintenance interventions. However, developing effective monitoring approaches must rely on the collection of numerous information, such as the time series of structural deformations. In this context, various ground-based non-destructive testing (NDT) methods have been used in monitoring the structural integrity of transport infrastructures. These require routine and systematic application at the network level over long periods of time to build up a solid database of information, involving many efforts from stakeholders and asset owners in the sector. To this effect, satellite based remote sensing techniques, such as the Multi-temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (MT-InSAR), have gained momentum due to the provision of accurate cumulative structural displacements in bridges. Although the application of the InSAR monitoring technique is established, this is limited by the high amount of time required for the interpretation of data with high spatial and temporal density. This research aims to demonstrate the viability of MT-InSAR techniques for the structural assessment of bridges and the monitoring of damage by structural subsidence, using high-resolution SAR datasets, integrated with complementary Ground-Based (GB) information. To this purpose, high-resolution SAR dataset of the COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) mission provided by the Italian Space Agency (ASI), were acquired and processed in the framework of the ASI-Open Call approved Project "MoTiB" (ID 742). To elaborate, a Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) analysis is applied to identify and monitor the structural displacements at the Rochester Bridge, in Rochester, Kent, UK. To explore the viability of Machine Learning algorithms in detecting critical scenarios in the monitoring phases, an Unsupervised ML Clustering approach, which generates homogeneous and well-separated clusters, is implemented. Each PS data-point is allocated to specific cluster groups, based on individual deformation trend features and the values of displacements from the historical time-series. This research paves the way for the development of a novel interpretation approach relying on the integration between remote-sensing technologies and on-site surveys to improve upon current maintenance strategies for bridges and transport assets.

TI  - A Distributed Modular Data Processing Chain Applied to Simulated Satellite Ozone Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing of the atmospheric composition from current and future satellites, such as the Sentinel missions of the Copernicus programme, yields an unprecedented amount of data to monitor air quality, ozone, UV radiation and other climate variables. Hence, full exploitation of the growing wealth of information delivered by spaceborne observing systems requires addressing the technological challenges for developing new strategies and tools that are capable to deal with these huge data volumes. The H2020 AURORA (Advanced Ultraviolet Radiation and Ozone Retrieval for Applications) project investigated a novel approach for synergistic use of ozone profile measurements acquired at different frequencies (ultraviolet, visible, thermal infrared) by sensors onboard Geostationary Equatorial Orbit (GEO) and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites in the framework of the Copernicus Sentinel-4 and Sentinel-5 missions. This paper outlines the main features of the technological infrastructure, designed and developed to support the AURORA data processing chain as a distributed data processing and describes in detail the key components of the infrastructure and the software prototype. The latter demonstrates the technical feasibility of the automatic execution of the full processing chain with simulated data. The Data Processing Chain (DPC) presented in this work thus replicates a processing system that, starting from the operational satellite retrievals, carries out their fusion and results in the assimilation of the fused products. These consist in ozone vertical profiles from which further modules of the chain deliver tropospheric ozone and UV radiation at the Earth's surface. The conclusions highlight the relevance of this novel approach to the synergistic use of operational satellite data and underline that the infrastructure uses general-purpose technologies and is open for applications in different contexts.

AB  - Remote sensing is basically the method of detection of the physical parameters of a specific area along with that it also monitors the area by measuring the radiation parameters from satellite. The cameras are designed to gather remotely sensed images, which are used to sense things of the earth's surface. Like the cameras on the satellites and the airplanes takes pictures of the different area, allowing us to get every minute detail about it. Now, change detection is the process to identify the changes or differences in various parts of land characteristics at different intervals. This process can be carried by manual observation or by the use of remote sensing software. Because of the rapid urbanization there has been a significant impact on resources and urban environment. But with the use of high quality multi-spatial and multi-temporal remote sensing data, it is quite easy to possibly observe the changes in the urban environment. Therefore, the given study aims to quantify changes in the urban area of Symbiosis University Nagpur, Maharashtra India using Land satellite image. These changes of urbanization are detected by satellite images of Land-Sat MSS in march-2016, march-2018 and may-2020 using a geographic information system (GIS). The change of urbanization in Symbiosis University is for building, road, garden and ground are 17.35%, 20.71%, 1.65% and 0.89% respectively and the total change is 43.51%. From this change we will receive the taxes as per its ongoing construction and it will be easy for government.

TI  - THE PLANT LIFE IN THE ONOMASTIC WORLDVIEW OF THE TATARS
T2  - REVISTA ENTRELINGUAS
M3  - Article
AB  - The onomastic worldview reflects the most important aspects of culture and history, world outlook and psychology of the people. The meaning of some onomastic units contains hidden informational layers of archaic mythological thinking. One of the most significant groups among those units includes names of the plant world. This article is aimed at demonstrating the specificity of the plant life representation in the onomastic worldview of the Tatars. The analysis involves interpretation of the meaning of toponyms and anthroponyms retaining repercussions of beliefs of the ancient Turks. The analysis was carried out on linguistic and culturological material by means of a complex of interdisciplinary methods and techniques. The conducted analysis revealed that the tradition of using names of flora as proper nouns traces its origin to the archaic forms of mythology, which conceived a tree as the supreme god's symbol. The ancient naive views of the Turks were transmitted to the modern onomastics of the Tatars. Due to its stability, the toponymic system retains the earliest views. In the anthroponymic system, despite the fact that many of ancient anthroponyms grew out of use, traditions and motives of naming continued when borrowing anthroponyms from other languages

TI  - Common conservative treatments for lymphoedema post breast cancer: A focus article
T2  - PHYSIOTHERAPY PRACTICE AND RESEARCH
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in women worldwide (J. Ferley et al., 2015). Breast cancer-related lymphoedema (BCRL) is a disabling complication with a long term impact on quality on life after breast cancer treatment, with an incidence of 2-5% in patients post sentinel node procedures (M. King et al., 2012) up to 40% following axillary lymph node dissection (A.C. Pereira et al., 2017). BCRL results in swelling of the arm, hand, and trunk which can lead to limb pain, heaviness, and altered sensation (Y.J. Sim et al., 2010). These symptoms can result in functional limitations, psychosocial distress and an overall reduction in quality of life (S.J. Merchant et al., 2015). The aim of this review is to evaluate the effects of some of the more common conservative rehabilitation interventions in BCRL. Conservative interventions reviewed include early physiotherapy and exercise, complex decongestive therapy, manual lymphatic drainage, compression, electrotherapy & acupuncture, self-treatment & weight management. The review may inform policies for treatment within the health service.

AB  - This dataset contains information about the spatial dynamics of flooded settlements in the Dosso Region, in Niger. The data was collected by means of photo-interpretation of very high-resolution satellite images available on Google Earth. Settlements were chosen according to Niger's national database on flooding, known by the French acronym, BDINA.The zip archive contains built-up areas of each settlement at three different dates, for a total of 348 files stored in .kmz format.The word document contains two tables describing all settlements information regarding the built-up areas, the years of reference, and the roof composition of the building assets.The figures show a synthesis of the data collected:-Fig. 1 shows the location of the 124 human settlements inundated between 2011 and 2019;-Fig. 2 shows the dates on which the high-resolution images of the 124 settlements are freely available on Google Earth;-Fig. 3 shows a comparison between the built-up area that can be defined with Google Earth and the built-up area of the global settlement dataset based on Landsat data (HBASE);-Figs. 4 and 5 show the built-up area on the three dates for the city of Gaya, the rural town of Tanda, the village of Bouma Manzo, and the hamlet of Kofo.The method used for the data collection is replicable in other contexts and can be used to identify the most rapidly expanding settlements, the extent of the built-up area under the risk of flooding, and to verify the accuracy of the built-up area obtained from coarse satellite images.The data presented can be used for future insights and researches on the region.

TI  - Radiometric Normalization of Multitemporal Landsat and Sentinel-2 Images Using a Reference MODIS Product Through Spatiotemporal Filtering
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Radiometric normalization is an essential preprocessing step for almost all remote sensing applications such as change detection, image mosaic, and 3-D reconstruction. This article proposes a novel radiometric normalizing method based on spatiotemporal filtering using a reference moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) product. This differs from traditional relative radiometric normalization (RRN) methods in two folds: first, the number of reference images is more than one, which introduces more complexities than RRN with a single reference image; second, the resolution of MODIS product is significantly lower, thus requiring the algorithms to accommodate scale differences. To address, our approach extends the traditional spatiotemporal filtering method with per image bias that represents both internal (e.g., sensor characteristics) and external (e.g., atmosphere and topography) against the reference data. In addition, we use the Kullback-Leibler divergence metric to statistically determine the resemblance degree between the temporal images for weighting. We applied our proposed method to normalize Landsat Operational Land Imager, Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus +, and Sentinel MSI using MODIS Nadir BRDF-adjusted reflectance product, covering two study areas of 30 x 15 km(2) and 32 x 52 km(2), respectively, and we show a notable radiometric consistency over both temporal and spatial dimension after the processing through three comparative experiments with state-of-the-art methods. 1) 3-7% improvement in the contexts of transfer learning, which favors only images with consistent radiometric properties and 2) Mosaic results using our processed images show no apparent seamlines as compared with images processed by other methods.

M3  - Article
AB  - The visual interpretation of the cinematic image by means of the art of music has evolved into a special sphere of compositional activities. Endowed with an applied meaning, movie music has developed certain particular tendencies and parameters of genre and style, which resulted in the formation of a complex system of functioning of its illustrative features. Correspondingly the spectrum of interaction of music with the visual depiction is wide and diverse. The technical particular features of creating cinematic works have created in impact on the formation of new forms of interactions between the various expressive means. The experience of working with applied genres has brought to the formation in the Uzbek compositional school of a peculiar national artistic language, style and innovations in the realm of rhythm, texture, harmony, etc. The synthesis of the arts, which mutually enriches itself, has created a broad field for the composer's fantasy, for expressing his or her ideas and worldview positions. The role of music in movie replication (the making of animated cartoon) is determined not only by its aesthetical qualities, but also by the possibility of interacting with the video sequence.The general tendencies, the artistic style and the characteristic features of the music in the making of animated cartoons in Uzbekistan are determined by the aesthetical directedness of artistic activity, the reliance on traditional music and the derivation of the principles of musical development from it (improvisational structure and meditative technique).

TI  - An Approach for Evaluating Multisite Radiometry Calibration of Sentinel-2B/MSI Using RadCalNet Sites
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-2B offers high spatial resolution optical imagery from 13 bands in the visible, near infrared, and short-wave infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum, providing enhanced continuity to monitoring global terrestrial surfaces and coastal waters. In this article, its radiometry calibration is evaluated using 37 clear-sky observations in 2018 from the four sites of radiometric calibration network for assuring data quality. However, since the single calibration results acquired under different surface and atmospheric conditions have different biases and different uncertainties, it is difficult to determine which calibration sample is much more trustable. In view of this, by assuming that the calibration samples are independent of each other, a state-of-the-art reference value is derived by combining 37 calibration samples using a weighted average method, which has much lower uncertainty and approaches the "true" value. The reference value also could be used to compare each calibration result. The result shows that the reference value of the relative difference between the simulated and observed top-of-atmosphere reflectance is 4.29%, 4.95%, 4.54%, 5.34%, respectively, for bands 2, 3, 4, and 8, and the corresponding uncertainty is 1.09%, 1.10%, 1.10%, and 1.12%, respectively; the degree of equivalence for each sample is calculated by comparing each calibration result with the reference value. It is worth noting that the degrees of equivalence are lower than 5%, and the four samples on July 9, July 13, October 4, and October 11 perform worse than the other sample.

TI  - The Feasibility of Wetland Waterfowl Monitoring Method Based on UAV Remote Sensing
T2  - Chinese Journal of Zoology
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional bird monitoring methods have the limitations of long investigation time, large consumption of manpower and material resources, as well as inaccurate identifications. In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing technology has been widely used in the field of ecology, however, it is still a lack of developed methods for its application in bird survey. In this study, a micro-UAV (DJI Mavic 2) equipped with a visible light camera was used to conduct a waterfowl survey in the West Dongting Lake National Nature Reserve in Hunan Province. Four survey areas were selected inside the reserve where the target species were concentrated. With flight routes in each area planned and the flight and shooting parameters set appropriately, remote sensing data were collected (Fig. 1). Meanwhile, the birds' response to the disturbance caused by the shooting process was ranked and recorded (Table 1). Subsequently, the image splicing software PTGui Pro 11.0 was employed to splice the collected images and adjusted their color balance. Finally, based on the synthesized remote sensing image, the classification and annotation table of waterfowl was established and the waterfowl in the image were manually interpreted. Also, the disturbance ranks of the investigation to the waterfowl was analyzed statistically. We conducted 11 flights in this study, of which the largest flight sites had an area of 18 hm(2) and the resolution of 0.012 m/pixel at the flight altitude of 75 m. We successfully obtained data from ten survey flights. We tried to identify and count, in our obtained images, six main waterfowl species with relatively large body size: Ardea alba, A. cinerea, Anas crecca, Mareca falcata, Cygnus columbianus and Vanellus vanellus (Table 2, Fig. 2). The results showed that the four target species can be identified and counted accurately with the remote sensing images, however, the A. crecca and M. falcata could not be distinguished from each other. Alarm rating records show that the drone investigation had a minor impact on waterfowl. In conclusion, it is feasible to conduct rapid remote sensing monitoring of large and medium sized waterfowl in wetland based on micro-UAV equipped with visible light cameras. In order to achieve relatively higher accuracy of interpretation and prevent excessive interference to waterfowl at the same time, parameters such as flight altitude, flight speed and image overlap need to be set appropriately.

TI  - Lateral-torsional buckling behaviour of concrete-filled high-strength steel tubular flange beams under mid-span load
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTIONAL STEEL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Lateral-torsional buckling (LTB) behaviour of concrete-filled high-strength steel tubular flange beams (HS-CFTFBs) is experimentally and numerically investigated. Six specimens are tested in simple support with a lateral unrestrained concentrated load in mid-span. Among them, two are failure controlled through flexural yielding (FY), whereas the remaining specimens are controlled through LTB. Finite-element (FE) models are then constructed and the comparison with the experimental results indicates that they could reliably and accurately evaluate failure modes, load-displacement relationship and ultimate capacities of HS-CFTFBs. These verified FE models are consequently used to investigate the effect of flange depth, concrete and steel with various span lengths. Results suggest that the ultimate moment capacity evidently decreases as the span length increased, particularly for the high-strength steel beams. The increasing flange depth remarkably improved the LTB strength but merely slightly increased the amount of steel. The infilled concrete could improve the resistance to flange distortion and thus increase the ultimate capacity. However, the strength of concrete exhibits a slight influence on ultimate capacity. Increasing fy could improve the LTB capacity when the span length is relatively small, but the improvements decrease with increasing span length. When the failure mode is elastic LTB, increased fy could substantially improve post-buckling stiffness and ductility (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Production of nisin-containing bacterial cellulose nanomaterials with antimicrobial properties through co-culturing <i>Enterobacter</i> sp. FY-07 and <i>Lactococcus lactis</i> N8
T2  - CARBOHYDRATE POLYMERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Bacterial cellulose (BC) is used in various fields for its unique physical properties, but does not have the antimicrobial properties needed for the food and biomedical industries. Co-culture fermentation is a method commonly used in biotechnology to address high costs. A nisin-containing BC film (BC-N) was obtained by co-cultivating the BC-producing strain Enterobacter sp. FY-07 with the nisin-producing strain Lactococcus lactis N8. The physical properties of BC-N were similar those of BC, but the BC-N film had a specific strong inhibitory effect on Gram-positive bacteria. The antibacterial mechanism of BC-N was pore formation, but the obtained BC-N film had no significant impact on mammalian cell viability. This study provides a low-cost, facile and efficient technique to confer BC with antimicrobial properties. This strategy can be applied to introduce other functions into BC, and develop applications for BC polymers.

TI  - Pixel-Level Prediction for Ocean Remote Sensing Image Features Fusion Based on Global and Local Semantic Relations
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid development of remote-sensing imaging technology, remote-sensing images have become increasingly diverse, and people are paying more attention to ocean remote-sensing research. Because ocean remote-sensing data are complex, and the ocean environment is diverse, results will differ, even if the same target is detected at different times in the same scene. To obtain more semantic features and better pixel-level prediction capabilities, this paper proposes a pixel-level ocean remote-sensing image algorithm (GLPO-Net) that combines local and global features. First, texture features, color features, and spatial relationship features are extracted. Second, the algorithm constructs a multiscale local cross-attention mechanism strategy to obtain feature weight information in different directions to fully mine the local features of ocean remote-sensing images. Concurrently, an algorithm constructs a multiscale global cross-attention mechanism strategy to obtain global features. Then, the fusion of global features and local features is described in each submodule to obtain more representative deep features. Finally, small-sample ocean remote-sensing is described via image pixel-level prediction. The algorithm proposed in this paper has been tested with three public ocean remote-sensing datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed GLPO-Net algorithm can learn features from small samples of ocean remote-sensing images. Compared to the prediction results of other remote-sensing image algorithms, GLPO-Net exhibits better prediction capabilities.

AB  - This paper discusses the method of detecting the palace area of the capital city site by using the land surface temperature retrieval and downscaling taking Erlitou site in wheat coverage period as an example. Land surface temperature was retrieved from Landsat 8 multispectral data on May 6, 2014 using radiative transfer equation method. Then, the mathematical relationship between the retrieved LST and NDVI is established to realize the downscaling of LST data and improve its spatial resolution. Compared with the results of archaeological excavation, it is found that the geographical location and scope of the palace area of the capital site can be well reflected through the downscaling of land surface temperature image, which provides a feasible method for the satellite remote sensing detection of the early capital site.

M3  - Data study
AB  - The Global One-Eighth Degree Urban Land Extent Projection and Base Year Grids by SSP Scenarios, 2000-2100 consists of global SSP-consistent spatial urban land fraction data for the base year 2000 and projections at ten-year intervals for 2010-2100 at a resolution of one-eighth degree (7.5 arc-minutes). Spatial urban land projections are key inputs for the analysis of land use, energy use, and emissions, as well as for the assessment of climate change vulnerability, impacts and adaptation. This data set presents a set of global, spatially explicit urban land scenarios that are consistent with the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) to produce an empirically-grounded set of urban land spatial distributions over the 21st century. A data-science approach is used exploiting 15 diverse data sets, including a newly available 40-year global time series of fine-spatial-resolution remote sensing observations from the Landsat satellite series. The SSPs are developed to support future climate and global change research, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report (AR6), along with Special Reports.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 18th IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Satellite multi-view stereo (MVS) imagery is particularly suited for large-scale Earth surface reconstruction. Differing from the perspective camera model (pin-hole model) that is commonly used for close-range and aerial cameras, the cubic rational polynomial camera (RPC) model is the mainstream model for push-broom linear-array satellite cameras. However, the homography warping used in the prevailing learning based MVS methods is only applicable to pin-hole cameras. In order to apply the SOTA learning based MVS technology to the satellite MVS task for large-scale Earth surface reconstruction, RPC warping should be considered. In this work, we propose, for the first time, a rigorous RPC warping module. The rational polynomial coefficients are recorded as a tensor, and the RPC warping is formulated as a series of tensor transformations. Based on the RPC warping, we propose the deep learning based satellite MVS (SatMVS) framework for large-scale and wide depth range Earth surface reconstruction. We also introduce a large-scale satellite image dataset consisting of 519 5120x5120 images, which we call the TLC SatMVS dataset. The satellite images were acquired from a three-line camera (TLC) that catches triple-view images simultaneously, forming a valuable supplement to the existing open-source WorldView-3 datasets with single-scanline images. Experiments show that the proposed RPC warping module and the SatMVS framework can achieve a superior reconstruction accuracy compared to the pin-hole fitting method and conventional MVS methods.

TI  - Road Extraction Using a Dual Attention Dilated-LinkNet Based on Satellite Images and Floating Vehicle Trajectory Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Automatic extraction of road from multisource remote sensing data has always been a challenging task. Factors such as shadow occlusion and multisource data alignment errors prevent current deep learning-based road extraction methods from acquiring road features with high complementarity, redundancy, and crossover. Unlike previous works that capture contexts by multiscale feature fusion, we propose a dual attention dilated-LinkNet (DAD-LinkNet) to adaptively integrate local road features with their global dependencies by joint using satellite image and floating vehicle trajectory data. First, a joint least-squares feature matching-based floating vehicle trajectory correction model is used to correct the floating vehicle trajectory; then a convolutional network model DAD-LinkNet based on a dual-attention mechanism is proposed, and road features are extracted from the channel domain and spatial domain of the target image in turn by constructing a dual-attention module in the dilated convolutional layer and adopting a cascade connection; a weighted hyperparameter loss function is used as the loss function of the model; finally, the road extraction is completed based on the proposed DAD-LinkNet model. Experiments on three datasets show that the proposed DAD-LinkNet model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and connectivity.

TI  - Use of Google Earth Engine to Generate a 20-Year 1 Km x 1 Km Monthly Air Temperature Product Over Yellow River Basin
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Near-surface air temperature (NSAT) is a key parameter in climate changes, environmental ecosystem monitoring, and human settlement issues. As it is difficult for in situ observations to capture the spatial distribution characteristics of NSAT in great detail, various methods have been developed to use remotely sensed land surface temperature and other auxiliary variables to estimate the NSAT. Among them, machine learning turns out to be an exhilarating choice due to its superior performance. However, for long-term dataset estimation, when using machine learning methods with abundant related variables, computation loads and data storage cannot be ignored. Fortunately, Google Earth Engine (GEE) provides a wealth of geospatial datasets and powerful parallel computation capability. In this article, GEE has been utilized to demonstrate the feasibility of estimating long-term 1-km NSAT with two machine-learning models (random forest and deep neural network). After testing the effects of the input variables and the model portability, the 20-year monthly mean 1 km x 1 km NSAT over the Yellow River basin was generated and analyzed. Compared with in situ observations, the overall RMSE, MAE, R-2, and R of the NSAT product are 0.429, 0.302, 0.998, and 0.999, respectively. Specifically, for each observation station, R and R-2 are greater than 0.997, and RMSE and MAE are smaller than 0.5 and 0.4, respectively. The comparisons with three existing NSAT products show that our product outperforms the other three products. Once again, it is demonstrated in this study that GEE is a powerful platform to generate valuable products with ready-to-use datasets and computation resources.

Consequently, there remains an ongoing need for antidepressants that are either more effective or better tolerated than existing standards. We previously identified ZY-1408 as a drug with a novel chemical structure and potential anti-depressant-like activity. Specifically, ZY-1408 is a novel serotonin 2C (5-HT2C) receptor antagonist and serotonin/norepinephrine (5-HT/NE) reuptake inhibitor. In this study, we further investigated the antidepressant-like efficacy of ZY-1408 using in vitro and in vivo behavioral tests. ZY-1408 showed 5-HT2C receptor antagonist and 5-HT/NE reuptake inhibitor properties in vitro. Meanwhile, ZY-1408 decreased immobility in vivo in a dose-dependent manner in rats (via the forced-swim test) and mice (via the tail-suspension test). The behavioral test results do not appear to result from stimulation of locomotor activity. In chronically stressed rats, repeated ZY-1408 treatment significantly reversed depressive-like behavior, including reduced sucrose preference, decreased locomotor activity, and prolonged time to begin eating. Furthermore, in vivo microdialysis showed that administration of ZY-1408 significantly increased extracellular concentrations of 5-HT and NE in the hippocampus of freely moving rats. Thus, ZY-1408 is a potent and orally active 5-HT2C receptor antagonist and 5-HT/NE reuptake inhibitor with antidepressant-like activity in rodents.

AB  - Satellite cloud image data plays an important role in the ultra-short-term photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting. By calculating the cloud displacement vectors of two adjacent cloud images, it is possible to calculate the cloud cluster's occlusion of the PV power plant for a period of time in the future, thereby forecasting the PV power. The satellite cloud image data provided by FY-4A Satellite has large and unequal sampling time intervals, which brings difficulties to cloud displacement vector calculation. This paper proposes a method for calculating the displacement vector of the cloud edge block based on the cosine similarity and the adaptive adjustment of the matching spatial scale. The parameter equation is used to establish the relationship between the relative position of the cloud cluster and the PV plant over time, and to predict the future position. On this basis, this paper proposes an ultra-short-term forecasting method of PV power based on cloud displacement vector. The performance of the proposed model is verified through case analysis.

TI  - Mapping Opencast Iron Mine and Mine Solid Waste Based on a New Spectral Index From Medium Spatial Resolution Satellite Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Opencast iron mine and mine solid waste (OIM-MSW) are closely associated with a wide range of environmental issues, such as destroying soil structure, affecting air quality, and damaging biodiversity. Therefore, accurately grasping the distribution of OIM-MSW is of great significance to monitoring and managing environmental conditions. In order to reduce the impact of background features on the identification of OIM-MSW, we constructed an index based on medium spatial resolution satellite data, and proposed a semiautomatic method to determine the threshold value of the index. Experimental results indicated that: 1) The proposed index (OIM-MSWI) can effectively identify the OIM-MSW of which the OA (overall accuracy) and K (kappa coefficient) value are 0.98 and 0.75, respectively. 2) The index owns satisfying performance in identifying OIM-MSW in different months, and its recognition ability in plant growing season is better than that in the nonplant growing season. 3) Both Landsat 8 images and Sentinel 2 images have the potential to identify OIM-MSW via the proposed index, but the recognition accuracy of Landsat 8 images (OA = 0.98, K = 0.75) is slightly better than Sentinel 2 images (OA = 0.96, K = 0.64). (4) OIM-MSWI is effective in different climatic conditions, with OA and K of 0.98, 0.75 and 0.97, 0.63 in the cases of semiarid and humid zones, respectively. In conclusion, OIM-MSWI is a simple and effective index for identifying OIM-MSW, and can provide support for OIM-MSW monitoring and management.

AB  - As an important component of surface cover, the changes of vegetation can reflect the changes of regional environment at different spatial and temporal scales, and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) based on remote sensing can effectively reflect the growth status of surface vegetation, and the study of the spatial and temporal characteristics of NDVI changes of vegetation in long time series can help the protection and sustainable development of regional ecological environment. In this study, based on the overlapping period data of Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) NDVI from 1982 to 2015 and Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI from 2000 to 2019 in the Yellow River source region (YRSR), we established the GIMMS NDVI dataset from 1982 to 2019 in the YRSR, and analyzed the spatial and temporal characteristics of vegetation NDVI changes in the YRSR for 38 years by using linear regression analysis, accumulative anomaly method and moving ttest method. The results showed that the spatial distribution of NDVI in the YRSR was high in the southeast and low in the northwest, and the spatial trend was increasing in the north and decreasing in the center. The mean NDVI from 1982 to 2019 showed an overall weak increasing trend, with abrupt changes in NDVI in 2000 and 2008. This study will contribute to a better understanding of the vegetation cover changes in the YRSR, which is of great significance for the ecological protection of the YRSR.

T2  - TRANSLATIONAL CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Bibliometric analysis highlights the pivotal studies and topics that have shaped the understanding and management of a disease in its designated field. Herein, original articles on the applications of nanotechnology in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) were characterized and analyzed.Methods: A comprehensive search was carried out using a bibliometric methodology, and eligible articles on nanomedicine research in HNSCC were retrieved from the Scopus database.Results: A total of 309 eligible articles were retrieved, and the total citation count was 7,468. An ascending trend in citation count was observed since 2004, which increased substantially between 2014 and 2019. There were 144 (52.7%) original articles on oral cavity carcinomas. Chemotherapy (n=53, 19.4%), chemoprevention (n=35, 11.3%), and photodynamic therapy (n=23, 8.4%) were the three most published topics on the applications of nanotechnology in the therapy of HNSCC. Sentinel node detection (n=25, 9.2%) and noninvasive cancer diagnosis (n=22, 8.1%) were the two most published topics in the diagnostic area of HNSCC. A vast majority of these articles were preclinical studies, and only four articles (1.5%) were phase I/II clinical studies on chemotherapy and radiotherapy.Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to analyze the bibliometric characteristics of original articles on nanomedicine in HNSCC. The results of this study not only provide a historical perspective on the scientific evolution in this field, but also revealed the trends and key topics within it that may help facilitate further research.

TI  - Changes of submerged macrophytes community in Lake Fuxian since 1960s
T2  - Hupo Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - The submerged macrophyte communities have developed rapidly in the littoral zone of Lake Fuxian since 1960s, however, the monitoring frequency is relatively insufficient. To understand the distribution status and community changes of submerged macrophytes in Lake Fuxian during the past 60 years, we investigated and sampled the whole-lake submerged macrophytes and epiphytic filamentous algae from 41 sample sites in July 2016. The distribution of submerged macrophytes in the whole lake was determined by CBERS 04-based normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of August 18, 2016. In addition, the average biomass density, dominance index and the Shannon-Wiener diversity index in the coastal vegetation area were calculated. The results showed that the distribution area of submerged macrophytes in the summer of 2016 was 5.14 km2. The average biomass ( fresh weight) density was 9.8 kg/m2, and the highest value was 48.7 kg/m2. The total biomass ( fresh weight) of the submerged macrophytes in the whole littoral zone was 5.02x104 t. Totally 13 species of submerged macrophytes were collected, belonging to 5 families and 6 genera. Among the species, Ceratophyllum demersum had the highest biomass density, followed by Hydrilla verticillata and Myriophyllum spicatum. The species with the highest frequency of occurrence were M. spicatum, followed by Vallisneria natans and Potamogeton pectinatus. In addition, the species with the greatest dominance were M. spicatum, followed by C. demersum and H. verticillata. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index of submerged macrophytes in Lake Fuxian was between 0.05 and 1.28, having an average value of 0.75. Except for charophytes, the canopy of higher plant groups ranged from 1.5 m to 4 m, with the highest canopy of C. demersum. The biomass of epiphytic filamentous algae attached to the canopy of submerged macrophytes was much higher than that attached to the substrates, and filamentous algae mainly attached to the canopy of submerged plants within 100 cm along apical height. The historical data showed that the distribution area, total biomass and species richness of submerged macrophytes in Lake Fuxian increased sharply since 1957. The dominance of low meadow-forming species, such as charophytes and V. natans declined in recent years. In contrast, the tall canopy-forming submerged macrophytes such as M. spicatum and C. demersum dominated the community. The exotic species Elodea nuttallii emerged in recent years and became subdominant species. The epiphytic filamentous algae boosted, and most of them attached on the canopy of submerged macrophytes. At present, the submerged plant community in Lake Fuxian is at the highest stage of biomass, distribution area and diversity, which is the key period for protecting and maintaining the submerged macrophyte bed in the littoral zone. While, the dominance of tall canopy-forming species, the fast development of the exotic species and the bloom of the epiphytic filamentous algae may lead the submerged macrophytes community toward a structure composition which is common in eutrophic lakes. Therefore, it is urgent to control the nutrient loadings in Lake Fuxian and to harvest the upper crown within 100 cm of the tall species to control both the canopy-forming submerged macrophytes and the filamentous algae attached to them. These measures will create conditions for the development of the meadow forming species and maintain the macrophytes community composition in oligotrophic lakes.

TI  - Development of an Imagewise Stacking Method to Mitigate Atmospheric Effect With an Application to Lianyan Railway
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Much attention has been paid to the subsidence monitoring of large-scale man-made linear features, which are usually characterized by long-distance, large-scale, and nonuniform distribution. The multitemporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technique can provide ground deformation maps for a large area with high spatial resolution and millimeter precision at low costs. The technique overcomes the limitations of ground-based survey instruments. However, the variable atmospheric turbulent component in flat areas has impacts on InSAR detection capability, especially over low-amplitude quasi-stable deformation areas. We propose an imagewise stacking method, which can improve the InSAR time-series analysis by reducing residual noise while retaining the ground deformation signal. We integrate persistent scatterer and distributed scatterer in our processing strategy and conduct a tentative test on the roadbed subsidence monitoring of the Lianyan high-speed railway using 47 medium-resolution Sentinel-1 images. Comparing the InSAR displacement time series and the results with a continuous BeiDou navigation satellite system network, the standard deviation of 3.3 mm and the mean absolute error of 2.2 mm are obtained. The proposed method reduced the above two error measures by 66.3% and 65.6%, respectively, compared with the spatiotemporal filtering. Moreover, the analysis of the spatiotemporal characteristics of the railway deformations also tells that the railway under study is stable.

TI  - Capitalism, history and autofiction: a rhizomatic proposal
T2  - ANALES DE LITERATURA HISPANOAMERICANA
M3  - Article
AB  - The autofiction exploits tensions between reality, inventio and fiction. It generates a space where personal experiences, historical events and scenes invented by the author are interwoven that put into question the distinction between truth and lie, between true and false. Criticism has often struggled to deal with the ambiguity of the genre, defined in 1977 in a text by Serge Doubrovsky. This article adopts the predominant theoretical conceptions about autofiction, but proposes the synthesis with other postulates adjacent to the problem: the worldview of Ludwig Wittgenstein, the rhizome of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, and the "destructive character" identified by Walter Benjamin. The integration of these lines of thought favor a renewed understanding of the autofictional genre, which without denying or abandoning the predominant theoretical statements, offers new perspectives of analysis to the problemator.

TI  - Ethnoozological study and nutritional value of white-tailed deer <i>Odocoileus virginianus</i> in the community of Pitzotlan, Tepalcingo, Morelos, Mexico
T2  - CALDASIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) is an important resource for rural communities for the goods it contributes to peasant and indigenous families. The objective of the research was to analyze the traditional knowledge and nutritional value of O. virginianus in the community of Pitzotlan, Morelos, Mexico. In-depth interviews were applied to eleven hunters, participant observation and guided tours. For the nutritional analysis of venison, techniques from the Official Association of Analytical Chemists (AOAC International) were used. Local hunters recognize different aspects of the biology of the species such as feeding habits, sexual dimorphism, breeding season and social behavior. Three hunting techniques are recorded: "arreadas" (100 %), "espiadas" (100 %) and "lampareadas" (54 %), which are practiced in agricultural and forest areas of low deciduous forest. The "arreadas" as a collective practice for hunting deer, are conceived as spaces for recreation and community socialization. The categories of use registered were in the following proportions: food, medicinal and ornamental (loo %), tool (45 %), amulet (io %) and sale (10 %). The main forms of preparation were "guaxmole", barbecue, "asadura", dried meat, fried meat, and steaks. Venison meat (dry basis) reported 75.14 g / 100 g of protein and 7.88 g /100 g of total minerals. The white-tailed deer is an important wildlife resource for the rural families of Pitzotlan because the traditional knowledge about its appropriation has a role in their diet, health, worldview, and community life.

AB  - Rural spaces are object of historical representation from a homogeneous account that has not been questioned in the school geography and affects the explanations made by the students of Secondary Education and Baccalaureate. The theory of social representations and their relationship with the subjective space allow us to understand the students school conceptions of ten schools in the province of Valencia (Spain) about rural spaces. Through a dual approach (structural and procedural) that is accompanied by qualitative and quantitative techniques applied to the field of social science teaching, it is intended to diagnose the elements that make up the worldview that students have, as a result of a social representation that idealizes these spaces.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing for Agriculture, Ecosystems, and Hydrology XXIII
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - The launch of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission offered new insights for the management of the European Common Agrarian Policy (CAP). Sentinel-2 provides information at a spatial and temporal resolution of 10 m and 5 days, respectively. However, this unprecedented time series of high resolution satellite imagery requires from approaches to extract meaningful agronomical information and reduce dimensionality. This could be the case of land surface phenology, which consists in estimating key phenometrics related to agronomical events from time series of vegetation indices (VIs). Knowing the dynamics of crop phenology is essential for the correct monitoring of CAP.We used EVI2 (Enhanced Vegetation Index 2) time series of Sentinel-2 data for the period 2018-2020. EVI2 is a VI widely used as an indicator of plant vigour, that avoids saturation in regions with high biomass. Double Logistic smoothing method was used to fill the gaps caused by the lack of images due to cloud presence or sensor failures. We selected plots of durum and common wheat, sorghum, barley and triticale according to the Geographical Information System for the CAP (GISCAP-CAP) declarations in Andalusia, Spain. The phenometrics extracted were start of the season (SOS), middle of the season (MOS), end of the season (EOS), their respective values of EVI2, and length of the season (LOS) (EOS-SOS). The aim of this study is to characterise the phenology of different winter cereals, through the extraction of phenometrics, and to evaluate whether these latter measures can serve to distinguish them. Results show that the response is quite similar between all of them, except sorghum. Common wheat shows the earliest SOS, followed by barley, durum wheat, triticale and sorghum. Common wheat shows the earliest EOS, followed by durum wheat, barley, triticale and sorghum.

TI  - New Nuclear Medicine techniques in hyperparathyroidism surgery: PET and advances in radioguided surgery
T2  - REVISTA ORL
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction and objective: Radioguided surgery of hyperparathyroidism (HPT) has substantially evolved in recent years, due to the development of new intraoperative tools and the improvement of pre-operative techniques. The aim of this work is to perform a review of the role of choline PET-CT as a preoperative technique, as well as of the use of intraoperative tools, in the radioguided localization of parathyroid adenomas. Synthesis: Choline PET-CT is a pre-operative technique, alternative to the Tc-99m-MIBI scintigraphy, for the pre-operative localization of HPT in cases where conventional techniques give negative or doubtful results. This technique has showed good results in two recently published meta-analysis. The radioguided localization by means of gamma probe is still the intraoperative technique of choice in cases where parathyroid glands show significant Tc-99m-MIBI uptake. Hand-held gammacamera is an adjuvant tool to the probe, which allows performing an intraoperative imagine and ensuring the complete resection of the specimens. Free hand SPECT is already applied in parathyroid radioguided surgery, but its use is still not widespread, probably because the superiority of this technique over the probe and hand-held gammacamera has not been demonstrated. Radioguided occult lesion localization (ROLL) by means of Tc-99m-MAA injection and I-125 seed implantation are two successfully used alternatives for the radioguided localization of negative Tc-99m-MIBI parathyroid glands. Hybrid tracers are being used in the radioguided surgery of the sentinel node but have not been applied yet in hyperparathyroidism. Conclusions: Choline PET-CT is an increasingly used tool in preoperative HPT localization. Although gammadetector probe remains of choice in HPT surgery-both for its good results at low cost and for the great accumulated experience-; the combined use of the hand-held gammaprobe could be helpful for particular cases as well as to ensure the total excision of the specimens. On the other hand, the injection of I-125 seeds and Tc-99m-MAA, guided by means of sonography, are useful in (TC)-T-99m-MIBI negative cases. Lastly, more experience is required on the application of free hand SPECT and hybrid tracers to HPT surgery on order to demonstrate their possible advantages compared to other widespread tools.

AB  - A global seabed sediment map has been developed since 1995 to provide a necessary tool for different needs. This project is not completely original since it had already been done in 1912 when the French hydrographic Office and the University of Nancy produced sedimentary maps of the European and North American coasts. Seabed sediments is one of the last geographical domains which can't benefit of satellite data. Without this contribution, sediment maps need to use very old data mixed with the new ones to be able to reach the goal of a global map. In general, sediment maps are made with the latest available techniques and are replaced after a few decades, thus generating new cartographic works as if all the previous efforts had become useless. Such approach underestimates the quality of past works and prevents to have maps covering large areas. The present work suggests to standardize all kind of sedimentary data from different periods and from very different acquisition systems and integrate them into a single product. This process has already been done for bathymetric data of marine charts, we discuss in this article of the application of this method at a global scale for sediment data.

T2  - ACTA GEODYNAMICA ET GEOMATERIALIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the analysis performed in the Kura geomorphological sub-region of the Caspian coastal zone, it was determined that the sea level rise of 2.43 m in 1976-1996 caused an average annual rate of erosion processes about 75 times higher than accumulation processes. In 1996-2019, the stabilization and the following drop of the sea level of 1.39 m led to an average annual rate of accumulation processes up to 14 times higher than the average annual rate of erosion processes. This pattern is observed along the entire coastline of those periods. Erosion processes in the initial stage (1976-1996) increased the indentation and length of the coastline by almost 2 times, and in the next stage (1996-2019) the intensification of accumulation processes resulted in the smoothing and reduction of the coastline by 35 %.Statistical analysis of coastlines was carried out by processing Landsat satellite images for 19762019; each coastline was divided into 14 segments according to geomorphological zones and their morphostructures in the study area. The development forecast for the next 10 and 20 years is provided.

TI  - Narrow River Extraction From SAR Images Using Exogenous Information
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring of rivers is of major scientific and societal importance due to the crucial resource they provide to human activities and the threats caused by flood events. Rapid revisit synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors such as Sentinel-1 or the future surface water and ocean topography (SWOT) mission are indispensable tools to achieve all-weather monitoring of water bodies at the global scale. Unfortunately, at the spatial resolution of these sensors, the extraction of narrow rivers is extremely difficult without resorting to exogenous knowledge. This article introduces an innovative river segmentation method from SAR images using a priori databases such as the global river widths from Landsat (GRWL). First, a recently proposed linear structure detector is used to produce a map of likely line structures. Then, a limited number of nodes along the prior river centerline are extracted from the exogenous database and used to reconstruct the full river centerline from the detection map. Finally, an innovative conditional random field approach is used to delineate accurately the river extent around its centerline. The proposed method has been tested on several Sentinel-1 images and on simulated SWOT data. Both visual and qualitative evaluations demonstrate its efficiency.

TI  - Green Infrastructure Mapping in Urban Areas Using Sentinel-1 Imagery
T2  - CROATIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - High temporal resolution of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery (e.g., Sentinel-1 (S1) imagery) creates new possibilities for monitoring green vegetation in urban areas and generating land-cover classification (LCC) maps. This research evaluates how different pre-processing steps of SAR imagery affect classification accuracy. Machine learning (ML) methods were applied in three different study areas: random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB). Since the presence of the speckle noise in radar imagery is inevitable, different adaptive filters were examined. Using the backscattering values of the S1 imagery, the SVM classifier achieved a mean overall accuracy (OA) of 63.14%, and a Kappa coefficient (Kappa) of 0.50. Using the SVM classifier with a Lee filter with a window size of 5x5 (Lee5) for speckle reduction, mean values of 73.86% and 0.64 for OA and Kappa were achieved, respectively. An additional increase in the LCC was obtained with texture features calculated from a grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM). The highest classification accuracy obtained for the extracted GLCM texture features using the SVM classifier, and Lee5 filter was 78.32% and 0.69 for the mean OA and Kappa values, respectively. This study improved LCC with an evaluation of various radiometric and texture features and confirmed the ability to apply an SVM classifier. For the supervised classification, the SVM method outperformed the RF and XGB methods, although the highest computational time was needed for the SVM, whereas XGB performed the fastest. These results suggest pre-processing steps of the SAR imagery for green infrastructure mapping in urban areas. Future research should address the use of multitemporal SAR data along with the pre-processing steps and ML algorithms described in this research.

TI  - WATERSHED DELINEATION AND CODIFICATION IN SOUTHERN PATAGONIA
T2  - BOLETIN GEOGRAFICO
M3  - Article
AB  - Watershed definition is fundamental for integrated management of water resources, considering the social, productive and environmental demands. The watershed spatial delimitation is essential to understand eco-hydrological processes in the territory and management. The objective of this work was to delineate and code the hydrographic regions of Southern Patagonia under standardized procedures and new geographic information technologies. The ALOS World 3D model, WorldView high-resolution scenes and QGIS 3.12 free software algorithms were used to carry out automated watershed delineations at various hydrological nesting levels, and subsequent coding and nomenclature. A precise cartographic product was achieved at a scale of 1: 25,000 on a territory of 366,357.4 km(2). This results in 7,307 hydrographic units distributed in 5 levels, with 14 large hydrographic regions (RH) in the upper level, 46 sub-regions, 249 hydrographic basins, 1,110 sub-basins and 5,888 micro-basins. The cartography achieved improved the resolution and precision of actual available regional products, representing a valuable tool for the sustainable water resources management at different levels of organization and complexity of natural processes.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is avery heterogenous disease. The incidence of DCIS has been increasing with the adoption of mammography screening. This opened new questions concerning surgical and adjuvant therapy. Methods: We retrospectively observed the incidence of DCIS amongst the patients that underwent surgical resection in EUC clinic Zlin between 2017 and 2019. We also assessed the extent of breast surgery including interventions in axilla and the adjuvant therapy. Results: There were 616 breast cancer patients, of whom 44 (7.1%) were diagnosed with DCIS. Breast-conserving surgery was performed in 35 (80%) patients. Lumpectomy alone was performed in 21 (47%) patients. Mastectomy was indicated primarily in 9 cases with additional two mastectomies performed to achieve clear margins. All sentinel nodes were negative. Conclusion: Results confirmed, that the surgical therapy as well as radiotherapy and hormonal treatment are performed according to guidelines at our department. Proportion of sentinel node biopsy is remarkably higher, therefore an improvement in this area is our next goal.

Accurate and up-to-date land cover maps are vital for underpinning evidence-based landscape management decision-making. However, the technical skills required to extract tailored information about land cover dynamics from these open-access geospatial data often limits their use by those making landscape management decisions. Using Dartmoor National Park as an example we demonstrate an open-source toolkit which uses open-source software (QGIS and RStudio) to process freely available Sentinel-2 and public LiDAR datasets to produce fine scale (10m2 grain size) land cover maps. The toolbox has been designed for use by staff within the national park (for example), enabling land cover maps to be updated as required in the future. An area of 945 km2 was mapped using a trained random forest classifier following a classification scheme tailored to the needs of the national park. A 2019 land cover map had an overall user's accuracy of 79%, with 13 out of 17 land cover classes achieving greater than 70 % accuracy. Spatially, accuracy was related via logistical regression to blue band surface reflectance in the spring and topographic slope derived from LiDAR (1 m resolution), with greater accuracy in steeper terrain and areas exhibiting higher blue reflectance. Between an earlier (2017-2019) and later (2019-2021) timeframe 8 % of pixels changed, most of the change by area occurred in the most common classes. However, the largest proportional increase occurred in Upland Meadows, Lowland Meadows and Blanket Bog, all habitats subject to restoration efforts. Identifying areas of change enables future field work to be better targeted. We discuss the application of this mapping to land management within the Dartmoor national park and of the potential of tailored land cover and land cover change mapping, via this toolbox, to evidence-based environmental decision making more widely.

TI  - Experimental re-infected cats do not transmit SARS-CoV-2
T2  - EMERGING MICROBES & INFECTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19 and responsible for the current global pandemic. We and others have previously demonstrated that cats are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and can efficiently transmit the virus to naive cats. Here, we address whether cats previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2 can be re-infected with SARS-CoV-2. In two independent studies, SARS-CoV-2-infected cats were re-challenged with SARS-CoV-2 at 21 days post primary challenge (DPC) and necropsies performed at 4, 7 and 14 days post-secondary challenge (DP2C). Sentinels were co-mingled with the re-challenged cats at 1 DP2C. Clinical signs were recorded, and nasal, oropharyngeal, and rectal swabs, blood, and serum were collected and tissues examined for histologic lesions. Viral RNA was transiently shed via the nasal, oropharyngeal and rectal cavities of the re-challenged cats. Viral RNA was detected in various tissues of re-challenged cats euthanized at 4 DP2C, mainly in the upper respiratory tract and lymphoid tissues, but less frequently and at lower levels in the lower respiratory tract when compared to primary SARS-CoV-2 challenged cats at 4 DPC. Viral RNA and antigen detected in the respiratory tract of the primary SARS-CoV-2 infected cats at early DPCs were absent in the re-challenged cats. Naive sentinels co-housed with the re-challenged cats did not shed virus or seroconvert. Together, our results indicate that cats previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 can be experimentally re-infected with SARS-CoV-2; however, the levels of virus shed was insufficient for transmission to co-housed naive sentinels. We conclude that SARS-CoV-2 infection in cats induces immune responses that provide partial, non-sterilizing immune protection against re-infection.

TI  - Multisensor Land Cover Classification With Sparsely Annotated Data Based on Convolutional Neural Networks and Self-Distillation
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Extensive research studies have been conducted in recent years to exploit the complementarity among multisensor (or multimodal) remote sensing data for prominent applications such as land cover mapping. In order to make a step further with respect to previous studies, which investigate multitemporal SAR and optical data or multitemporal/multiscale optical combinations, here, we propose a deep learning framework that simultaneously integrates all these input sources, specifically multitemporal SAR/optical data and fine-scale optical information at their native temporal and spatial resolutions. Our proposal relies on a patch-based multibranch convolutional neural network (CNN) that exploits different per-source encoders to deal with the specificity of the input signals. In addition, we introduce a new self-distillation strategy to boost the per-source analyses and exploit the interplay among the different input sources. This new strategy leverages the final prediction of the multisource framework to guide the learning of the per-source CNN encoders supporting the network to learn from itself. Experiments are carried out on two real-world benchmarks, namely, the Reunion island (a French overseas department) and the Dordogne study site (a southwest department in France), where the annotated reference data were collected under operational constraints (sparsely annotated ground-truth data). Obtained results providing an overall classification accuracy of about 94% (respectively, 88%) on the Reunion island (respectively, the Dordogne) study site highlight the effectiveness of our framework based on CNNs and self-distillation to combine heterogeneous multisensor remote sensing data and confirm the benefit of multimodal analysis for downstream tasks such as land cover mapping.

TI  - Deep Residual Network-Based Fusion Framework for Hyperspectral and LiDAR Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents a deep residual network-based fusion framework for hyperspectral and LiDAR data. In this framework, three new fusion methods are proposed, which are the residual network-based deep feature fusion (RNDFF), the residual network-based probability reconstruction fusion (RNPRF) and the residual network-based probability multiplication fusion (RNPMF). The three methods use extinction profile (EP), local binary pattern (LBP), and deep residual network. Specifically, EP and LBP features are extracted from two sources and stacked as spatial features. For RNDFF, the deep features of each source are extracted by a deep residual network, and then the deep features are stacked to create the fusion features which are classified by softmax classifier. For RNPRF, the deep features of each source are input to the softmax classifier to obtain the probability matrices, and then the probability matrices are fused by weighted addition to producing the final label assignment. For RNPMF, the probability matrices are fused by array multiplication. Experimental results demonstrate that the classification performance of the proposed methods significantly outperform existing methods in hyperspectral and LiDAR data fusion.

TI  - Understanding the Correlation between Landscape Pattern and Vertical Urban Volume by Time-Series Remote Sensing Data: A Case Study of Melbourne
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization is changing the world's surface pattern more and more drastically, which brings many social and ecological problems. Quantifying the changes in the landscape pattern and 3D structure of the city is important to understand these issues. This research study used Melbourne, a compact city, as a case study, and focused on landscape patterns and vertical urban volume (volume mean (VM), volume standard deviation (VSD)) and investigate the correlation between them from the scope of different scales and functions by Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques. We found: (1) From 2000 to 2012, the landscape pattern had a trend of decreasing fragmentation and increasing patch aggregation. The growth of VM and VSD was more severe than that of landscape metrics, and presented a "high-low" situation from the city center to the surroundings, maintaining the structure of "large east and small west". (2) Landscape pattern was found closely associated with the urban volume. In the entire study area, landscape pattern patches with low fragmentation and high aggregation were directly proportional to VM with high value, which represented high urbanization, and patches with high connectivity and fragmentation had a positive relationship with high VSD, which represented strong spatial recognition. (3) The urban volumes of different urban functional areas were affected by different landscape patterns, and the analysis based on the local development situation can explain the internal mechanism of the interaction between the landscape pattern and the urban volume.

TI  - Spatiotemporal multi-index analysis of desertification in dry Afromontane forests of northern Ethiopia
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land degradation and desertification is a great concern of arid and semiarid areas. Desertification trends in northern Ethiopia were quantified using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Topsoil Grain Size Index (TGSI), and Precipitation Concentration Index (PCI) calculated from 1990 to 2018 Landsat imagery and meteorological data from fourteen stations. A decision tree approach was used to assess the rate of desertification in northern Ethiopia using 1990, 1995, 2000, 2008, 2014, and 2018 Landsat 5 TM+ and Landsat 8 OLI data. A significant decline (P < 0.005) in mean NDVI was detected between 1990 and 2018 (mu = - 0.012 + 0.072), indicating that desertification has expanded over this time. The analysis showed a significant and positive spatial correlation (R-2 = 0.47; P < 0.0001) between the distribution of NDVI and the independent variables of precipitation and TGSI. Precipitation had the predominant impact on the NDVI. Monthly rainfall was characterized by a significant spatiotemporal variability (PCI > 20%) from 2001 to 2016 due to frequent droughts, particularly in northeastern Ethiopia. This desertification hot spot was confirmed through semi-variogram analyses. The overall findings from the multi-index assessment indicate decreasing vegetation cover, increasing ratio of coarse soil particles, as well as decline and high seasonal variability in rainfall. The desertification also appears linked to the rapid reduction in dense forests and shrublands in favor of bare and desert land as well as agricultural land. Therefore, major causes of land degradation in northern Ethiopia are both anthropogenic and natural climatic factors, requiring mitigating and adaptation actions primarily in northeastern Ethiopia.

T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are at high risk of degradation worldwide, but the driving mechanisms at different spatiotemporal scales vary and remain unclear. In this study, we used Landsat images from 1986 to 2016 to assess variations in natural wetlands in the five sub-watersheds of the Dongting Lake Watershed (DTLW): the Xiang River Watershed (XRW), Zi River Watershed (ZRW), Yuan River Watershed (YRW), Li River Watershed (LRW), and Dongting Lake Area (DTLA). We also explored the relationships between variations in wetland area and meteorological factors, along with anthropogenic factors. The total area of natural wetlands in the DTLW decreased by 124.12 km(2) (2.45%) over the study period, mainly due to the declines in lake and marsh areas. The wetland area decreased in the ZRW and DTLA, but increased in the other three. Mean annual precipitation (MAP) was highly variable over time, while mean annual temperature (MAT) increased significantly in all sub-watersheds. Overall, gross domestic product (GDP), population (POP), cultivated area (CA), and irrigation area (IA) increased from 1986 to 2016. MAT had the maximum correlation with lake and river area changes in the DTLW, while marsh area changes were best correlated with POP. The IA was the greatest contributor of lake area change in XRW, LRW, and DTLA, while the dominant factor for river area change differed by sub-watershed. Overall, the most influential factors were meteorological changes in the DTLW as a whole, while anthropogenic activities were more important at the sub-watershed scale.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the reconstruction of the biography of Isai Pavlovich Schmidt, a Professor of History, propagandist and the head of the fliight on the route Moscow - Beijing (1925). The life and work of I. P. Schmidt (1896-1975) have already been the object of studies in modern historiography. However, the complex of new sources, which were available to the authors of the present article, made it possible to revisit some facts of the professor's biography, introducing the necessary additions and clarifications. The purpose of the study is the reconstruction of the biography of I. P. Schmidt in the context of the Soviet history with a focus on the impact of the anticosmopolitan campaign in the USSR on the professional career and further life of the professor. As a result of the analysis, the authors identified the main stages of the biography of I. P. Schmidt and noted the peculiar features of his worldview. The obtained results of the study led the authors to the conclusion that events of the anti-cosmopolitan campaign had resulted in the beginning of a new stage in the I. P. Schmidt's biography - his research and pedagogical activities in Uzbekistan and Siberia. The study determines peculiarities of the activities and life of the "cosmopolitan" historian in the country's periphery. This article is intended for teachers and university students, researchers as well as local historians.

TI  - VARIATIONS OF GLUTATHIONE LEVEL AND GLUTATHIONE RELATED ENZYMES ACTIVITIES IN <i>Mytilus galloprovincialis</i> LAM. FROM THE BULGARIAN BLACK SEA COASTAL REGION
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Glutathione and glutathione related enzymes play an important role in oxidative stress (OS) regulation in bivalves. Detoxification of xenobiotic compounds entering the organism is attributed to glutathione-S-transferase (GST) which catalyses the conjugation of reduced glutathione (GSH) with various xenobiotics which become more hydrophilic thus facilitating their removal from the body. The Black Sea mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis Lam. is a sentinel species, used as a bioindicator of contamination. The aim of this study was to assess the variations of GSH and of related enzymes activities as biomarkers of the mussels' reaction to pollution exposure. Adult mussels (45-60 mm) were sampled from 11 localities, including two farms, along the Bulgarian Black Sea coast. GSH levels and activity of glutathione related enzymes were measured spectrophotometrically in the digestive gland, gills and foot. Highest GST activities along with depletion of GSH were present in mussels from the northern localities, which were more polluted than the southern localities where relatively high GSH levels and moderate GST activity and hence lower OS was found in mussels. Our results confirmed the presence of a coordinated reaction of the mussel detoxifying system to chronic exposure to various contaminants in the environment.

AB  - Additional, creatively oriented education of the younger generation of Russians in school technoparks requires studying the characteristics of Generation Z. The values were compared as noted by respondents (1st-year students and university entrants) among different generations of Russians: their own world (the world of children), the world of parents and the world of grandparents. All the three generations are dominated by being oriented towards hard work, study, mutual assistance both within the global environment and within a small society, that is, within family. These positions are represented by the phraseological layers of the language, which indicates their presence in the Russian national value worldview. In the world of parents and in that of children, the emergence of new groups of values absent in the world of grandparents is recorded: orientation towards consumer values, perceived from advertising in the media, and at the same time the extinction of the value of serving the homeland. A new value stands out in the world of children - a humorous approach to life problems, which can be considered global because it contains quotations from world literature and borrowed phraseological units. This value is distinguished by an optimistic view of the world and the role of man in it, which is characteristic of youth. The research results allow asserting that Generation Z is ready to be creative and is oriented towards technology. Taking into account the peculiarities of the generation allows scientifically organizing educational leisure activities in technoparks.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article is a summary of the content and results of the author's research into the party-Soviet nomenclature of the Volga German Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. In the course of the study, the origin, education, worldview, personal qualities, and activities of a significant number of the German Autonomy party Soviet functionaries were analyzed. The study was based on a wide array of documentary sources.The author is the first to identify three types of integrated images of the nomenclature that ruled the Volga Germans in the Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. The first type comes from the intellectuals, as a rule, with pre-revolutionary experience in social democratic work and supporters of classical Marxism, although infected with it, but able to more or less adequately assess the situation in society, the mood of people, and the degree of their ability to implement communist attitudes in practice. The second type is people from the "lower classes" who got involved in revolutionary practice during the Civil War, who knew and dogmatically perceived only the basics of Marxism and were fanatically ready to do anything for "brighter future", without thinking about the consequences of their actions. The third type is young personnel, formed in the Soviet time by the end of the 1930s. They perceived the ideas of Stalinist socialism as religion and were personally loyal to the leader. Having traced the fate of all the types of nomenclature, the author comes to the conclusion that the first type prevailed until the end of the 1920s. During the years of the "Great Turning Point" it was ousted from power by those who belonged to the second type. Almost all the nomenclature of the first and second types was destroyed in 1937-1938. They were replaced by the young nomenclature of the third type. Its administrative "destruction" took place during the deportation of the Germans from the Volga Region. Eventually, they shared the fate of their people.

AB  - The use of vegetation forest fires (FF) is known as one of the most important criteria in global change, especially because of their events on changes in land cover and atmospheric chemistry. Fire and climate are related with each other, meaning that the fire regime responds quickly to changes in climate. There are many environmental factors that affect the spread of fire, as ignition agents, topography, vegetation, landscape fragmentation, etc. Several of them can be obtained by Remote Sensing (RS) data/techniques. Fire risk (FR) assessment is one of the main components when determining the right approach to protect and prevent a region against FF. An analysis of the variables that influence FR was performed by applying a Geographical Information System (GIS) methodology to obtain a final FR map. The methodology used was based on the Chuvieco FR model. It was necessary to consider the fire danger (FD) and the fire vulnerability (FV). In this study, the main objective was to estimate the FR map, which is composed by two maps: ignition map, propagation map; and several variables, such as Fuel Moisture Content (FMC), Human Risk Index (HRI), vegetation indices (estimated through Sentinel-2 images), among others. The results were validated with the data relative to the fire occurrences in Valongo (Porto, Portugal) in 2019. It was demonstrated that the model is sufficiently accurate to apply in Portugal and in other areas with the respective local adjustments. In the future, this model will be implemented in a GIS plugin, under QGIS software.

T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Potential earthquake precursors include, among others, electromagnetic fields, gas emissions, Land Surface Temperature (LST), Sea Surface Temperature (SST), and Surface Air Temperature (SAT) anomalies. These observables have been individually studied, before earthquakes, by many researchers. The ionospheric studies concerning earthquakes (EQs) using magnetic data from Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites are increasingly being used to detect ionospheric anomalies before large EQs. Also, LST, SST, and SAT values retrieved from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra and Aqua satellites and Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications Version 2 (MERRA-2) are considered as physical precursors before EQs. In this work, we jointly analyze magnetic, MODIS, and MERRA-2 data in space and time around the epicenters before the selected EQs in Mexico, Japan, Chile, and Indonesia. Our analyses present interesting findings where anomalies in temperature and magnetic field, preceding the considered EQs, are confirmed through different methods. Particularly, we utilize the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) for analyzing magnetic data over the designated EQs regions. We use the magnetic data acquired by Swarm satellites in the top side ionosphere along with MODIS and MERRA-2. Five case studies are described to prove the effectiveness of our analyses. Precursory anomalies were observed using these methods in different anomalous days from the considered four regions of interest around the epicenter. It is concluded that these methods could be effective and reliable in detecting anomalies preceding the upcoming EQs.

T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Canadian RADARSAT constellation mission (RCM) is represented by three synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites, each of which includes a compact polarimetry (CP) mode. CP is advantageous because it provides increased backscatter information relative to single and conventional dual-polarized modes and has larger swath widths relative to a quad polarization mode. CP captures single-look complex data which can be used to derive the multilook complex (MLC) coherence matrix, or, equivalently, the Stokes vector data of the backscattered field. The challenge is to develop computer vision algorithms that can be used to effectively segment the scene using this new data source. An unsupervised region-based segmentation approach has been designed and implemented that utilizes the complex Wishart distribution characteristic of the MLC CP data. The segmentation method is based on the iterative region growing with semantics algorithm originally designed for single and dual pol intensity SAR data. The algorithm has been tested using both simulated CP SAR images and a pair of available quad polarization SAR images. The results demonstrate that the CP-IRGS algorithm provides more accurate segmentation images than those using only the RH and RV channel intensity images.

TI  - Mapping flood prone and Hazards Areas in rural landscape using landsat images and random forest classification: Case study of Nasia watershed in Ghana
T2  - COGENT ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Floods are hazard which poses immense threat to life and property. Identifying flood-prone areas, will enhance flood mitigation and proper land use planning of affected areas. However, lack of resources, the sizable extent of rural settlements, and the evolving complexities of contemporary flood models have hindered flood hazard mapping of the rural areas in Ghana. This study used supervised Random Forest (RF) classification, Landsat 8 OLI, and Landsat 7 ETM + images to produce flood prone, Land Use Land Cover (LULC), and flood hazard maps of the Nasia Watershed in Ghana. The results indicated that about 418.82 km(2) area of the watershed is flooded every 2-3 years (normal flooding) and about 689.61 km(2) is flooded every 7-10 years (extreme flooding). The LULC classification produced an overall accuracy of 92.31% and kappa of 0.9. The flood hazard map indicated that land areas within hazard zones of the river include the Nasia community, Flood Recession Agricultural (FRA), rainfed and woodlands. When compared with a Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), the RF supervised classification had an edge over the MNDWI in estimating the flooded areas. The results from this study can be used by local administrators, national flood disaster management and researchers for flood mitigation and land use planning within the watershed.

In addition to the role of animals in the transmission of the virus and spread of infected ticks through livestock trade, they can be employed as sentinel hosts for monitoring the infection. Iran is one of the endemic counties for CCHF and the disease has been documented in all provinces. However, in some provinces such as Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad, the rate of the disease has been dramatically low. Therefore, this serosurvey was designed to investigate CCHF virus (CCHFV) seroprevalence among livestock in different parts of Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad Province.Methods: This study was conducted in 2017, in which, blood samples were collected from 501 sheep and goats from eight different cities of Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad Province. CCHFV IgG antibodies were detected in livestock serum samples by specific ELISA assays for detection of ovine and caprine antibodies.Results: In total, four sheep serum of out of 501 (0.8%) livestock samples (3 from Gachsaran and 1 from Dena) had CCHFV IgG antibodies. No significant association was found between CCHFV seropositivity and sex or age of animals (P>0.05).Interpretation & conclusion: Our findings suggest a minor CCHFV circulation in Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad Province, Iran. However, due to the notion that outbreaks of tick-borne infections is hard to predict; steady and comprehensive monitoring programs especially in ticks and animals would be critical for understanding the circulation on the pathogen in a region.

M3  - Article
AB  - Pests and diseases can cause a variety of reactions in plants. In recent years, the boxwood dieback has become one of the essential concerns of practitioners and natural resources managers in Iran. To control the boxwood dieback spread, the early detection and disease distribution maps are required. The boxwood dieback causes a range of changes in colour, shape and leaf size with respect to photosynthesis and transpiration. Through remote sensing techniques, e.g. satellite image processing data, the variation of thermal and visual characteristics of the plant could be used to measure and illustrate the symptoms of the disease. In this study, five common vegetation indices like difference vegetation index (DVI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), simple ratio (SR), and plant health index (PHI) were extracted and calculated from Landsat 8 satellite image data from six regions in the Gilan province, located in the northern part of Iran out of 150 maps over the time period 2014-2018. It turned out that among the aforementioned indices, based upon the results of the models, SR and NDVI indices were more useful for the disease spread, respectively. Our disease progression model fitting criteria showed that this technique could probably be used to assess the extent of the affected areas and also the disease progression in the investigated regions in future.

AB  - Behind the needs of the availability for the mangrove trees biodiversity database are important in promoting coastal area protection, including mangrove forest conservation. This initiative started by mapping mangrove trees distribution by utilizing two different modes of ground detected ranged (GRD) and single look complex (SLC) of Sentinel-1 data images. Both are processed to get the backscatter value, dual-polarization radar vegetation index (DpRVI) and polarization decomposition for entropy, alpha, and anisotropy values for each mangrove trees species (MTS) detection that compared with the data field. Besides that, the distribution of each mangrove tree has been conducted based on its genus and species richness that estimated using a random forest (RF) algorithm for nine different combinations, including VV, VH, and VV-VH, entropy, alpha, and anisotropy, DpRVI, and the integration of between backscatter value and polarization decomposition. The result has shown a variation in the level of accuracy ranging from weak to moderate at about 26% to 65%. The combination of VV, VH, VH-VV and DpRVI obtained better accuracy at about 65%. Related to the species of mangrove detected, the Avicennia alba becomes a dominant mangrove tree species grown as much as 60% in the study area.

M3  - Article
AB  - In 1926, in Tay Ninh province, about 100 km away from present day Ho Chi Minh City, a new spiritual movement was born, aiming at the symbolic unification of all the world's major religions into one. Its hierarchical structure resembles Roman Catholicism while on the other hand integrating elements from Christianity, Buddhism, Taoism and Islam. Besides worshipping the prophetic figures of the world major religions (Jesus Christ, Buddha and Mohammed), the Cao Dai claim to have communicated in spiritist seances with secular western and eastern literary, historical and political figures such as William Shakespeare, Victor Hugo, Jeanne D'Arc, Sun Yat Sen, Vladimir Lenin and the Vietnamese poet and prophet Nguy.n B.nh Khiem, worshipping some of these (but not all) as saints. Within the present article, I aim at analyzing the syncretic religious imagery of the Cao Dai and discuss the manner in which they construct their religious narrative as well as worldview.

AB  - We investigate the effect of the Adige-Garda spillway opening on the 03/03/2020 on Lake Garda using numerical modelling and maps of Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) concentration. SPM maps are obtained from Sentinel-2 images processed using the BOMBER bio-optical model. Three satellite images are examined: 28/02/2020, 04/03/2020 and 07/03/2020. Maps indicate a significant increase in SPM concentrations, especially in the northern part of the lake close to the hydraulic tunnel outlet. Results are consistent with the modelled flow field. Remote sensing effectively captures the event's spatial and temporal variation, while numerical modelling explains and corroborates the observed patterns.

CP  - 7th Geoinformation Science Symposium
CL  - Yogyakarta, INDONESIA
AB  - Investigation of possible variations of the combination of VV and VH polarization available for SENTINEL-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery has been conducted for plantation detection. The dual-polarization (VV and VH) Interferometric Wide Swath (IW) along descending orbit over Tesso Nilo Ecosystem collected between 1st to 25th March 2021 stored inside Google Earth Engine dataset catalog is used for this objective. Thus initial preprocessing is excluded. The Random Forest method is implemented for two purposes, (1) to identify variable importance of variable used in the classification process, (1) the supervised pixel-based classification. Training samples used in the classification process were collected from visual interpretation of SENTINEL-1 composite image whereas the validation sample is obtained from the Google earth high-resolution imagery. The result shows that variable (VV/VH), (VV-VH), and RVI has the highest degree of importance for oil palm, pulpwood, and forest detection respectively. There is a pattern where the derivative variables of the VV and VH polarization have a high degree of importance. The same pattern appears in the classification results, where scenario 13 ((VV-VH), (VV/VH), ((VV+VH)/2), RVI) has the highest overall accuracy value of 91.74%. Scenario 13 produces the user accuracy of 94.22%, 93.89%, 81.82%, and 95.45% for oil palm, pulpwood, forest, and other land use respectively. The scenario also produces a high producer accuracy of 93.86%, 93.89%, 81.82%, and 97.67%. The combination of available polarization derivative variables with SAR data capabilities can be utilized to build wide-scale plantation monitoring and management systems.

AB  - The effectiveness of the sentinel lymph node mapping in patients with Urothelial carcinoma of the bladder is under investigation. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT/CT) and intraoperative sentinel node biopsy using gamma probe are performed to detect the exact location of the sentinel lymph node to be dissected during the surgery. In this case report, a 73-year old man with high grade urothelial carcinoma was referred to our nuclear medicine department for SPECT/CT, four hours after injection of the radiotracer through cystoscopy. SPECT/CT could not reveal any sentinel node; however, one sentinel lymph node was detected and harvested in the right external iliac region during surgery. SPECT/CT revealed unusual accumulation of tracer in large bowel which was due to severe adhesion of rectum and bladder, and inadvertent injection of the radiotracer into the rectal wall. During the sentinel lymph node procedure, the tracer should be injected with extreme caution and lymphoscintigraphy post injection may help detection of any injection failures.

TI  - Landslide Mapping Using Two Main Deep-Learning Convolution Neural Network Streams Combined by the Dempster-Shafer Model
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Beyond the direct hazards of earthquakes, the deposited mass of earthquake-induced landslide (EQIL) in the riverbeds causes the river to thrust upward. The EQIL inventories are generated mostly by the traditional or semisupervised mapping approaches, which required a parameter's tuning or binary threshold decision in the practical application. In this study, we investigated the impact of optical data from the PlanetScope sensor and topographic factors from the ALOS sensor on EQIL mapping using a deep-learning convolution neural network (CNN). Thus, six training datasets were prepared and used to evaluate the performance of the CNN model using only optical data and using these data along with each and all topographic factors across the west coast of the Trishuli river in Nepal. For the first time, the Dempster-Shafer (D-S) model was applied for combining the resulting maps from each CNN stream that trained with different datasets. Finally, seven different resulting maps were compared against a detailed and accurate inventory of landslide polygons by a mean intersection-over-union (mIOU). Our results confirm that using the training dataset of the spectral information along with the topographic factor of the slope is helpful to distinguish the landslide bodies from other similar features, such as barren lands, and consequently increases the mapping accuracy. The improvement of the mIOU was a range from approximately zero to more than 17%. Moreover, the D-S model can be considered as an optimizer method to combine the results from different scenarios.

TI  - Automatic Detection of Volcanic Unrest Using Blind Source Separation With a Minimum Spanning Tree Based Stability Analysis
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Repeated synthetic aperture radar (SAR) acquisitions can be utilized to produce measurements of ground deformations and associated geohazards, such as it can be used to detect signs of volcanic unrest. Existing time series algorithms like permanent scatterer analysis and small baseline subset are computationally demanding and cannot be applied in near real time to detect subtle, transient, and precursory deformations. To overcome this problem, we have adapted a minimum spanning tree based spatial independent component analysis method to automatically detect sources related to volcanic unrest from a time series of differential interferograms. For a synthetic dataset, we first utilize the algorithm's capability to isolate signals of geophysical interest from atmospheric artifacts, topography, and other noise signals, before monitoring the evolution of these signals through time in order to detect the onset of a period of volcanic unrest, in near real time. In this article, we first demonstrate our approach on synthetic datasets having different signal strengths and temporal complexities. Second, we demonstrate our approach on a couple of real datasets, one acquired in 2017-2019 over the Colima volcano, Mexico, showing the occurrence of previously unrecognized short-term deformation events and the other over Mt. Thorbjorn in Iceland acquired over 2020. This shows the strength of the deep learning application to differential interferometric SAR measurements, and highlights that deformation events occurring without eruptions, which may have previously been undetected.

T2  - GEOGRAPHY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper discusses the response of ecosystem service values to land use/land cover (LULC) changes and examines spatial contributions of individual transformations to the ecosystem service functions in the Barasat Sadar subdivision (West Bengal, India) over the period from 1977 to 2016 on the basis of a modified coefficient. Spatiotemporal LULC patterns were identified on the basis of Landsat series satellite images taken at intervals of 10 years. To identify the LULC parameters, a supervised classification was performed on the basis of the maximum likelihood (MXL) classifier. Ecosystem service values have been computed per ha of the terrestrial ecosystem based on coefficients determined for each land cover parameter in earlier studies. In 2016, the highest ecosystem service value was attributed to surface waters ($477.06 million); while the lowest value corresponded to fallow lands ($0.98 million). The results obtained using the assumed coefficient indicate a continuous loss of the total ecosystem service value of $238.92 million over 1977-2016 due to the deterioration of agricultural fallow lands, areas occupied by dense vegetation, and shrubby lands, as well as rapid expansion of arable lands and development of an artificial infrastructure for surface-water bodies. The results of this study can be used as a reference and basis for decision making in the field of wise land resource management. In addition, the obtained data can be used to strike a compromise between urban growth and the decline of ecosystem services.

AB  - The availability of massive earth observing satellite data provides huge opportunities for land use and land cover mapping. However, such mapping effort is challenging due to the existence of various land cover classes, noisy data, and the lack of proper labels. Also, each land cover class typically has its own unique temporal pattern and can be identified only during certain periods. In this article, we introduce a novel architecture that incorporates the UNet structure with Bidirectional LSTM and Attention mechanism to jointly exploit the spatial and temporal nature of satellite data and to better identify the unique temporal patterns of each land cover class. We compare our method with other state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively on two real-world datasets which involve multiple land cover classes. We also visualise the attention weights to study its effectiveness in mitigating noise and in identifying discriminative time periods of different classes. The code and dataset used in this work are made publicly available for reproducibility.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The Handover process is an essential aspect of patient care in daily clinical practice to ensure continuity of patient care. Standardization of clinical handover may reduce sentinel events due to inaccurate and ineffective communication. Single arm experimental trial was conducted to assess the effect of standard Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation (SBAR) protocol implementation in overall bedside nursing handover process, patient satisfaction, and nurses' acceptance. As a sample, all nursing staff of specified unit, all handover process performed by them, and patients admitted during study the period were included. Initially, the prevailing handover process and patient satisfaction regarding nursing handover was assessed using a structured observation checklist. During the implementation phase, nurses were trained on an SBAR handover protocol. After implementation, nursing handovers were again assessed and data regarding patient satisfaction and nurses' acceptance were collected. There was a statistically significant difference (P < .05) in median scores between the pre and post-intervention group on overall nursing handover and patient satisfaction regarding nursing handover. Standardization of patient's handover process is effective in terms of improving nursing handover process, patient satisfaction, and health professionals' acceptance.

M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic Interferometric Aperture Radar (InSAR) is a cost-effective technique for observing the Earth's surface, topography and ground motion deformations of the Earth. However, little work has been done in developing countries to apply this technique to the monitoring of natural disasters that strongly affect their socioeconomic condition. In this work, we apply the Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) technique in central Rwanda. This article presents the monitoring of earthflows in central Rwanda using 26 Sentinel-1 radar data extended from 2014 to 2018. The site investigation by high-resolution optical imagery from Google Maps is compared to the SBAS velocity. The results revealed an active earthflow near a mining area with a mean velocity around -30 to -20 mm/ year and an earthflow of -40 mm/year mean velocity in Kigali. The other movements detected were due to anthropogenic and coastal subsidence.

AB  - Kim So-woon (1907-1981)’s Korean Japanese mixed children’s magazine, 『New Child』 has been partially discussed recently. In 1934, Kim So-woon established the Children’s World History as a separate institution of the Joseon Children’s Education Association and published ‘Children’s World’, but the problem of commercialization of business as management rights are delegated to the hands of the investors in the organization of a limited partnership company has arisen, and he has cut off from them and newly established ‘Shinadongsa’. The magazine contains several children’s literature works by the members of the Guinhoe, including Kim Hae-kyung (Lee Sang), Kim Yoo-jung, Park Tae-won and Jung Ji-yong, who are close to Kim So-woon.In a fairy tale written in Japanese <Willow’s complaints>, Kim So-woon reveals his worldview of sympathizing with Japan by contrasting active supporters of Japanese modernization with the slave situation of Joseon, which he had no choice but to passively accept. However, the members of Guinhoe all wrote in Korean, except for Lee Sang, and showed a different worldview from Kim So-woon. While maintaining their personal relationship with Kim So-woon, the members of the Guinhoe did not lose their identity and direction in the work. The members of the Guinhoe, who had been with Kim So-woon for a long time, did not think negatively about the modern knowledge and learning opportunities that Kim So-woon wanted to impart to the children of Joseon, although he led the Korean Children’s Education Association under the protection, assistance, and cooperation of Japan. Although this paper focused on the relationship between “New Children” and “Guinhoe,” evaluation of this magazine and Kim So-woon should be continued in the future.

TI  - Sand Fly (Diptera: Psychodidae: Phlebotominae) Population Dynamics and Natural <i>Leishmania</i> Infections in Attica Region, Greece
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A 2-yr sand fly (Diptera: Psychodidae) seasonality study was performed in Attica Region, Greece, from June 2017 until November 2018, aiming also to detect the presence of Leishmania infection in the collected sand flies. In total, 701 sand flies were collected from urban areas within the Attica Region using BG-Sentinel traps, set weekly in eight fixed sites. Five species were identified morphologically and molecularly, namely Phlebotomus tobbi (Adler and Theodor), which was most the most commonly collected species, followed by P. Neglectus (Tonnoir), P. papatasi (Scopoli), P. simici (Theodor), and Sergentomyia minuta (Rondani). During both survey years sand fly populations peaked in late August to early September. Fifty-nine monospecific pools were examined for Leishmania detection by analyzing the ITS1 nuclear region using both RFLPs and sequencing, seven of which were found positive. Leishmania DNA was identified as L. infantum in six pools (five P. papatasi and one P. tobbi), whereas in one P. papatasi pool Leishmania DNA was identified as L. tropica. This is the first time that L. tropica has been detected in naturally infected sand flies from the Attica Region as well as in central Greece, while previously it has only been detected in sand flies collected from Central Macedonia (Northern Greece).

TI  - EXPLOITATION OF IMAGING SPECTROSCOPY DATA FROM PRISMA AND DESIS FOR WATER QUALITY MAPPING
T2  - PLANET CARE FROM SPACE
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - This study presents a first exploitation of imagery data acquired by the current hyperspectral satellite sensors PRISMA and DESIS for water quality applications. In particular, a general description of the two missions, respectively developed by the Italian and German space agencies, is initially provided for presenting the main features of the sensors. The standard Level 1 (L1) and Level 2 (L2) products acquired by both sensors are then presented for their support for water quality retrieval. A preliminary analysis on the estimation of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) from L1 products over open waters is indicating SNR, apart at short wavelengths where imagery data showed a lower value, is comparable with Sentinel-2 MSI values. A variety of L2 products for inland and coastal waters are then presented in terms of remote sensing reflectance (Rrs, in sr(-1) units) in view of aquatic ecosystem mapping. The analysis, which is also supported by in situ reference data, overall indicates that even if some applications might be developed with the standard L2 PRISMA and DESIS products, an ad-hoc processing might be necessary to include the specific requirements of atmospheric correction of water targets, especially in clear marine waters. Satellite imaging spectroscopy products are also comparable to synergic multispectral missions (e.g. Sentinel-2 MSI, Sentinel-3 OLCI); this finding is promising to meet spectral, temporal and spatial requirements typical for aquatic ecosystems applications.

TI  - The contribution and weighting functions of radiative transfer - theory and application to the retrieval of upper-tropospheric humidity
T2  - METEOROLOGISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT
M3  - Article
AB  - Several interesting problems in remote sensing can be traced back to the question of the origin along the line of sight of the registered photons. In this paper we revive old concepts that directly follow from the equation of radiative transfer, namely the contribution and weighting functions. We give them, however, a new mathematical form by transforming them into a pair of probability density functions which have the advantage that they can be used in a more flexible manner. We derive these functions, demonstrate a simple relation between them and show how they can be used in principle. Then we proceed with simple applications to a case of upper-tropospheric humidity (UTH) retrieval. In particular, we show how the mean emission pressure level and mean emission temperature change with increasing UTH. We show that the mean emission pressure increases with increasing humidity and remains almost unchanged for UTH values greater than 50 %. The mean emission temperature is decreasing exponentially as UTH increases. The sensitivities of the mean emission pressure to various quantities, e.g. the temperature lapse rate, or retrieval situations, e.g. whether UTH or UTH with respect to ice is considered or which of two different versions of a receiver is used, is generally small compared to the 2 sigma(p)-width of the layer. The relation of the contribution and weighting functions to Jacobians is discussed as well. We note that the dependence of the mean emission pressure level and other statistical quantities can be formulated using the radiances or brightness temperatures directly. The new method thus offers additional possibilities for interpretation of data from passive remote sensing, and examples are given. In addition of deriving the desired product (for instance, UTH) one can derive and map the mean emission location, its width, and other physical properties like mean temperature of the emission layer. The necessary probability density functions are contained in the solution of the radiative transfer equation and can thus be obtained from runs of the corresponding models. We recommend that radiative transfer models be equipped with facilities to compute and output the contribution and weighting functions.

TI  - Metalliferous Mining Pollution and Its Impact on Terrestrial and Semi-terrestrial Vertebrates: A Review
T2  - REVIEWS OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY, VOL 256
M3  - Review
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Metalliferous mining, a major source of metals and metalloids, has severe potential environmental impacts. However, the number of papers published in international peer-reviewed journals seems to be low regarding its effects in terrestrial wildlife. To the best of our knowledge, our review is the first on this topic. We used 186 studies published in scientific journals concerning metalliferous mining or mining spill pollution and their effects on terrestrial and semi-terrestrial vertebrates. We identified the working status of the mine complexes studied, the different biomarkers of exposure and effect used, and the studied taxa. Most studies (128) were developed in former mine sites and 46 in active mining areas. Additionally, although several mining accidents have occurred throughout the world, all papers about effects on terrestrial vertebrates from mining spillages were from Aznalcollar (Spain). We also observed a lack of studies in some countries with a prominent mining industry. Despite >50% of the studies used some biomarker of effect, 42% of them only assessed exposure by measuring metal content in internal tissues or by non-invasive sampling, without considering the effect in their populations. Most studied species were birds and small mammals, with a negligible representation of reptiles and amphibians. The information gathered in this review could be helpful for future studies and protocols on the topic and it facilitates a database with valuable information on risk assessment of metalliferous mining pollution.

TI  - Simulation of glacial lake outburst flood hazard in Hunza valley of upper
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED AND APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The UIB (Upper Indus Basin) is prone to GLOFs (Glacial Lake Outburst Floods). Physical monitoring of such a large area on a regular basis is a challenging task, especially when the temporal and spatial extent of the hazard is highly variable. The purpose of this study was to map the potentially dangerous glacial lakes and simulate the associated hazard in the downward settlements using HEC-RAS in the GIS environment using Landsat 7 remote sensing data. The study was conducted in Hunza Valley of UIB, where there are several human settlements that are endangered due to the GLOF hazard. Sudden breaches in the unstable moraine dams adjoining receding glaciers may occur because of the rapid and huge accumulation of turbulent water in the glacial lakes. The ASTER GDEM (Digital Elevation Model) is utilized to detect flow accumulation of glacial hazard involving slope, elevation, and orientation of the mountain glaciers. The study results revealed that settlements of Hunza Valley are threatened by the GLOFs hazard. Keeping in view the seasonal growth of the potentially dangerous glacial lakes of Hunza Valley, a low discharge of 3500m(3)/s from a potentially dangerous glacial lake can affect 40%, whereas a moderate discharge of 5000m(3)/s can affect 60%, and a high discharge of 7000m(3)/s can affect 80% of the Shimshal village habitat. The results of the study can provide a platform for the establishment of an early warning and monitoring system to minimize the impact of future GLOFs. Accurate and comprehensive knowledge of potentially dangerous GLOFs is of utmost importance for risk management. A digital repository of GLOFs can enhance the ability to inform policymakers on the vulnerability, risk mitigation, and action/adaptation measures. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by IASE.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Ocean Sensing and Monitoring XIII

AB  - Current Ocean Color (OC) algorithms for the estimation of chlorophyll-a concentration (Chla) from satellite imagery, which are based primarily on 440, 490 and 550 nm bands, work well in the open ocean areas and often break in coastal waters because of failure of the atmospheric correction in blue bands and water complexity. A recently developed neural network (NN) algorithm for VIIRS avoids blue bands utilizing 490, 550 and 671 nm bands. This algorithm was proven to work well to detect Karenia brevis algal blooms along the West Florida Shelf even near the coast and to determine Chla in many other areas but is limited to Chla below 10-15 mg/m(3). Algorithms that are based on the red-NIR bands, work well at high Chla for the near surface measurements. However, they require a band near 709 nm which is available only on the Sentinel-3 OLCI satellite sensor, and the current OLCI atmospheric correction is not reliable enough at this band. To detect algal blooms in very complex areas like the Chesapeake Bay, a new approach is presented, which avoids blue bands but includes data from the VIIRS I1 imaging band 600 - 680 nm with a center at 638 nm. Remote sensing reflectance for this I1 band is now routinely included in the standard set of processed VIIRS bands at NOAA CoastWatch with 750 m spatial resolution. This band integrates part of the remote sensing reflectance spectrum with variable phytoplankton absorption together with a complex combination of spectra from other water components and is helpful in the estimation of Chla in a broad range. Results are compared with the performance of the OLCI red-NIR algorithm with an alternative atmospheric correction, showing good qualitative agreements in the Chesapeake Bay area in conditions from clear waters to algal blooms.

The pixel in its artistic aspect, has as its origin hypothesis the brushstroke of pointillism, with the arrival of computing it is a matter of information in binary code, the first images that came to us from the Landsat series satellites were built with an algorithm located in 7x7 pixel matrices where each pixel corresponds to a number and this to a tone or colour, the sum of the pixels built an image. With all this technology and its scientific foundations, we created didactic units to be carried out in the subject of "Fundamentals of Visual Expression and Representation", for the C.FG.S. Interactive Graphics, from High Educational School of Art and Design (Castellon de la Plana). Because if the hand thinks when drawing, the brain gets excited, and this leads us to an emotional and intelligent design.

TI  - Reduced lymphedema after sentinel lymph node biopsy versus lymphadenectomy for endometrial cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveEndometrial cancer surgical staging includes lymph node assessment which can lead to lower extremity lymphedema. The aim of this study was to estimate prevalence after sentinel lymph node biopsy versus lymphadenectomy.MethodsConsecutive patients who underwent minimally invasive surgery at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA, between January 2009 and June 2016 for newly diagnosed endometrial cancer were mailed our validated 13 item lower extremity lymphedema screening questionnaire. We also ascertained via questionnaire whether the patient was ever diagnosed with lower extremity lymphedema.ResultsAmong 378 patients included in the analysis, 127 (33.5%) had sentinel lymph node biopsy with or without side specific lymphadenectomy (sentinel lymph node cohort) and 251 (66.4%) underwent bilateral lymphadenectomy prior to sentinel lymph node biopsy implementation at our institution or as 'backup' after sentinel lymph node mapping (lymphadenectomy cohort). The prevalence of lower extremity lymphedema was 41.5% (157/378), with 69 patients (18.3%) self-reporting a lower extremity lymphedema diagnosis after their endometrial cancer surgery at a median of 54.3 months (interquartile range 31.2-70.1 months), and an additional 88 patients (23.3%) identified by the screening questionnaire. The prevalence of lower extremity lymphedema was significantly higher in the lymphadenectomy cohort compared with the sentinel lymph node group (49.4% (124/251) vs 26.0% (33/127); p<0.001). When the cohorts were restricted to patients surgically managed after the introduction of sentinel lymph node, the prevalence of lower extremity lymphedema was still significantly higher in the lymphadenectomy cohort compared with the sentinel lymph node cohort (39.0% (41/105) vs 26.0% (33/127); p=0.03). In a multivariable analysis adjusted for body mass index, receipt of adjuvant external beam radiation, diabetes, congestive heart failure, and International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics grade, the adjusted odds ratio for the association between type of nodal sampling (lymphadenectomy cohort vs sentinel lymph node cohort) and lower extremity lymphedema was 2.75 (95% confidence interval 1.69 to 4.47, p<0.001).ConclusionsSentinel lymph node biopsy was associated with a decreased risk of post-treatment lymphedema compared with lymphadenectomy in patients who underwent surgical staging for endometrial carcinoma.

TI  - INTERPRETATION SPHERE OF THE AUTHOR'S VOCABULARY (ON THE MATERIAL OF THE BOOK "STONE" BY O. E. MANDELSTAM)
T2  - PHILOLOGICAL CLASS
M3  - Article
AB  - The scope of research in the article includes author's vocabulary, or the vocabulary of the language of O. E. Mandelstam (based on the book of poems "Stone"). The research object is an author's vocabulary entry as a system that has a structure and its own units. The basic research method is the method of poetic ideography as a kind of literary ideography and a type of general ideography in lexicographical perspective. The units under study are heterogeneous and diverse: these are units of a quantum and metafunctional nature. The former include units of prosody, lexical and conceptual units; the latter comprise units of a poetological and prosodic nature, as well as conceptual formations. The study reveals and characterizes typological features of the author's vocabulary (of the language of O. Mandelstam), and introduces new features: poetological, prosodic, and interpretative. In general, the investigation is carried out within the framework of lexicography, ideography, textual studies, text linguistics, text hermeneutics, and text decoding (interpretation). The article establishes the operational order of description of poem units (the arrangement of the material in the author's vocabulary is text-related), which corresponds to the set of systemic areas of the poetic text analyzed in the vocabulary entry: textual, poetological, prosodic, lexico-semantic, denotative, ideographic, and interpretative (based on the analysis of the system of functional-semantic field of vocabulary in a particular poem as the title unit of a vocabulary entry) spheres. The results of poetic-ideographical analysis correlate with the specific features of the poetic worldview of O. Mandelstam. The study suggests, illustrates, and analyzes a model and structure of a vocabulary entry of O. Mandelstam's language. The degree of subjectivity/objectivity of the content of the interpretation sphere of a vocabulary entry is also determined. Furthermore, the authors conceptualize the nature, character, and structure of the interpretative sphere of a vocabulary entry. They analyze O. Mandelstam's poem "Silentium". The vocabulary entry contains eight structural elements. The logic of description and analysis of the units of the poetic text (by stanzas) is as follows: the title unit of the vocabulary entry - the poem. poetological information. prosodic information. semantic-denotative-ideographic information. interpretative sphere of the vocabulary entry. Interpretation of textual, general lexicographic, and ideographic information is performed with reference to the identification and analysis of paradigmatic (causative) series of conceptual formations implemented in the text word by word, line by line, and stanza by stanza (the units of interpretative analysis - vocabulary, phrase, utterance, complex syntactic construction and complex syntactic unity). Interpretation of conceptual formations is carried out taking into account the polysemy of the vocabulary. The interpretative sphere is the result of functioning of such a feature of the text as interpretability, or poliinterpretability, and also an outcome or generalized conclusion of the poetic and lexicographic study of O. Mandelstam's poems.

TI  - Epidemiology of intussusception in infants less than one year of age in Ghana, 2012-2016.
T2  - The Pan African medical journal
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Multicenter Study
AB  - INTRODUCTION: we examined the epidemiology, clinical and demographic characteristics of intussusception in Ghanaian infants.METHODS: active sentinel surveillance for pediatric intussusception was conducted at Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital in Kumasi and Korle Bu Teaching Hospital in Accra. From March 2012 to December 2016, infants < 1 year of age who met the Brighton Collaboration level 1 diagnostic criteria for intussusception were enrolled. Data were collected through parental interviews and medical records abstraction.RESULTS: a total of 378 children < 1 year of age were enrolled. Median age at onset of intussusception was 27 weeks; only 12 cases (1%) occurred in infants < 12 weeks while most occurred in infants aged 22-34 weeks. Median time from symptom onset until referral to a tertiary hospital was 2 days (IQR: 1-4 days). Overall, 35% of infants were treated by enema, 33% had surgical reduction and 32% required surgical reduction and bowel resection. Median length of hospital stay was 5 days (IQR: 3-8 days) with most patients (95%) discharged home. Eleven (3%) infants died. Infants undergoing enema reduction were more likely than those treated surgically to present for treatment sooner after symptom onset (median 1 vs 3 days; p < 0.0001) and have shorter hospital stays (median 3 vs 7 days; p < 0.001).CONCLUSION: Ghanaian infants had a relatively low case fatality rate due to intussusception, with a substantial proportion of cases treated non-surgically. Early presentation for treatment, possibly enhanced by community-based health education programs and health information from various media platforms during the study period might contribute to both the low fatality rate and high number of successful non-surgical treatments in this population.

TI  - More Than 40 yr of Potentially Induced Seismicity Close to the San Andreas Fault in San Ardo, Central California
T2  - SEISMOLOGICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Evidence for fluid-injection-induced seismicity is rare in California hydrocarbon basins, despite widespread injection close to seismically active faults. We investigate a potential case of injection-induced earthquakes associated with San Ardo oilfield operations that began in the early 1950s. The largest potentially induced events occurred in 1955 (M-L 5.2) and 1985 (M-w 4.5) within 6 km from the oilfield. We analyze Synthetic Aperture Radar interferometric images acquired by Sentinel-1A/B satellites between 2016 and 2020 and find surface deformation of up to 1:5 cm/yr, indicating pressure imbalance in parts of the oilfield. Fluid injection in San Ardo is concentrated within highly permeable rocks directly above the granitic basement at a depth of similar to 800 m. Seismicity predominantly occurs along basement faults at 6-13 km depths. Seismicity and wastewater disposal wells are spatially correlated to the north of the oilfield. Temporal correlations are observed over more than 40 yr with correlation coefficients of up to 0.71 for seismicity within a 24 km distance from the oilfield. Such large distances have not previously been observed in California but are similar to the large spatial footprint of injection in Oklahoma. The San Ardo seismicity shows anomalous clustering with earthquakes consistently occurring at close spatial proximity but long interevent times. Similar clustering has previously been reported in California geothermal fields and may be indicative of seismicity driven by long-term, spatially persistent external forcing.The complexity of seismic behavior at San Ardo suggests that multiple processes, such as elastic stress transfer and aseismic slip transients, contribute to the potentially induced earthquakes. The present observations show that fluid-injection operations occur close to seismically active faults in California. Yet, seismicity is predominantly observed on smaller unmapped faults with little observational evidence that large faults are sensitive to induced stress changes.

TI  - A Novel Approach for Gaussian Mixture Model Clustering Based on Soft Computing Method
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Determining the number of clusters in a data set is a significant and difficult problem in cluster analysis. In this study, a new model-based clustering approach is proposed for the estimation of the number of clusters. In the proposed method, the number of components in each variable is determined by using univariate Gaussian mixture models. The number of alternative cluster centres and mixture models was determined according to the number of components in heterogeneous variables. In this study, appropriate Gaussian mixture models were determined with the help of "mixture model soft computing method" for the first time. Vector arrays showing the number and addresses of clusters in appropriate Gaussian mixture models were created, and according to the parameter estimations of these models that fit the arrays, the best model was obtained through information criteria. The clustering success achieved with the proposed mixture model soft computing method was compared with the results of Gaussian mixture model clustering methods namely, mclust, clustvarsel, varselLCM, selvarMix and vscc model selection methods in R package. All respective methods analyse and determine the number of clustering for the data sets, synthetic-1, synthetic-2, Iris, and Landsat Satellite Image data sets, respectively and evaluate the correct classification rate. The results revealed that the proposed method shows better results for the determination of number of clustering as well as correct classification rate. The novelty of the study is that a new model-based dimension reduction method is proposed for the estimation of the number of clusters. A deterministic clustering approach is proposed for clustering and classification success on reduced data.

TI  - "Non-violent evangelism": a look at how members of evangelical faith-based organizations share faith with service recipients in Southern, Ontario, Canada
T2  - JOURNAL OF RELIGION AND SPIRITUALITY IN SOCIAL WORK
M3  - Article
AB  - This present work shares data from a mixed-methods study in Southern Ontario, Canada, focused on understanding faith sharing (often called evangelism or proselytism) within evangelical faith-based organizations. The study figures against the backdrop of the relatively scant literature on understanding evangelism in social service settings. The findings reveal multiple ways in which faith-based organizations seek to evangelize clients "non-violently", i.e., in a fashion that is not forceful or coercive. Here we focus on three: (1) through sharing and imparting a worldview; (2) through faith as a service modality; and (3) through social support. Analyzed against the backdrop of existing literature on faith-based organizations and ethical social service delivery, our findings suggest the need for further inquiry into social service delivery by faith-based organizations (FBOs). The paper discusses some valuable elements of the service provided by FBOs but also raises critical questions about client self determination and autonomy and service free from coercion - even if faith-sharing is in its gentlest and most well-intentioned form.

TI  - Monitoring Soil Salinity Changes, Comparison of Different Maps and Indices Extracted from Landsat Satellite Images (Case Study: Atabieh, Khuzestan)
T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinity is the dominant process in the degradation of arid and semi-arid soils, which in turn reduces crop yields, increases erosion, and exacerbates desertification. In recent years, soil salinity has affected much of the land in the Atabieh area located in the west of Khuzestan province in Iran. The purpose of this study was thus to evaluate and map soil salinity changes in the region over 15 years using Landsat 7 and 8 satellite images. To that end, the spectra of saline soils in the study area were extracted from the satellite data, and after the initial pre-processing in EVNI software version 5.3, the SI1, SI2, SI3, BI, NDVI, and NDSI indices were prepared. Using the supervised classification method, the salinity map with four different classes was then plotted in Arc GIS version 10.2, and the changes in saline soil area were investigated. Moreover, field surveys, surface soil sampling, soil EC measurement and identification of available minerals were performed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique and satellite images. Among the studied indices, the BI index with the highest correlation (0.71) was considered as the best index, and NDVI with the correlation coefficient of 0.35 at the 95% confidence level, was the best index for vegetation cover. Examination of changes in BI index by Landsat 7 images showed that the non-saline land area decreased from 1023.54 ha in 2000 to 143.43 ha in 2010, while the area with medium salinity increased by 14.57%. Besides, the salinity severity in the NDVI index had a growth rate of 72.86%. In turn, XRD studies confirmed the presence of abundant evaporate minerals (Halites, Calcite and Dolomite) corresponding to the values (real numbers) of salinity and mineralogical maps obtained from the Landsat 8 images.

AB  - Remote sensing is currently the primary method of obtaining knowledge about the composition and physical properties of the surface of other planets. In a commonly used technique, visible and near-infrared (VNIR) spectrometers onboard orbiting satellites capture reflectance data at different wavelengths, which in turn gives insight about the minerals present and the overall composition of the terrain. In select locations on Mars, rovers have also conducted up close in-situ investigation of the same terrains examined by orbiters, allowing direct comparisons at different spatial scales. In this work, we build Planetary Visor, a virtual reality tool to visualize orbital and ground data around NASA's Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover's ongoing traverse in Gale Crater. We have built a 3D terrain along Curiosity's traverse using rover images, and within it we visualize satellite data as polyhedrons, superimposed on that terrain. This system provides perspectives of VNIR spectroscopic data from a satellite aligned with ground images from the rover, allowing the user to explore both the physical aspects of the terrain and their relation to the mineral composition. The result is a system that provides seamless rendering of datasets at vastly different scales.We conduct a user study with subject matter experts to evaluate the success and potential of our tool. The results indicate that Visor assists with geometric understanding of spectral data, improved geological context, a better sense of scale while navigating terrain, and new insights into spectral data. The result is not only an immersive environment in a scientifically interesting area on Mars, but a robust tool for analysis and visualization of data that can yield improved scientific discovery. This technology is relevant to the ongoing operations of the Curiosity rover and will directly be able to represent the data collected in the upcoming Mars 2020 Perseverance rover mission.

TI  - Soil loss on the arable lands of the forest-steppe and steppe zones of European Russia and Siberia during the period of intensive agriculture
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - An assessment of the total soil loss from cultivated land was undertaken for the Chernozems-Kastanozems belt of European Russia and Siberia, based on the results of the National Soil Survey for administrative regions and the detailed study of three sentinel catchments, located in different parts of the Russian Plain. The soil profile truncation method was used to assemble data on soil erosion for the period of intensive agriculture, which ranged in duration between 110 and 230 years for the different parts of the sentinel study catchments and which had mean durations of 50-220 years for the total area of arable land comprising the administrative regions of Russia. The average value of the mean annual erosion rate for all regions of European Russia was estimated at 0.5 mm yr(-1) for Chernozems and 0.4 mm yr(-1) for Kastanozems, equivalent to similar to 6 t ha(-1) yr(-1) and similar to 4.8 t ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. The total volume of soil eroded on arable lands during the period of ploughing, in the Chernozems-Kastanozems soil belt of Russia, amounted to 33.4 x 10(9) m(3) (excluding sediment re-deposition on the arable land). The topography of arable slopes and the erosion index of precipitation are the critical factors determining the differences in the rates of soil loss, both at the level of small catchments and at regional level, while the duration of the ploughing period does not significantly affect the proportion of eroded land. The contribution of wind erosion to soil loss of the study regions located in the dry steppe zone is identified. It was established that the values of soil erosion rates obtained using the soil profile truncation method are in good agreement with the evaluation of soil erosion rates compiled during long-term monitoring of soil loss using runoff plots. Our rates of soil loss do not agree with recent estimates based on the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) for some administrative regions of European Russia with significant wind erosion.

TI  - Red Sea MODIS Estimates of Chlorophyll a and Phytoplankton Biomass Risks to Saudi Arabian Coastal Desalination Plants
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Harmful algal blooms (HABs) and the high biomass associated with them have afflicted marine desalination plants along coastal regions around the world. Few studies of HABs have been conducted in the Red Sea, where desalination plants along the Saudi Arabian Red Sea coast provide drinking water for millions of people. This study was conducted along the Saudi Arabian Red Sea coast from 2014 to 2015 to assess the potential for using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) remote sensing of chlorophyll a (Chl a) or fluorescence line height (FLH) to identify risks for biofouling at these desalination plants. Ship-based surveys of phytoplankton were conducted along the Saudi Arabian coastline offshore of desalination plants at Jeddah, Al Shoaibah and Al Qunfudhuh to assess the density of phytoplankton populations and identify any potential HAB species. Ship-based surveys showed low to moderate concentrations of phytoplankton, averaging from 1800-10,000 cells L-1 at Jeddah, 2000-11,000 cells L-1 at Al Shoaibah and 1000-20,500 cells L-1 at Al Qunfudhuh. Sixteen different species of potentially toxigenic HABs were identified through these surveys. There was a good relationship between ship-based total phytoplankton counts and monthly averaged coastal MODIS Chl a (R-2 = 0.49, root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.27 mg m(-3)) or FLH (R-2 = 0.47, RMSE = 0.04 mW m(-2) mu m(-1) sr(-1)) values. Monthly average near shore Chl a concentrations obtained using MODIS satellite imagery were much higher in the Red Sea coastal areas at Al Qunfudhuh (maximum of about 1.3 mg m(-3)) than at Jeddah or Al Shoaibah (maximum of about 0.4 and 0.5 mg m(-3), respectively). Chlorophyll a concentrations were generally highest from the months of December to March, producing higher risks of biofouling desalination plants than in other months. Concentrations decreased significantly, on average, from April to September. Long-term (2005-2016) monthly averaged MODIS Chl a values were used to delineate four statistically distinct zones of differing HAB biomass across the entire Red Sea. Sinusoidal functions representing monthly variability were fit to satellite Chl a values in each zone (RMSE values from 0.691 to 0.07 mg m(-3), from Zone 1 to 4). December to January mean values and annual amplitudes for Chl a in these four sinusoidal functions decreased from Zones 1-4. In general, the greatest risk of HABs to desalination occurs during winter months in Zone 1 (Southern Red Sea), while HAB risks to desalination plants in winter months are low to moderate in Zone 2 (South Central Red Sea), and negligible in Zones 3 (North Central) and 4 (Northern).

TI  - Approaches to the process of the survival and eradication of idolatries in the Jesuit missions of the Sierra del Nayar (1729-1764)
T2  - IHS ANTIGUOS JESUITAS EN IBEROAMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to carry out the Christian indoctrination of the "neophyte" Indians, the Jesuits of the missions established in the New World considered it necessary to eradicate those "pernicious" customs that went against the true faith. Considered as idolatrous or superstitious practices, they were inspired by the influence of the devil, and promoted by certain individuals who determined social cohesion in the daily life of small groups: sorcerers, healers and apostates. Between the years of 1722 and 1767, I would highlight the pastoral work in the last missionary complex established by the Mexican Province of the Society of Jesus: San Joseph del Gran Nayar, located in the territorial limits of the Kingdom of New Galicia, and inhabited by the cora group. In some Jesuit reports written between the years of 1729 and 1764, the missionaries recorded evidence about the permanence of the Cora worldview. The present article intends to analyze these documents to understand the Jesuit strategies in the process of extirpation of idolatries in the sierra del Nayar, as well as reviewing the survival of ancient beliefs among the reduced population.

TI  - A 25 year overview of the contaminant exposure and effects in Eurasian Eagle-owl (<i>Bubo bubo</i>) from southern Spain
T2  - Airo
M3  - Article
AB  - The Eurasian Eagle-owl (Bubo bubo) meets the requirements of a suitable sentinel species for biomonitoring environmental contaminants in Southeastern Spain (Murcia Region and Alicante Province). In this area, it is an abundant species, showing the highest breeding density within its distribution range. Since 1992, different sample types from free-living nestlings and adults (blood, feathers, unhatched eggs) or from injured individuals admitted in wildlife rehabilitation centres (blood, feathers, liver, kidney, brain and bones) were analysed for a wide range of pollutants (metals, organochlorine pesticides, anticoagulant rodenticides, neonicotinoid insecticides). Specific biomarkers (antioxidant molecules, lipid peroxidation, SALAD and blood clinical parameters) were analysed to perform risk assessment. As main findings, the patterns and concentrations of contaminants in Eurasian Eagle-owl samples reflected the contamination influenced by agriculture, an ancient mining site (AMS) and the use of anticoagulant rodenticides. In general, biomarkers were highly correlated to contaminants (i.e. delta-ALAD inhibition by lead, antioxidant enzymes inhibition by lead and cadmium, lipid peroxidation induction by mercury). Overall, we can confirm the suitability of the Eurasian Eagle-owl to biomonitor contaminants in our study area.

M3  - Article
AB  - In geosciences, satellite data are very important, where in-situ methods cannot be applicable. Especially the gravity data are very important for investigating the buried structures and discovering the changes of subterranean media alongside laterally. Nowadays, many global satellite models are used for solving these problems. The TOPEX V28.1 data set has a much more frequent sampling interval than other models. However, the TOPEX data set obtained in the general application is free air anomaly values. For this reason, researchers do not prefer TOPEX dataset for evaluation. In this study the target is using of TOPEX data set, which has a much more frequent sampling interval, to obtain Bouguer gravity values. These calculated new Bouguer gravity results have been compared with the results of the EGM08 and WGM2012 models to check coherence. The depth values which calculated by using the power spectrum method were investigated the findings have been compared with the result of the horizontal derivatives and finally findings of the general tectonic of the western Anatolian which obtained by using 3-D Euler depth solutions were discussed.

AB  - Urban river water bodies have multiple functions such as landscape, ecology, and shipping. With the improvement of people's living standards, the requirements for urban river water quality and water environment quality are gradually increasing. The traditional ground station sampling and analysis method will cost a lot of manpower and financial resources. Remote sensing technology has the advantages of macroscopic, periodic revisiting, low cost, diverse platforms, and rich data. UAV remote sensing data is suitable for rivers with a smaller width. The surface spectrometer is used to measure the spectral reflectance of the water surface and analyze and establish the relationship model between the spectral reflectance of the water surface and water quality. In Jiading District, Shanghai, as an application demonstration area, remote sensing measurement was carried out for the main water quality parameters and water quality types of the river. The remote sensing identification accuracy of typical water quality parameters was better than 70%, and two water quality parameters was better than 80%. The accuracy of remote sensing recognition of water quality type is better than 80%. The hyperspectral remote sensing technology can improve the frequency and efficiency of water quality monitoring. It can be used as an effective supplementary means for ground monitoring and provide continuous data support for long-term monitoring of river water quality.

TI  - Remote Sensing Monitoring of the Bottom Topography in a Shallow Reservoir and the Spatiotemporal Changes of Submerged Aquatic Vegetation Under Water Depth Fluctuations
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the growth and distribution of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) is crucial to the protection and restoration of the ecosystem of inland reservoirs. Considering the high sensitivity of SAV to water depth fluctuations in Guanting Reservoir, China, in this study, we realized the reconstruction of bottom topography by combining changing water level with a long time series remote sensing technology and explored the spatiotemporal succession law of SAV by analyzing the effect of water depth on the spatiotemporal distribution of SAV. Results of water depth spatial distribution in Guanting Reservoir were obtained by using water and land boundary lines to construct underwater terrain contours. The accuracy of estimated water depth data from remote sensing images was verified with measured water depth data, and the average relative error of water depth estimation results was about 0.25 m. The experimental results show that (1) the SWIR bands of Landsat images could avoid the interference of aquatic vegetation and realize the separation of land and water; and (2) after separating water area from land, an SWIR1_NIR index was used to effectively map SAV distribution in the reservoir. The results also indicate that the distribution of SAV in the reservoir is suitable for the water depth range of 0-2 m. Water depth fluctuations cause changes in the spatial distribution of suitable water depth. It is the main reason for the change of SAV distribution area in the reservoir during the past 20 years.

TI  - PERFORATIVE PERITONITIS IN NEWBORNS: INSTRUMENTAL AND MORPHOLOGICAL EXAMINATION FINDINGS.
T2  - Wiadomosci lekarskie (Warsaw, Poland : 1960)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim: To study and analyze the results of instrumental diagnostic measures and morphological verification of perforations of abdominal viscera in peritonitis in newborns, their importance in timely diagnosis, as well as to present authors' experience of examining newborns with PP, taking into account the complexity of diagnosis and treatment of these patients.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: The study is based on the results of examining 59 newborns with PP of various etiologies. Instrumental methods that were used in the diagnosis of PP and differential diagnosis of other emergencies involved the following: radiological examination (plain abdominal radiography), abdominal and retroperitoneal ultrasound, neurosonography, echocardiography, diagnostic abdominal paracentesis. Morphological verification of hollow viscus perforations was performed by methods of histologic examination in 54 newborns who underwent surgery.RESULTS: Results: It is emphasized that perforations in NEC and spontaneous gastrointestinal perforations have clinical and morphological differences. The analysis of morphological data showed absence of intestinal musculature or muscular wall defect in spontaneous gastrointestinal perforations. Perforations in NEC had massive gastric or bowel wall necrosis. Morphogenesis of gastrointestinal perforations in newborns is crucial for developing correct treatment strategy and choosing surgical approach.CONCLUSION: Conclusions: Diagnosis of PP in newborns should be comprehensive and include modern instrumental studies that enable to reliably establish the cause of peritonitis and indications for surgical treatment. Differential diagnosis of PP in newborns with other diseases aims to differentiate PP from a number of similar clinical symptoms of urgent conditions in order to conduct adequate preoperative preparation and appropriate surgery. Diagnostic markers of PP involve the following: pneumoperitoneum, free fluid in the abdomen, sentinel loop (intestinal distention), fixed bowel loop, cloudy brown or greenish intra-abdominal fluid with a large number of leukocytes and bacteria.

TI  - Spatial Impacts of Urban Growth on the Mersin, Tarsus, and Adana Lines
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY-COGRAFYA DERGISI
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in land covers and land use are increasing along with the growth of cities. Therefore, problems such as overconsumption and exploitation of natural resources, environmental pollution, and unplanned and improper use of the land because of occupation of the space by people and their activities in urban settlements, which have a dynamic and complex structure. This study aims to explore the urbanization line between Mersin, Tarsus, and Adana, which is one of Turkey's conurbations, to reveal the spatial changes in the context of land cover and use from 1989 to 2019; determine the direction of urban sprawl; and investigate the spatial dynamics causing these changes and conversions. In this study, six different Landsat satellite images from the last 30 years were classified using a supervised classification method, and then accuracy assessments were carried out. The results revealed that urban areas have been growing from their centers to peripheries, mainly northwards and along the linear line on the Mersin-Adana highway. Additionally, the urban areas had doubled their existing area with an increase of 16.782 hectares in the 30-year period between 1989 and 2019. The urban areas have been sprawling on agricultural lands and seminatural areas, and current projects indicate that more such areas will be destroyed in the future. All these are clear indicators of spatial consumption in the study area.

TI  - Influence of landscape attributes on forest patch occupancy and demography of Alouatta caraya in a fragmented landscape of northeastern Argentina
T2  - REVISTA MEXICANA DE BIODIVERSIDAD
M3  - Article
AB  - The northeast of the Argentinean Chaco Park constitutes the main habitat of the black and golden howler monkey, Alouatta caraya, and has the highest deforestation rate of the country, in the period 2007-2018 there was an annual loss of 7% in this region that corresponds to approximately 2,600,000 ha. We evaluate landscape attributes that can influence the use of forest patches and the demographic characteristics of A. caraya in a rural area of the Argentinean Chaco. We conducted monthly censuses from June 2017 to November 2018, and used geomatics tools and geographic data to perform spatial analyzes. The forest patches area was the only attribute positively related to their occupation by the howlers (p = 0.007). The mean group size (5.6 +/- 2.13 individuals) did not vary between large and small patches but the immature: adult female ratio of the groups was higher in the large patches (p = 0.024). This study provides evidence of the value of geomatic tools to assess landscape attributes that influence habitat occupancy in the primates from Argentina, contributing to the understanding of the important requirements to design conservation strategies.

T2  - Harvard Dataverse
M3  - Data study
C8  - 1
AB  - This dataset presents simulated Sentinel 2 L1C product that include methane plumes. The product name follows the Sentinel 2 L1C naming convention but the initial tag has been replaced by "S2A/B_MSICH4" and at the end the tag "_plumeX_QY" has been added. Here "X" is a number from 0 to 4 that refers to the 5 different plume shapes modeled and "Y" is the methane flux rate in kg/h. Simulations include two sites representative of heterogeneous and homogeneous conditions for the detection of methane emissions.  Kopeje (Turkmenistan) @ latlon= (38.49383, 54.19767)  Permian basin (USA) @ latlon= (31.72070, -102.28663) The NetCDF product includes the following fields: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Field name Datatype Size --------------- ------------ ------ S2TOA float32 ('xdim', 'ydim', 'num_bands') Sentinel 2 TOA radiance for the 13 bands at 20m spatial resolution for an area of 1500x1500m. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- lat float32 ('xdim', 'ydim') Latitude per pixel -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- lon float32 ('xdim', 'ydim') Longitude per pixel -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- xch4 float64 ('xdim', 'ydim') Methane enhancement used as an input.

It includes a short description of the methodology, validation and results using this dataset. A manuscript with the detailed methodology is under preparation. These initial products can be used to test your retrieval against the reference enhancement map. From this reference enhancement map, the IME can be also compared. A comparison against a Q reference value can be also obtained under some limitations. For that calculation you might need to set a value of U10 [m/s]. The suggested reference U10 is 3.5m/s. This value refers to the initial wind for the simulations. However, this value might present some variations once turbulence kicks off in the simulations. The geostrophic wind over the domain should remain around 3.5 m/s, but U10 can take different values at different locations/time. You can contact us for more information and, of course, let us know about your results.

TI  - Pathological Complete Response following Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Invasive Ductal Carcinoma with Mammary Paget's Disease: A Case Report
T2  - CASE REPORTS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mammary Paget's disease is a rare malignancy. Mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery has been considered as the standard treatment, while there have been few reports of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). A 53-year-old woman with erythema and skin ulceration of the left breast was admitted to our institution. Breast examinations revealed left invasive ductal carcinoma (cT1bN0M0, cStage I), and a punch biopsy of the left mammary erythema indicated Paget's disease (cTisN0M0, cStage0). The patient received NAC because of multiple lesions. Consequently, the breast tumor clinically disappeared, and the erythema improved. These outcomes made it easier to perform surgery (left mastectomy and sentinel node biopsy). Histopathological examination revealed no residual cancer cells in either the mammary gland or breast skin, and no metastasis was found in the sentinel lymph node. Therefore, NAC may be a useful treatment for mammary Paget's disease.

TI  - Freud and the Philosophy: precedents of a fundamental ambivalence
T2  - THEMATA-REVISTA DE FILOSOFIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The relationship of psychoanalysis with philosophy must consider Freud's own rejection of any attempt to reduce psychology to the knowledge of the phenomena of consciousness, which he early and insistently linked to the idealistic notion of "worldview" (Weltanschauung). However, a meticulous follow-up of the main philosophical trends that occurred in their context shows the true place of privilege that corresponds to philosophical thought in the face of the identity configuration of psychoanalysis as a discipline (and of its object of study: the unconscious), with its own epistemological framework that draws on the ideological confluence that scientist neopositivism established with Schopenhauer's philosophy.

TI  - <i>Mateo Simbana:</i> Identity and spirituality in Ecuadorian children's literature
T2  - CONTEXTO
M3  - Article
AB  - Teresa Crespo has been considered one of the pioneers of children's literature in Ecuador. Her story Mateo Simbana is one of her most emblematic texts. Considering literary texts for children as an aesthetic fact whose limits transcend the mere prescriptive purpose of these works (Subero; Delgado Santos), this article investigates the interrelation between the work as an artistic form and the representation of identity and spirituality within the framework of the functions attributed to children's literature in the enrichment of children's development (Colomer Martinez). It is concluded that the cultural socialization fostered by children's literature outlines, with a lyrical language and a solid narrative structure, the ethnic and spiritual commitment of an ancestral worldview which is part of an identity marked by the indigenous nature as well as by the mestizo one.

TI  - Using Sentinel-2 Images to Estimate Topography, Tidal-Stage Lags and Exposure Periods over Large Intertidal Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Intertidal areas provide key ecosystem services but are declining worldwide. Digital elevation models (DEMs) are important tools to monitor the evolution of such areas. In this study, we aim at (i) estimating the intertidal topography based on an established pixel-wise algorithm, from Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument scenes, (ii) implementing a set of procedures to improve the quality of such estimation, and (iii) estimating the exposure period of the intertidal area of the Bijagos Archipelago, Guinea-Bissau. We first propose a four-parameter logistic regression to estimate intertidal topography. Afterwards, we develop a novel method to estimate tide-stage lags in the area covered by a Sentinel-2 scene to correct for geographical bias in topographic estimation resulting from differences in water height within each image. Our method searches for the minimum differences in height estimates obtained from rising and ebbing tides separately, enabling the estimation of cotidal lines. Tidal-stage differences estimated closely matched those published by official authorities. We re-estimated pixel heights from which we produced a model of intertidal exposure period. We obtained a high correlation between predicted and in-situ measurements of exposure period. We highlight the importance of remote sensing to deliver large-scale intertidal DEM and tide-stage data, with relevance for coastal safety, ecology and biodiversity conservation.

TI  - Polyphony, Historicism and Relativism: Russian Philosophy and Contemporary Analytical Political Philosophy
T2  - VOPROSY FILOSOFII
M3  - Article
AB  - This article is a study of the main directions of the contemporary analytical political philosophy in the context of the idea of polyphony (pluralism) and related problems of historicism and relativism. This approach, on the one hand, solves the problem of embedding Russian philosophy into the global semantic context, on the other, it allows to identify the philosophical foundations of Western liberal theories of the second half of the twentieth century, the main metaphysical assumption of which is diversity. The article analyzes the commonality of worldview positions of the key directions of the analytical political philosophy and the Russian philosophical tradition. It is shown how the combination of Western and domestic conceptual attitudes allows representatives of modern philosophy to understand traditional socio-philosophical problems in a new way: rational disagreement, pluralism of values, the problem of manipulation, the basis of moral judgments, the problem of political justification and consent. J. Gray's concept of 'temporary agreement' is analyzed in the context of polyphony and pluralism. The impact of antinomianism of the Russian thought on the neo-Hobbesians D. Gauthier and K. Baier is examined. The main points of the concepts of 'collective rationality' by C. McMahon, D. Schmidtz, J. Waldron, P. Pettit, and S. Hurley are revealed in the context of the problem of intersubjectivity (M. Bakhtin). J. Habermas's political and philosophical ideas - public discourse, justification, and deliberation - are studied in the context of the value conflict problem. A comparative analysis of the 'public justification' (G. Gaus), of the `objective horizon of values' (I. Berlin), of the concept of 'Other' (Bakhtin) is conducted. In the context of historicism, which is expressed in the understanding of the man as a historical, self-creating being, whose needs changed along with changes in self-consciousness, the author analyzes the relationship among A. Kojeve's, M. Bakhtin's, I. Berlin's ideas, deliberative democracy and justifiable liberalism. Historicism manifests itself in a constant conversation with a personified addressee or 'second subject' within which the ideas of the historian of philosophy and the positions of the political philosopher are formulated.

AB  - Reconciling biodiversity conservation with increasing demand for agricultural production is a major challenge. A long-running discourse that addresses this challenge is the land-sparing vs land-sharing debate. However, the land-sparing vs land-sharing framework has also been criticized for favouring a dichotomous worldview, which contradicts the real-world complexity of agricultural landscapes. Here, we review land-sparing and land-sharing measures with a focus on European landscapes. Land-sparing is needed to preserve the last of Europe's wilderness (2.2% of the land) but will fail to conserve traditional agroecosystems and a wealth of synanthropic species with a long-history of human land-use influence. This is why land sparing should be combined with wildlife-friendly land-sharing practices needed for the preservation of these low-intensity agroecosystems, including European High Nature Value Farmland (15-25% of the land), which is of outstanding conservation value. By promoting generalist species associated with wildlife-friendly farming, land-sharing also enhances ecosystem services provision to agriculture, including pollination and biological pest control. Current land-sharing practices cover multiple spatial scales from local (e.g. wildflower strips) to field (e.g. organic farming) to landscape scale (e.g. diversified farming systems). In addition, productivity outcomes of land-sharing vary greatly, fromcomparatively high productivity (e.g. pastures for organic production) to agroecosystems that no longer provide any economic returns and are managed mostly for conservation purposes (e.g. dry grasslands). From an economic point of view, the latter may even be defined as land-sparing, highlighting that land-sparing and land-sharing sensu stricto are merely the endpoints of a spare-share continuum of the many agricultural practices in European landscapes. The best biodiversity outcomes and potentially smallest ecological-economic trade-offs result from landscape management that combines measures like agri-environment schemes and organic farming with small field sizes and high crop diversity to enhance spatial and temporal resource complementarity for associated species. Despite increasing progress towards win-win solutions, biodiversity-productivity trade-offs remain widespread, nonetheless. Multifunctional landscapes should therefore include elements from both land-sparing (e.g. natural ecosystems, intensively managed arable fields) and land-sharing (e.g. organic agriculture, agri-environment schemes) to halt declines of farmland biodiversity under increasing agricultural demand. Landscape heterogeneity is key to facilitate landscape connectivity, to avoid species extinctions in spared natural habitats and to promote spill-over of organisms and ecosystem services from shared landscape elements to agricultural land. To halt ongoing losses of farmland biodiversity and to promote sustainable multifunctional landscapes, the post-2020 Common Agricultural Policy of the European Union should better reflect the need for agricultural diversification, sustainable agricultural practices and greater landscape heterogeneity.

AB  - The purpose of the study is to identify the features of the relationship between the potential readiness of future teachers for lifelong education and the level of development of meta-competence and to develop recommendations on this basis for creating conditions in the university for the development of students' meta-cognitive abilities. Research methods and materials. The study involved 748 students enrolled in teacher education programs. Studied: the level of formation of future teachers of psychological, strategic and competence-based readiness for lifelong education (questionnaire survey); the level of development of their worldview ("Methodology of worldview activity" by D.A. Leontyev, A.N. Ilchenko), intellectual ("Mental performance and the type of intelligence" by B.N. Ryzhov), cognitive ("Methodology for assessing the systemic nature of thinking" I.A. Sychev) and operational-procedural (methods for identifying the level of formation of mental operations (methods for identifying the ability to analyze, compare, generalize and classify) components of metacompetence. Comparative (chi-square test, Student's t-test) and correlation (Spearman's correlation coefficient ) analyzes. Results. A close relationship was revealed between the indicators of the potential readiness of future teachers for lifelong pedagogical education and individual components of metacompetence, characteristics of students' worldview, their intelligence and cognitive abilities. Conclusion. The results of the study suggest that the formation of future teachers' readiness for lifelong education should be based not only and not so much on stimulating their motivational activity, but also on creating conditions for the development of their worldview, intelligence, systemic, creative thinking and general cognitive abilities.

TI  - SURGICAL TREATMENT FOR BREAST CANCER AND AXILLARY METASTASES: HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
T2  - ACTA MEDICO-HISTORICA ADRIATICA
M3  - Review
AB  - Breast cancer (BC) is the most common malignancy to affect females. The first suggestions of BC and its treatment date back to Ancient Egypt, 1500-1600 B.C. Throughout history, the management of BC has evolved from extensive radical mastectomy towards less invasive treatments. Radical mastectomy was introduced by W.S. Halsted in 1894, involving the resection of the breast, regional lymph nodes, pectoralis major and minor. Despite its mutilating effect, it had been the main surgical approach to BC patients until 1948, when Patey and Dyson proposed its modified form that conserved pectoralis major and minor and the level III of axillary lymph nodes. The latter was associated with less postoperative morbidity and improved quality of life. The idea of limited breast tissue resection was introduced in the 1970s by Umberto Veronesi and led to further minimizations of surgery in BC patients until breast conservation became the standard of care for early-stage disease. In the 1990s, intra- operative lymphatic mapping and the concept of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy (SLNB) have been developed. SLNB has replaced axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) to be the standard procedure for axillary staging in patients with clinically node-negative BC. Many women have since been spared ALND, including those with negative SLNB or with SLNs involved with micrometastases (0.2-2 mm in size). In the last decade, evidence gathered from new clinical trials suggests that ALND may be safely omitted even in BC patients with I or 2 positive SLNs if adjuvant radiotherapy is delivered.

TI  - Epidemiology of varicella among immigrants and non-immigrants in Quebec, Canada, before and after the introduction of childhood varicella vaccination: a retrospective cohort study
T2  - LANCET INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Many immigrants are susceptible to varicella on arrival to Canada because of different transmission dynamics in their countries of origin and scarcity of vaccination. Universal childhood vaccination programmes decrease varicella incidence rates through herd immunity, but the accumulating number of susceptible adult immigrants could remain at risk for severe varicella. Our aim was to describe the epidemiology of varicella among immigrants and non-immigrants before and after childhood varicella vaccination.Methods We did a population-based, retrospective cohort study of all varicella cases in Quebec, Canada, diagnosed between 1996 and 2014 in administrative health databases linked to immigration data. Cases of varicella met diagnostic codes in the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth Revision Canadian modifications. Cases with a co-occurring zoster diagnostic code and immigrants from Australia, New Zealand, the USA, and western European countries were excluded. Vaccination periods included pre-vaccination (1996-98), private vaccination (1999-2005), and public vaccination (2006-14). Incidence rate and comparative rate ratios were estimated using census data.Findings A total of 231 339 varicella cases diagnosed between Jan 1, 1996, and Dec 31, 2014, were linked to 1 115 696 immigrants who arrived between Jan 1, 1980, and Dec 31, 2014. 1444 herpes zoster cases and 1276 immigrants from Australia, western Europe, New Zealand, and the USA were excluded. Among 228 619 varicella cases, 13 315 (5.8%) occurred in immigrants. In pre-vaccination versus public vaccination periods, varicella incidence declined in immigrants by 87% (95% CI 86.6-87.9; 324.3 cases per 100 000 person-years to 40.9 cases per 100 000 person-years) and in non-immigrants by 93% (92.4-92.7; 484 cases per 100 000 person-years to 36 cases per 100 000 person-years). Mean age at diagnosis increased in both groups (15.1 vs 19.4 years in immigrants and 8.4 vs 12.0 years in nonimmigrants). In the public vaccination period, immigrants younger than 50 years had higher varicella rates than nonimmigrants, with relative risk ranging from 1.53 (95% CI 1.37-1.72) to 4.64 (3.90-5.53) with the highest risk in adolescents and young adults, and people from Latin America and the Caribbean (age-specific incidence rate ratio [aIRR](I-NI) pre-vaccination 2.19 and post-vaccination aIRR(I-NI) 6.07) and south Asia (aIRR(I-NI) pre-vaccination 3.41 and aIRR(I-NI) post-vaccination 4.46) and in childbearing women (15-40 years; IRRI-NI 2.48).Interpretation Immigrant adolescents, young adults, and women of childbearing age had higher age-standardised rates of varicella than non-immigrants, with increasing disparities following vaccine introduction. Immigrants younger than 50 years of age would benefit from targeted vaccination upon arrival to host countries. Copyright (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Speaking with an Upside-Down Tongue: Reflections on Human-Elephant Multispecies Culture in Northern Thailand.
T2  - Gajah
M3  - Article
AB  - In Karen villages in northern Thailand, humans often coexist with captive wild Asian elephants, in what can be described as a multispecies culture. A variety of ethnographic data is presented here as evidence of this culture, including an elephant origin story, rituals performed throughout elephant lives, and associated beliefs and practices. Together these rituals and beliefs mediate and define the human-elephant relationship. This relationship exists not only on physical, intellectual and emotional levels, but also within the spiritual worldview of Karen people. In this worldview, elephants are entangled in the same complex relations with spirits, both within their bodies and within the landscape in which they live, that influence Karen human lives. The shared life between humans, elephants and spirits can be understood as a form of multispecies culture resulting from a long process of cultural co-evolution.

TI  - Ownership Patterns Drive Multi-Scale Forest Structure Patterns across a Forested Region in Southern Coastal Oregon, USA
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Research Highlights: We used airborne lidar to assess the multi-scalar patterns of forest structure across a large (471,000 hectare), multi-owner landscape of the Oregon Coast Range, USA. The results of this study can be used in the development and evaluation of conservation strategies focused on forest management. Background and Objectives: Human management practices reflect policy and economic decisions and shape forest structure through direct management and modification of disturbance regimes. Previous studies have found that land ownership affects forest cover, patch dynamics, structure, and ecosystem function and services. However, prior assessments of forest structure across landscapes and ownerships have been limited by a lack of high-fidelity forest structure measurements across a large spatial extent. We addressed three research questions: (1) What distinct classes of forest structure exist across our study area? (2) How does the distribution and pattern of forest structure vary among types of owners at scales of patches, ownership types, and subregion, and is this independent of property size? and (3) What implications do the fine and sub-regional scale patterns have for landscape configuration goals under recent updates to the Northwest Forest Plan? Materials and Methods: We examined forest structure patterns by identifying six statistically distinct classes of forest structure and then examining their distribution across and within ownership types. We used these structure classes to examine their area within each ownership class, mean patch size, and intermixing at multiple scales. Results and Conclusion: We found that the six different forest structure classes in the study area can be interpreted as two assemblages: production-style forests, principally on private lands, and structurally complex forests, principally on public lands. We found that land ownership objectives resulted in distinct landscape patterns of forest structure as measured by mean structure class patch size and intermixing of different structure class patches. Finally, we found that forest structure differed between public and private lands but differed comparatively little among ownership types within those two broad categories.

T2  - COMPTES RENDUS DE L ACADEMIE BULGARE DES SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study is related to elucidating the remote sensing monitoring and capabilities for profiling to particulate matter (PM) mass concentration control in the lowest atmospheric layers. The PM was studied at a distance of 5.5 km from the LIDAR station. The experiments were conducted in May and October 2020 in the South-Eastern part of the Bulgarian capital Sofia during a COVID-19 lockdown. The LIDAR measurement data was compared during the experiments with in situ sampling by mobile devices located just below the spot of the LIDAR beam: (i) Absorber collects particles higher then 3 mu m; (ii) PM Microcollector type SDS 011; and (iii) Andersen Cascade Impactor for exploring PM size distribution and microbiota. The results obtained show that remote sensing can be very effective when quantitative evaluation has been combined with in situ sampling for PM qualitative assessment.

TI  - Studying the Social History of a Russian Microregion, Based on Historical Maps and Aerial Survey
T2  - VESTNIK SANKT-PETERBURGSKOGO UNIVERSITETA-ISTORIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study focused on a Russian agrarian microregion (12.5 km(2)) situated in a forest steppe area (in Tambov Oblast) during the 18th-19th centuries. The research illuminates the mechanisms, patterns, and impact that the environment has on social processes, and vice versa the human impact on the environment (and particularly on landscape). The authors created a geographic information system which they used to compare the results of aerial survey and satellite imagery, with historical maps and other sources, including archival documents. Morphological anomalies were identified on an orthophotomap, and then interpreted. The conclusions of the research concern the nature of interaction between the agrarian society and the environment. Settlement in the plains of the forest steppe was heavily dependent on the water regime, which directly affected the condition and dynamics of communication routes and economic infrastructure. The vanished settlement found in this study is an example of such an effect: it grew up along a road and was abandoned when the areas through which the road ran were waterlogged. Plain rivers can alter the surrounding landscape quite drastically over relatively short historical periods, and are themselves subject to anthropogenic influence. Changes in living conditions and economic management led to variability in settlement patterns and land use. This can be seen especially well in the lowland, where such schemes were predominantly temporary. The processing of Earth remote sensing data makes it possible to fill gaps in sources and discover new evidence of the past.

TI  - Socio-ecological change in the Ruvu Estuary in Tanzania, inferred from land-use and land-cover (LULC) analysis and estuarine fisheries
T2  - Western Indian Ocean Journal of Marine Science
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem goods and services derived from estuaries have sustained coastal livelihoods in the Western Indian Ocean (WIO) region throughout recorded history. Estuaries provide fertile and seasonally irrigated space for planting crops, mangrove products for construction and fuel, and fish as a protein source. Human population growth and an escalating demand for natural resources threaten estuarine critical habitats and their functioning, exacerbated by the effects of climate change. Decadal and seasonal land-use and land-cover (LULC) changes in the Ruvu Estuary in Tanzania were investigated through analysis of Landsat 5/8 and Sentinel-2 satellite images. The estuary is riv- er-dominated and truncated near the coast during high river flow, with tidal influence extending approximately 12 km upstream during low river flow. LULC change detection targeting nine classes (water, developed, barren, forest, grasslands, cultivated, mangroves, wetlands and mudflats) showed that estuary-associated wetlands and mangroves had declined significantly over the past two decades (1995-2016) making way for developed land (growth of Bag- amoyo Town), cultivated land (agricultural expansion with increasing population) and grasslands (coastal habitat changes). Seasonal LULC changes were conversion of wetlands to cultivated land after the wet season, and transfor- mation of fallow wetlands to grasslands. The estuarine fishery relied on a small number of mainly freshwater and marine migrant species, compared to a highly diverse mix of mainly marine species in the nearby coastal fishery. The sparsity of quantitative fisheries data, spectral confusion when modelling land-cover change, and absence of household survey data to assess livelihood activities remain major information gaps. Generalized recommendations for improving socio-ecological change studies in WIO estuarine systems are provided.

TI  - REFORMATION DOCTRINE AND POLITICAL VALUES: HISTORICAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL ANALYSIS (On the example of late protestantism in Ukraine)
T2  - SKHIDNOIEVROPEISKYI ISTORYCHNYI VISNYK-EAST EUROPEAN HISTORICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose the research is to determine the characteristics of political ethics in the reformation doctrine using the example of late Protestantism history in Ukraine. The research methodology is based on: general scientific methods (analytical, synthetic, paradigmatic, holistic), general historical (system chronological, historical and comparative), sociological method (content analysis). The scientific novelty consists in the fact that for the first time there has been made the attempt of a comprehensive analysis of the external factors influence on the political ethics of Protestants on the history example of the Protestantism in Ukraine during the 20th - beginning of the 21st century in modern Ukrainian historiography and philosophical science. The Conclusions. The Reformation Doctrine was formed 500 years ago. It passed the test of time during this period. Having examined political ethics as a separate component of the doctrine, the authors of the article came to the conclusion that its key points were formed during the period of early Protestantism and have remained unchanged up to this day. Expressive specificity is the reaction to the historical conditions of existence and demonstration of ethno-confessional differences. Genesis of Protestants in Soviet Ukraine is an example. Referring to the biblical thesis "All authority comes from God", the Protestants accepted all the slogans of the Soviet power. At their congresses, they even approved a military service. Afterwards the atheistic experiment in the Ukrainian SSR gained momentum and the representatives of theomachistic authorities resorted to repressions, in the society with a dominant hostile worldview believers tried to use various survival strategies starting with the insistent demands of communities registration ending with sit-in strikes and emigration attempts to "any non-socialist country". The Christians came to the conclusion that power from God also serves a good cause. The Protestants in modern Ukraine entered a political life slowly. Evangelical Christians most clearly demonstrate solidarity with public sentiments (participation in the Orange Revolution, the Revolution of Dignity, chaplaincy service). In the modern Protestant milieu, a blind submission to any authority is questioned therefore changes are made to pacifist sentiments and prerequisites for the formation of socio-political theology arise. Of particular values are the categories of truth, freedom and responsibility (which is the manifestation of ethno-confessional differences), and non-cult services are organized in compliance with orthodoxy and orthopraxy.

TI  - "Refugees" as a Misnomer: The Parochial Politics and Official Discourse of the Visegrad Four
T2  - POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Attitudes towards migrants and refugees are created and reflected at the level of public policies, as well as in local communities which cultivate traditional approaches and a specific worldview. The refugee crisis in Europe in the mid-2010s showed how public opinion translated into voting behaviour and became a source of strength for nationalist anti-immigrant movements and parties across the continent. East-Central Europe was no exception, regardless of the absence of a long-term, massive inflow of refugees. Nevertheless, the migration crisis created a new political narrative which exploited deeply rooted resentments, complexes, and fears. This article aims to analyse the official policy responses to the refugee crisis in the four East-Central European countries: Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic, which together constitute the so-called Visegrad Four. It puts the emphasis on the discriminatory practice of misnaming the refugees, which became deeply anchored in the political discourse of these countries. Based on a qualitative content analysis supplemented by the findings of public opinion polls, the argument developed in the article is that reluctant and defensive attitudes towards the refugees have been determined by the revival of parochialism as a radical reaction to the challenges of global trends and supra-local processes. The theoretical framing of the refugee problem is built on politicization, in connection with the concept of parochialism, seen from political and social perspectives, and the meaning of the use of the misnomer as a policy instrument. The article concludes that the migration crisis petrified traditional cleavages at the supra-local level, reinforcing simultaneously the sense of parochial altruism and hostility towards "the other."

TI  - Language as an Accumulator and a Form of Culture Representation
T2  - LOGOS-VILNIUS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyses the dependency of language development on changes in the spiritual and material culture of the people which is in constant motion and self-affirmation. It also regulates social experience by carrying an echo of the past and forming the future worldview of its carrier. The study emphasizes that every national culture is developed according to the laws of diffusion and convergence. These laws allow the culture to share its achievements with other peoples and create spontaneously and independently of them. Language accumulates the achievements of different spheres of a people's culture in their complex and interconnected modes. The dependence of the dynamics of the lexicon on changes in material and spiritual culture is obvious. It may lead to the erroneous generalization that any changes in extralingual reality cause changes in language. However, the culture is not fully verbalized. There are small fragments of culture that are not nominated in language, i.e. part of the practical and intellectual heritage of the individual is represented outside the verbalization, because it has not become a collective experience or those fragments of collective experience have not become relevant to society.The many details of extralinguistic reality accurately provide a basis for a linguistic analysis of the composition, semantic structure of language vocabulary. The markers of extralinguistic reality are the changes in cultural dominants.

TI  - THE CONCEPT OF DEMOCRACY AND ITS PROFILING IN GERMAN AND POLISH: A CONTRASTIVE ANALYSIS
T2  - ROCZNIKI HUMANISTYCZNE
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this paper is a contrastive analysis of the concept of 'democracy' in the German and Polish languages, along with a presentation of the modes of its conceptualisation in modem Polish and German public discourse. The methodological basis is provided by the assumptions of the Lublin school of cognitive ethnolinguistics. The linguistic materials derive from three types of sources: dictionaries of the German and Polish languages, empirical surveys and press texts. Based on these, a set of basic definition features were defined in the understanding of 'democracy' (the so-called "set of basic features") common for various discourses in both languages. The sets of features assigned to 'democracy' on the basis of specialist discourses, diverse both ideologically and with respect to their worldview, were listed. The profiling of the concept of 'democracy' was outlined on the basis of texts derived from both the German and Polish press with liberal-conservative and leftist-liberal profiles.

TI  - Long-term outcomes of individualized management after sentinel lymph-node biopsy for vulvar cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The management for patients with vulvar cancer after sentinel lymph-node biopsy (SLNB) remains controversial. The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term outcomes of individualized management after SLNB for early stage vulvar cancer. Methods The medical records of patients with vulvar cancer treated by surgery involving SLNB between 2004 and 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. During this period, the inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy (IL) were performed with individualized strategy, while the postoperative intensity-modulated radiotherapy was planned with a consistent policy. Results We identified 138 patients with at least one sentinel node detected, of whom 64 underwent further IL while 74 had SLNB only. Nodal metastases (pN+) were confirmed in 22 patients with IL and 16 without. Radiotherapy was scheduled with the dose of 60-70 Gy for all pN+ patients and finally completed in 15 with IL and 15 without. The median follow-up time was 56 months (6-156 months). Recurrence was observed in 24 patients, of whom 10 were pN- at primary treatment. The 3-year overall survival (OS) was 97.2, 95.2, 68.3, and 71.8%; 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 94.5, 91.4, 60.2, and 59.2%, respectively, for patients with pN- and IL, pN- and SLNB, pN+ and IL, and pN+ and SLNB. Neither OS nor DFS showed significant difference between SLNB and IL in pN- (P = 0.564 for OS, P = 0.423 for DFS), or pN + patients (P = 0.920 for OS, P = 0.862 for DFS). Conclusions With appropriate adjuvant radiotherapy, SLNB alone provided similar long-term survival compared with IL for both patients with and without sentinel node metastasis.

TI  - Areal Extent, Species Composition, and Spatial Distribution of Coastal Saltmarshes in China
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal saltmarshes are key ecosystems with important ecological functions. Yet, they have experienced a widespread decline. Due to their importance, the conservation and restoration of saltmarshes are globally shared objectives, including China. Despite multiple local studies, nationwide information about saltmarshes in China is scarce. Thus, we used remote sensing to delineate the spatial distribution and areal extent of saltmarshes along coastal China and resolve their species composition. By interpreting 10 m spatial resolution Sentinel-2 images on Google Earth Engine, assisted with field survey and literature search, a total of 118 010 ha of saltmarshes were delineated in coastal China in 2019. Seven typical saltmarsh species were identified, with Phragmites australis, Spartina alterniflora, and Scirpus mariquater as dominant species, accounting for 95.5% of total saltmarsh extent, while Suaeda salsa, Tamarix chinensis, Cyperus malaccensis, and Sesuvium portulacastrum were present in limited abundance. The P. australis and exotic species S. alterniflora grow along almost all coastal provinces, but P. australis dominates in the north while S. alterniflora dominates in the middle part of coastal China. Suaeda salsa occurs mainly in the north and has suffered large losses. Tamarix chinensis is abundant in Shandong province, S. mariquater in the Yangtze River delta, C. malaccensis in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, and S. portulacastrum in Taiwan. The exotic species S. alterniflora expanded extensively along the coast and its expansion rate continues to increase. The results provided conform a much-needed baseline for future monitoring efforts and the assessment of progress in the conservation and restoration projects toward recovering saltmarshes in China.

TI  - REVIVIFICATION MECHANISM OF ANCIENT LANDSLIDES IN XIAONANGOU BASIN, YAN'AN
T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Yan'an, Shaanxi Province is located in the middle reaches of the Yellow River. Its unique landform and fragile ecological environment lead to frequent landslide disasters. Due to the shortage of land resources in the city, people developed a large number of basins in the expansion of urban space, inducing the revivification of many ancient landslides. Since ancient landslide revivification poses a threat to soil and water conservation, ecological environment, engineering construction, human settlements and property safety, it is very important to study the resurrection mechanism. This paper uses such methods as geological survey, geological mapping and geotechnical exploration to obtain the ancient landslide boundaries, stratigraphic lithology and basin DEM, and finds on this basis that the water content in the ancient landslide and the soil shear strength increase with depth, and the soil shear strength near the sliding plane decreases to a certain extent. The processing of remote sensing data of vegetation in the study area and the long-term monitoring of sedimentation and rainfall in the field show that rainfall affects the coverage of vegetation, and the revivification degree of ancient landslides is different due to different vegetation coverage. Finally, according to the revivification factors of ancient landslides in the basin and the results of laboratory tests, the author puts forward the revivification mechanism of ancient landslides in the basin. This paper can offer a view on how to deal with ancient landslide revivification from the perspective of basins.

TI  - Transcendentalist Encounters with a Universe of Signs
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMIOTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This essay aims to identify a semiotic consciousness found in New England Transcendentalism, consisting of the worldview that signs are pervasively present throughout nature and society. It finds that this worldview exists as a historical strand of thought stretching through the 19th century and, ultimately, further beyond, thereby making up an early movement in American semiotics. In this context, I furthermore see Transcendentalist thought informing the backdrop of Charles Peirce's groundbreaking theory of signs later in the century, especially his metaphysical claims about a "universe... perfused with signs"1 (1906: EP 2.394). In order to bring into full view the presence of a semiotic consciousness in Transcendentalism, I first address the intellectual history and genealogical roots that helped shape the minds of the Transcendentalists. Relevant influences include those both local to New England and imported from abroad, in particular the theologies of Jonathan Edwards and of Emanuel Swedenborg. Next, I directly examine the ideas of the figurehead of the Transcendentalist movement, Ralph Waldo Emerson, together with his Concord peers, Amos Bronson Alcott and Henry David Thoreau. Taking them as my case studies, I track the different ways a like-minded interest in signs takes shape within their individual projects. Focusing on their descriptions of nature, we find it in their experiences of the natural environment, their understanding of phenomena as representational and poetic, and their belief in the dialogical sharing of ideas across minds and species. Along the way, I further work out some of the aspects of a general theory of signs identifiable within the Transcendentalist perspective, as well as distinguish it from other theoretical alternatives. Ultimately, I contend that the Transcendentalists held a similar idea of nature existing as a sign representing deep and varied meanings.

TI  - Retrospective Evaluation of Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses Surveillance Data Between 2016-2018 in Samsun Public Health Laboratory
T2  - FLORA INFEKSIYON HASTALIKLARI VE KLINIK MIKROBIYOLOJI DERGISI
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the sentinel and nonsentinel surveillance data of respiratory track viruses determined by the Samsun Public Health Laboratory during the 2016, 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 flu seasons.Materials and Methods: Samsun Public Health Laboratory collected nasal and nasopharyngeal samples from the following sources: designated family medicine practitioners (within the scope of influenza-like illness [ILI] surveillance), selected hospitals (within the scope of severe acute respiratory illness [SARI] surveillance), and other sources that provided nonsentinel specimens. Viral agents were identified via real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).Results: A total of 2867 ILI specimens and 3189 SARI specimens (from sentinel and nonsentinel sites) were collected and assessed. In 2016, 648 samples were tested positive, 542 were influenza A (187 H3N2 and 355 H1N1 - three were accompanied by influenza B), and 106 were influenza B. In 2016-2017, 180 samples were positive: 139 were influenza A (all H3N2) and 41 were influenza B. In 2017-2018, 290 samples were positive for influenza, 150 for influenza A (15 H3N2 and 135 H1N1 - two of which were accompanied by influenza B) and 140 for influenza B. Overall, influenza A H1N1 was identified as the most common respiratory virus in all ages during the 3 years of surveillance, with 417 positive results. The second most common virus, especially in the early childhood period, was the Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) which was identified in 323 specimens.Conclusion: In general, although the results of ILI and SARI surveillance performed at regional level are parallel to the country and world data, there may be differences. This study determined that circulating virus distribution and seasonal peak may differ slightly. We believe that regional surveillance studies are essential in taking early andnecessary measures to fight against influenza.

TI  - Synergistic use of ASTER, L-band ALOS PALSAR, and hyperspectral AVIRIS-NG data for exploration of lode type gold deposit - A study in Hutti Maski Schist Belt, India
T2  - ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we have explored the utility of advanced hyperspectral, dual-polarized microwave, and advanced multispectral data to delineate potential areas of mineralization associated with the lode type gold deposit in Hutti-Maski Schist Belt Karnataka, India. We derived different image-enhanced products using visible-near-infrared (VNIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectral bands of the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) sensor to delineate major rock types of gold-bearing green-stone belt such as metabasalt, amphibolite, younger alkali feldspar rich granite, granodiorite, and tonalitic-granodioric gneiss (TTG). The principal component (PC) image composite of ASTER VNIR-SWIR bands was not only used to distinguish different granitoids but also confirmed their sharp instructive nature of contact with the greenstone rocks. We also used an index image composite using ASTER SWIR bands to discriminate granitoid, basalt and amphibolite. We could demarcate few lineaments extending through the mineralized zone (e.g., Hutti, Heera-Buddine mines, etc.) using the fused products of ASTER and two polarization channels of the Phased-array L band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) sensor of the Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS). All these image-enhanced products are validated using the reference geological map of the study area and field data collected along selected field -traverses. The mineralogical and petrographical data of the altered rocks from the study site revealed the formation of calcite, scapolite, and other minerals. Represenattive reflectance spectrum of the altered rock was used to spatially delineate the surface distribution of the patchy and small alteration zones using airborne hyperspectral data of the Advanced Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG) sensor. In this regard, a unified spectral map of altered rocks was derived by integrating two alteration maps prepared independently using two different partial sub-pixel algorithms (constrained energy minimization and matched filtering). Occurrences of altered rocks in the vicinity to favorable geological lineaments and their spatial proximity to metavolcanic-younger felsic intrusive contacts suggest their importance as the potential sites for detailed exploration.

T2  - ECOSYSTEM HEALTH AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a significant component of the ecological health of any city and the LST is closely related to the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The present study evaluates the seasonal variability of the relationship of LST with NDVI by using a large dataset of Landsat sensors for different seasons from 1991-92 to 2018-19. Pearson's correlation coefficient technique was used to obtain the LST-NDVI relationship. The study also compares the ecological and thermal status of the city by applying the urban thermal field variance index (UTFVI). The results found that the mean LST increased considerably. The post-monsoon season produces the best correlation (-0.59), followed by the monsoon season (-0.53), pre-monsoon season (-0.45), and winter season (-0.22). Apart from this relationship, the ecological status of the city has also been estimated. Almost an equal portion of lands are under the excellent and worst categories of ecological condition. This study is beneficial for future ecological planning in any tropical city.

T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyzes the long-term monthly variation of land surface temperature (LST) and its relationship with normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), and normalized difference bareness index (NDBaI) in the Raipur City of India using one hundred and twenty-three Landsat images from 1988-2020. In terms of LST, the warmest month is April (38.49(o)C) and the coldest month is January (23.04(o)C). The standard deviation in LST is noticed as 1.1022(o)C throughout the period. The growth pattern of LST is increasing in the earlier stage while it is steady and decreasing in the later stage. The mean linear regression coefficients for LST-NDVI is -0.42, LST-NDBI are 0.68, LST-NDWI is 0.27, and LST-NDBaI is 0.32. It indicates that the high ratio of green vegetation and water bodies resist the raise of LST, whereas the bare rock surface and built-up land accelerate the LST. The value of the spectral indices and LST varies with the change of month due to the physical change of the land surface materials. Hence, the study will be an effective one for the town and country planners for their future estimation of land conversion.

The results show that a monthly variation is observed in the mean LST. The highest mean LST is found in April (38.79 degrees C), followed by May (36.64 degrees C), June (34.56 degrees C), and March (32.11 degrees C). The lowest mean LST is observed in January (23.01 degrees C), followed by December (23.76 degrees C), and November (25.83 degrees C). A moderate range of mean LST is noticed in September (27.18 degrees C), October (27.22 degrees C), and February (27.88 degrees C). Pearson's linear correlation method is used to correlate LST with NDVI. The LST-NDVI correlation is strong negative in October (-0.62), September (-0.55), and April (-0.51). The moderate negative correlation is developed in March (-0.40), May (-0.44), June (-0.47), and November (-0.39). A weak negative correlation is observed in December (-0.21), January (-0.24), and February (-0.29). The change in weather elements and variation in land surface characteristics contribute to the monthly fluctuation of mean LST and LST-NDVI correlation. The study will be an effective one for the town and country planners for their future estimation of land conversion.

AB  - With the Renaissance, philosophers and humanists were keen to establish a worldview based on individual needs and stimulated maritime expansion. At the end of the 15th century, navigators and explorers ushered the Age of Sail with the development of geography, astronomy and navigation, and numerous chronicles were produced entering the Age of the Maritime Discoveries. Chroniclers tried to capture and depict ‘everything’ about America in their writings. Therefore, it is very important to understand through these chronicles the ‘reality’ captured by the Europeans of that time, as well as their perspectives, evaluations and desires, in regards to said continent. In particular, Christopher Columbus’s Diario de a bordo, which can be said to be the first chronicle of America, contains the first official ‘interpretation’ of the Americas by Europeans. This paper will examine, by analyzing the contents of Diario de a bordo, how Christopher Columbus observed and understood nature in America and how he reported it to the Spanish royal family, as well as the captured usefulness and value attributed on things of nature therein. In addition, we will examine the colonial desires of the Europeans for the nature of America and the meaning of their search for realizing those desires.

TI  - Infectious Diseases of Eastern Spotted Skunks (<i>Spilogale putorius</i>) within a One Health Framework
T2  - SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST
M3  - Article
AB  - Owing to their omnivorous diet, den-site habits, foraging activities, mating behaviors, and other pertinent habitat-use and natural-history traits, Spilogale putorius (Eastern Spotted Skunk [ESS]) are exposed to a wide variety of pathogenic agents. Understanding the diversity of infectious diseases affecting ESS in conjunction with the role this species plays in the disease ecology of these pathogens is crucial not only for devising efficacious management strategies, but also in formulating comprehensive veterinary and public health strategies for combatting zoonotic diseases associated with this species. Herein I review the reported infectious diseases of ESS. I address the implications of these pathogens for current and future population health of the species with reference to the changing dynamics of ESS disease ecology, influenced by increasing habitat fragmentation, exposure to pathogens across the domestic-wildlife interface, fluctuating climatic patterns, antimicrobial-resistant pathogens, and the profusion of immunosuppressant chemicals throughout the environment. Employing a One Health framework to evaluate the role that ESS play in the disease ecology of zoonoses further highlights the interrelationships of ESS health to the health of humans, domestic animals, and other wildlife. The potential for ESS to serve as hosts, "dilutors", and/or sentinels for zoonoses underscores their importance in public health and provides an opportunity to leverage their potential disease-mitigating attributes for the conservation of ESS aligned with their provision of ecosystem services.

TI  - Spaceborne SAR Interferometry Exploitation for Longitudinal Ground Deformation Monitoring
T2  - 2021 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE (AEROCONF 2021)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE Aerospace Conference (AeroConf)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Multi-temporal Interferometric SAR (InSAR) is a promising modality for spaceborne analysis of ground and structure deformations for predictive alerting. With increasing deployments of highly capable commercial satellites offering high spectral and spatial resolution, global coverage and site revisit rates, predictive structural instability/integrity assessment is becoming accessible at a fraction of cost of aerial and ground based solutions. This paper presents an overview of the opportunities and challenges in affordably monitoring new and longstanding large buildings, monuments and ground infrastructure. This is necessitated by increasingly intense exploitation of environmental resources, hydrogeological instabilities and risk of natural disasters in environments perturbed by human activities that has created new risks. Planetek's Rheticus (R) Displacement (RD) solution provides actionable, accurate assessment of land subsidence and slow changes. The underlying SPINUA (Stable Point Interferometry Even Over Unurbanized Areas) technique has already been shown to be robust in non- and scarcely urbanized areas. The talk will provide an overview of InSAR usage and multi-temporal analysis processing chain to estimate ground displacement and velocity, including results from well-characterized distributed scatterers. New results are presented that combine Quantum Resonance Interferometry (QRI) SNR and SCR enhancement processing within RD computational pipeline for extending the reliability of displacement computations to complex, vegetated ground topography and reducing the number of ground fiducials. New results are presented on dataset acquired using ESA's Sentinel-1 C-band InSAR instrument (with revisit time of 6 days) with high swath-width over a site in Southern Italy. QRI-enhanced displacement maps, compared in terms of the density of measured coherent targets and the precision of the estimated velocity, will be provided. The paper will discuss the utility of improved InSAR processing in all-weather, early warning land monitoring satellite system.

TI  - Rainfall Runoff in Small Watershed after Wenchuan Earthquake in Western China Based on Remote Sensing Technology-A Case Study of Jianping Gully Watershed
T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - On May 12, 2008, the Wenchuan earthquake in Sichuan Province, China caused surface damage, frequent landslides and debris flow, which further exacerbated the flash flood hazards. Two giant debris flows in Longxi River basin (located in Wenchuan county) occurred due to heavy rainfall after the earthquake: one was on August 13,2010, and the other on August 18,2010. Reduction and risk assessment of flash floods are the key issues in post-disaster reconstruction. Due to lack of sufficient research data, hydrological prediction models are employed as important and cost-efficient mitigation tools. Wenchuan earthquake area was taken as study site in order to illustrate the influence of geographical environmental changes on micro-mechanism of mountain floods. In this paper, hydrological observation and simulations using remote sensing data and the WMS HEC-1 model are carried out in the typical flood-hitting area (Jianping Gully basin, Dujiangyan City, Sichuan Province, China). The hydrological response of rainfall runoff is discussed. Precipitation over the study area affects the runoff and floods, however precipitation has positive relation with the peak flood discharge. The simulation shows that the peak flood and runoff volume on August 13, 2010 is close to a 10-year maximum. The flash flood was the main cause of the large debris flow on that event. However, peak runoff remains the same regardless of the intensity of rainfall, which may be due to the shape of the river basin and the initial conditions of the model setting. This paper can get better understanding of the forming mechanism, evolution process, distribution and assessment of torrential flood induced by a devastating earthquake.

TI  - Application of Remote Sensing Technology to Monitoring of Vegetation Recovery and Regional Precipitation in Wenchuan Earthquake Area: Case Study of Longxi River Basin
T2  - SENSORS AND MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Wenchuan earthquake occurred in Sichuan Province, China, on May 12, 2008, and caused a large number of secondary geological disasters such as collapses, debris flows, and landslides, as well as extensive damage to local vegetation. The earthquake had an impact on the regional climate, seriously affecting the sustainable development of the regional environment and economy. In this study, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was used to characterize the vegetation status, which was calculated from images acquired by the MODIS sensor. Based on the vegetation cover and precipitation of the area affected by the Wenchuan earthquake over about 70 years, in this paper we analyze the characteristics of vegetation changes and their impact on the climate after the earthquake. The results revealed that the above secondary geological disasters caused by the earthquake destroyed vegetation. After the earthquake, NDVI decreased from 0.394 in 2007 to 0.383 on July 1, 2008, and then increased year by year to 0.413 in 2015, except in 2010. During the two years after the earthquake, several large-scale debris flows occurred in this area, damaging the surface vegetation, so the vegetation coverage was low in 2010. The change of the land cover has an indirect impact on the local precipitation. The annual and seasonal (except winter) precipitation trended downward from 1948 to 2018, with an annual average decrease of 1.6069 mm, but trended upward from 2008 to 2018, with an annual average increase of 14.012 mm, after the Wenchuan earthquake, indicating the recovery of vegetation. The increased vegetation promoted regional precipitation, but the interaction mechanism between the vegetation cover and the precipitation is complex. The effect of the vegetation differs in different regions and cannot be generalized. This study provides theoretical support for vegetation restoration and environmental management in areas with strong earthquakes.

TI  - CDnetV2: CNN-Based Cloud Detection for Remote Sensing Imagery With Cloud-Snow Coexistence
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud detection is a crucial preprocessing step for optical satellite remote sensing (RS) images. This article focuses on the cloud detection for RS imagery with cloud-snow coexistence and the utilization of the satellite thumbnails that lose considerable amount of high resolution and spectrum information of original RS images to extract cloud mask efficiently. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel cloud detection neural network with an encoder decoder structure, named CDnetV2, as a series work on cloud detection. Compared with our previous CDnetV1, CDnetV2 contains two novel modules, that is, adaptive feature fusing model (AFFM) and high-level semantic information guidance flows (HSIGFs). AFFM is used to fuse multilevel feature maps by three submodules: channel attention fusion model (CAFM), spatial attention fusion model (SAFM), and channel attention refinement model (CARM). HSIGFs are designed to make feature layers at decoder of CDnetV2 be aware of the locations of the cloud objects. The high-level semantic information of HSIGFs is extracted by a proposed high-level feature fusing model (HFFM). By being equipped with these two proposed key modules, AFFM and HSIGFs, CDnetV2 is able to fully utilize features extracted from encoder layers and yield accurate cloud detection results. Experimental results on the ZY-3 satellite thumbnail data set demonstrate that the proposed CDnetV2 achieves accurate detection accuracy and outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - Mozambique Flood (2019) Caused by Tropical Cyclone Idai Monitored From Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The tropical cyclone Idai caused severe floods in Mozambique in March 2019. Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images are processed to monitor the flood disaster in Pungue and Buzi rivers by combining the object-based image analysis approach and the decision tree algorithm. Water is preliminarily extracted from Sentinel-1 image, and shadows of mountain and buildings in the study area are extracted from Sentinel-2 image. Mountain shadow is extracted based on the decision tree classification rules constructed by the digital elevation model and the index model, while building shadow is extracted by constructing the decision tree classification rules using the features of objects. Water extraction results are combined with shadows to eliminate confusing shadows in the preliminary extraction to obtain the accurate flood extent. Sentinel-2 images are used to classify land use types in multiple periods before and after the flood and analyze the disaster by combining with the change information of the water. Land use type changes are analyzed and predicted with the CA-Markov model. The results show that the maximum submerged area was 3.5 times of the normal water area, and that most areas were submerged for more than 10 d. The area between Pungue and Buzi rivers were severely affected, where a large number of crops and villages were submerged. Grassland and cropland were the most seriously submerged. The overall accuracy of extracted water results ranges from 86% to 92%. The results indicated that the combining method can effectively suppress the influence of shadows on water extraction results.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Dynamics of Environmental Status Based on a Remote Sensing Ecological Distance Index (RSEDI) in the Oases of Hexi Corridor in Northwest China
T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Hexi Corridor is a typical ecologically fragile and sensitive area, and the oases areas in the middle are the core area of the economic development of the Hexi Corridor, where the ecological problems are most serious. It is of great significance for regional ecological environment construction and sustainable development to clarify the ecological environment status and its change distribution of the Hexi oases areas. This study used remote sensing ecological distance index (RSEDI) model to generate time series of various environmental indexes of the Hexi oases areas from 1986 to 2020, based on Landsat TM/OLI images. And the changes of ecological environment were quantitatively analyzed by employing the coefficient of variation, Theil-Sen median trend analysis and the Mann-Kendall test, and Hurst index method. Results showed that: (1) The mean value of RSEDI of Hexi oases showed an increasing trend, increasing from 0.386 in 1986 to 0.405 in 2020. (2) The ecological environment changes of the Hexi oases were relatively stable, areas with low coefficients of variation accounted for 62.70%. (3) The ecological improvement areas (26.53%) were smaller than the ecological decline areas (30.83%), and areas with no change accounted for 42.62%. (4) 75.14% of areas were persistent, showing the ecological environment changes had strong sustainability. The areas with persistence and improvement accounted for 20.72%, which were distributed throughout the study area, mostly around the periphery of artificial oasis such as Shandan, and Yongchang. The areas with persistence and degradation accounted for 21.55%, which were concentrated in the middle of the study area, mainly in Sunan and Gaotai. In short, the ecological environment of the Hexi oases had been improved, but it also faced huge challenges.

TI  - The influence of temperature and precipitation on the vegetation dynamics of the tropical island of Hainan
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding how terrestrial ecosystems respond to climate change can help achieve regional sustainability. The normalized difference vegetation Index (NDVI), which is an important vegetation parameter and ecological index, can directly reflect changes in the ecological environment. Based on meteorological observation data and NDVI monitoring data from 2000 to 2018, we explore the impact of climate change on vegetation on Hainan Island. Firstly, by using Mann-Kendall trend detection together with correlation and partial correlation analysis, we analyze the spatial patterns and trends of the NDVI, annual average temperature, and annual precipitation at grid level and also investigate the spatial relationship between the climatic factors and vegetation. The results show that (1) the ecological conditions on Hainan Island are good and the vegetation trends are positive; (2) the air temperature of Hainan Island has a strong positive effect on the NDVI; and (3) precipitation prevents vegetation growth in the rainy season especially in the central parts of the island. This study focuses on the spatiotemporal characteristics and evolution of vegetation and the influence of climate change on vegetation. Our study provides a scientific basis for achieving regional ecologically sustainable development and valuable evidence related to the impact of climate change on vegetation in tropical island regions.

AB  - Illegal wildlife poaching is driving the loss of biodiversity. To combat poaching, rangers patrol expansive protected areas for illegal poaching activity. However, rangers often cannot comprehensively search such large parks. Thus, the Protection Assistant for Wildlife Security (PAWS) uses machine learning to help identify the areas with highest poaching risk. As PAWS is deployed to parks around the world, we recognized that many parks have limited resources for data collection and therefore have scarce feature sets. To ensure under-resourced parks have access to meaningful poaching predictions, we introduce the use of publicly available remote sensing data to extract features for parks. By employing this data from Google Earth Engine, we also incorporate previously unavailable dynamic data such as climate and primary production patterns to enrich predictions with seasonal trends. We automate the entire data-to-deployment pipeline and find that, with only using publicly available data, we recuperate prediction performance comparable to predictions made using features manually computed by park specialists. We conclude that the inclusion of satellite imagery creates for a robust system through which parks of any resource level can benefit from poaching risks for years to come.

TI  - Mapping Impervious Surface Distribution and Dynamics in an Arid/Semiarid Area-A Case Study in Ordos, China
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The impervious surface area (ISA) has become an important parameter in the areas such as surface runoff, climate change, and socioeconomic analysis. However, using remote sensing data to accurately map ISA is still difficult due to its complexity in the arid and semi-arid areas with large amounts of bare soil, sparse vegetation, and a small ISA. In this study, we have selected Ordos city as study area and examined the spatial pattern and dynamics in the years of 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2019 by using multiple data sources with a combination method. The results indicate that the ISAs in 2010, 2015, and 2019 were extracted with overall accuracies of 90.6%, 89.2%, and 91.8% with kappa coefficients of 0.79, 0.76, and 0.82, respectively. The ISA extraction results of the Urban Index (UI), Normalized Difference Built-Up Index (NDBI), Index-based Built-Up Index (IBI), and Impervious Built-up Index from optical sensors (IBUIopt) were used for comparison. Meanwhile, a correlation analysis between socioeconomic factors and the ISA of the typical resource-based city of Ordos was conducted. The spatial pattern and dynamics of the ISA data in Ordos city are of great significance to the study of socioeconomic and environmental changes and provide a reference to examine the effect of ISAs in other resource-based cities.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Changes in Vegetation in the Ruoergai Region, China
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely monitoring of the changes in coverage and growth conditions of vegetation (forest, grass) is very important for preserving the regional and global ecological environment. Vegetation information is mainly reflected by its spectral characteristics, namely, differences and changes in green plant leaves and vegetation canopies in remote sensing domains. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is commonly used to describe the dynamic changes in vegetation, but the NDVI sequence is not long enough to support the exploration of dynamic changes due to many reasons, such as changes in remote sensing sensors. Thus, the NDVI from different sensors should be scientifically combined using logical methods. In this study, the Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) NDVI from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI are combined using the Savitzky-Golay (SG) method and then utilized to investigate the temporal and spatial changes in the vegetation of the Ruoergai wetland area (RWA). The dynamic spatial and temporal changes and trends of the NDVI sequence in the RWA are analyzed to evaluate and monitor the growth conditions of vegetation in this region. In regard to annual changes, the average annual NDVI shows an overall increasing trend in this region during the past three decades, with a linear trend coefficient of 0.013/10a, indicating that the vegetation coverage has been continuously improving. In regard to seasonal changes, the linear trend coefficients of NDVI are 0.020, 0.021, 0.004, and 0.004/10a for spring, summer, autumn, and winter, respectively. The linear regression coefficient between the gross domestic product (GDP) and NDVI is also calculated, and the coefficients are 0.0024, 0.0015, and 0.0020, with coefficients of determination (R-2) of 0.453, 0.463, and 0.444 for Aba, Ruoergai, and Hongyuan, respectively. Thus, the positive correlation coefficients between the GDP and the growth of NDVI may indicate that increased societal development promotes vegetation in some respects by resulting in the planting of more trees or the promotion of tree protection activities. Through the analysis of the temporal and spatial NDVI, it can be assessed that the vegetation coverage is relatively large and the growth condition of vegetation in this region is good overall.

Large amounts of accessible satellite remote sensing data can provide timely and accurate information on the dynamics of mangroves, offering significant advantages in space, time, and characterization. In view of the capability of deep learning in processing massive data in recent years, we developed a new deep learning model-Capsules-Unet, which introduces the capsule concept into U-net to extract mangroves with high accuracy by learning the spatial relationship between objects in images. This model can significantly reduce the number of network parameters to improve the efficiency of data processing. This study uses Landsat data combined with Capsules-Unet to map the dynamics of mangrove changes over the 25 years (1990-2015) along the MSR. The results show that there was a loss in the mangrove area of 1,356,686 ha (about 21.5%) between 1990 and 2015, with anthropic activities such as agriculture, aquaculture, tourism, urban development, and over-development appearing to be the likely drivers of this decline. This information contributes to the understanding of ecological conditions, variability characteristics, and influencing factors along the MSR.

AB  - The lower reaches of the ancient Yellow River (AYR) migrated very frequently, like a loong swinging its tail on the land of China. This paper, based on Gaofen-3 full-polarization synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, analyzed scattering characteristics of archaeolandscapes, which provided reliable evidences for the existence of AYR between Lankao and Sui County. Then, an adaptive irregular convolution kernel U-Net (AICK-U-Net) was proposed to reconstruct the part of channel of AYR, based on the image obtained by polarization decomposition, and the precision reached 96.21%. In summary, polarization decomposition and neural network in spaceborne SAR field, provided new insights for detecting and reconstructing archaeolandscapes.

TI  - Upwelling study of chlorophyll <i>a</i> content in phytoplankton of the western Caspian in 2017 based on remote sensing data
T2  - SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim. Study of upwelling based on spatio-temporal variability of chlorophyll a concentration in the western part of the Caspian Sea in 2017 based on space survey images.Materials and methods. Space images were obtained from the specialized centers of Ocean Color NASA, Earth Science Data Systems NASA and SATIN. Remote sensing data was processed using SeaDAS and ArcGIS programmes. Ground data were obtained from the Unified State System of Information on the Situation in the World Ocean (ESIMO). ESIMO is an inter-agency information system designed to integrate data and services of marine systems of Russia and to provide integrated information support to maritime activities of the Russian Federation. The database was created in ArcGIS and maps compiled accordingly.Results. The first upwelling occurred on 9-17 June 2017. The minimum water temperature registered in the Makhachkala region was 14 degrees C. with an increase in salinity to 12 parts per thousand, over an area of 1.500 km(2). There was an increase in the content of dissolved oxygen up to 9.70 mg/l and a pH of 8.64 was recorded. At first, the concentration of chlorophyll a was more than 10 mg/m(3), then it decreased to 2.5 m/m(3), while at the same time the area of distribution of chlorophyll with this indicator significantly increased. For the coastal strip, the chlorophyll index was 5 mg/m(3). The second upwelling of medium intensity was from 19 June to 1 July 1 2017 with a minimum of t = 17.9 degrees C. with an increase in salinity of 1 parts per thousand. The surface area was 454 km(2). The concentration of chlorophyll a increased from 4 to 8-12 mg/m(3), reaching 23 mg/m(3) on 24 June. The third case of upwelling was recorded from 26 August to 1 September 2017 and was characterized by a decrease in water temperature by 7.4 degrees C (near the coast by 17.1 degrees C). The average salinity increase was 0.32 parts per thousand, while the O-2 concentration was 8 mg/l and the water area 500 km(2). A sharp increase in the area and concentration of chlorophyll was observed on 29 August 2017. Subsequently, the concentration of chlorophyll throughout the entire water area was evenly distributed in the range of 1-5 mg/m(3).Conclusion. The Caspian Sea is characterized by spatial heterogeneity of oceanological parameters, which can be recorded based on the results of processing satellite images and their verification using ground data. In the western part of the sea, the upwelling is periodic and of different scales. In total, on the basis of the capabilities of multifactor geoinformation modeling, 3 upwellings were identified and confirmed using satellite data.

TI  - Contribution of aspiration to the diagnosis of lung cancer in endobronchial ultrasound-guided fine-needle biopsy
T2  - REVISTA DA ASSOCIACAO MEDICA BRASILEIRA
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration has been successfully applied in both diagnosis and staging of mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathies and masses, especially in malignant cases. However, the optimal procedure of Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration to further increase diagnostic yield and minimize processing complexity remains controversial. This study aims to compare aspiration biopsy (Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration) and non-aspiration biopsy (Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle capillary sampling) in terms of sample adequacy, diagnosis, and quality in malignant cases.METHODS: Between March 2018 and June 2020, Endobronchial ultrasound- guided was performed sequentially on patients with mediastinal and/or hilar lymph nodes that were considered malignant. Each lymphadenopathy was sampled with and without aspiration. A single-blinded pathologist evaluated the samples.RESULTS: A total of 84 lymph nodes evaluations of 51 patients were included. Most samples were taken from the right lower paratracheal lymph nodes ( n=27, 32.2%) and subcarinal LN (n=21, 25%). The mean size of the lymph nodes was 21.21 +/- 8.257 (8-40) mm. The agreement between the two procedures in terms of sample adequacy and diagnostic yield was 69.1% (95%CI 58-78.7, p=0.076). In addition, according to the goodness-of-fit statistics, the kappa values were 0.255 (p=0.015) and 0.302 (p=0.004) for sample adequacy and diagnostic yield, respectively. There was no difference between the two procedures in relation to complications.CONCLUSION: Although the agreement between the two procedures is weak, Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle capillary sampling can be performed with less personnel, without reducing diagnostic yield and tissue adequacy. These findings can assist clinicians in determining the optimal procedure for Endobronchial ultrasound-guided.

M3  - Article
AB  - Aim of study: Our world is exposed to forest fires and threatens both natural and human environments. Remote sensing is one of the effective techniques to monitor forest fires. However, accessing and processing data on the field is challenging for researchers as it is costly and time-consuming.Area of study: In this study, the Mersin-Gulnar fire that happened in 2008 in the Mersin region was investigated.Materials and methods: Starting from 2000, data from the MODIS satellite images were used to monitor the forest's regeneration process along the forest fire's complete timeline. For this, analyzes were made over 471 Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) MODIS satellite data from 2000 until 2020. The analyses were made in Google Earth Engine.Main results: According to the data processed on the Google Earth Engine platform, the vegetation cover was damaged after the fire. As a result of the examined 471 MODIS images, it was observed that the recovery process of the study area after a forest fire takes an average of 10 years.Highlights: Remote sensing methodologies and satellite datasets provide powerful functionality for assessing the damage caused by forest fires. This study is an example that the recovery period of forest fires is long, and it brings many difficulties together with other natural events.

TI  - Utility of Copernicus-Based Inputs for Actual Evapotranspiration Modeling in Support of Sustainable Water Use in Agriculture
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying spatial and temporal patterns of the actual evapotranspiration (ET) using Earth observation data can significantly contribute to the accurate and transparent monitoring of sustainable development goals (SDGs) target 6.4, which focuses on the increase of the water-use efficiency and sustainable freshwater withdrawals. Irrigated agriculture is by far the largest consumer of freshwater worldwide, and ET can serve as a direct proxy of crop water use. Various ongoing initiatives encourage the use of remote sensing data for the monitoring of SDG 6.4, including the WaPOR portal run by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. However, none of these initiatives use Copernicus satellite and modeled data to the fullest extent. Copernicus provides operational high-quality data freely and openly, contains all the inputs required for ET modeling, and has long-term continuity and evolution plans, thus allowing for the establishment of baseline for SDG 6.4 and continuous monitoring in mid- and long term. In this study, we evaluate the utility of Copernicus data for this task with WaPOR products serving as a comparison benchmark. Thus, the modeled ET has to be able to accurately capture the field-scale activity at 10-day timesteps while also scaling to national coverage and providing consistent estimates at different spatial resolutions, ranging from tens to hundreds of meters. Results indicate that Copernicus-based ET can reach a correlation of 0.9, mean bias of 0.3 mm/day, and root-mean-square error of less than 1 mm/day when compared against the field lysimeter and eddy covariance measurements, and with proper approach, can achieve a better spatial-scale consistency than WaPOR data. This sets a path toward the Copernicus-based ET product and its use within the SDG monitoring and reporting.

TI  - Insects, Rodents, and Pets as Reservoirs, Vectors, and Sentinels of Antimicrobial Resistance
T2  - ANTIBIOTICS-BASEL
M3  - Review
AB  - This paper reviews the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in insects, rodents, and pets. Insects (e.g., houseflies, cockroaches), rodents (rats, mice), and pets (dogs, cats) act as reservoirs of AMR for first-line and last-resort antimicrobial agents. AMR proliferates in insects, rodents, and pets, and their skin and gut systems. Subsequently, insects, rodents, and pets act as vectors that disseminate AMR to humans via direct contact, human food contamination, and horizontal gene transfer. Thus, insects, rodents, and pets might act as sentinels or bioindicators of AMR. Human health risks are discussed, including those unique to low-income countries. Current evidence on human health risks is largely inferential and based on qualitative data, but comprehensive statistics based on quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) are still lacking. Hence, tracing human health risks of AMR to insects, rodents, and pets, remains a challenge. To safeguard human health, mitigation measures are proposed, based on the one-health approach. Future research should include human health risk analysis using QMRA, and the application of in-silico techniques, genomics, network analysis, and 'big data' analytical tools to understand the role of household insects, rodents, and pets in the persistence, circulation, and health risks of AMR.

AB  - The common characteristic of the lyrical genre is that the subject and object worlds are integrated or divided in the ways such as “assimilation, projection, and unification”. The lyrical subject always has the upper hand in value judgment, and the subject's voice is not denied unless it is based on his own reflective thinking. As adult literature(poetry, Sijo) and children's literature (children's poetry, children's Sijo) are classified according to the poetic subject involved in communication, the difference in content is so great that it is comparable to the change in worldview. The difference between poetry(freeform poetry) and Sijo(Korean sonnet) can be found in the use of formal conventions called ‘formal rules’. This is a difference in the style of expression rather than a difference in worldview, making it easier to cross the boundaries of sub-genres.In Insu Moon's poetry, the 'poetic qualities' overwhelm the differentiating factors of the sub-genre. According to him, the success of the poetic idea, which is considered a common characteristic, is successfully expanded even in crossing the boundaries of sub-genres.

AB  - In this paper, I looked for the parts where laughter appeared in the Mundoong, Yangban, Yeongno, and Grandfather and Grandmother of Tongyeong Ogwangdae and Dongrae Yaryu, and investigated the meaning of those parts. Laughter in mask play has made him more tolerant of human injustice and foolishness. I softened the critical content and naturally revealed what I thought should be hidden. Through a short and noisy plot, the opposing forces, the inner conflict of the Mundoong, Yangban, Yeongno, and Grandfather and Grandmother were shown in a realistic and realistic way.The worldview that creates the structure of realism is typically skeptical and ironic, and the worldview that creates the comical structure related to laughter aims for the ultimate emergence of a new order based on unity and harmony. Masking is thought to be a work in the stage of moving from the latter to the former. Therefore, it is judged that laughter in mask play served as an important medium for Korean art thought to have a realist view of the world. This is because various expression methods that induce laughter are working to reveal negativity, reveal the illusion of contemporary values, and naturally expose restraint and taboo suppression. In laughter, there is a path that transforms perception by fusing several elements. There was realism at the end of the pathway to new perception.

AB  - Indonesia is an archipelagic in Southeast Asia, which located between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. Indonesia's sea area is 70% of its total area. Water was covered almost 72 percent of the Earth's atmosphere. This is the most important for monitoring for maritime supervision and control. Ship identification is a very important component of marine surveillance. This surveillance can be helpful in a variety of applications, such as maritime trade, dealing illegal fishing, and oil spill monitoring. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is an active microwave remote sensing system that can identify marine features on the sea surface and penetrate clouds from space. It is used to identify marine formations on the sea surface in tropical regions. Sentinel 1 availability as a SAR image with have ability for day/night operation illumination conditions, makes it is appropriate for accurate and precise ship operations at sea. Many false alarms are triggered by the presence of land, it has been discovered. These are minimized by using land masks, which are buffered coastlines. The identification from SAR satellite is to identify the ship from the missing Automation Identification systems (AIS) and able to know the type of classification of the ship. The results will be used classification method from machine learning to identify the ship type.

AB  - Each year, vegetation fires, in composite with deforestation operations, convert and modify huge sections of evergreen tropical forests, transitional forests, and savanna vegetation across the tropics. MODIS is the most basic fire product, identifying current flames as well as other thermal anomalies such as volcanoes. The MODIS product has daily composite fire products. The daily composite fire products that we use is MOD14a. MOD14a is a daily level 3 fire product spans one of the 460 MODIS tile, 326 of which contain land pixels. We used a comprehensive analysis in this study to validate the MODIS satellite active fire detection products (MOD14) and compute the data in time series. The data were taken during January 2021 - August 2021 utilizing in Google Earth Engine. This method is user-friendly methods for data processing, aggregation, downloading, and ingestion data processing parallel processing for fast downloads. The parallel processing is useful to fulfill the gap of the data of the hotspot region which are not cover by the other satellite imagery. From results show the distribution of hotspot locations in Riau, identifying the most vulnerable regions to fire as Pelalawan and Bukit Kapur, as well as the smoke and hazes that are prone to fires and validated with monitoring system Sipongi application.

AB  - City expansion is characterized by population increase and advancement in space requirements, which results in a city's inability to accommodate its people's activities, causing the development of urban regions to occur as a symptom of urban sprawl. The evolution occurring in Bandar Lampung, as well as other new core development in the suburbs, causes physical progress to occur in the urban zone, resulting in a symptom of urban sprawl. The Sentinel constellation can deliver high-quality free satellite imagery that allows for the estimation of characteristics related to urban structure. Multitemporal Sentinel 2 data and Synthetic aperture radar sentinel 1 data are frequently utilized to generate urban sprawl indexes. The normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), both measures of an urban heat island effect, are effective for detecting changes in metropolitan environments. The research is to fuse multitemporal and multi-resolution sentinel 2 data to build a new, creative strategy for better water management in urban catchments at the local scale and we propose a new methodology of fusing the sentinel 1 and sentinel 2 to visualize the urban areas.

AB  - Pixel-based classification is considered as a classic method of extracting land-cover related information from remotely sensed imagery, and has been used in various applications, including vegetation mapping. However, several recent studies also mentioned the weakness of the pixel-based approach, including the vegetation index transformation, in mapping the structural composition of vegetation. This study aimed to test several pixel-based classification algorithms for mapping the structural composition of vegetation using Sentinel-2A (10 meters) imagery in Salatiga and its surrounding, Central Java. In this study three classification algorithms, namely Maximum Likelihood, Minimum Distance to Mean, and Support Vector Machine were compared with respect to their accuracy results in mapping the vegetation structural composition. The authors evaluated the effects of additional data in the classification process by comparing two different datasets, i.e. (i) the one using original bands only, and (ii) the one containing original bands and additional data in the form of several vegetation indices and Leaf Area Index (LAI). We collected field samples using stratified random strategy, which were separated into two sub-datasets, as a basis for structural composition classification reference and accuracy assessment. In addition, comparison was also carried out using the original results and the one which was majority filtered. The results showed that the Maximum Likelihood algorithm performed the highest accuracies at a range of 74-86% using a combination of original bands and RVI (Ratio Vegetation Index). The result that was processed using a 5x5 majority filter showed the highest accuracy 86.29%. These results demonstrated that the pixel-based classification of Sentinel 2A imagery using the Maximum Likelihood algorithm could be used to map the structural composition of vegetation in the study area

TI  - Possible Atmosphere and Ionospheric Anomalies of the 2019 Pakistan Earthquake Using Statistical and Machine Learning Procedures on MODIS LST, GPS TEC, and GIM TEC
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying atmospheric and ionospheric anomalies based on remote sensing satellites has contributed highly to develop the hypothesis of lithosphere-atmosphere-ionosphere coupling over the earthquake (EQ) epicenter during the seismic preparation period. This article has investigated the variations of potential EQ precursor in daytime and nighttime land surface temperature (LST) before and after the 2019 Pakistan EQ from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite. The nighttime LST values of MODIS exhibit temporal anomalies during nighttime period within a time window of five days before and after the main shock day. Furthermore, the LST values predicted by artificial neural network (ANN) validate the significant enhancement in nighttime time series of MODIS. The nighttime LST anomalies obtained from the observation and ANN prediction are more than 20% and 7% of normal distribution beyond the confidence bounds, respectively, within five days after the main shock. Likewise, the ionospheric anomaly from daily total electron content (TEC) values at Sukkur Global Positioning System (GPS) station confirms the EQ associated ionospheric perturbations on the day after the main shock. The Global Ionospheric Maps (GIMs) also show the TEC anomalies during 1000-1400 LT on September 25, 2019.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 7th Geoinformation Science Symposium
CL  - Yogyakarta, INDONESIA
AB  - Gerbangkertosusila (Gresik-Bangkalan-Mojokerto-Surabaya-Sidoarjo-Lamongan) is one of the biggest metropolitan areas in Indonesia impacted hardest by COVID-19 after social restriction. High temperature conditions are an issue in the Gerbangkertosusila area. Reduced mobility and industrial activity lead to decrease in surface temperature. The research was carried out using the Statistical Mono Windows (SMW) algorithm in separate periods of time (July 2019, July 2020, October 2020, May 2021) to represent the changes between social restriction policy and the weather. This research goal is to examine the relationship between land surface temperature with changes of spectral indices, such as NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and NDBI (Normalized Difference Built-up Index) data. These three parameters are correlated with a simple linear regression equation to calculate how much influence occurs in each different period, then the qualitative analysis is carried out to explain the variations between the distribution of hotspot and annual temperature chart to the real conditions. The result shows strong positive correlation coefficient between changes of NDBI pixel and the LST in each period of time such as 0.62; 0.80; 0.70; and 0.80. Meanwhile the NDVI-LST correlation coefficient shows negative results such as -0.57; -0.43; -0.38; -0.41. This research also concludes that in the social restriction period, the Land Surface Temperature doesn't affect the variability of NDVI

AB  - Bringing together a number of cutting-edge technologies that range from storing extremely large volumes of data all the way to developing scalable machine learning and deep learning algorithms in a distributed manner and having them operate over the same infrastructure poses unprecedented challenges. One of these challenges is the integration of European Space Agency (ESA)'s Thematic Exploitation Platforms (TEPs) and data information access service platforms with a data platform, namely Hopsworks, which enables scalable data processing, machine learning, and deep learning on Copernicus data, and development of very large training datasets for deep learning architectures targeting the classification of Sentinel images. In this article, we present the software architecture of ExtremeEarth that aims at the development of scalable deep learning and geospatial analytics techniques for processing and analyzing petabytes of Copernicus data. The ExtremeEarth software infrastructure seamlessly integrates existing and novel software platforms and tools for storing, accessing, processing, analyzing, and visualizing large amounts of Copernicus data. New techniques in the areas of remote sensing and artificial intelligence with an emphasis on deep learning are developed. These techniques and corresponding software presented in this article are to be integrated with and used in two ESA TEPs, namely Polar and Food Security TEPs. Furthermore, we present the integration of Hopsworks with the Polar and Food Security use cases and the flow of events for the products offered through the TEPs.

AB  - This study aims to analyze the relationship between the image mode of information and the abductive method. The image mode of information is defined as the mode of information exchange between persons that determines thinking and acting, worldview, and belief. There are three kinds of modes, oral, letter, and digital image modes. The three modes have been appearing in sequence with the historical progress of media.According to the mode of information theory, the research method is determined by way of information and knowledge exchange. Hence, the inductive method is included within the oral mode, and the ground of this assertion is that both the inductive method and the oral exchange of information share ideas in which a law/general rule stems from the lateral accumulation of individual experiences.The deductive method is established within the letter mode, and the ground of this assertion is that both the deductive method and the oral exchange of information believe that a law is established through logical thinking with propositions.The abductive method is established within the digital image mode, and this assertion has its basis as follows. First, the abductive method and exchange of digital image information share the ideas that both research and visual perception are performed within a strategy that creates and then proves a hypothesis. Second, the abductive method was suggested by Peirce when image media such as pictures and movies began to be popular. Third, the abductive method is an appropriated method to analyze data in web 2.0.Schooling has to develop students’ image thinking ability and encourage students to use their abductive learning and research ability to adapt to the AI society.

TI  - Role of IRS-1C in Developing Remote Sensing Applications for Water Management in India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Efficient water management is essential for water and food security leading to socio-economic development. In order to build resilience and achieve water security, planning and management of water resources projects needs to be based on realistic assessment of related aspects. This requires comprehensive, reliable and easily accessible information on demand, availability and utilisation of water resources. Observational capabilities from ground monitoring systems and supplementary/complementary data from satellite remote sensing provide unique opportunities for data integration and value addition supporting water management decisions. While LANDSAT-1 initiated various remote sensing based activities with respect to management of hydrology and water resources across the globe, the launch of Indian remote sensing satellite, IRS-1A in 1988, along with its follow-up satellites, provided fillip to these activities mainly in India. The launch of IRS-1C in December 1995, with unique combination of sensors, has greatly improved extensive utilisation of satellite remote sensing for various facets of water management. This article presents a review of various applications carried out using IRS-1C data while highlighting the capabilities and advantage of IRS-1C sensors achieving significant improvement in mapping water bodies, inventory and monitoring of irrigated crops, irrigation system performance evaluation, assessment of reservoir sedimentation, mapping and monitoring of snow cover, snowmelt runoff forecasting, watershed developmental planning and management, etc.

TI  - Interpreting Prehistoric Labor North and South of the Forager-Agricultural Frontier in Central Fennoscandia, Northern Europe
T2  - ARCTIC ANTHROPOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The prehistory of Fennoscandia is characterized by a split of the north and south into what is commonly interpreted as forager and agricultural subsistence contexts. The cultural divergence between the two took place in the region over the span of 4,000 years. This article focuses on analyzing products indicative of extrasubsistence labor, which signify distinct-yet-comparable activities in the divergent regional contexts. The activities are studied by interpreting the production processes of the most common types of pertinent archaeological remnants and interpreted through two attributes: labor intensity and expertise. The combined analysis reflects the differences between the two regional material records while also indicating different logic related to the persistence of labor activities. This difference in logic is interpreted with a framework pertaining to worldview differences between subsistence production and subsistence procurement. Beginning from the 4th and 3rd millennium BC, communities in the southern context are argued to have adopted aspects of an ideology of production. These communities maintained and strengthened their labor efforts in the long term. Contrastingly, in the northern zone, several phases of the decline of labor-related activities can be discerned in the long-term prehistory when labor roles were completely reorganized or abolished. The difference may be due to an ideological separation between the two contexts concerning nonsubsistence-related work and the associated issue of social organization.

T2  - CLINICAL LABORATORY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Knowing the prevalence of blood group antigens in a given population is important to prevent hemolytic reactions. The Duffy blood group system (FY) has two main antigens, Fy(a) and Fy(b). Antibodies binding these antigens can cause immediate/delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions as well as hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn. In this study, frequencies of Fy(a) and Fy(b) antigen expression and FY phenotypes were determined in a cohort of Saudi blood donors.Methods: For this study, 143 samples were collected from randomly selected volunteer Saudi blood donors living in Jazan Province. Serological analysis, using gel card technology, was performed to detect Fy(a) and Fy(b) antigens among the samples.Results: The frequencies of Fy(a) and Fy(b) antigens were 12.58% and 11.18%, respectively. The numbers and frequencies of FY phenotypes were as follows: Fy(a(+)b(-)), 15 (10.48%); Fy(a(-)b(+)), 13 (9.10%); Fy(a(+)b(+)), 3 (2.10%), and Fy(a(-)b(-)), 112 (78.32%). The frequencies of the FY phenotypes were highly and significantly different in Jazan Saudis compared to other ethnicities (< 0.01).Conclusions: This study reports the frequencies of the Fy(a) and Fy(b) antigens and phenotypes of the FY blood group system in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's Jazan Province. The null phenotype Fy(a(-)b(-)) was the most prevalent among this population. This study highlights the importance of investigating FY alleles in different provinces of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

T2  - INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES AND LEARNING TOOLS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article highlights the productivity of the visual metaphor in the context of the use of information and communication technologies, the implementation of which changes the format of the educational process. An analysis of visual metaphors in the paradigm of the philosophy of education, which are used to describe various models of worldview, cognition and reflection on the meaning of concepts and knowledge that become the subject of study is performed. Visualization is defined as the creation of images for the transmission and expression of symbols, which provides a more complete understanding of the text, data, information, complementing the scientific explanation or logical reasoning. Given that metaphors are used in everyday perception as a means of visualization to "see" abstract concepts, the concept of "conceptual metaphor" is analyzed, which in cognitive-linguistic research associates thinking with vision and explains complex phenomena that determine the course of thought. The idea of engaging visual metaphors in the process of applying information and communication technologies and learning tools, which by means of computer graphic presentation help deeper understanding of the text, educational material, and its application is postulated. It is proved that visual metaphors are a means of raising the level of the concept, direct thought in a certain direction, and with the use of information and communication technologies, at the same time more fully inform, present, create opportunities for reflection on the meanings of specific knowledge. It is noted that visual metaphors arise both in images and in language, appealing to sight, vision, light, visual perception, and visual experience. A number of key visual metaphors are analyzed - "visual contemplation", "blindness", "mirrors", "light" and their application in the practice of learning in the humanities. The authors see promising further research on the use of information and communication technologies for the formation of all components of visual culture.

TI  - The role of declining snow cover in the desiccation of the Great Salt Lake, Utah, using MODIS data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Great Salt Lake (GSL) in Utah has been shrinking since the middle of the 19th Century, leading to decreased area and volume, and increased salinity. We use satellite data products from the Terra and Aqua MODerateresolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Landsat-7 and-8 satellites, along with meteorological and streamflow data, and modeled data products to study the relationship between changing snow-cover conditions and the decline of the GSL since 2000 in the context of the historical record of lake levels. The GSL basin includes much of the snow-dominated Wasatch and Uinta mountain ranges to the east of the lake. Snowmelt feeds the Bear, Jordan, and Weber rivers which are the three main rivers that flow into the lake. Snowmelttiming maps, derived from a new MODIS standard snow-cover product, MOD10A1F, show that snow melted-9.5 days earlier in the GSL basin during the study period, extending from 2000 to 2018. Air temperatures derived from 26 meteorological stations and surface temperatures measured by the Aqua MODIS land-surface temperature (LST) products, MYD21A1D and MYD21A1N, show trends of increasing temperature of similar to 0.94 degrees C (alpha = 0.05), and similar to 2.18 degrees C, respectively, with most of the LST trends in the GSL basin being statistically significant (alpha = 0.05). Increasing air temperatures in the basin have led to less precipitation falling as snow, lower snow depth (by-34.5 mm (alpha = 0.01)) and snow-water equivalent (0.02 mm (alpha = 0.01)), and earlier snowmelt. Also during the study period, Global Land surface Evaporation Amsterdam Model data show evaporation increasing by similar to 3.2 mm/yr, with trends in much of the basin being statistically significant (alpha = 0.05). Trends calculated from the various products are generally in agreement indicating higher temperatures, greater evaporation, less snowfall and snow-on-the ground, and earlier snowmelt. Earlier snowmelt contributes to increasing evaporative loss from water flowing toward the lake. Furthermore, a lower mountain snowpack and less precipitation falling as snow (versus rain) is associated with lower stream discharge even if overall precipitation stays the same. The surface-water temperature of the GSL also increased over the study period by similar to 0.69 degrees C, according to the MODIS LST data products, the surface-water elevation of the lake dropped by similar to 1.7 m between 2000 and 2018, and the areal extent of the lake decreased by similar to 901 km(2) as measured using Landsat imagery. Desiccation of the lake is associated with deleterious effects on wildlife, recreational activities, and some local industries. And, importantly, an expanding lake bed can also fuel dust storms that promote dangerous air quality along the Wasatch Front. This work elucidates the key role that satellite remote sensing can play in documenting earlier snowmelt and other changes in the GSL basin that influence the ongoing decline of the Great Salt Lake.

AB  - In this work, we propose applying a non-linear strategy to estimate the novel synthetic intensity component through a second-order polynomial regression analysis, such that it could be expressed as a linear combination of multispectral bands in addition to their weighted joint products. Details maps are, therefore, obtained as the residual between the panchromatic (PAN) and the novel synthetic intensity component. Indeed, the high-resolution Multispectral (MS) image is produced by transferring the details into the expanded multispectral bands. The quality improvements achievable by our proposal are evaluated by using two high resolution data sets collected by the WorldView-3 and WorldView-4 sensors. The performance of our proposed technique is clearly shown against the existing state-of-the-art pansharpening methods (especially with linear schemes) and particularly for multispectral channels with non-overlapping spectral wavelengths with respect to the PAN image.

AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has efficiently replaced axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in axillary staging in node-negative breast cancer patients. Dual sentinel lymph node (SLN) localization using radioisotopes and blue dye is the standard technique for SLN mapping. Yet, nuclear medicine facilities are not widely available worldwide. In Japan, Computed tomography lymphography (CTLG) is presented as an SLN mapping technique which was first suggested in 2003 by Suga etal. Multiple subsequent studies confirmed the efficacy of CTLG in SLN mapping in breast cancer. Further applications of the technique followed; such as prediction of SLN metastasis using CTLG, the use of CTLG guided SLN biopsy after neoadjuvant therapy, video-assisted CTLG guided SLN biopsy, the use of real-time virtual sonography with 3-D CTLG, and preoperative localization of the CTLG mapped SLN using either real-time virtual sonography (RVS) guided Indocyanine green (ICG) injection or its marking using liquid charcoal and silver wire and the use of SPIO enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for prediction of metastasis in SLNs detected by CTLG. This efficacy and variable applications open the door for conducting wide-scale randomized controlled trials to suggest using CTLG as an efficient alternative for the use of radioisotopes in SLN mapping in breast cancer patients, especially in low and middle-income countries.

TI  - From local to global: A transfer learning based approach for mapping poplar plantations at national scale using Sentinel-2
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable estimates of poplar plantations area are not available at the French national scale due to the unsuitability and low update rate of existing forest databases for this short-rotation species. While supervised classification methods have been shown to be highly accurate in mapping forest cover from remotely sensed images, their performance depends to a great extent on the labelled samples used to build the models. In addition to their high acquisition cost, such samples are often scarce and not fully representative of the variability in class distributions. Consequently, when classification models are applied to large areas with high intra-class variance, they generally yield poor accuracies because of data shift issues. In this paper, we propose the use of active learning to efficiently adapt a classifier trained on a source image to spatially distinct target images with minimal labelling effort and without sacrificing the classification performance. The adaptation consists in actively adding to the initial local model new relevant training samples from other areas in a cascade that iteratively improves the generalisation capabilities of the classifier leading to a global model tailored to these different areas. This active selection relies on uncertainty sampling to directly focus on the most informative pixels for which the algorithm is the least certain of their class labels. Experiments conducted on Sentinel-2 time series revealed their high capacity to identify poplar plantations at a local scale with an average F-score ranging from 89.5% to 99.3%. For large area adaptation, the results showed that when the same number of training samples was used, active learning outperformed random sampling by up to 5% of the overall accuracy and up to 12% of the class F-score. Additionally, and depending on the class considered, the random sampling model required up to 50% more samples to achieve the same performance of an active learning-based model. Moreover, the results demonstrate the suitability of the derived global model to accurately map poplar plantations among other tree species with overall accuracy values up to 14% higher than those obtained with local models. The proposed approach paves the way for a national scale mapping in an operational context.

TI  - Atmospheric Dynamics and Numerical Simulations of Six Frontal Dust Storms in the Middle East Region
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyzes six frontal dust storms in the Middle East during the cold period (October-March), aiming to examine the atmospheric circulation patterns and force dynamics that triggered the fronts and the associated (pre- or post-frontal) dust storms. Cold troughs mostly located over Turkey, Syria and north Iraq played a major role in the front propagation at the surface, while cyclonic conditions and strong winds facilitated the dust storms. The presence of an upper-atmosphere (300 hPa) sub-tropical jet stream traversing from Egypt to Iran constitutes also a dynamic force accompanying the frontal dust storms. Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) observations are used to monitor the spatial and vertical extent of the dust storms, while model (Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem), Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service (CAMS), Regional Climate Model-4 (RegCM4)) simulations are also analyzed. The WRF-Chem outputs were in better agreement with the MODIS observations compared to those of CAMS and RegCM4. The fronts were identified by WRF-Chem simulations via gradients in the potential temperature and sudden changes of wind direction in vertical cross-sections. Overall, the uncertainties in the simulations and the remarkable differences between the model outputs indicate that modelling of dust storms in the Middle East is really challenging due to the complex terrain, incorrect representation of the dust sources and soil/surface characteristics, and uncertainties in simulating the wind speed/direction and meteorological dynamics. Given the potential threat by dust storms, more attention should be directed to the dust model development in this region.

TI  - Short-Term Effects of Fire Severity on Vegetation Based on Sentinel-2 Satellite Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - An important component in improving the quality of forests is to study the interference intensity of forest fires, in order to describe the intensity of the forest fire and the vegetation recovery, and to improve the monitoring ability of the dynamic change of the forest. Using a forest fire event in Bilahe, Inner Monglia in 2017 as a case study, this study extracted the burned area based on the BAIS2 index of Sentinel-2 data for 2016-2018. The leaf area index (LAI) and fractional vegetation cover (FVC), which are more suitable for monitoring vegetation dynamic changes of a burned area, were calculated by comparing the biophysical and spectral indices. The results showed that patterns of change of LAI and FVC of various land cover types were similar post-fire. The LAI and FVC of forest and grassland were high during the pre-fire and post-fire years. During the fire year, from the fire month (May) through the next 4 months (September), the order of areas of different fire severity in terms of values of LAI and FVC was: low > moderate > high severity. During the post fire year, LAI and FVC increased rapidly in areas of different fire severity, and the ranking of areas of different fire severity in terms of values LAI and FVC was consistent with the trend observed during the pre-fire year. The results of this study can improve the understanding of the mechanisms involved in post-fire vegetation change. By using quantitative inversion, the health trajectory of the ecosystem can be rapidly determined, and therefore this method can play an irreplaceable role in the realization of sustainable development in the study area. Therefore, it is of great scientific significance to quantitatively retrieve vegetation variables by remote sensing.

TI  - A Critical Response of Practical Theology to the Diffusion of Therapeuticism: Rhetoric Nature of Psychotherapy and the Church’s Strategy to It

M3  - research-article
AB  - The study comprehensively deals with the problem how the church understand and respond therapeuticism, which is thought of as influencing the consciousness and life of the contemporary mass society. ‘Therapeuticism’ is the author’s tentative coinage to indicate a comprehensive ‘therapy’-related phenomenon including worldview, values, lifestyle, political policy, and industry. What makes therapeuticism problematic is that it makes it difficult for the public to accept the traditional Christian view because it widespreadly dominates their conscious world in terms of a particular viewpoint on the world, human being, and mind (consciousness), beyond simply replacing the role of the traditional religion. The author views that it is modern psychology and psychotherapy that have decisive influence on constituting the characteristics of therapeuticism, even if he admits that its fundamental origin consists in human nature. This means that therapeuticism, though not led by scientificity that psychology and psychotherapy intend, uncritically receives the materialism, justified by the modern myth of science through the illusion of healing supplied by psychology and psychotherapy. In fact, thoughts and ideologies against the sustenance of the Christianity are endlessly invented and disseminated since the rise of modernism. The actual threats to the Christianity, however, are made not by elaborate speculative philosophies but by their transfiguration into popular ideas and cultural forms to the extent that they become parts of everyday lives. For religion regards the public mass as its primary audience, rather than intellectual elites. Nonetheless, one cannot but elucidate the true identity of the philosophies behind therapeuticism. This is why the study focuses on philosophical critiques on psychology and psychotherapy. The researcher is to examine to what degree psychology-psychotherapy can be scientific, through explicating the nature of science and the idiosyncratic features of the human consciousness, supposing that the authority and prestige of psychology-psychotherapy relies on their pretensions to being a science. The study shows that the rule of discourse moves from that of science to that of rhetorics if psychology and psychotherapy is to persuade the public in the name of science while they are unable to be sufficiently scientific, and furthermore gives rise to the rhetorical nature of science in general. It follows that psychotherapy is not a true medical therapy but a rhetorical persuasive process, which suggests significant implications for the church’s response to therapeuticism.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to examine the structure of empathy contained in marriage-centered folktales and to explore its patterns and meanings.Empathy represents a universal law of living among people who express themselves voluntarily, in contrast to laws enforced by coercion. Therefore, looking for the aspect and meaning of empathy implied in classical literature, especially through folktales, would allow us to be able to examine the emotional and cognitive foundations implied in the empathy consciousness of traditional society and solve the communication problems in modern society.With this purpose and significance, this study has been conducted to explore the aspects and meanings of empathy in three marriage-centered stories, “Forgiving the Bride Who Gave Birth on the First Night of Marriage,” “The Pillar Fixed by a Bride Who Is Blind,” and “A Daughter from Nobility Who Married a Butcher.” These narrative folktales include the structure of empathy and In these three stories, the altruistic, therapeutic, and communicative aspects of empathy can be found in common.Through these aspects of empathy, this study found that empathy changes not only its recipient, but also the value and worldview of the person who is experiencing empathy toward another person. In addition to allowing others to be healed emotionally, empathy helps them to realize themselves. Furthermore, in all three stories, the recipients of empathy were in danger of being disconnected from the world, but it was revealed that they were reconnected with the world through the empathy of their spouses.In addition, stories that include the structure of empathy have mainly been classified into themes including virtue, good works, ethics, values, or rewards, leading to a blessed ending for the sympathizers and their families. It can thus be understood that people have passed along stories of empathy in order to encourage it with each other.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Pneumonia caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is spreading globally. There have been strenuous efforts to reveal the mechanisms that the host defends itself against invasion by this virus. The immune system could play a crucial role in virus infection. Dendritic cell as sentinel of the immune system plays an irreplaceable role. Dendritic cells-based therapeutic approach may be a potential strategy for SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this review, the characteristics of coronavirus are described briefly. We focus on the essential functions of dendritic cell in severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Basis of treatment based dendritic cells to combat coronavirus infections is summarized. Finally, we propose that the combination of DCs based vaccine and other therapy is worth further study.

TI  - Developing a New Method to Identify Flowering Dynamics of Rapeseed Using Landsat 8 and Sentinel-1/2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying the rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) flowering dates are important for planting area estimation, growth monitoring, and yield estimation. However, there is currently a lack of data on rapeseed flowering dates at the parcel scale. In this study, a new spectral index (Normalized Rapeseed Flowering Index, NRFI) is proposed to detect rapeseed flowering dates from time series data generated from Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel-2 sensors. This study also analyzed the feasibility of using the backscattering coefficients (VV, VH, and VV/VH) of Sentinel-1 to detect the flowering dates of rapeseed at the parcel scale. Based on the spectral and polarization characteristics of 718 rapeseed parcels collected in 2018, we developed a method to automatically identify peak flowering dates by the local maximum of NRFI series and the local minimum of VH and VV, along with the maximum of VV/VH. The results show that most of the peak flowering dates derived from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 can be confirmed by the in-situ phenological observations at the Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD) stations in Germany. The NRFI outperforms the Normalized Difference Yellow Index (NDYI) in identifying the peak flowering dates from Landsat 8. The derived medians of peak flowering dates by NRFI, NDYI (Sentinel-2), and VH are similar, while a systematic delay is observed by NDYI (Landsat 8). The method with the spectrum and backscattering coefficients will be a potential tool to identify crop flowering dynamics and map crop planting area.

TI  - A Novel Radiometric Cross-Calibration of GF-6/WFV With MODIS at the Dunhuang Radiometric Calibration Site
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To obtain more abundant target information for vegetation remote sensing research, the wide field of view (WFV) of the GaoFen-6 (GF-6) satellite utilizes eight bands, including four new bands. Unfortunately, it finds the unavailable reference bands from well-calibrated sensors to implement radiometric cross-calibration of the WFV sensor for these new bands, which severely affects the radiometric quality estimation and the radiometric degradation detection of WFV. Therefore, taking the Dunhuang radiometric calibration site (DRCS) in China as the radiometric transfer platform and treating the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer as a reference sensor, a novel radiometric cross-calibration method for WFV is proposed. The validation results show that compared with the official calibration coefficients (OCCs) published by the China centre for resources satellite data and application (CRESDA), the proposed method can obtain reliable radiometric cross-calibration results for each band even without available corresponding reference bands. Moreover, the influences of the interpolation method and the spectral band adjustment factor (SBAF) correction on the calibration results are discussed. The total radiometric cross-calibration uncertainty is less than 4.33%.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of levels of education on ground reaction force and center of pressure parameters during chest compression resuscitation.Method: Twenty male university students were divided into two groups; certified group (CG, n=10) and non-certified group (NCG, n=10). Two force plates were used to measure ground reaction force and center of pressure parameters during 30 times (three trials) chest compression resuscitation. Independent t-tests were used to compare ground reaction force and center of pressure parameters between two groups. An alpha level of 0.05 was used in all tests.Results: All chest-compression time parameters (total time, 1 systolic time, and diastolic time) in CG were significantly shorter than those in NCG (p<.05). Fy of the diastolic and Fz of the systolic in CG revealed significantly the larger GRF values and Fy of the systolic in CG showed significantly the smaller GRF value (p<.05). The standard deviation of Fz of the systolic and diastolic within the subject during 30 times chestcompression resuscitation revealed significantly the smaller values in CG (p<.05).Conclusion: First, CG performed chest compressions efficiently at an appropriate rate compared to NCG.Second, CG showed lower Fx and Fy values in both the mediolateral and anteroposterior axes compared to NCG, which reduced unnecessary chest-compression force consumption and minimized the movement in patients with cardiac arrest. Third, CG showed high Fz value of the systolic and low Fz value of the diastolic. Based on this, chest compression resuscitation was performed to increase the survival rate of cardiac arrest patients.

TI  - Non-linear anomaly detection for hyperspectral image
T2  - GLOBAL INTELLIGENT INDUSTRY CONFERENCE 2020
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Global Intelligent Industry Conference
CL  - Guangzhou, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - Anomaly detection finds data samples whose signatures are spectrally distinct from their surrounding data samples. One area of interest regarding hyperspectral images is anomaly detection. Anomaly detection becomes increasingly important in hyperspectral image analysis. Hyperspectral imagers can now uncover many material substances which were previously unresolved by multispectral sensors. Many anomaly detectors have been developed and most of them are based on the most widely used Reed-Yu's algorithm, called RX detector (RXD). Principal component analysis (PCA) allows linear dimensionality reduction and feature extraction for hyperspectral remote sensing data. Kernel PCA (KPCA) is the nonlinear form of PCA, which better exploits the complicated spatial structure of high-dimensional features. In this paper, we first use PCA-global RX (PCA-GRX) algorithm for anomaly detection. Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA)-GRX algorithm is investigated for anomaly detection from hyperspectral remote sensing data. Experimental results presented in this paper confirm the usefulness of the KPCA-GRX for the analysis anomaly detection of hyperspectral data. The detection accuracy increases with the proposed approach.

TI  - Guiding Lineage Specific Differentiation of SHED for Target Tissue/Or-gan Regeneration
T2  - CURRENT STEM CELL RESEARCH & THERAPY
M3  - Review
AB  - Stem cells from Human Exfoliated Deciduous teeth (SHED) are considered one of the most attractive cell sources for tissue engineering due to their easy acquisition with no donor mor-bidity, ready availability, ability to self-renew with high proliferation, capacity for multilineage dif-ferentiation and immunomodulatory functions. To date, SHED are able to differentiate into odon-to-/osteoblasts, neuronal cells, endothelial cells, hepatocyte-like cells, chondrocytes, epidermal cells among many other cell types. Accordingly, SHED possess a promising potential to be used in the cell-based therapy for various diseases, including reversible pulpitis, orofacial bone defects, neurodevelopmental disease and ischemic injury. Despite this potential, it has been a concern that tissue specific stem cells do not differentiate with the same efficacy into all the different lineages as they may have an inherent tendency to differentiate toward the tissues from which they were originally derived. Furthermore, stem cell niche comprises of a complex microenvironment where various cells, soluble signals, extracellular matrix and physical cues interplay to maintain the stem-ness of SHED and modulate their differentiation. Therefore, it is of significant importance to identi-fy the specific microenvironmental cues that regulate lineage specific differentiation of SHED, which could inspire to develop functional approaches in target tissue regeneration. In this review, we highlight the recent studies that demonstrated multilineage differentiation capacity of SHED, fo-cusing on how the microenvironment could be modified using different cues in order to achieve tis-sue specific regeneration.

T2  - MOLECULAR AND CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Clear cell sarcoma (CCS) affects the deep soft tissues in young adults and is known to have high rates of metastasis, including lymphatic metastasis. In our previous study an xenoplant model of CCS was established, which exhibited local tumor growth, lymphatic metastasis, and distant metastasis in SCID-Beige mice. In the current study, the role of NK cells during metastasis in the same xenoplant murine model was investigated. Injection of murine or human NK cells significantly suppressed the metastasis of HS-MM CCS cells in SCID-Beige mice. Notably, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR analysis demonstrated that injection of NK cells did not alter the mRNA expression levels of ERSR1-ATF1, which is specifically transcribed in CCS, in the buffy coat of circulating blood cells of HS-MM-xenoplanted SCID-Beige mice. BALB/c nude mice xenoplanted with HS-MM cells exhibited local growth without evident metastasis, whereas inoculation with the anti-asialo-GM1 antibody, which has previously been found to abolish NK-cell activity, resulted in metastasis of HS-MM cells in BALB/c nude mice. The injection of the anti-CD96 antibody, which increases the cytotoxicity of NK cells, significantly suppressed the metastasis of HS-MM cells in SCID-Beige mice. These results indicated that NK cells impaired the metastatic tumor microenvironments in the present mice xenoplant model.

AB  - This study compares and analyzes the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and Terra MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) as coniferous, deciduous and mixed forest with Yongdam Dam upstream (904.4 km2). The hydrologic evaluation period was set to 10 years from 2010 to 2019, and the applicability of the 8-day MOD15A2 Leaf Area Index (LAI) data, 3 TDR (Time Domain Reflectometry) (GB, JC, CC), and 1 Flux Tower (DU) evaporation volume (YDD) data was simulated. As a result, the R2 of coniferous forest, deciduous forest and mixed forest are 0.95, 0.89, 0.90, soil moisture and evaportranspiration stations R2 were analyzed at 0.50 to 0.55 and 0.51, respectively, with R2 at 0.74, RMSE 2.75 mm/day, NSE 0.70 and PBIAS 14.3% for Yongdam inflow. Based on the calibrated and validated watersheds, the annual average evaportranspiration was calculated as coniferous 469.7 mm, deciduous 501. mm and 511.5 mm mixed forest, total runoff were estimated at coniferous 909.8 mm, deciduous 860.6 mm and 864.2 mm mixed forest. In the case of annual average evaportranspiration, it was evaluated that deciduous were high, but in the case of streamflow, it was evaluated that coniferous were high. Unlike other hydrologic with similar patterns throughout the year, the average annual evapotranspiration was about 7% higher than coniferous due to the higher evapotranspiration of deciduous with high leaf area index in summer and fall. In addition, deciduous were 9% and 6% higher for surface runoff and lateral flow, but the groundwater of coniferous was 77% higher. Therefore, it was confirmed that the total runoff was in order of coniferous, mixed forest, and deciduous.

AB  - As a marine protected area, the water quality of Wangi-wangi Island, located in South East Sulawesi, should be monitored regularly to detect potential eutrophication. However, in situ water quality monitoring is expensive and unpractical due to its remote area. The Landsat 8 satellite is able to retrieve water quality information, such as chlorophyll-a and total suspended matter (TSM) over period of times using several neuronal nets of Coast 2 Regional CoastColor / C2RCC algorithm. The C2RCC is a neural network algorithm, trained on simulated top of atmosphere reflectance. There are 2 sets of neuronal nets on C2RCC algorithm which is C2RCC-Nets and C2X-Nets. The aim of this study is to obtain the best neuronal nets of C2RCC algorithm to retrieve chlorophyll-a and TSM from Landsat 8 image over Wangi-wangi island. The in situ measurement of chlorophyll-a and TSM were measured during satellite pass of Landsat 8. Four scenes of Landsat 8 data overpass of Wangi-wangi Island in 2016 were selected in this study. The result showed that the C2RCCnets is more accurate to retrieve chlorophyll-a information with R-2=0.0747, RMSE = 0.1046 mg/m(3) and MAE = 0.0834 mg/m(3). The C2RCC-nets showed good performance to retrieve TSM information with R-2=0.1586, RMSE = 0.4327 g/m(3) and MAE = 0.4258 g/m(3). During our study timeframe, the trophic status of Wangi-wangi Island was oligotrophic with no signs of eutrophication.

AB  - Irrigated area has been decreasing since last decade in Indonesia. Surface irrigation scheduling performed predominantly due to water limitation and plant heterogeneity. Plant type and growth phase relate to the performance of water delivery. The research objective is to compare land use classification (LUC) from Landsat 8 and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with supervised algorithm. Supervised method (i.e. minimum distance algorithm) was applied. The result showed six LUC from UAV, i.e.: vegetative stage of dry crop (39%), ripening stage of dry crop (23%), vegetative stage of paddy (15%), tillage (15%), bare land (7%), and paddy nursery (6%). On the other hand, five LUC were performed by Landsat 8 image, i.e.: vegetative stage of dry crop (10%), ripening stage of dry crop (17%), vegetative stage of paddy (5%), tillage area (62%), bare land (6%). UAV's image source performed more detail and accurate than satellite image. Thus, supervised method appropriate for UAV image for crop stage classification in small irrigation district.

CP  - OCEANS Conference
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Smart monitoring, planning and decision making for projects in the coastal and nearshore regions requires spatial and temporal understanding on the environmental parameters. Very often time and budget constraints preclude a comprehensive physical and environmental survey data collection exercise. Bathymetry, for example, is typically valid for one timestamp (during the period of data collection), one-dimensional (e.g. single beam surveys), and has sparse resolution in the shallow nearshore regions. In recent years, significant advances in satellite sensor technology and analysis have been developed to produce relevant information for coastal and nearshore monitoring applications at a fraction of both the time and cost of traditional methods. Aquatic Earth Observation techniques have been evolving since the 1970s. The recent advances on satellite sensor hardware and analytics have allowed the once crude methodology to be efficiently applied into practice - in particular very high-resolution satellite data availability and the sound understanding on the physical modelling of the light path from the surface/seafloor to the sensor. Applying over 20 years of continuous research and development, EOMAP has advanced a unique physics-based procedure which allows mapping of shallow water bathymetry, water quality parameters, seafloor characteristics and topography in dense spatial grids. Uncertainties in Earth Observation products are subject to a number of environmental factors that need to be accounted for. At the core of the technology are state-of-the-art algorithms for extracting quantitative environmental information from the aquatic remote sensing signal. Mechanisms for quantifying uncertainties and flagging relative reliabilities are embedded in the algorithms, which include: (1) allowance for coupled atmospheric and in-water parameter retrievals, which includes a correction of the (terrestrial) adjacency effect, critical for the accurate remote sensing of any coastal or inland water body, (2) a physically accurate implementation of the bi-directional effect inside the water column, at the water surface and in the atmosphere, (3) accounting for the full range of reflecting, absorbing and scattering properties of the water body and the interfaces. Those procedures are included in EOMAP's Watcor-X physics-based Satellite-Derived Bathymetry (SDB) software. This paper provides an overview of SDB, demonstrates successful project applications, and describe tools that support coastal and nearshore monitoring projects through the use of the software in the Pacific, Caribbean Sea and Arabian waters. We showcase the capability to monitor spatial seabed changes in highly dynamic environments, and demonstrate the latest technology that jointly incorporates the passive multispectral satellite imagery with complementary active Satellite- Lidar bathymetric data technology using NASA's ICESAT-2 Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS) sensor.

TI  - VISIONS OF THE WORLD AND REPRESENTATIONS OF TIME
T2  - LOGOS
M3  - Article
AB  - From the viewpoint of intellectual history, the displacement and transformation of the cardinal concepts which made orientation in time possible and also expressed a new vision of the world should be central topics. Although at first glance the same concepts seem in use, they nevertheless changed first their content and then their application. In this article five historical examples are examined in order to understand how changes in representations of time have accompanied and structured transformations in worldviews. The first of these comes from the beginnings of Christianity, which established a radically new time hemmed in between two limits: the Incarnation and the Last Judgment (with the Second Coming of Christ). This new time, which shattered the times of paganism, bore within itself a vision of the world with its history conceived as the history of Salvation. The second example comes from the humanists, whose project for constructing a new world by reviving antiquity involved a break with the time before, which was designated and also denigrated as the Middle Ages. The third involves the concept of reform and the Reformation, which ushered in a real bifurcation in time: it signified first a return to an initial state before it turned into the concept of progress that characterizes the European modern era. The fourth example: by attributing judgment to History, the European thinkers of the modern era secularized it and made History the ultimate judge. Revolution provides the final example. Is it the inception of a new time (like the Incarnation) or of a radically different time (like the Apocalypse)? Or perhaps the concept of crisis is sufficient to make sense of it?

TI  - Tropical Dry Forest Resilience to Fire Depends on Fire Frequency and Climate
T2  - Data Archiving and Networked Services (DANS-KNAW)
M3  - Data study
AB  - Wildfires are becoming increasingly frequent and devastating in many tropical forests. Although seasonally dry tropical forests (SDTF) are among the most fire-threatened ecosystems, their long-term response to frequent wildfires remains largely unknown. This study is among the first to investigate the resilience in response to fire of the Chiquitano SDTF in Bolivia, a large ecoregion that has seen an unprecedented increase in fire intensity and frequency in recent years. We used remote sensing data to assess at a large regional and temporal scale (two decades) how fire frequency and environmental factors determine the resilience of the vegetation to fire disturbance. Resilience was measured as the resistance to fire damage and post-fire recovery. Both parameters were monitored for forested areas that burned once (F1), twice (F2), and three times (F3) between 2000 and 2010 and compared to unburned forests. Resistance and recovery were analyzed using time series of the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) index derived from Landsat satellite imagery, and climatic, topographic, and a human developmentrelated variable used to evaluate their influence on resilience. The overall resilience was lowest in forests that burned twice and was higher in forests that burned three times, indicating a possible transition state in fire resilience, probably because forests become increasingly adapted during recurrent fires. Climatic variables, particularly rainfall, were most influential in determining resilience. Our results indicate that the Chiquitano dry forest is relatively resilient to recurring fires, has the capacity to recover and adapt, and that climatic differences are the main determinants of the spatial variation observed in resilience. Nevertheless, further research is needed to understand the effect of the higher frequency and intensity of fires expected in the future due to climate change and land use change, which may pose a greater threat to forest resilience.

TI  - A Review of the Linear Sufficiency and Linear Prediction Sufficiency in the Linear Model with New Observations
T2  - MULTIVARIATE, MULTILINEAR AND MIXED LINEAR MODELS
M3  - Review
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - We consider the general linear model y = X beta + epsilon, denoted as M = {y, X beta, V}, supplemented with the new unobservable random vector y*, coming from y(*) = X-*beta + e(*), where the covariance matrix of y* is known as well as the cross-covariance matrix between y(*) and y. A linear statistic Fy is called linearly sufficient for X-* beta if there exists a matrix A such that AFy is the best linear unbiased estimator, BLUE, for X-*beta. The concept of linear sufficiency with respect to a predictable random vector is defined in the corresponding way but considering the best linear unbiased predictor, BLUP instead of BLUE. In this paper, we consider the linear sufficiency of Fy with respect to y(*), X-*beta, and epsilon(*). We also apply our results into the linear mixed model. The concept of linear sufficiency was essentially introduced in early 1980s by Baksalary, Kala, and Drygas. Recently, several papers providing further properties of the linear sufficiency have been published by the present authors. Our aim is to provide an easy-to-read review of recent results and while doing that,

TI  - Hybrid Predictive Model for Water Quality Monitoring Based on Sentinel-2A L1C Data
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring water quality is an important challenge in both developed and developing countries. Remote sensing data can form a highly frequent dataset with acceptable spatial coverage that can be used to remotely monitor water quality. This paper presents a novel automated model for remotely monitoring water quality to address the problem of insufficient samples and save the time and cost of sample collection. The proposed model estimates both optical and non-optical water quality parameters via Sentinel-2A data. A bio-inspired hybrid model of a Binary Whale Optimization Algorithm (BWOA) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) (BWOA-ANN) is applied to determine the relationship between extracted refiectance values from Sentinel-2A images and analyzed samples. The novelty of this model is to solve two main problems of remote water quality monitoring: poor applicability and low non-optical parameter estimation accuracy. For the first problem, a proposed fully automated model with band selection using the BWOA to automatically select the optimal features (Sentinel-2A bands) that are suitable for each water quality parameter. The second problem is addressed by automatically detecting the relationship between non-optical parameters, such as the total phosphorus, and optical parameters, such as chlorophyll-a. Three datasets with different locations, seasons, and parameters were selected to test the proposed BWOA-ANN. The experimental results demonstrated good regression with a mean R2 value of 0.916 for optical parameters and 0.890 for non-optical parameters. The proposed model was found to outperform the ANN with an R2 value higher by 40% and 52% for the optical and non-optical parameters, respectively.

AB  - An experiment was conducted for the purpose of studying the change in the indicators of vegetation cover and surface temperature in wheat fields in Babylon Governorate, in the Nile region. After we get the satellite images of SEBAL and Landsat-7, we make SEBAL calibration and application, NDVI maps to get output. and surface temperature were obtained for the months of the study. The results showed that the highest average of NDVI values was for the visual captured on 1/27/2020, reaching 0.36, while the lowest average for the visual captured on 8/11/2020 was 0.03. The results also showed that the highest values of soil lane flow for the video captured on 2/5/2020, which amounted to 85.86 Watts m(-2), while the lowest value reached on 27/1/2020, which amounted to 24.86 Watts m(-2). Also an inverse correlation between surface temperature and temperature is found during the study. There was also a positive correlation between the net radiation flux and the NDVI values, and there was an inverse relationship between the soil temperature flux values and the NDVI values, and a positive correlation was found between the perceived heat flux values and the NDVI values.

T2  - APPLIED ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - With the declines in water levels of the Central and Southern High Plains Aquifer, there is a critical need to accurately map the irrigated agriculture in this region as it is the largest user of groundwater resources. The goal of this study was to develop a geospatial database of all areas under the most dominant irrigation system in the region: center pivots. The borders of all center pivots (50,116) were manually digitized using high spatial resolution satellite imagery, delineating the area that can be potentially irrigated by these systems. Most center pivots were comparable in size (ca. 50 ha), with a range of 1 to >230 ha. The areas of digitized center pivots at the state and study area levels were relatively close to estimates of two actual irrigated area products based on automatic land classification. The new layer was also used to extract available data on groundwater level changes since predevelopment (before 1950). Aquifer regions under center pivots in Colorado and Texas had the smallest and largest declines in water level, respectively. The new layer offers advantages in terms of accurately identifying the area covered by center pivots and has potential research and practical applications such as studying adopted practices in response to water level declines, assessing field-scale irrigation uniformity, and extracting distributed soil, weather, and crop data to be used in various precision agriculture applications. The new layer is freely available to the public as supplemental information of this article (https://doi.org/10.13031/14707284).

TI  - Temperature strongly correlates with regional patterns of body size variation in Mediterranean small pelagic fish species
T2  - MEDITERRANEAN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study we consider the applicability of Bergmann's rule to the populations of small pelagic fish species in the Mediterranean Sea. Under Bergmann's rule, body size increases with decreasing temperature and increasing latitude. Although this macroecological pattern in body sizes is well established for many taxa of endotherms and ectotherms, it does not remain universal, and the proposed mechanisms underlying it are multiple and still lack consensus. Here we explored the occurrence of geographical body size clines using measurements of average body sizes of 10 species collected in pelagic trawl hauls carried out during acoustic surveys in the Mediterranean Sea. Bergmann's rule was evaluated by correlating body sizes with latitude and temperature for each species while accounting for potential confounding variables and sampling bias. For 5 species, namely anchovy, sardine, Atlantic chub mackerel, bogue and blue jack mackerel, we demonstrate that they follow Bergmann's rule, with a decline in average body size by about 3.01, 3.43, 3.67, 3.82 and 3.76 % per 1 degrees C of warming, respectively, although this did not translate with an increase in size with latitude. The adherence of these 5 pelagic fish to Bergmann's rules strongly suggest that temperature is a major determinant of their body sizes and enables them to act as sentinel species for identifying the drivers and consequences of warming in the Mediterranean ecosystems.

TI  - Ground Displacement Variation Around Power Line Corridors on the Loess Plateau Estimated by Persistent Scatterer Interferometry
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - As the world's largest producer and consumer of electricity, China has deployed a project to transport energy resources from West China to East China through extra-high-voltage transmission lines to reduce carbon emissions. In the Loess Plateau, the safety of transmission lines has been frequently threatened by natural hazards such as landslides and ground subsidence. However, it is prohibitively expensive to build a monitoring network covering all transmission lines to provide timely early warnings, particularly for sparsely inhabited areas. Based on the large-scale coverage of Sentinel-1 SLC images in IW TOPS mode, we utilized persistent scatterer interferometry to measure the ground target movements along transmission lines with millimeter accuracy. Three regions of interest were selected to reflect the different environmental conditions from the south to north of the Yan'an Region. The displacement variations were compared and evaluated at three spatial scales (region, route, local) from October 2018 to November 2019. On the regional scale, the deformation variation decreased from the south (-36 - 29 mm/yr) to the north (-19 - 20 mm/yr), which was significantly different as determined by the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and can be attributed to the impacts of water-induced subsidence and human activities. On the local scale, the results showed that the deformation rate was less than 10 mm/yr, which suggested a stable status for the experimental line sections. The displacement time series of transmission towers preliminarily revealed seasonal displacement variations, wherein winter and spring were relatively quiet periods. The application of advanced InSAR technologies has excellent prospects in smart grid implementation.

TI  - An Improved Method for Soil Moisture Monitoring With Ensemble Learning Methods Over the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) is a key parameter of the hydrological process, which affects exchanges of water and heat at the land/atmosphere interface. The "trapezoid" (or "triangle") method has been widely applied to SM monitoring based on the pixel distribution within the thermal and optical remote sensing observations. However, the trapezoid method is a linear empirical model highly related to the retrieval accuracy of the surface temperature. In the article, the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data were applied to retrieve SM through an improved method over the Tibetan Plateau. The improved method is integrated with the "trapezoid" model and multiple learning techniques, Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). Meanwhile, RF and XGBoost were both trained with SM target data (the scale of SM and soil temperature) derived from the Tibetan Plateau observations, and the input variables were derived from MODIS observations. Compared with the SM measured, the results showed the root mean square error, the mean absolute error, and the correlation coefficient of the ensemble retrievals were 0.046-0.081 m(3)m(-3), 0.030-0.065 m(3)m(-3), and 0.60-0.87, respectively, which is better than that of the separate model. The ideas to implement the combination of traditional inversion algorithms and machine learning methods are helpful for researches in remote sensing fields.

TI  - Advances in congenital Zika syndrome and its pathogenesis
T2  - CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE
M3  - Article
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV), originally discovered in a sentinel rhesus monkey in Zika valley in Uganda in 1947, has long been viewed as a classical mosquito-borne flavivirus. Due to its association with only a mild and self-limiting illness. ZIKV was a neglected pathogen following 60 years since its identification. However, this virus became a serious public health concern in 2015-2016 outbreak in the Americas because of its association with congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ZIKV outbreak a public health emergency of international concern in 2016.CZS is a pattern of birth defects found among fetuses and babies infected with ZIKV during pregnancy. The main clinical features of CZS are variable including severe microcephaly, decreased brain tissue, meningitis, damage to the back of the eye, hearing defects, arthrogryposis as well as hypertonia restricting body movement soon after birth. Benefiting from close collaboration of the international scientific community. intensive studies have been performed in development of experimental models to gain insights into the molecular basis of CZS in humans. These models include cultured neuroprogenitor stem cells, cortical organoids, especially mouse and nonhuman primate animal models which recapitulate many features of CZS in humans. Thanks to these models, questions related to how ZIKV infection causes congenital disease have been largely answered. For example. ZIKV was found to directly infects human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) of the cerebral cortex. resulting in reduced hNPC proliferation; ZIKV also exhibits tropism for microglia in the brain, leading to production of inflammatory cytokines that inhibit neuronal precursor cell proliferation and differentiation. Additionally, studies have suggested that ZIKV can infect and trigger inflammasome pathways and innate antiviral immune responses of glial cells.While remarkable progress has been made to explain the associated underlying mechanisms, many unanswered key questions remain as follows: (1) How is the placenta in different developmental stage susceptible to ZIKV infection? (2) How is ZIKV transmitted across the placenta to infect the fetus? (3) What is the neurodevelopmental sequelae of congenital infection? (4) How does pre-existing maternal flavivirus immunity impact pregnancy-associated disease? Overall, due to collaborative and multidisciplinary efforts, a large body of knowledge of ZIKV biology has been obtained that has deepened our understanding of the CZS and informed the development of candidate vaccines and therapies. The lessons we have learned from ZIKV could enable effective preparation for the ultimate control of emergence of new congenital viral diseases in the future.

AB  - Remote sensing, as a rapid and large-scale investigation and monitoring technology, widely used in the study of lake evolution and dynamic changes. In general, the evolution of lakes in the arid area is obviously controlled by the distribution of groundwater system. Based on high-resolution satellite data, this paper obtains, the elevations and boundaries of 124 lakes in a longtime series in the Badain Jaran Desert region, and summarizes the pattern of, lake evolution and shrinkage. Besides, the division of the groundwater system in this region has been achieved, by estimating the water volume changes in the two periods, and the analysis of the regional geological structure characteristics. The application results show that over the years, the average elevation of the lake has decreased by 8.79m, the cumulative shrinkage of areas have reached 64.81 km(2), and the total volume of lakes has been reduced by 465 million m(3). The spatial differentiation characteristics of the shrinking lakes are obvious, and the difference in the extent of lake shrinkage is significantly controlled by the regional tectonic basement, which indicates that the regional groundwater system may have a local nested structure. Based on remote sensing method, the groundwater system in Badain Jaran Desert is divided into two primary units in the north and south, and four secondary units in the south.

TI  - Mining Subsidence Monitoring With Modified Time-Series SAR Interferometry Method Based on the Multi-Level Processing Strategy
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The supply of coal is related to the stability of social development in China. Coal mining faces are generally located under farmland and wasteland to avoid destroying the livelihood and property of residents, which seriously affects the selection of permanent scatterer (PS) with time-series interferometric synthetic aperture radar (TS-InSAR) method. The advanced TS-InSAR (ATS-InSAR) method combining PS and distributed scatterer (DS) monitoring modules is a useful tool to increase measurement points. However, the number of DS and the accuracy of measurement are different with different thresholds of temporal coherence. On the basis of ATS-InSAR, we propose a modified method applying the multi-level processing strategy to obtain more reliable deformation information in this paper. 16 sentinel-1A images are used to monitor mining subsidence in Peixian, China. The results of three different methods are cross-verified. Meanwhile, reliable DS pixels are identified by using the thresholding of both temporal coherence and Pearson correlation coefficient through the hierarchical processing. The results show that the deformation of the modified method reveals a large subsidence with the maximum rate of -563 mm/yr. The number of measurement points selected by the modified method is about 6.6 times that of the TS-InSAR method, and 1.3 times that of the ATS-InSAR method. The modified strategy can extract a great number of reliable pixels and reduce error propagation to ensure measurement accuracy. This research offers information to relevant departments for risk management purpose.

TI  - An Improved Method for Phase Triangulation Algorithm Based on the Coherence Matrix Eigen-Decomposition in Time-Series SAR Interferometry
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Time-series SAR interferometry, which combines permanent scatterers (PSs) and distributed scatterers (DSs), has been strongly developed in recent years. Unlike PS, DS corresponds to a natural target whose neighboring pixels share similar reflectivity values. The selection of DS is relevant to the goodness-of-fit value, the estimation of which is based on all possible combined interferometric phases and fails to avoid the adverse effect of low-quality phases. This paper used eigen-decomposition of coherence matrix that was constructed based on the identified homogeneous pixels to perform phase optimization, and then only the interferometric phases with low noise and clear fringes are utilized to measure the goodness-of-fit. 30 Sentinel-1A images were applied to test the improved method of land subsidence monitoring in Beijing, China. The deformation results of different methods were cross verified and the area statistics of the study area were carried out. The results show that the maximum subsidence monitored by the improved method is located in Jinzhan Town with a maximum rate of -109 mm/yr. This improved method extracts more measurement points with accuracy ensured, which is proved to be an effective way to provide the high spatial density of deformation measurements. The land subsidence in this area is mainly caused by the excessive exploitation of groundwater resources. This research provides support for the prevention and control work of relevant departments.

TI  - An Extraction Method for Glacial Lakes Based on Landsat-8 Imagery Using an Improved U-Net Network
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing monitoring of glacial lakes is an indispensable tool for identifying and preventing glacial lake disasters. At present, the existing extraction methods of glacial lakes based on Landsat remote sensing image have achieved remarkable results, but the algorithms used lack the ability to analyze glacial lake spectral and shape and texture features, and require manual design parameters to fine tune the automation of the algorithm. As a result, it cannot mine the depth features of glacier lakes in remote sensing images accurately enough. To address these challenges, this study designed a self-attention mechanism module U-net network that enhances the propagation of features, reduces information loss, strengthens the weight of glacial lake areas, restrains the weight of irrelevant features, reduces the influence of low image contrast on the model, and deals with the variety of pixel categories in glacial lakes. These features improve the performance of the model. Based on Landsat-8 images, we first extracted glacial lakes in large-scale alpine areas using a U-net network model. To make it a self-attention U-net network, we introduced the attention mechanism into the step connection part of the U-net network to adjust feature weight, focus on learning glacial lake features, and strengthen the network to extract the glacial lake features. Finally, we selected the combination of bands 3, 5, and 6 and all bands of Landsat-8 images sing the self-attention U-net network to extract glacial lakes in the study area and compared and analyzed the extraction results. The experimental results and analyses revealed that the proposed method can effectively segment glacial lakes from Landsat-8 remote sensing images. Its effectiveness was proven by different evaluation indices. Compared with a standard U-net network, the true positive for the combination of 3, 5, and 6 bands increased by 15.95% and for all bands by 5.79%. The area under curve for the whole study area reached 85.03% for all bands. The improved U-net network can, thus, meet the real time needs of glacial lake disaster information acquisition.

AB  - High-resolution satellite imagery has proven useful for a broad range of tasks, including measurement of global human population, local economic livelihoods, and biodiversity, among many others. Unfortunately, high-resolution imagery is both infrequently collected and expensive to purchase, making it hard to efficiently and effectively scale these downstream tasks over both time and space. We propose a new conditional pixel synthesis model that uses abundant, low-cost, low-resolution imagery to generate accurate high-resolution imagery at locations and times in which it is unavailable. We show that our model attains photo-realistic sample quality and outperforms competing baselines on a key downstream task - object counting - particularly in geographic locations where conditions on the ground are changing rapidly.

TI  - 왕양명의 심론心論으로 본 한국 전통춤의 내재미 고찰
T2  - Resach of Dance Education
T2  - 한국무용교육학회지
M3  - research-article
AB  - This study aims to examine the aesthetic source by applying the relationship between the embodied philosophy that can realize body and mind integration through dance based on Wang Yang-myeong’s psychological theory. In other words, since Korean traditional dance reveals the mind originating from the inner world of Muja, I would like to argue based on East Asian aesthetic traditions, focusing on the aesthetic worldview of Wang Yang-myeong and the body and mind reached through the training of Muja. Traditional Korean dance requires a proper understanding of the mind and performance based on it, as the direction and content of practice vary depending on the sexual nature of the mind and how you view of the mind. Therefore, I would like to raise the methodology for specific presentations as follows. The aesthetic characteristics of the body and mind inherent in traditional Korean dance are divided into the beauty of envy, the beauty of lightness, the beauty of temple, and the beauty of rain as follows. First, the beauty of traditional Korean dance refers to the artistic spirit and mind function of a Muja person seeking aesthetic values in an unconscious world that he does not know, and this can be seen as the texture of the dance in which Muja’s fermented spirit and dance mind are expressed in temperament and disposition.Second, the “beauty of light white” of traditional Korean dance expresses the naturalness of the dance and reveals its lightness and purity, and is pursued through the mental world of the body and mind. This “beauty of light white” is not a mind that moves along the form of dance, but an aesthetic spirit that expresses the dance of a warrior who is restrained by a mind that flows along with this.Third, the beauty of the temple can be seen as an aesthetic idea that captures the balance of moderation and mind that suppresses the feelings rising from the inside of the warrior as an external tool and technique that naturally reveals the taste of residence by itself.Fourth, the beauty of rain in traditional Korean dance is an aesthetic spirit that lives with an empty heart without putting a mind to the world. For example, crane dance can be seen as the aesthetic spirit of “the beauty of rain” because it contains the flavor of nature and the light and simple taste of dance, away from the artificiality that values formality and form. Therefore, it can be seen that Wang Yang-myeong’s psychological theory has an interdependent relationship with the dance of traditional Korean dance, starting with the mind and spirit filled through foreign objects in the mind of the Muja from the perspective of reception.

AB  - Drought monitoring over paddy field area is an important role as the frequency and intensity of drought due to climate change increases. This studyanalyzed the applicability of drought monitoring on paddy crops using MODIS-based field surveys. As a satellite-based drought index usingevapotranspiration for quantitative drought determination, ESI (Evaporative Stress Index), was applied and calculated through the ratio o f MODIS- basedactual and potential evapotranspiration. For the irrigated areas of Idong, Gosam, Geumgwang, and Madun reservoirs the availability of irrigation watersupply, ponding depth, precipitation, paddy growth were investigated for the paddy field within one grid of MODIS. In addition, the percentile-basedESI drought severity was calculated to compare the growth process of paddy and changes in the drought category of ESI. The Idong area was irrigatedabout a week later than other reservoirs for the period of water supply, transplanting, and water drainage and the ESI drought category tended to bedifferent. The Gosam, Geumgwang, and Madun area expressed moderate drought prior to the farming season, and indicated normal as the water wassupplied. During the water drainage, the drought category intensified, indicating that the water available on land was decreasing. These resultsdemonstrated that the MODIS-based ESI could be an effective tool for agricultural drought monitoring over paddy field area.

TI  - Lymphedema and Post-Operative Complications after Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy versus Lymphadenectomy in Endometrial Carcinomas-A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Lymph node dissection (LND) is recommended as staging procedure in presumed low stage endometrial cancer. LND is associated with risk of lower-extremity lymphedema and post-operative complications. The sentinel lymph node (SLN) procedure has been shown to have high diagnostic accuracy, but its effects on complication risk has been little studied. This systematic review compares the risk of lower-extremity lymphedema and post-operative complications in SLN versus LND in patients with endometrial carcinoma. Methods: A systematic search was conducted in PubMed and Cochrane Library. Results: Seven retrospective and prospective studies (total n = 3046 patients) were included. Only three studies reported the odds ratio of lower-extremity lymphedema after SLN compared to LND, which was 0.05 (95% CI 0.01-0.37; p = 0.067), 0.07 (95% CI 0.00-1.21; p = 0.007) and 0.54 (95% CI 0.37-0.80; p = 0.002) in these studies. The pooled odds ratio of any post-operative complications after SLN versus LND was 0.52 (95% CI 0.36-0.73; I-2 = 48%; p < 0.001). For severe post-operative complications the pooled odds ratio was 0.52 (95% CI 0.28-0.96; I-2 = 0%; p = 0.04). Conclusions: There are strong indications that SLN results in a lower incidence of lower-extremity lymphedema and less often severe post-operative complications compared to LND. In spite of the paucity and heterogeneity of studies, direction of results was similar in all studies, supporting the aforementioned conclusion. These results support the increasing uptake of SLN procedures in endometrial cancer.

TI  - Flow Cytometry for Detection and Quantification of Micrometastases in Sentinel Lymph Nodes from Patients with Primary Melanoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Detection of micrometastases in the regional lymph nodes is one of the most important prognostic factors for melanoma patients. Our aim was to evaluate the suitability of flow cytometry for rapid quantification of disseminated melanoma cells in sentinel lymph nodes (SLN).Methods: 132 SLNs from 104 patients diagnosed with melanoma were analyzed by flow cytometry, utilizing the extracellular marker melanoma-associated chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, in addition to quantitative immunocytology and conventional histopathology, including immunohistochemistry. For quantification, the number of melanoma positive cells per million lymph node cells (disseminated cancer cell density, DCCD) detected by flow cytometry was compared to the DCCD obtained by immunocytology.Results: Compared to histopathology and immunocytology, flow cytometry exhibited a sensitivity of 50% and a specificity of 85%. DCCDs of immunocytology and flow cytometry of the 37 immunocytologically positive SLNs showed a positive correlation (Spearman's rho = 0.7,P < 0.0001). In 10 SLNs from 9 patients with high tumor load, the flow cytometric DCCD was 8-fold higher on average than the immunocytologic DCCD.Conclusions: Although flow cytometry is not yet suitable for early detection of metastatic melanoma, it promises to become a valuable tool for rapidly quantifying tumor load in high-risk patients.

T2  - IMAGE AND SIGNAL PROCESSING FOR REMOTE SENSING XXVII
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Image and Signal Processing for Remote Sensing XXVII
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Commercial smallsats are emerging as a key resource for the remote sensing community, with Planet Labs, Inc. operating the largest constellation. Global coverage is achieved through the combined efforts of many different sensors, but the unique spectral response of each sensor results in radiometric inconsistencies across the constellation. These inconsistencies have been an obstacle for researchers as the images do not match the quality the remote sensing community has come to expect from traditional platforms such as Landsat or Sentinel. Various approaches have been offered to correct cross-sensor radiometric inconsistencies in Planet image acquisitions, with many utilizing high radiometric quality platforms such as Landsat or Sentinel to normalize Planet surface reflectance via a linear transformation. These approaches have largely been applied in homogenous regions, and performance in heterogeneous landscapes is not well understood. The Planet surface reflectance images were transformed linearly using Sentinel-2 surface reflectance as a reference. Transformations were tested in six heterogeneous National Ecological Observatory Network sites where airborne hyperspectral data was available for validation. The probability density functions of the transformed Planet images and the corresponding Sentinel reference images were compared using the D statistic of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The absolute spectral accuracy of the transformed Planet images was evaluated against airborne hyperspectral data. Results show that the transformations were effective in transforming the empirical cumulative distribution functions of the Planet images to be more similar to that of Sentinel regardless of initial offsets.

AB  - From FY 2011 to FY 2019, The BAI of Korea has conducted financial audits toward national government financial statements and have corrected many errors in relation to financial statements. There was little systemic study on analysis of errors of national government financial statements, and yet those were not about the errors themselves or only the study restricted to macroscopic aspect. To minimize the errors, it should be sorted by categories and analyzed specifically, so that the right solution just for the categorized error should be found. This study has categorized and analyzed the errors which are the most typical cases among the valuation of accrual assets and liabilities to ⓛthe error of revaluation of assets, ②the error of the allowance for accounts receivable, ③the error of acquisition, evaluation and disposition of investment securities, ④the error of BTO･BTL regarding social infrastructure, ⑤the error of non-exchange transaction liabilities, and each category has divided again to 1∼7 specific categories to suggest the solutions for specific categories to minimize the errors. The financial audit of BAI has significant meaning that paved the way to categorize the various errors of national government financial statements.

AB  - An Oraimono was a beginner textbook widely used from the end of the Heian (平安) period to the early Meiji (明治) period. As Tenaraijuku (手習塾), an educational institution for the common people increased and education for the common people developed, oraimono containing various terms and contents related to history, geography, and society were created. Currently, there are more than 30,000 types of orimono identified.In the Edo period, it was difficult for ordinary citizens to obtain foreign information because the shogunate blocked the distribution of foreign information. At that time, the term Oraimono was meant as one of the few channels for the general public to obtain information regarding other countries. In addition, after Japan opened in 1854, the interest of Japanese people overseas was reflected, and a wider range of foreign information was included.Among the oraimono texts introduced in   Oraimono Kaidai jiten (往来物解題辞典)  , there are 33 types of oraimono texts that mention Joseon or contain contents related to Joseon. Oraimono were published until the 18th century, mainly with content by which Tongshinsa (通信使) were recognized as tribute. At the age of 19, the main focus was on content that revealed Japan's strengths, such as Imjin･Jeongyu war (壬辰･丁酉戰爭) and tiger hunts, as well as content related to donated goods and donations from the dynasty. From the middle to the late 19th century, the case of Joseon was also dealt with, referring to the geography and the history of Asia or of the history around the world. At the end of the 19th century, an oraimono was published that contained the details of Japan's victory in the Sino-Japanese War. As such, it can be seen that the contents of Oraimono reflected the changes of the times.Through the education of Tenaraijuku, the general public naturally accumulated knowledge by collecting and analyzing information related to culture based on the contents of Oraimono, creating a national image and forming a worldview. It is believed that this was latent through the process of memorization, and later formed Japanese consciousness and served as an axis that maintained the Japanese consciousness from its roots.

TI  - THE MANAGEMENT OF LAND USE CHANGES IN PERI-URBAN AREA OF TIMISOARA CITY USING GIS AND REMOTE SENSING TECHNOLOGIES
T2  - SCIENTIFIC PAPERS-SERIES MANAGEMENT ECONOMIC ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover and Land use monitoring is a very complex process for a better understanding of the dynamics of the landscape over a long period of time. Such monitoring cannot be performed without using geospatial methods in the field of remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). In this paper was analysed the use of land in the Periurban area of Timisoara in the period 1990-2018 based on data provided by the Copernicus program of the European Union. From the analysis of the data from 1990 to 2018, based on the GIS spatial analyses, it can be concluded that approximately 5,700 hectares have changed their destination. The most significant changes were those in the category Pesterers in Non irrigated arable land (21.8% - 1,256 ha) and the change in the category Non irrigated arable land in Discontinuous urban fabric (18.9% - 1,087 ha), leading to the conclusion both of the urbanization of this periurban area of Timisoara Municipality, but also of the development of the agricultural field. Also, in this study were analysed 3 remote sensing indices determined based on Landsat 8 images, data that can be the basis for a monitoring of urban expansion in western Romania.

M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveA retrospective cohort study comparing survival and perioperative outcomes of patients with early vulvar cancer who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy versus standard lymphadenectomyMethodsPatients diagnosed between January 2012 and December 2015 with vulvar squamous cell carcinoma of less than 4 cm in size, with invasion of at least 1 mm, who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy, lymphadenectomy, or both were identified from the National Cancer Database. Overall survival was evaluated following generation of Kaplan-Meier curves and compared with the log-rank test for patients who had at least 1 month of follow-up. A Cox model was constructed to control for confounders.ResultsA total of 1583 patients were identified; 304 patients (19.2%) underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy alone. Sentinel lymph node biopsy utilization increased 13.9% between 2012 and 2015. Patients who underwent sentinel node biopsy alone were less likely to have comorbidities compared with those undergoing lymphadenectomy only or sentinel node biopsy with lymphadenectomy (25.3% vs 32.9% vs 31.9%, p=0.042), had smaller tumors (median 1.6 vs 2.0 vs 2.0 cm, p<0.001), and were less likely to have positive lymph nodes (11% vs 19.6% vs 28.1%, p<0.001). There was no difference in 3 year overall survival between the three groups (86.3% vs 82.1% vs 77.9%, p=0.26). After controlling for age, race, insurance, comorbidities, lymph node metastases, and tumor size, sentinel lymph node biopsy alone was not associated with worse overall survival compared with lymphadenectomy (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.32). The sentinel node only group had shorter inpatient stays compared with lymphadenectomy only (median 1 vs 2 days, p<0.001) and a lower rate of unplanned readmission (1.7% vs 5.0%, p=0.010).ConclusionsThe utilization of sentinel lymph node biopsy is increasing in the management of vulvar cancer and is associated with superior perioperative outcomes without impacting overall survival.

T2  - Boletin de Investigaciones Marinas y Costeras
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to generate inputs for the management of the Sanctuary, the Pacific Territorial Directorate of National Natural Parks began in 2006 a monitoring of oceanographic conditions in the area. Currently, this monitoring has a sampling network of only six stations located 0.93 km (0.5 nm) and 1.85 km (1 nm) from the island, so it is not efficient due to the reduced distance between stations, and insufficient given the large extension of the Sanctuary. Therefore, a sampling network was designed based on Sea Surface Temperature (TSM) data taken in situ and derived from the Modis-Aqua remote sensor. The spatial autocorrelation structure was analyzed through a semi-variance function. The decision to choose the best sampling network among the different sizes was based on the dissimilarity between stations associated with the semi-variance model, on the variance of the prediction error, on the predominant pattern of marine currents during the annual cycle, and on aspects logistics related to the movement limitations of the vessels that carry out oceanographic monitoring in the SFF Malpelo. As a result of considering these variables, a sampling network was obtained with stations every 7.41 km (4 nm) , composed of eight new stations and six of the historical sampling network.

AB  - Ven. Bogak (普覺) Iryeon(一然, 1206∼1289) in the late Goryeo period is the author of ≪SamgukYusa≫, which has been steadily read. This article aims to contemplate about the authenticity of his religious aspect, for it was discussed superficially in former studies, and about the values he had pursued of in Buddha land. He lived through the period of severe military rule in 13th century when invasion of Mongol Empire and of Khitan had occurred. At the age of 31, of being appreciated with his monastic practice and devotion, he confronted the invasion of Mongol then dreaded dying. In reflection of his shallow liberation from life and death, he aspired to evacuate and chanted ‘the spell of Manjushri(文殊五字呪)’. He had a responsive experience then was widely awakened. After the enlightenment, he struggled to practice in diligence to free all sentient beings from suffering. His devotion is emerged throughout the work of ≪SamgukYusa≫, and the consequence appears in ‘Gojoseonjo’. His idealism of Buddha land is implemented by Hwan-in(the God of Heavens), Hwan-ung, a bear, and a tiger. Hwan-ung, after a discussion with his father(Hwan-in) to do ‘Humanitarian ideal(弘益人間)’, descended to human world, then became a selfless spiritual leader of all kinds of human race. Sentient beings, who are deficient and unsatisfied with reality, give effort to grow up for self-actualization. Iryeon eagered for the ideal Buddha land where everything is available by harmonizing their wishes. This study is expected to contribute the revaluation of the world that Iryeon had pledged to pray for and of the historic worth of ≪SamgukYusa≫. Awareness and cultivation of personality will be needed for pedagogues, who should comprehend educatees and encourage them to self-actualize, in the 21st century.

TI  - Detectability of variation in river flood from satellite images
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Floods are major natural disasters that have considerable consequences worldwide. As the frequency and magnitude of flooding are expected to be affected by ongoing climate change, understanding their past changes is important for developing adequate adaptation measures. However, the limited spatiotemporal coverage of flood gauges hinders detection of changes in flooding, particularly in poorly gauged regions. Here, we propose a method using surface water data of river floodplain inundation as a proxy of the magnitude and frequency of flooding. Surface water data Aqua Monitor which represented the probability linear trend changes in land and water surface area based on 30-m Landsat images between 1984-2000 and 2000-2013 was used in this study. The changes in water surface area over the floodplain obtained from Aqua Monitor showed high correspondence with historical trends observed or simulated annual maximum daily discharge, indicating the potential to detect changes in frequency and magnitude of flood from satellite data. In regions where changes could be measured with sufficient satellite images, 29% showed an increase in water surface area in the flood plain, 41% showed a decrease, and 30% showed small or no changes.

TI  - A machine learning approach to model leaf area index in<i> Eucalyptus</i> plantations using high-resolution satellite imagery and airborne laser scanner data
T2  - ANNALS OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - As a forest structural parameter, leaf area index (LAI) is crucial for efficient intensive plantation management. Leaf area is responsible for the energy absorption needed for photosynthetic production and transpiration, both affecting growth. Currently, LAI can be estimated either by remote-sensing methods or ground-based methods. However, unlike ground-based methods, remote estimation provides a cost-effective and ecologically significant advance. The aim of our study was to evaluate whether machine learning algorithms can be used to quantify LAI, using either optical remote sensing or LiDAR metrics in Eucalyptus dunnii and Eucalyptus grandis stands. First, empirical relationships between LAI and remote sensing data using LiDAR metrics and multispectral high-resolution satellite metrics, were assessed. Selected variables for LAI estimation were: forest canopy cover, laser penetration index, canopy relief ratio (from among the LiDAR data), the green normalized difference vegetation index, and normalized difference vegetation index (from among spectral vegetation indices). We compared the accuracy of three machine learning algorithms: artificial neural networks (ANN), random forest (RF) and support vector regression (SVR). The coefficient of determination ranged from 0.60, for ANN, to 0.84, for SVR. The SVR regression methods showed the best performance in terms of overall model accuracy and RMSE (0.60). The results show that the remote sensing data applied through machine learning algorithms provide an effective method to estimate LAI in eucalypt plantations. The methodology proposed is directly applicable for operational forest planning at the landscape level.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 27th International Symposium on Atmospheric and Ocean Optics, Atmospheric Physics

AB  - We consider the problem of construction of nearshore underwater terrain model. While this information is less available, it is the most required for solving various tasks concerning the changes of water level. In the article we show, that it is possible to use the observations of the actual water level changes to obtain the terrain model. We use the freely available satellite images of the resolution of 10 m (in particular Sentinel-2) to observe the shorelines at the subpixel level. As a result we have the shoreline coordinates of higher than 10 m precision. After comparing the shorelines obtained from several overlapping images we have found that the horizontal position of the Sentinel-2 images may have systematic errors of about the size of their pixels, which becomes noticeable for the subpixel processing technique. In the article we suggest a simple algorithm, which allows us to find the horizontal shift vector required to align the contours obtained from two overlapping images. The experimental results show, that after the shift the contours of the shorelines from different images are in good agreement with each other.

TI  - AUTOMATED PANSHARPENING INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY OF SATELLITE IMAGES
T2  - RADIO ELECTRONICS COMPUTER SCIENCE CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - Context. Nowadays, information technologies are widely used in digital image processing. The task of joint processing of satellite image obtained by different space systems that have different spatial differences is important. The already known pansharpening methods to improve the quality of the resulting image, there are new scientific problems associated with increasing the requirements for high-resolution image processing and the development of automated technology for processing the satellite data for further thematic analysis. Most spatial resolution techniques result in artifacts. Our work explores the major remote sensing data fusion techniques at pixel level and reviews the concept, principals, limitations and advantages for each technique with the program implementation of research.Objective. The goal of the work is analyze the effectiveness of the traditional pan-sharpening methods like the Brovey, the wavelet-transform, the GIHS, the HCT and the combined pansharpening method for satellite images of high-spatial resolution.Method. In this paper we propose the information technology for pansharpening high spatial resolution images with automation of choosing the best method based on the analysis of quantitative and qualitative evolutions. The method involves the scaling multispectral image to the size of the panchromatic image; using histogram equalization to adjust the primary images by aligning the integral areas of the sections with different brightness; conversion of primary images after the spectral correction on traditional pansharpening methods; analyze the effectiveness of the results obtained for conducts their detailed comparative visual and quantitative evaluation. The technology allows determining the best method of pansharpening by analyzing quantitative metrics: the NDVI index, the RMSE and the ERGAS. The NDVI index for the methods Brovey and HPF indicate color distortion in comparison with the reference data. This is due to the fact that the Brovey and HPF methods are based on the fusion of three channel images and do not include the information contained in the near infrared range. The RMSE and the ERGAS show the superiority of the combined HSVHCT-Wavelet method over the conventional and state-of-art image resolution enhancement techniques of high resolution satellite images. This is achieved, in particular, by preliminary processing of primary images, data processing localized spectral bases, optimized performance information, and the information contained in the infrared image.Results. The software implementing proposed method is developed. The experiments to study the properties of the proposed algorithm are conducted. Experimental evaluation performed on eight-primary satellite images of high spatial resolution obtained WorldView-2 satellite. The experimental results show that a synthesized high spatial resolution image with high information content is achieved with the complex use of fusion methods, which makes it possible to increase the spatial resolution of the original multichannel image without color distortions.Conclusions. The experiments confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed automated information technology for pansharpening high-resolution satellite images with the development of a graphical interface to obtain a new synthesized image. In addition, the proposed technology will effectively carry out further recognition and real-time monitoring infrastructure.

It argues that a discourse of Chinese exceptionalism has permeated Chinese scholarly circles as a mode of political inquiry into China's international relations and vision of global order. Consequently it argues that a framework of exceptionalism provides a more comprehensive explanation of China's international politics and foreign policy behavior. The chapter also discusses the research design of this study, which is based primarily on elite interviews and discourse analysis. It concludes with an outline of the remaining eight chapters of the book, and how they relate to the broader theme of Chinese exceptionalism.

AB  - The chapter examines "Chinese ways" of thinking about international relations, including how traditional Chinese ideas are accounted for and incorporated into mainstream IR scholarship. It argues that the study of Chinese IR should be viewed within the larger framework of a Chinese self-identity that is perceived as in tension with Western conceptions of the self, society, and statehood. Specifically, I compare the ideas put forth by four Chinese scholars with a few mainstream IR theories (realism, liberalism, and constructivism) and evaluate the extent to which the theories proposed by Chinese scholars can be considered unique and/or better than existing IR theories in terms of their ability to explain certain aspects of Chinese political life.

M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - This chapter examines Chinese national identity as a core element of China's political worldview and claims to exceptionalism. Using a sociological structure of liquid modernity, the chapter analyzes how Chinese national identity is being considered and constructed within domestic conditions and the extent to which it affects social capital and the cohesiveness of Chinese social life. I argue that liquid modernity has resulted in greater fragmentation between Chinese private and public life as well as complicating efforts to construct a unified sense of collective national identity (Chinese-ness). To remedy these challenges, the Chinese government utilizes nationalism to cultivate domestic support by projecting itself as good vis-a-vis the West, which is scapegoated as evil and the root cause of all Chinese ills.

By studying Xi's speeches, this chapter identifies the ways China tries to distinguish itself from the West in the space of domestic governance and the extent to which these ideas reflect the Chinese political worldview and belief in Chinese exceptionalism. Three main themes form the key narratives of both the promoted national image of China and Chinese exceptionalism, namely: (I) the "Chinese dream" and image of China as a flourishing civilization; (II) a progressive and peaceful China; and (III) China as a moral example which should be internationally emulated.

AB  - In this chapter I summarize the discussions of the previous chapters and argue that Chinese exceptionalism provides a more comprehensive interpretation compared to mainstream IR theories in explaining Chinese international politics. However, I also note that China's claims to exceptionalism lack universal appeal and are fundamentally self-serving rather than outward facing. This suggests that Beijing's political worldview reflects a narrow vision of what the international political order should entail and is largely developed with China's own interests in mind.

AB  - This chapter analyzes Chinese responses to the events of the Covid-19 global pandemic and identifies themes of Chinese exceptionalism and Chinese benevolence in Beijing's pandemic-related global interactions. Three core narratives have framed China's response: that China is a responsible power; that China is self-sacrificing; and that China is superior to the West. At the same time, however, the events of the Covid-19 pandemic have also generated considerable criticism of the Chinese government, and how it being perceived as being good and different from the West. All of these factors have long-term implications for China's claim to global leadership and the attractiveness of its political worldview.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to examine the determining factors of the religious ideology formed through 『the comfort of Uchimura's Christians believers』 while examining various aspects of Uchimura's faith after the blasphemous incident.Uchimuraâ€² thoughts formed through 『the comfort of Christians』 relativized the Meiji spirit, the national supremacy, imperialism, and Japanese Orientalism at the time, to materialize the belief in atonement, sown the seeds of evangelicalism centered on the crucifixion, and Uchimura's final worldview, Adventism. And Uchimura's prophetic perspective, which was used as a tool for this, gave birth to agnosticism based on Paul's faith, in his Japanese Christianity, and further functioned as a measure that enabled the independence of Japanese Christianity that does not depend on Western Christianity. In addition, Japan, the object of devotion, is also not an empire Japan where the existing emperor is the master, but a new Japan in which people who do not depend on anyone other than God and themselves, that is, commoners who live in this world only through fair competition and their own strengh, are the masters.In this respect, the comfort of Uchimura's Christian believers can be said to be the place where the reality of two Js, Japan and Jesus, was embodied, and the principle of Uchimura's Japanese Christianity and Pauline faith, which tried to relativize the Meiji spirit, the national ideology of the time, is inherent.

AB  - This study intended to assess the reliability of topographic data using satellite imaging data. The topographical data using actual instrumentation data and satellite image data were established and applied to the rainfall-leak model, S-RAT, and the topographical data and outflow data were compared and analyzed. The actual measurement data were collected from the Water Resources Management Information System (WAMIS), and satellite image data were collected from MODIS observation sensors mounted on Terra satellites. The areas subject to analysis were selected for two rivers with more than 80% mountainous areas in the Han River basin and one river basin with more than 7% urban areas. According to the analysis, the difference between instrumentation data and satellite image data was up to 50% for peak floods and up to 17% for flood totals in rivers with high mountains, but up to 13% for peak floods and up to 4% for flood totals. The biggest difference in the video data is Landuse, which shows that MODIS satellite images tend to be recognized as cities up to 60% or more in urban streams compared to WAMIS instrumentation data, but MODIS satellite images are found to be less than 5% error in forest areas.

TI  - Rice yield estimation in An Giang province, the Vietnamese Mekong Delta using Sentinel-1 radar remote sensing data

AB  - Rice production in Vietnam has been developing rapidly and sustainably in recent years, contributing to ensuring national food security. However, it is facing the effect of climate change, sea-level rise, salinity intrusion, drought, and flood which threatens food production, especially in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta. For this reason, building a tool that allows estimating rice yield is necessary. SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) remote sensing data from Sentinel-1 satellites is provided by European Space Agency (ESA) with no cost, large coverage, and high spatio-temporal resolution, which has the advantage of observation in cloudy, foggy, rainy weather and independent of solar radiation. Therefore, this data is suitable for rice monitoring in countries with tropical monsoon climate like Vietnam. This paper presents the results of estimating the Winter-Spring rice yield in 2018 by using multitemporal Sentinel-1 data with C-band. The estimated rice yield was compared with the in-situ yield, which shows that the average values of the samples of estimated and surveyed yield were equivalent with 6.5 ton/ha and 6.6 ton/ha respectively, and the standard deviation between the estimated and surveyed yield was 0.80 ton/ha. The results demonstrate the applicability of the multitemporal SAR Sentinel-1 data for estimating rice yield in the study area, An Giang province, the Vietnamese Mekong Delta.

TI  - Fully Automated Detection of Supraglacial Lake Area for Northeast Greenland Using Sentinel-2 Time-Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The usability of multispectral satellite data for detecting and monitoring supraglacial meltwater ponds has been demonstrated for western Greenland. For a multitemporal analysis of large regions or entire Greenland, largely automated processing routines are required. Here, we present a sequence of algorithms that allow for an automated Sentinel-2 data search, download, processing, and generation of a consistent and dense melt pond area time-series based on open-source software. We test our approach for a similar to 82,000 km(2) area at the 79 degrees N Glacier (Nioghalvfjerdsbrae) in northeast Greenland, covering the years 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019. Our lake detection is based on the ratio of the blue and red visible bands using a minimum threshold. To remove false classification caused by the similar spectra of shadow and water on ice, we implement a shadow model to mask out topographically induced artifacts. We identified 880 individual lakes, traceable over 479 time-steps throughout 2016-2019, with an average size of 64,212 m(2). Of the four years, 2019 had the most extensive lake area coverage with a maximum of 333 km(2) and a maximum individual lake size of 30 km(2). With 1.5 days average observation interval, our time-series allows for a comparison with climate data of daily resolution, enabling a better understanding of short-term climate-glacier feedbacks.

TI  - Mapping invasive alien trees in water towers: A combined approach using satellite data fusion, drone technology and expert engagement
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Operationalising advances in remote sensing for invasive alien plant management remains a major challenge, despite its proven value globally. There is also a lack of detailed remote sensing studies in water towers, for example the southwestern Cape of South Africa, where invasive alien trees threaten water security. There is a need for cost-effective, easy to use, inclusive and repeatable approaches to map invasive alien plants to inform management. We use a novel, transdisciplinary approach, combining Google Earth Engine's processing power, freely available Sentinel imagery (fusion of Sentinel-1 and -2), expert engagement (including researchers, managers and decision makers), drone technology and field trips, to provide an accurate and up-to-date understanding of the occurrence and density of invasive alien trees in an important water tower for the southwestern Cape of South Africa at a 20 m resolution. We explored the efficacy of combining bands and indices with the highest alien tree discriminatory power based on a statistical spectral analysis of 10 of the 13 Sentinel-2 bands and 39 relevant indices with various other data inputs (e.g. Sentinel-1, topographic information) in six classifications using robust and advanced non-parametric image classifiers. All six classifications performed well, with invasive alien trees discriminated from surrounding shrublands with 89-92% accuracy, and alien tree groups discriminated with 74-84% accuracy. Data fusion of Sentinel-1 and -2 and inclusion of topographic information (elevation and landform) marginally improved the accuracy statistics. However we caution against over-reliance on accuracy statistics given the relatively small sample sizes typically used in multispectral classifications. The rich spectral information contained in the red edge and shortwave infrared parts of the spectrum were critical for alien tree discrimination as the key traits distinguishing these alien trees from indigenous shrubland vegetation are differences in biomass and water usage. Discrimination between different types of alien trees and discriminating alien trees from native vegetation with high water use (e.g. wetlands and mountain forests) remained a challenge for the given spatial and spectral resolutions of Sentinel-2 imagery, despite reasonable accuracy statistics. Though the results present a significant advance for the region, given currently available out-dated maps, engagement with decision makers showed that managers require even more detailed products for alien tree management.

T2  - ANNUAL REVIEW OF BIOMEDICAL DATA SCIENCE, VOL 4
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Data from satellite instruments provide estimates of gas and particle levels relevant to human health, even pollutants invisible to the human eye. However, the successful interpretation of satellite data requires an understanding of how satellites relate to other data sources, as well as factors affecting their application to health challenges. Drawing from the expertise and experience of the 2016-2020 NASA HAQAST (Health and Air Quality Applied Sciences Team), we present a review of satellite data for air quality and health applications. We include a discussion of satellite data for epidemiological studies and health impact assessments, as well as the use of satellite data to evaluate air quality trends, support air quality regulation, characterize smoke from wildfires, and quantify emission sources. The primary advantage of satellite data compared to in situ measurements, e.g., from air quality monitoring stations, is their spatial coverage. Satellite data can reveal where pollution levels are highest around the world, how levels have changed over daily to decadal periods, and where pollutants are transported from urban to global scales. To date, air quality and health applications have primarily utilized satellite observations and satellite-derived products relevant to near-surface particulate matter <2.5 mu m in diameter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Health and air quality communities have grown increasingly engaged in the use of satellite data, and this trend is expected to continue. From health researchers to air quality managers, and from global applications to community impacts, satellite data are transforming the way air pollution exposure is evaluated.

TI  - Measuring land surface temperature, near-infrared and short-wave infrared reflectance for estimation of water availability in vegetation
T2  - METHODSX
M3  - Article
AB  - The vegetation water status is a crucial variable for modelling of drought impact, vegetation productivity and water fluxes. Methods for spatial estimation of this variable still need to be improved. The integration of remotely sensed data of land surface temperature (LST) and water vegetation indices based on near-infrared (NIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) reflectance for estimation of vegetation water content and water available for evapotranspiration require more analysis. This study contains a detailed method and measurements of LST, NIR and SWIR reflectance of soybean, corn and barley taken in field campaigns in central Argentine Pampas and laboratory with a ST PRO Raytek (8-14 mu m) and a spectrometer SVC HR-1024i (0.35 and 2.5 mu m). Also, relative water content of leaves was measured in laboratory during the dehydration process. This method and dataset could be also used for researching other wavelengths between 0.35 and 2.5 mu m as indicator of water vegetation status (e.g. solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence, photosynthesis).Procedures useful to measure field spectra of vegetation are presented.Not only the traditional method to measure leaves spectra in laboratory, but also in field were applied.The method allows the integration of spectra and thermal data as a proxy of vegetation water status.

M3  - research-article
AB  - This article has examined the implications and aims of Hwanghae-do Jinjinogi-gut based on muga, or shaman songs along with the present status of practicing gut. Hwanghae-do Jinjinogi-gut is practiced while the bereaved family is yet to get over the grief of the death of their member, which places its highest priority on leading the deceased to the heaven. <Youngsilgamheunggeori> is a gutgeori dedicated to the appearance of the deceased. This perception is seen in demonstrating several objects that were used by the deceased while he or she was alive, and the muga itself also focuses on the deceased as well. <Suwangjeseokgeori> prepares for the deceased to go to the heaven with the teachings of Suwangjeseok. Both gutgeoris of < Youngsilgamheunggeori> and <Suwangjeseokgeori> are dedicated to the deceased while the center is still in this life. Departure for the heaven is suggested but that does not mean that the deceased leaves for the heaven. <Sajageori> is a shaman tune that that clearly shows the deceased's departure from this life to the heaven. The angel of death comes down and connects this world to the heaven, enabling the deceased to go to the heaven. <Daenaerim> and <Serving Clean Spirit> portrays the process of the deceased saying goodbye to the bereaved family before leaving for the heaven. <Dividing Road> demonstrates the deceased leaving for the heaven and confirms that the deceased has properly left to the heaven by delivering visual representation of a series of processes of leaving for the heaven. <Madanggeori> is the final part of the gut. Unlike other guts, Jinjinogi-gut repeats the meaning of ushering ancestors to follow the path of the deceased to the heaven instead of inviting various evil spirits. This is how Hwanghae-do Jinjinogi-gut focuses strictly on the deceased and that is why the deceased play an important role of leaving for the heaven by themselves. In this regard, it serves as a feast without <Bari Princess> available in Seoul gut, indicating that Hwanghae-do gut has been less influenced by the Buddhist worldview than Seoul gut.

TI  - Demand-Based Adaptive Multi-Beam Pattern and Footprint Planning for High Throughput GEO Satellite Systems
T2  - IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF THE COMMUNICATIONS SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The current broadband coverage area requisites and the expected user demand is satisfied by the state of the art satellite industry by using multiple spot beams of high throughput satellites with fixed multi-beam pattern and footprint planning. However, in recent years, new mobile broadband users with dynamic traffic demand are requesting for services in remote geographical locations such as air (aeroplanes) and water (ships). Furthermore, the expected demand varies with time and geographical location of the users. Hence, a practical approach to meet such heterogeneous demand is to plan adaptive beams to the satellites equipped with beamforming capabilities. In this paper, we study the state of the art fixed multi-beam pattern and footprint plan and show its drawbacks to support the non-uniformly distributed user terminals and varying traffic demands. To end this, we propose an adaptive multi-beam pattern and footprint plan where we design spot beams with flexible size and position based on the spatial clustering of the users in order to increase the flexibility of the high throughput satellite system. Numerical simulations demonstrate the high system performance of the proposed methodology.

AB  - The study aims to present only government offices with preemptive responses to the paradigm shift in transnational terrorism and security threats facing the world today. The term New Terrorism was coined by the Land Institute of the United States, and we want to look at the paradigm that has changed since the September 11 attacks, and find a strong response to terrorism at important national facilities. In the ever-changing international situation, there are no terrorist attacks caused by Islamic terrorist groups in the Middle East, but there are situations in which terrorists and foreign terrorists are hiding in the country, and there are lonely wolves such as racial chauvinism, schizophrenia, social discontent, Insel, etc. Under these circumstances, the government sought to protect government office facilities and further study measures for the safety of the people by preparing measures to preemptively respond to terrorism.Terrorism is now looming a global security threat that is hard to withstand in any country or society today, and as the worldview of terrorism, ideologies and means of terrorism, and methods of terrorism are constantly changing, the recent appearance of conflicts and confrontations between countries is a good indication of the problem. Therefore, the activities of appropriate diagnosis, search for solutions, and response efforts against terrorism are more important than ever in this changed environment. Moreover, as recent terrorism in many parts of the world is characterized by unpredictability and diversification, the world will surely continue to wage war without a front that is hard to predict.The purpose of this study is to reflect this threatening situation and to present appropriate countermeasures through realistic analysis techniques, establish a task force to respond strongly, and provide basic data for recognizing terrorist responses in the building.

TI  - GARMENTS OFFERINGS IN THE CHERNIAKHIV-SINTANA-DE-MURES CULTURE INHUMATIONS
T2  - ARHEOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - In a number of the Cherniakhiv-Sintana-de-Mures culture inhumations items or sets of garment or footwear were found separately from the skeleton, next to it or in the grave filling. According to the classification of grave goods by its functional purpose, a garment belongs to personal things of the deceased. The garment has never been considered as an independent sociological feature, but only together with vessels-"offerings".In the article, it is hypothesized that placement of additional item or set of garments or footwear in a grave is an independent sociological feature - a feature of a high social ranked grave.The additional items or sets of garment or footwear were found in nine graves (their descriptions are given in the Appendix). The garment with a fibula and probably a cloak were placed in men's graves (Nos. 3, 7), while clothes with two fibulae, like a Roman stola - in graves of women of different ages (Nos. 1, 2, 4, 6, 9). Clothes, a bag or a pair of shoes were placed next to the head of an elderly woman (No. 8).The listed burials belong to the period not earlier than the third phase of the Cherniakhiv culture relative chronology, proposed by Ye. L. Horokhovskyi, i.e. to the second third of the 4th century and later.Most of the discussed graves belong to the 3rd and 3rd"a" archaeological-sociological types after N. M. Kravchenko. The exception is a grave of Independents No. 13, which belongs to the 2nd type after N. M. Kravchenko.The placement in the grave of a garment stock or footwear was a reflection of intention to provide the deceased with necessary things - a manifestation of care for the deceased or conversely of the intention to dispose from his/her personal things.The question about the Cherniakhiv-Sintana-de-Mures culture footwear, about ideas and beliefs connected with it, deserves special attention.

TI  - Critical knowledge gaps and research priorities in global soil salinity
T2  - ADVANCES IN AGRONOMY, VOL 169
M3  - Review
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Approximately 1 billion ha of the global land surface is currently salt-affected, representing about 7% of the earth's land surface. Whereas most of it results from natural geochemical processes, an estimated 30% of irrigated lands globally are salt-affected through secondary human-induced salinization. Application of lower quality, alternative irrigation water is further threatening expansion of the areal extent of soil salinity, in addition to climate change causing increases of salt-water intrusion in coastal areas and increasing crop water requirements. The reduced availability of freshwater resources for irrigation, the continued reduction of the world's cultivated agricultural area by land degradation and urbanization, in conjunction with a growing world population further complicates the problemseeking sustainable solutions. This scoping review prioritizes critical knowledge gaps and makes recommendations for 10 priorities in soil salinity research toward a sustainable and productive agricultural system for a food-secure future world. We also include basin-specific case studies that illustrate progress of the world's major irrigated areas in addressing impacts of soil salinization. By identifying research priorities, we seek to accelerate enhanced research funding to bring new knowledge and innovative solutions toward mitigation of soil salinity impacts. We further want to inspire the science community to develop new directions in salinity research.

TI  - Drug-Induced Interstitial Lung Disease after Anthracycline-Combined Chemotherapy for Breast Cancer: A Case Report and Literature Review
T2  - CASE REPORTS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Drug-induced interstitial lung disease (DILD) has been occasionally reported with various causative drugs. In the context of breast cancer, anthracycline infrequently causes pulmonary adverse events. We report a 67-year-old woman with cT2N0M0 triple-negative breast cancer who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy with anthracycline-combined chemotherapy with pegfilgrastim. She developed fever, cough, and shortness of breath after 21 days of the scheduled fourth cycle of anthracycline. Computed tomography revealed drug-induced interstitial pneumonia. Prednisolone (1 mg/kg) was administrated and gradually decreased. Thereby, interstitial pneumonia quickly improved. Partial resection of the left breast and sentinel lymph node biopsy were performed, and we diagnosed ypT1bN0. The patient received 4 cycles of taxane and hypofractional radiotherapy and survived without any recurrences over the following 37 months. We report a rare case of DILD due to anthracycline-combined chemotherapy. Twenty-five cases of DILD with breast cancer after administration of anthracycline have been reported so far. However, 14 cases occurred during taxane. Most of the cases had remission by steroid treatment. The patients with respiratory symptoms during chemotherapy should be suspicious of not only infection but also DILD. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by S. Karger AG, Basel

TI  - Hyperspectral surface reflectance reconstruction based on non- negative matrix factorization and multispectral results
T2  - AOPC 2021: OPTICAL SPECTROSCOPY AND IMAGING
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on AOPC - Optical Spectroscopy and Imaging
CL  - Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - Different from the principal component analysis (PCA), non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) can provide more direct interpretation owning to the non-subtractive combinations of non-negative basis vectors, and many practical problems also require non-negative basis vectors rather than the orthogonal vectors with alternating positive and negative. In this study, we develop a hyperspectral surface reflectance reconstruction method based on NMF and multispectral results in several wavelength bands. In order to test our spectral reconstruction method, the spectral datasets of typical surface types are extracted from the spectral library of John Hopkins University (JHU), which include the soil, vegetation, manmade materials, sedimentary fine and coarse rock. The prior surface reflectance or emissivity results are selected from only four wavelength bands (2.13, 3.75, 3.96, 4.05 mu m) from shortwave infrared to Mid-infrared, which can be easily obtained from the surface product of Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Based on the JHU spectral dataset and NMF, the hyperspectral surface reflectance in the spectral range of 2-5 mu m with the step of 25 nm can be reconstructed consistently. In addition, the hyperspectral reconstruction effects by NMF are quantitatively investigated, in which the root mean square error and the mean absolute error is about 0.016 and 0.01, respectively.

M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal distributions of CO2 obtained from the greenhouse gases observing satellite (GOSAT) over China from 2010 to 2017 and influence factors are presented in this study. It shows an annual increase and a seasonal cycle. The CO2 annual growth rate was about 2.34 ppm year(-1), with the highest value being in spring and the lowest in autumn. Yearly variations in the CO2 over eight economic regions are prominent, the regions with higher CO2 concentration also have higher increase rate. Some factors affecting variations in CO2 are analysed in this study. There is a stronger negative relationship between CO2 and MODIS vegetation products. Population density and energy consumption are anthropogenic factors in increasing CO2 concentration, and CO2 variation shows a high correlation with population density in eight economic regions [coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.76]. CO2 and energy consumption also have a better correlation (R-2 > 0.66) in the most regions.

AB  - Ambient air quality (AQ) is a recurrent issue in cities, exacerbated in low- and middle-income countries. Global AQ impacts on health can be assessed using an aggregated health risk indicator (Sigma RIs), derived from in-situ stations, chemical transport models (CTMs) or satellite data.AQ monitoring is well covered in the city of Munich (Germany): in-situ stations, POLYPHEMUS CTM with three domains, CAMS-Reanalysis of the regional model ensemble and satellite data from MODIS. From these data sets, the Sigma RIs was calculated considering four major air pollutants (NO2, PM10, PM2.5, O-3), using their respective relative risk for the mortality-all causes health end-point. Then, the Sigma RIs from the models and the satellite data were compared to the Sigma RIs(in-situ) by means of basic statistics, time series and violin plots and the mean relative difference (MRD).Using the Sigma RIs allows to further observe the contribution of individual pollutants to the index. For the mortality all causes health end point between 2017 and 2018, ground observations and CTMs show an increase of ca. 12-13% when exposed to ambient air pollution. The difference between traffic and background stations can be observed: Sigma RIs(in-situ) mean is higher at the traffic station than at the background stations. This order is however reversed when considering Sigma RIs mean from the models. The four CTMs simulate the Sigma RIs well and its seasonality is also represented. Most of the data are spread around the mean and the median for all data sets and stations with an overall distribution skewed towards high values. With 0.5<r(2)<0.6, POLYPHEMUS/DLR yields medium correlation, regardless the domain, while CAMS-Reanalysis returns high correlation (r(2) approximate to 0.8) for all the studied stations. The MRD indicates an underestimation of the Sigma RIs by CAMS-Reanalysis, while POLYPHEMUS tends to overestimate it for the larger domains (positive MRD).The difference in the r(2) between the two CTMs is due to their singularities: POLYPHEMUS/DLR uses free runs while CAMS-Reg uses a data assimilation process with station measurements (among them the two studied background stations). The overestimation of Johanneskirchen by POLYPHEMUS/DLR comes from its location nearby a power plant and the wind direction. Finally, the very high values in early 2017 can be explained by fireworks, which are not reproduced by models.It is show in this study that estimating a global health risk from air pollution is possible using in-situ measurements, models and satellite. Finally, satellite data can be helpful to assess the Sigma RIs worldwide.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Neoadjuvant therapy (NT) is one of the possible oncological treatment strategies for breast cancer. Its aim is to achieve down-staging of the tumour in the breast and axilla and thus the possibility of converting mastectomy to a breast-conserving procedure, and also to allow for a less burdensome and more targeted operation of the axillary lymph nodes. The role of the radiologist is to utilise imaging procedures for precise local staging of the malignancy prior to NT, to evaluate the effect of treatment during its course and upon its completion, and to perform restaging of the cancer in the breast and axilla.CASE REPORTS: The authors present three case reports of female patients with breast cancer who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT). They describe the diagnostic procedure and imaging methods used to establish local staging of the cancer prior to treatment, to monitor the disease during the course of treatment, and to perform restaging of the cancer after completing NCT. The radiological response after NCT completion was correlated with the pathological response.CONCLUSION: Correct determination of the extent of the cancer in the breast and axilla by the radiologist before NT and precise histological analysis of the tumour by the pathologist are fundamental for selecting the appropriate treatment for patients at the multidisciplinary breast tumour board.

AB  - The evolution of cooperative behaviour is a major area of research among evolutionary biologists and behavioural ecologists, yet there are few estimates of its heritability or of its evolutionary potential and long-term studies of identifiable individuals are required to disentangle genetic and non-genetic components of cooperative behaviour. Here we use long-term data on over 1800 individually recognisable wild meerkats (Suricata suricatta) collected over 30 years and a multi-generational genetic pedigree to partition phenotypic variation in three cooperative behaviours (babysitting, pup feeding and sentinel behaviour) into individual, additive genetic and other sources, and to assess their repeatability and heritability. In addition to strong effects of sex, age and dominance status, we found significant repeatability in individual contributions to all three types of cooperative behaviour both within and across breeding seasons. Like most other studies of the heritability of social behaviour, we found that the heritability of cooperative behaviour was low. However, our analysis suggests that a substantial component of the repeatable individual differences in cooperative behaviour that we observed was a consequence of additive genetic variation. Our results consequently indicate that cooperative behaviour can respond to selection, and suggest scope for further exploration of the genetic basis of social behaviour. .csv files contain processed phenotypic data and individual/group-level information. .rds files are for the R processing environment.

AB  - In this paper we used two methodologies of remote sensing data and its derived variables for the estimation of Evapotranspiration (ET). In the first method, the sensible heat flux was calculated by combining air temperature and the remotely sensed surface temperature using Thornthwaite method. We applied and evaluated the ET successfully in the Al-Ain area of United Arab Emirates. In the Second method, vegetation index derived using Landsat 8 OLI was used for the determination of surface resistance for latent heat. To derive the predicted ET using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), regression analyses were conducted between data derived from satellites, published field meteorological stations data and ET values. From the collected variables of interest, we have also studied the bivariant density estimation curves. It is evident from the patterns of multimodal data that the data belong to different locations with different ET status. It was also observed that wind velocity (U) seems to be decreasing with increasing ET and rest all variable were increasing with increasing ET, which depend on the saturation vapor pressure (SVP). From this approach, we confirmed that the prediction of ET is achievable from the remote sensing data. It is also confirmed that the predicted ET results gained from the NDVI regression functions were comparable to the ET values obtained by the previously published field data. The results showed that indirect application of remotely sensed vegetation index could be used for the ET determination.

TI  - Estimating heat storage in urban areas using multispectral satellite data and machine learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A satellite-derived hysteresis model is presented for estimate heat storage in urban areas. Storage heat flux, one of the dominant terms in the urban surface energy budget (USEB), is largely unknown despite its critical relationship to various urban environmental processes. This study introduces a novel technique for quantifying heat storage by relating multispectral satellite radiances and geophysical properties to ground-truth residual heat storage computed with flux instruments. Gradient-boosted regression trees serve as the method of maximizing the relationship between satellite data and flux measurements. Several flux networks are used to train and validate the model over varying land cover types, which strengthens the robustness of the model. The model performs well under variable weather conditions such as cloudy rainy days. In comparison with other studies, the RMSE and MAE values were found to be lower than some ground-to-ground studies, and is one of few satellite-derived methods that computes direct comparison over a range of different land cover types.

M3  - Article
AB  - HRUBON, Anton. Pioneers of Clerical Fascism? Mythical Language of Revolutionary Political Catholicism in Slovakia and Visions of a "New Nation". Clerical fascism is among the vaguest and most corrupted terms in the political lexicon. As a result of abuse by the Communist regime for political purposes, it became an ideological label and insult after 1948. The present study attempts to revive this devalued term over the background of an analysis of the political language and ideology of Rodobrana, considered the first fascist movement in Slovakia (1923 - 1929). The study defines clerofascist ideology as a system of opinions, ideas and worldviews, functionally combining clericalism and fascism into a coherent worldview. The presented case study proves that, although clerical fascism has never formed the basis of any European regime, several variously significant political movements, including the Slovak Rodobrana, met its definition criteria. After outlining the methodology and general continental European context of the issue, the study analyses the forms of militarization of Catholicism in Slovakia after 1918, the formation of the concept of mystical ultra-nation, as well as the Rodobrana's vision of establishing a new religious community. The paper pays special attention to the work performed by the myth of purity in the political language of the Rodobrana, the political instrumentalization of Christ and his sacred blood in the context of creating the "revived nation".

TI  - Time-Series InSAR Technology for Ascending and Descending Orbital Images to Monitor Surface Deformation of the Metro Network in Chengdu
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past decade, Chengdu has become one of the fastest growing urban centers in China. However, the massive expansion of the infrastructure and the transportation network has resulted in surface subsidence which typically presents as a hard to detect geological hazard. As an all-day, all-weather, high-precision, and wide-range surface deformation monitoring tool, interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technology has unique advantages with respect to monitoring long-period surface subsidence. In this article, the Sentinel satellite data from March 2018 to March 2021 for the ascending and descending orbits are used to obtain the deformation fields of Chengdu's surface in two different satellite line of sight directions using the time-series InSAR technique. The results are then used to invert the surface deformation field in the vertical direction and analyze it via the Peck and Logistic models. In addition, wavelet transform technology was used to investigate the relationship between deformation and climate. The results show that the surface deformation in Chengdu is stable, and the rate of deformation in the center of the urban area is within 5 mm/year. The main reason for the emergence of ground settlement funnels is the construction of subways and real estate development. It was also observed that the deformation of the buildings shows a clear periodic pattern, which is closely related to the seasonal rainfall and temperature in Chengdu.

TI  - Micromilling of Ti6Al4V alloy assisted by plasma electrolytic oxidation
T2  - JOURNAL OF MICROMECHANICS AND MICROENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper develops a novel processing method of plasma electrolytic oxidation-assisted micromilling (PEOAM). Electrolyte solutions with KH2PO4, NaAlO2, or Na2SiO3 as the main component are designed, and three types of oxide films are grown on the surface of a Ti6Al4V alloy in situ by means of plasma electrolytic oxidation. The morphology and composition of the oxide films are characterized by scanning electron microscope and energy dispersive spectrum. Additionally, the cutting force and surface roughness of PEOAM are measured by dynamometer and white light interferometer, respectively. A comparison between PEOAM and conventional micromilling in terms of cutting force, tool wear, chips, and surface roughness is conducted, with results showing that oxide films with about 20 mu m thickness are loose and porous, their hardness decreasing to a minimum of 1.12 GPa, which corresponds to 23.3% of the original hardness value. At the axial cutting depth of 18 mu m, compared to the F-x, F-y, and F-z values of the Ti6Al4V alloy substrate, the average milling forces of the NaAlO2 oxide film are the most significantly reduced (35.1%, 15.7%, and 94.8% of the original values, respectively). At the axial cutting depth of 25 mu m, the surface roughness (R-a) value of PEOAM is reduced by 0.08-0.12 mu m. Consequently, under the same cutting parameters, PEOAM can effectively reduce the cutting force, prolong the service life of the tool, and improve surface quality.

TI  - Improved Mapping of Long-Term Forest Disturbance and Recovery Dynamics in the Subtropical China Using All Available Landsat Time-Series Imagery on Google Earth Engine Platform
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - After implementations of many economic and forestry policies during recent 30 years, forest cover in China has experienced significant changes. The fine scale and long-term information on forest temporary (disturbance) loss, persistent loss (deforestation), and gains (afforestation/reforestation) will provide a guide for forest management and policies at regional scale. Using Jiangxi Province as a pilot study region, here we assessed forest cover dynamics in the subtropical China during 1986-2019 by integrating time-series Landsat images, Landsat-based Detection of Trends in Disturbance and Recovery algorithm and Random Forest classifier on the Google Earth Engine Platform. The accuracy assessment indicated a high overall accuracy (>90%) and Kappa coefficient (>0.9) for both forest gain and loss detections as evaluated against various sources of plot-level sample data and the existing global forest change product. The total forest loss area was 18 697.79 km(2), with persistent loss area of 3394.31 km(2) due to land conversion during 1986-2019, while persistent (net) forest gain area was 45 656.96 km(2), accounting for 57.70% of the forest area in 1986. Forest loss area exhibited large interannual variations, but showed a general increase trend from 1986 to 2019. The annual variation patterns of forest gain and loss area were associated with the changes in forestry policies and large disturbance events. Our assessments on the long-term and fine scale forest dynamic patterns will help evaluate the effectiveness of forest management practices and forestry polices on forest resource sustainability, and climate change and greenhouse gases mitigation in Jiangxi Province and China.

TI  - Phytoplankton "Missing" Absorption in Marine Waters: A Novel Pigment Compensation Model for the Packaging Effect
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - The packaging effect (Q(a)*) of phytoplankton pigments can account for over half of the variability in the phytoplankton absorption coefficient (a(ph)) in oceanic waters. Given the significance of a(ph) in many marine biogeochemical and environmental processes, exploring the packaging effect on absorption properties is a crucial task. In the present study, two pigment compensation models for quantifying the packaging effect are developed for Case I and Case II waters using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) derived pigments and a(ph) data. The Case I model is based on data from the NOMAD data set from the Atlantic Ocean, and the Case II model is based on data taken in the marginal seas of China. Phytoplankton "missing" absorption is derived by subtracting the reconstructed a(ph) without the packaging effect from the measured a(ph). Our proposed models use the established relationships between "missing" absorption and specific absorption coefficients of pigment groups without the packaging effect to quantify pigment group concentrations. Validation using independent in situ data sets demonstrates that significant improvements are achieved to quantify the packaging effect, especially for waters under abnormal packaging effect conditions (Q(a)* > 1), where the mean ratio of normal Q(a)* increasing largest from 40% to 90% in 455 nm in Case I water and from 70% to 100% in 520 nm in Case II water. Applying the proposed models to satellite data displays the spatial distributions of the packaging effect in the Atlantic Ocean and the marginal seas of China, as delegates of Case I and II waters, respectively. The Q(a)* intensity negatively covaries with the chlorophyll-a distribution. This study shows the spatial variability of the packaging effect from satellite observations for the first time.

AB  - China's FengYun-3E meteorological satellite was launched on July 5, 2021. The GNOS-II onboard the satellite is a payload that can combine GNSS reflectometry (GNSS-R) and GNSS radio occultation (GNSS RO). It can also receive signals from GPS and BeiDou (BDS) satellites. This paper introduces the GNSO-II payload and its early on-orbit GNSS-R wind product. The characteristics of reflectometry using BDS signals was discussed. The early on-orbit wind product was validated by the comparison with ECMWF reanalysis wind data. The GNSS-R winds retrieved by GPS and BDS signals were compared.

TI  - Mapping of urban typical land covers using GaoFen-5 data: Linear spectral unmixing based on a novel spectral analysis technique
T2  - SEVENTH SYMPOSIUM ON NOVEL PHOTOELECTRONIC DETECTION TECHNOLOGY AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 7th Symposium on Novel Photoelectronic Detection Technology and Applications
CL  - Kunming, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - Human activity has changed land covers on the earth surface significantly over decades, especially in urban areas. Mapping the urban typical land covers is critical for the analysis of environment and sustainable urban management. With the availability of various remote sensed data, urban typical land covers extraction at different scale has attracted growing attention. Linear spectral unmixing is a widely-employed technique in mapping urban land covers, which can estimate urban component abundance at sub-pixel scale, popular especially in medium spatial resolution images. However, it suffers from the endmember selection, including types and numbers of endmembers, due to the intra-class spectral variability and the inter-class spectral similarity in the feature space constructed of original spectral bands. In this paper, we propose a novel technique for mapping urban typical land covers under linear spectral unmixing model in GaoFen-5 data at 20 m resolution. A main contribution of our new technique is that we develop a new spectral analysis technique which uses the spectral trend between every two bands instead of arbitrary spectral values, demonstrated effective in spectral representation of different urban land covers. The feature space constructed based on this spectral analysis model is discriminative, which makes endmember selection effective and efficient. To validate the superiority of our new spectral analysis technique, the linear spectral unmixing was also conducted based on the original spectral bands. Experimental results illustrated that the newly spectral analysis technique show promising performance for mapping urban typical land covers in terms of RMSE and SE.

AB  - With the rapid development of remote sensing techniques, the quantity and quality of remote sensing data have been greatly promoted. The automatic understanding and semantic analysis of satellite or aircraft remote sensing images are strongly required. In this paper, we design and implement a lightweight CNN based network for the detection task of remote sensing images analysis. Experimental results show that our model is robust to distinguish different object categories with high similarity. At the same time, we deployed the model to mobile devices, which maintain the detection accuracy and prediction speed.

TI  - Sensing Population Distribution from Satellite Imagery Via Deep Learning:Model Selection, Neighboring Effects, and Systematic Biases
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid development of remote sensing techniques provides rich, large-coverage, and high-temporal information of the ground, which can be coupled with the emerging deep learning approaches that enable latent features and hidden geographical patterns to be extracted. This article marks the first attempt to cross-compare performances of popular state-of-the-art deep learning models in estimating population distribution from remote sensing images, investigate the contribution of neighboring effect, and explore the potential systematic population estimation biases. We conduct an end-to-end training of four popular deep learning architectures, i.e., VGG, ResNet, Xception, and DenseNet, by establishing a mapping between Sentinel-2 image patches and their corresponding population count from the LandScan population grid. The results reveal that DenseNet outperforms the other three models, while VGG has the worst performances in all evaluating metrics under all selected neighboring scenarios. As for the neighboring effect, contradicting existing studies, our results suggest that the increase of neighboring sizes leads to reduced population estimation performance, which is found universal for all four selected models in all evaluating metrics. In addition, there exists a notable, universal bias that all selected deep learning models tend to overestimate sparsely populated image patches and underestimate densely populated image patches, regardless of neighboring sizes. The methodological, experimental, and contextual knowledge this article provides is expected to benefit a wide range of future studies that estimate population distribution via remote sensing imagery.

TI  - Field-Scale Soil Moisture Retrieval Using PALSAR-2 Polarimetric Decomposition and Machine Learning
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is a key indicator to assess cropland drought and irrigation status as well as forecast production. Compared with the optical data which are obscured by the crop canopy cover, the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is an efficient tool to detect the surface soil moisture under the vegetation cover due to its strong penetration capability. This paper studies the soil moisture retrieval using the L-band polarimetric Phased Array-type L-band SAR 2 (PALSAR-2) data acquired over the study region in Arkansas in the United States. Both two-component model-based decomposition (SAR data alone) and machine learning (SAR + optical indices) methods are tested and compared in this paper. Validation using independent ground measurement shows that the both methods achieved a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of less than 10 (vol.%), while the machine learning methods outperform the model-based decomposition, achieving an RMSE of 7.70 (vol.%) and R-2 of 0.60.

TI  - Quantitative analysis of shear wave elastic heterogeneity for prediction of lymphovascular invasion in breast cancer
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To evaluate the correlation between elastic heterogeneity (EH) and lymphovascular invasion (LVI) in breast cancers and assess the clinical value of using EH to predict LVI pre-operatively.Methods: This retrospective study consisted of 376 patients with breast cancers that had undergone shear wave elastography (SWE) with virtual touch tissue imaging quantification between June 2017 and June 2018. The EH was determined as the difference between the averaged three highest and three lowest shear wave value. Clinicalpathological parameters including histo-logical type and grades, LVI, axillary lymph node status and molecular markers (estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 and Ki-67) were reviewed and recorded. Relationship EH and clinicalpathological parameters was investigated respectively. The diagnostic performance of EH in distin-guishing LVI or not was analyzed.Results: At multivariate regression analysis, only EH (p = 0.017) was positively correlated with LVI in all tumors. EH (p = 0.003) and Ki-67 (p = 0.025) were positively correlated with LVI in tumors <= 2 cm. None of clinical-pathological parameters were correlated with LVI in tumors > 2 cm (p > 0.05 for all). Using EH to predict LVI in tumors <= 2 cm, the sensitivity and negative predictive value were 93 and 89% respectively.Conclusion: EH has the potential to be served as an imaging biomarker to predict LVI in breast cancer espe-cially for tumors < 2 cm.Advances in knowledge: There was no association between LVI and other most commonly used elastic features such as SWVmean and SWVmax. Elastic heter-ogeneity is an independent predictor of LVI, so it can provide additional prognostic information for routine preoperative breast cancer assessment.For tumors <= 2cm, using EH value higher than 1.36 m/s to predict LVI involvement, the sensitivity and negative predictive value can reach to 93% and 89%, respectively, suggesting that breast cancer with negative EH value was more likely to be absent of LVI.

TI  - Mapping the Coastal Upwelling East of Taiwan Using Geostationary Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal upwelling is important for coastal ecosystems and the blue economy because of its large productivity and large potential for catching fish. However, coastal upwelling along the Taiwan east coast has received little attention from the research community. This study used five-year daily Himawari-8 geostationary satellite sea surface temperature data to map the coastal upwelling east of Taiwan during the summer monsoon season. We applied a semi-automatic image process technique based on the topographic position index for the quantitative upwelling mapping. The results show clear evidence of seasonal coastal upwelling along the entire Taiwan east coast, mainly under the influence of upwelling-favorable southwesterly/southerly winds. There are three broad upwelling centers along the Taiwan east coast: north, central, and south. The upwelling around the northern center has the longest upwelling season, lasting from May to September. The upwelling extents are larger between June and August during the height of the summer monsoon.

TI  - Classification of Large-Scale High-Resolution SAR Images With Deep Transfer Learning
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The classification of large-scale high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) land cover images acquired by satellites is a challenging task, facing several difficulties such as semantic annotation with expertise, changing data characteristics due to varying imaging parameters or regional target area differences, and complex scattering mechanisms being different from optical imaging. Given a large-scale SAR land cover data set collected from TerraSAR-X images with a hierarchical three-level annotation of 150 categories and comprising more than 100 000 patches, three main challenges in automatically interpreting SAR images of highly imbalanced classes, geographic diversity, and label noise are addressed. In this letter, a deep transfer learning method is proposed based on a similarly annotated optical land cover data set (NWPU-RESISC45). Besides, a top-2 smooth loss function with cost-sensitive parameters was introduced to tackle the label noise and imbalanced classes' problems. The proposed method shows high efficiency in transferring information from a similarly annotated remote sensing data set, a robust performance on highly imbalanced classes, and is alleviating the overfitting problem caused by label noise. What is more, the learned deep model has a good generalization for other SAR-specific tasks, such as MSTAR target recognition with a state-of-the-art classification accuracy of 99.46%.

M3  - Article
AB  - Procedures of using ground penetrating radar (GPR) and Sentinel-1 satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) were tested in the area of housing estates in Hodonin, where there is an intensive decrease in the subsoil and thus a significant cracking of prefabricated houses. Extensive geophysical research of the site provided essential information about active faults in the area. To prove them and define the most active deformation zones (blocks), where the maximum settlement of the subsoil occurs, the processed interferometric (InSAR) data from the Sentinel-1 SAR satellite were used. Results from joint evaluation of geophysical data and InSAR not only confirmed detected deformations but also notified on other locations with tendencies to subsidence in the neighborhood of main faults. The combination of the methods to identify displacement tendencies in urbanized areas is very effective.

TI  - Shaping the Global High-Resolution TanDEM-X Digital Elevation Model
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The global digital elevation model (DEM) produced by the TanDEM-X (TerraSAR-X add-on for digital elevation measurements) mission is an interferometric elevation model with unprecedented quality, accuracy, and coverage. It represents an unedited surface model as artifacts inherent to the interferometric synthetic aperture radar acquisition and processing technique are still present. The most prominent artifacts in the DEM are water bodies appearing with a rough surface due to low coherence. Additionally, outliers, voids, and larger data gaps may be present in this dataset. Therefore, DEM editing is crucial for many applications including hydrology or orthorectification of remote sensing data. Depending on the field of application, different techniques of quality enhancement are required. This article provides a comprehensive description of a semi-automatic framework specially developed for generating an edited version of the TanDEM-X dataset by shaping the high-resolution 12 m DEM with focus on water areas, outlier handling, and void filling. The default configuration parameters of the workflow can thereby be adapted interactively for challenging areas where appropriate. A quality assessment of the resulting edited DEM was done by statistical measures, visual methods, as well as by an artifact evaluation.

AB  - Lots of Christian universities have a complex goal of spreading the gospel and nurturing talented people. Also they are thinking about effective university operation plans to achieve it. In a situation where religious freedom and cultural diversity are taking root in the general atmosphere of modern society, where to place the educational goals of Christian universities is a task that has been contemplated for a long time. It is true that the concerns of Christian universities are deepening because they are college students in their 20s who are sensitive to generational change, social application of religious values, and a social system. In most cases, Christian University replaced the funda-mental goal of founding psychiatric by making chapels a compulsory subject. However, there are practical solutions and alternatives that require a correct understanding of Christianity, concerns about faith, and an understanding of the Christian worldview, ultimately accepting Jesus Christ, and spreading the gospel in the curriculum.This study started from the point that if these problems can be approached and solved academically and theoretically. By internalizing Christianity as a religion, not an academic, we would like to think about how to achieve the purpose of establishing a more future-oriented and effective university and maximize the expected effect and what to do for this. It was intended to conduct a comprehensive study of the direction and purpose of Christian universities and practical alternatives for this purpose. In order to recognize the current situation of Christian universities and find the direction of change, This study tried to take a more specific and objective approach through a dynamic methodology that approaches from a long-term perspective, breaking away from existing research methods.In addition to identifying the factors influencing the sustainable growth of the university, it was specified and analyzed through simulation from a systematic perspective for the development of a Christian university from a long-term perspective as well as a correct understanding of religion. We hope to present insights and directions on the educational content and meth odologies that Christian universities must have, and suggest alternatives to implement them concretely to establish the direction of strategies for Christian universities to faithfully fulfill their original roles.

T2  - ACTA SILVAE ET LIGNI
M3  - Article
AB  - The intensity of fungal decay depends mainly on wood species, temperature and precipitation events. To estimate the planned service life of wood and to determine the maintenance intervals of wooden buildings, it is necessary to assess how wood behaves in a given environment. There are a variety of models that have been developed to assess the loading of wood. The approach most commonly used in practice is that developed by Theodore Scheffer. Scheffer proposed a climate index (Scheffer climate index) based on the number of rainy days and monthly average temperatures. Based on these data, Scheffer climate index for chosen locations in Slovenia was calculated. The results of the analysis of climatic conditions show that the Scheffer climate index is higher than it was decades ago at most of the analysed sites in Slovenia. The intensity of decomposition increased at all analysed locations, with the exception of Portoroz. The largest increase in the Scheffer climate index was observed in Ratece.

M3  - research-article
AB  - In the history of modern literature, Cho Ji-hoon (1920~1968) built tradition and ethnic sentiments in Eastern thought, based on classical beauty. When limiting a poetry-only view of his traditional worldview, which combines folklore and history, the psalm created through the form of sijo of the poetry style stands out. In addition, it is an early contemporary work that directly or indirectly contributes to the renewal of sijo when it was developed in traditional rules. His classical beauty is the fact that it is demonstrated in maintaining and inheriting the ethnic sentiment in sijo form of the psalm to be examined. In short, the execution arrangements of the psalms are generally based on sijo rules, which embodies tradition and reinforces the classics. This tells us that he was trying to create a near original form inherited from ancient shijo rather than referring to the transitional malformed time of the early modern sijo.At the time of Cho Ji-hoon, he maintained a certain concept of the founder's unique aesthetic formal first chapter, middle chapter, last chapter general 3 lines and 3 chapters, 6 wards, 4 notes. However, although his poems do not have all of the completed Sijo form, they are partially in the Sijo form. It contributes to having musicality with poetic rhythms in each chapter through each node such as each note and ward, embroidery.His work mainly finds the psalm in sijo form, which is based on the traditional rule's 3 sheets, 6 wards, and 4 notes. However, in the meantime, Cho Ji-hoon's research has shown the limitations that remain only in the poetic theory that he pursued oriental classics and preserving ethnic traditions. In addition, when considering classical beauty as formal beauty, it is only evaluated that it is associated with traditional rituals, and there was no search that specifically substituted sijo form. In this regard, attention was paid to the psalms of Cho Ji-hoon, who inherited traditionalism before and after the liberation period and implemented the typical sijo formal beauty, and traced the meaning contained there to the spatiality that Martin Heidegger claimed in “Existence and Time.” Heidegger cannot explain the present existence without excluding it because everything that exists belongs to the space of internality. To grasp this in terms of world spatiality, the present existence is the existence that we meet in the phenomenon of the environmental world.In this way, the present existence inside the world can be confirmed through such spatiality and is composed of mutual relationships. In this way, the formal beauty that Cho Ji-hoon's classical beauty acts on starts from the spatiality of the world. It can be grasped by dividing it into three stages, the spatiality of the present existence and the instrumental existence that exists in the space, which is the nature of the space of the world, that Heidegger said.

AB  - France now counts nearly 400,000 new cancer cases per year. Yet, even though this epidemic is shaped by strong inequalities, the role of work as a cause of cancer remains underacknowledged, if not ignored. In the GISCOP 84 cohort study on blood cancer patients taken care of at Avignon Central Hospital, each cancer is considered as a "sentinel event" giving access to the patients' past (and present) occupational exposures to carcinogens, as well as to the obstacles to - and levers of action for - the prevention of occupational cancers and their compensation as occupational diseases. This article presents the GISCOP approach and the type of knowledge it produces. It also analyzes the institutional resistances this action research encounters. Indeed, although the ongoing cancer epidemic is a major public-health crisis requiring a strong response, the prevention of occupational cancers is intricately related to social relations of production and thus politically sensitive.

AB  - Infrasound covers frequencies of around 10(-3) Hz to approximately 20 Hz and can propagate in atmospheric waveguides over long distances as a result of low absorption, depending on the state of the atmosphere. Therefore, infrasound is utilized to detect atmospheric explosions. Following the opening of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty for signature in 1996, the International Monitoring System (IMS) was designed to detect explosions with a minimum yield of one kiloton of TNT equivalent worldwide. Currently 51 out of 60 IMS infrasound stations are recording pressure f uctuations of the order of 10(-3) Pa to 10 Pa. In this study, this unique network is used to characterize infrasound signals of so-called Mountain-Associated Waves (MAWs) on a global scale. MAW frequencies range from 0.01 Hz to 0.1 Hz. Previous observations were constrained to regional networks in America and date back to the 1960s and 1970s. Since then, studies on MAWs have been rare, and the exact source generation mechanism has been poorly investigated. Here, up to 16 years of IMS infrasound data enable the determination of global and seasonal MAW source regions. A cross-bearing method is applied which combines the dominant back-azimuth directions of different stations. For better understanding the MAW generation conditions, the MAW occurrence is compared to tropospheric winds at the determined hotspots. Furthermore, ray-tracing simulations ref ect middle atmosphere dynamics for describing monthly propagation characteristics. Both the geographic source regions and the meteorological conditions agree with those of orographic gravity waves (OGWs). A comparison with GW hotspots, derived from satellite data, suggests that MAW source regions match those of OGWs. Discrepancies in the respective source regions result from a stratospheric wind minimum that prevents an upward propagation of OGWs at some hotspots of MAWs. The process of breaking GWs is discussed in terms of the MAW generation.

TI  - INSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL MODEL FOR PUBLIC PROCUREMENT OF PRODUCTS OF EARTH OBSERVATION IN UKRAINE
T2  - SPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-KOSMICNA NAUKA I TEHNOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article explores the mechanism of public procurement in the sphere of providing remote sensing services to public entities. Authors emphasize the benefits of the centralized procurement of remotely sensed data that will lead to cost savings of state funds through the avoidance of duplicate purchases. Authors give special consideration to the difference in products obtained within the Earth observation (EO) process, the purchase of which can be carried out according to different procedures, as well as the duality of the status of the National Center for the Management and Testing of Space Facilities (NCMTSF) as a supplier and intermediary in public procurement legal relations. It is determined that NCMTSF as a centralized procurement organization will collect requests from contracting authorities (public consumers) for remote sensing services, analyze them for the possibility of satisfying it with products from the existing own fund or the need to purchase remote sensing data. It is argued that in case of impossibility to provide relevant services from the available resources of the remote sensing fund, but economic expediency of purchasing raw remote sensing data, considering the consolidated application of public consumers, NCMTSF will act as a centralized procurement organization. It is emphasized that, unlike other centralized procurement organizations, the procurement contract with the winner of the procurement will be concluded by NCMTSF. NCMTSF will provide free of charge public authorities, enterprises, institutions, and organizations with raw data information products that were purchased at the expense of the state budget according to their requests. It is suggested that in case of impossibility and economic inefficiency of providing data processing services, NCMTSF as a centralized procurement organization organizes procurement in the interests of public consumers. The procurement contract is concluded between the public consumer and the winner of the procurement. That is, in this case, the NCMTSF performs an intermediary function of a procurement organization, which can professionally qualify the participants and determine the most economically advantageous tender.In addition, several procedures have been discovered that will unify suppliers' offers according to contracting authorities' technical requirements and optimize budget spending, that was based on an analysis of domestic legislation on public procurement and models for the procurement of remote sensing products in space states such as the USA, Australia, and India. The article provides an in-depth analysis of the implementation of a multi-use supplier list as a prequalification system for potential economic operators of remote sensing services.

AB  - High-severity wildfire in arid regions has caused ecological state change, transforming previously forested areas into shrublands. This dramatically alters the climatic envelope for tree seedlings, rendering the likelihood of returning post-wildlife landscapes to their previous state relatively low. We used a combination of sUAS imagery, satellite data and in-situ microclimate data recordings, together with a machine learning approach, to model monthly near-ground minimum, mean and max temperature as well as relative humidity and vapor pressure deficit in a previously forested area, which is now dominated by shrubs species. Spatially explicit models predicted recorded microclimate well (r = 0.73 to 0.97), and projections of models highlighted the solar buffering capacity of existing vegetation to alter the maximum temperature in the hottest month by ~12oC, increase relative humidity by ~20% and reduced vapor pressure deficit by 0.3mbar in locations 2m apart. By harnessing these microclimate refugia, the success rate of reforestation efforts in post-wildfire landscapes could be substantially increased and mitigate seedlings from climate warming at local scales.

T2  - INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES AND LEARNING TOOLS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article considers the preconditions, dynamics, trends, institutional basis for the development of modern pedagogical biography in Ukraine. It is emphasized that the late 80's of XX - early XXI century is the basis for meaningful understanding of its historiography. Emphasis is placed on the accumulated historiography of significant volumes of various source materials. It is established that according to the results of the analytical review they are divided into three categories, covering the work for the development of Ukrainian pedagogical thought and the study of the teaching staff in Ukraine and abroad. This proves the need for a careful study of the life and achievements of outstanding figures who define the face of education and pedagogy of the recent past.It is established that the bibliography, as a relevant industry resource, is a searching infrastructure. It is found that it is necessary to take into account the use of digital bibliography; examples of digital resources as powerful tools for quick search of biographies of famous teachers and scientists are given. This confirms the existence of a powerful bibliographic system developed in foreign countries, which operates in a modern dynamic environment and provides a high level of quality to expand people's worldview and obtain affordable general secondary and higher professional education in general.Research has shown that the transformation of the educational history and pedagogical thought personification in Ukraine into a digital infrastructure of the state and world level is projected in accordance with the digitalization of society. It is emphasized that in specific pedagogical research the scholars are usually limited to a brief interpretation of the biography in accordance with the subject of their study. It is noted that in the process of accumulation of an array of scientific, educational, popular science, reference literature on the life of teachers in the Ukrainian historical and pedagogical science formed a separate interdisciplinary research and personalized direction - a pedagogical biography.

AB  - This paper explores a topical film Minari, which has been nominated for Best Picture at the Golden Globe Awards but instead won the Best Foreign Language Film and, in which Yoon Yeo-jeong received the Best Supporting Actress Award for her outstanding performance. The goal of this paper is to reveal the musical structure in parallel with the narrative structure of the film.The paper attempts to read in depth the masterpiece Minari containing sorrows of the modern diaspora through a Christian worldview. In the paper asserting that God’s providence for Jacob’s family is revealed in the macroscopic frame of “Amen cadence,” I showed that the OSTs form a contrast between black-key (D -centricity) and white-key (C-centricity) pieces symbolizing divinity and humanity respectively. I claim that such contrast vividly summons a function to remind the narrative by implicitly appearing above what I call “fundamental axis.” I also analyzed the OSTs’ process of musical depiction in which unstable identity of Grandmother becomes fully established as a member of the family, and the struggle of a weak human being is portrayed. I illuminated the meaning structure with hermeneutical insight into the musical dimension of Minari, a rather flat but high-quality work.

T2  - Philosophical Investigation
T2  - 철학탐구
M3  - research-article
AB  - What role can philosophy play in the face of a crisis of death? Modern society is a ‘managed’ world driven by technology, science, and all social organizations. This world equalizes our deep experiences and turns them into a general object of record. For this reason, it is not surprising that even human death appears as a simple object of record, such as a death list or time of death. However, death is an absolute horizon and an unknown event that gives one existential meaning to all human beings. Even in an age dominated by the scientific worldview, the 'mystery of life' still exists. Therefore, philosophy cannot turn away from death as a limiting question that has not yet been given a clear explanation. Death is the essential theme and burden of philosophy. In this background, this article aims ‘practically’ to clarify the meaning of death given to humans in the modern society through Phaedo. Naturally, in this process, ‘theoretically’ a critical review of Phaedo's argument is carried out. Although the limitations of the arguments of Phaedo were pointed out in this process, the existential significance of this story, which justifies one's life through a decision to death, is consistently applied to the human world, especially the scientifically enlightened modern society. It holds immortal value in that it is inspiring.

AB  - Agricultural water occupies 48% of water demand, and management of agricultural reservoirs is essential for water resources management within agricultural basins. For more efficient use of agricultural water, monitoring the distribution of water resources in agricultural reservoirs and agricultural basins is required. Therefore, in this study, three threshold determination methods (i.e., fixed threshold, Otsu threshold, Kittler-Illingworth (KI) threshold) were compared to detect terrestrial water bodies using Sentinel-1 images for 3 years from 2018 to 2020. The purpose of this study was to evaluate methods for determining threshold values to more accurately estimate the reservoir area. In addition, by analyzing the relationship between the water surface and water storage at the Edong, Gosam, and Giheung reservoirs, water storage based on the SAR image was estimated and validated with observations. The thresholding method for detecting a waterbody was found to be the most accurate in the case of the KI threshold, and the water storage estimated by the KI threshold indicated a very high agreement (r = 0.9235, KGE' = 0.8691). Although the seasonal error characteristics were not observed, the problem of underestimation at high water levels may occur; the relationship between the water surface and the water storage could change rapidly. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the relationship between the water surface area and water storage through ground observation data for a more accurate estimation of water storage. If the use of SAR data through water resources satellites becomes possible in the future, based on the results of this study, it is judged that it will be beneficial for monitoring water storage and managing drought.

AB  - This paper examines the church’s response to epidemics in Christian history. As the COVID-19 epidemic spreads and prolongs as a worldwide pandemic, it is intensifying human anxiety, fear, and mutual distrust. Amid the COVID-19 epidemic spreading, non-face-to-face meetings are already becoming a trend in Christian churches as well as in educational institutions. Amid this situation, countries all over the world are concentrating on the development of vaccines and treatments for world peace, but the Korean church still lacks discussions of the issue based on theological concerns and self-reflection. To explore the matter, the biblical understanding of infectious diseases, Christian historical considerations on infectious diseases, the reactions of the Reformers to the related infectious diseases, and the response of the early Korean church to them were examined. In addition, we proposed five things needed to know how Korean churches should respond to the COVID-19 epidemic because this disaster poses not only a theological problem but also a ministering problem for Korean churches today; first, crisis management community, second, restoration of the Christian worldview, third, practice of love for neighbors, fourth, restoration of leadership, and fifth, incarnational missionary ministry.

T2  - The Classical Literature and Education
T2  - 고전문학과 교육
M3  - research-article
AB  - This study aims to identify implications for literature education and literary therapy of a brain-scientific understanding of the ways in which stories are constructed and function in the human brain. To this end, we examined ① what the brain uses as materials and what stories it creates; ② what kinds of structures of stories the brain creates; ③ the purpose of creating stories in the brain; and ④ what stories do to the brain. A summary of the discussion is as follows.① The main material of the story the brain creates is memory. Memories are not as precise and objective as moving pictures, but are influenced by emotions and interests and have the characteristics of snapshots taken in conformity with self-image and worldview. These memories can be reconstructed and transformed over time as perspectives and experiences change.② The structure of the story that the brain creates and enjoys is called a plot. This plot is internalized in spiritual forms and externalized as substantive narratives. In particular, our brains are fascinated by plots in which a protagonist with a flawed theory of control gains new and powerful control theory while being attacked by various types of events.③ The purpose of the brain's creation and enjoyment of stories is to understand what other people are thinking so as to increase control over the world, maintain self-identity, and preserve self-identity to better cope with the world.④ The power with which stories act on the brain can be summarized in two ways: indirect experience and empathy. Literary works enable indirect experiences through image simulation and induce empathy for fictional characters.In short, brain science deepens our understanding of the human beings who create and enjoy stories. Further, literature is useful in developing the brain to maintain, improve, and strengthen control over humans and the world. In particular, literature presents the lazy brain with different and unfamiliar contexts for life and different human experiences. By doing so, it helps to construct new identities and lives. Literature is therefore a meaningful companion for a good life.

AB  - There have been various debates centering on the discourse that the uniqueness and identity of Korean Buddhism is “interpenetrating Buddhism” (K. tong bulgyo). However, the history of human thoughts is bound to be integrated because various and heterogeneous thoughts constantly move forward in mutual influence beyond regions and times.Since interpenetrating Buddhism is not a unique characteristic of Korea, for productive discussions, it is necessary to investigate the nature of Buddhism’s Korean interpenetration and confirm the consistent basis of its worldview.The purpose of this paper is to grasp Tanheo(呑虛, 1913~1983)’s integrated idea of Confucianism-Buddhism-Daoism in succession with Choi, Chi-won(崔致遠, 857~?)’s “Profound and Mystical Dao(Hyun-Myo-jido 玄妙之道)” revealing that the interpenetrating view of Korean Buddhism is based on the worldview of inactual Becoming theory. First of all, it was revealed that the meaning of “Interdependent Arising(緣起法)”, the basic perspective of Tanhe as a monk, is an interdependent principle of creation that constantly emerges without a fixed invariant substance.In addition, the “Change(易)” philosophy of Confucianism, one of the pillars of the three religions, also shares the foundation of the worldview of creation centered on change in that it emphasizes the creative activity of heaven and earth.Finally, I would like to find the origin of Tanhe’s integrated identity in Choi Chi-won’s mention of “Profound and Mystical Dao”(玄妙之道) and “The Flow of Wind”(風流). “Hyun-Myo”(玄妙) is a collective unconscious prototype of Korean culture, which is the core of cultural identity and independent subjectivity. “Hyeon”(玄), an expression borrowed from Laozi (老子), is an irregular dynamism in which all dichotomous confrontations return to identity. It is a vital force that forever refuses to become a noun and promotes the world of phenomena in heaven and earth.Tanhe extended this Hyeon’s generative unification theory to three schools as a unified basis for integrating all dichotomy

AB  - In this paper, I tried to describe the fact that Christian worldview was formed in Russia, focusing on five aspects pointed out by Ninian Smart. In other words, firstly, it is the fact that farmers have adjusted their farming-related cycles and rituals to the church calendar. Secondly, it is the fact that local churches for farmers have emerged. Thirdly, it is the fact that local holy men in Russia, including farmers, began to be canonized as Russian saints. Fourthly, the legend of the apostle Andrei, who is said to have spread Christianity in Russia, reappeared during this period. Fifthly, while looking at the contents of the Domost roi and the Hundred Chapters Conference, I considered what the Christian worldview was imposed on the general public by the church and the state.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the meaning of Choigounjeon and its historical significance together through the characteristics of the problematic situations. First of all, the problematic situation of Choigounjeon had an external, non-personal and continuous nature from the beginning. Therefore, a different solution from chuanchi and a heroic protagonist were requested. At the same time, the possibility of a space behind the space presented as a problem situation in Choigounjeon also lies, distancing itself from hero novels in that the problem is solved in a way that leads to the possibility. In the ending, Choi Chi-won observes that the problem situation is not limited to a particular space. The problem situation is not just in one place, but to be ubiquitous, so the point of return, which should have already been resolved, was still a problematic space. In this regard, the ending served to further enhance the sense of theme. It also provides implications for the reason why the worldview based on heaven is constantly repeated in later hero novels. Therefore, Choigounjeon is a work worth noting in that it shows not only a unique narrative structure, but also a departure from chuanchi and a preview of hero novels in the history of fiction.

AB  - Chutokyoikukubuntokuhon (中等敎育國文讀本) is a Japanese textbook for secondary education published by the Government-General of Korea since 1930. A unique feature of this textbook is that it contains many Japanese literary works, unlike the previous textbooks. Furthermore, the content is often re-quoted from texts published in Japan at that time, not from the original texts of the Japanese literary works.Volume 8 of the Chutokyoikukubuntokuhon contains part of The Pillow Book (枕草子), a Japanese classic essay, and criticisms of it.The original text of this chapter is a book by Motoomi Kaneko called The Pillow Book Commentary (枕草子評釈). However, this part of the Chutokyoikukubuntokuhon is not from the original text, but from the Chutokokugotokuhon (中等國語讀本) textbook published in Japan at that time. This can be seen from the fact that the contents of the two texts are very similar, from words to sentence selection.However, despite the fact that the two texts are very similar overall, some texts published by the Government-General of Korea were omitted. For example, the Heian-era waka poems about the scene where men and women exchanged love in front of “Kami” (god, 神) were omitted. This is because the meaning of “Kami” in Heian period literary works is different from the word “Kami” that the Japanese Empire seeks in colonial Korea. The GovernmentGeneral of Korea has cited many Japanese classical literary works in textbooks to show Japan’s superiority. However, when the worldview of classical literary works conflicted with the worldview that the Japanese Empire wanted to plant in colonial Korea, some scenes in literary works were deleted.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to study a university mission plan as a Christian peer counseling for the students who have difficulties due to the delay in entering adulthood from adolescence. This study examined we the step-by-step peer counseling program for adolescents and the peer counseling program for later adolescents, and planned a Christian peer counselor training program, and searched for a mission plan by using the program. The Christian peer counselor training program is consisted of 12 sessions of 60 minutes each. Each Sessions are as far as 1-2 Sessions becoming close friends each other. Sessions 3-5 learning peer counseling techniques. Session 6 becoming Wonderful Counselor. Sessions 7-11 applying counseling skills to the university students who are stressed in university life, dreams and visions, human relationships, and religious life. Session 12 finish up with a time of commitment. By sharing the concerns of university students and religious issues, and a Christian worldview, a peer counselor who imitates and follows the Wonderful Counselor Jesus Christ gets so that he(or she) can solve the problems of his peers and take care of their souls.

AB  - This article is an attempt to understand ‘agential reality’ beyond the frame of ‘virtual reality’ that explains metaverse through Nintendo Switch’s game title Animal Crossing New Horizons. Animal Crossing New Horizons is a game designed and managed on Aristotle’s epistemological premise that argues for the politics of manhood by dividing Oikos and Polis. However, since the rules of the game reveal that Oikos and Polis cannot be split by linking material practice with discourse practice, players develop contradictions between the game’s worldview and rules. Furthermore, as a social agent, the player designs his island by gluing the affect brought in from outside the game to the rules of the game. The island’s design is not the subjective intention of the player, but only in the political and economic relationship, and in reality and virtual relationship. Therefore, the island’s design reveals, and sometimes conceals, the contradiction of the game. These are diffraction patterns related to how players play games based on their relationships and connectivity. In this regard, ‘DIY’, which Animal Crossing New Horizons boasts, is never performed by an individual and independent self. The design that corresponds to the norm of ‘DIY Oikonomia’ in Animal Crossing New Horizons is between the politics of game rules and the politics of game play. The design is a gender, political and economic play. Animal Crossing New Horizons is given as a device to observe it.

AB  - In this study, the concept of God reflecting the Christian worldview, the concept of God reflecting the pagan worldview, and the concept of God in which these worldviews are mixed were studied.As a result of the study, it was found that in Russian idioms and proverbs “God” is widely used in pagan concepts and in the concept of double faith in which Christianity and paganism coexist, and reveals the characteristics of Russia well.In particular, it is interesting that the ancient Russians, who had to adapt to irresistible natural environment before the Christian acceptance, were accepted as the gods of irresistible paganism by means of destiny(авось) and wealth.The concept of God in double faith reflects the cultural characteristics of Russia and a unique Russian’s worldview. It can be seen that the concept of a Christian and pagan god in the signs, amulets, functions of the Russian saints is so complex that they influence each other.Saint Nikola (Nikola) shows the unique characteristics of the Russian god in that he has an equal status with God and, like Jesus, is involved in salvation.

TI  - BETWEEN WORLDVIEW AND THE WORLD
T2  - LOGOS
M3  - Article
AB  - As the twentieth century opened, the unified vision of the world prized by philosophy disintegrated and shattered into a multiplicity of worldviews. Karl Jaspers and Heidegger both focused on this phenomenon in 1919. Husserl made an attempt to restore the lost unity of the world based on a new phenomenological transcendentalism. This unity in his system does not arise from a synthesis of the multiplicity of private aspects of our perception but from the dependence of the world on a kind of integrity in the ego, an instance of living through those aspects which unites them as one. This transcendental ego is an arena for and bearer of these experiences, which are located beyond any representation and hence are not under the sway of the relational but are absolute.Heidegger replaced Husserl's transcendentalism with a hermeneutic ontology which condemned any kind of absolute as illusory. Absolutes make sense only as our response to the finitude of our existence. This article considers why Husserl was so persistent in trying to go beyond our particularity and finitude, while Heidegger made them the basis of his philosophy. Of the many possible answers, the article argues that Husserl's Jewishness consigned him to exclusion from "organic" communities and inclined him to explore pure transcendental rationality, whereas Heidegger sought out the rootedness and concreteness of existence and Dasein that were readily available to him in Germany.

TI  - The Role of Leaders in Formulation of the Foreign Policy Identity in Egypt
T2  - MGIMO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The features of the formation of the of the state explains the high level of interest in this scientific problem in the modern theory of international relations. The study of foreign policy identity is capable of providing an understanding of the policy-making activity of the state and its positioning in the international arena.The process of forming a foreign policy identity linked to both objective and subjective factors. The objective factors should be classified as geographical, historical, cultural and religious, the key subjective factors can be considered the role of a leader. This factor is standard for Middle Eastern states, especially for Egypt, where there are traditions of strong centralized powers. Egyptian leaders have supreme power in foreign policy decisions within the framework of the political system. Egypt's foreign policy is often determined by the personal character traits of the country's leaders.This article aims to study the role of the head of the Egypt in the search for foreign policy identity in the context of an identity crisis at the national level. Egypt has a long history of authoritarian rule, because it is impossible to separate national identity from foreign policy identity. Since its independent existence, each period with its own context established a different framework of identity and worldview for decision-makers in the field of Egypt`s foreign policy. The predominance of various elements in ideological as well as worldview in the age of the rule of a particular president has led to noticeable differences in Egypt's foreign policy at the current stage.This article attempts to answer the following research questions: What place does of the institute of the heads of State in foreign policy decisions? How leader's influence does determine the foreign policy role of the state? What changes in foreign policy priorities have taken place during the analysis period? What are the reasons for the differences between the main periods of Egypt's foreign policy in goals, tools and approaches to the outside world? The author comes to the conclusion that the change of the political leader plays an important role in the transformations of Egypt's foreign policy. The article analyzes the main trends in the foreign policy self-perception of Egypt in order to confirm the hypothesis that the foreign policy identity of Egypt had not evolved a discontinuity even in the conditions of dramatic events, whether it is the Arab-Israeli conflict, the Peace treaty with Israel or the events of the Arab Spring.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GLOBAL WARMING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) plays a significant role with respect to drought, vegetation and climate change. The main objective of this paper is to evaluate the effect of LST in some parameters and to carry out mapping using remote sensing data and geographic information system (GIS) techniques. Satellite imagery in Landsat series and meteorological data were utilised to achieve the aims of study. Normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil moisture index (SMI), normalised difference water index (NDWI) and dry bare soil index (DBSI) were utilised to evaluate the effect of LST. The results shows that the relation between the indices and the LST was statistically significant (R-2 = 0.2 and 0.3 p < 0.05, respectively). Both maximum and minimum temperatures affect vegetation cover and lead to bareness. The final outcomes shows that the remote sensing data proved to be a powerful tool for monitoring spatial and temporal changes in LST.

AB  - The number of active landmines is uncertain, however, estimated 5,554 people were killed or injured by mines in 2019. Understanding the land-cover before mine clearance process provides valuable information on the scale of the problem, the resources to clear the field and ensures all hazardous areas prioritized. In this paper, we present a new framework for land clearness prioritization using land-cover analysis. We use remote sensing images from sentinel-2 to estimate the changes in the land cover. Specifically, we estimate the changes in vegetation and non-vegetation areas. Further, we use the amount and number of land changes during a period to provide recommendations on the clearance priority for different areas. A case study for different areas in the Kingdom of Cambodia is presented with several observations of satellite images for the years 2019 and 2020. Several suspected hazardous areas (or polygons) are defined by landmine surveying expert for analysis. A change matrix for each polygon is obtained from consecutive observations. Then, a series of qualitative and quantitative 2-dimensional characteristics are extracted such as class change mask from{to, percentage loss and gain per class. The 2D characteristics, together with expert-defined scores of class-change importance are used to compute the amount and number of changes in each polygon and a recommendation on the clearance priorities. Our study demonstrates that analysing the changes in land-cover is a promising direction to help in the non-technical survey process and increasing the productivity of the land release.

TI  - Study of Climate Change Detection in North-East Africa Using Machine Learning and Satellite Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The study of climate change has become an important topic because of its negative impact on human life. The North-East African part lacks the studies for climate change detection, despite it being one of the most affected parts worldwide. The relationship between the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and climate change is an important factor to understand. To investigate this linkage, we used machine-learning (ML) models based on essential climate variables (ECVs) to investigate the relationship between the GHGs and the rhythm of climate variable change. The article investigates how ML techniques can be applied to climatic data to build an ML model that is able to predict the state of climate variables for the short and long term. By selecting a candidate model, it will help in climate adaptation and mitigation, also determine at what level GHGs should be kept and their corresponding concentrations in order to avoid climate events and crises. The used models are long short-term memory, autoencoders, and convolutional neural network (CNN). Alternatively, the dataset has been selected from U.K. National Centre for Earth Observation and Copernicus Climate Change Services. We compared the performance of these techniques and the best candidate was the Head-CNN; based on performance metrics such as root-mean-squared-error: 5.378, 2.395, and 15.923, mean-absolute-error: 4.157, 1.928, and11.672, Pearson: 0.368, 0.649, and 0.291, and R-2 coefficient: 0.607, 0.806, and 0.539 for the ECVs temperature, CO2, and CH4, respectively. We were able to link the GHG emission to ECVs with high accuracy based on the reading of this geographic area.

TI  - A diachronic study of the land uses of the Dayet Aoua wetland in the Middle Atlas in Morocco
T2  - Ecologia Mediterranea
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake Dayet Aoua, located in the Middle Atlas in Morocco, is one of the most important lake ecosystems in Ifrane National Park, and is currently reduced to a small body of water. The objective of this study is to follow the dynamics of land uses in the Dayet Aoua wetland over a period of 30 years, from 1989 to 2019. Landsat satellite imagery, using supervised classification with the k-nearest neighbors algorithm, is used to map the land uses of the study area over a 10-year interval and subsequently to develop change maps. The evaluation of this classification shows that forests experienced strong growth between 1989 and 2019 (19.19 %) due in particular to the increase in arboriculture. The bare land class went from 8.07 % to 7.42 % and that of Agriculture went from 1.30 % to 5.22 % while that of water bodies went from 0.65% to 0.54%. Indeed, between 1989 and 2019 76.61% of the areas in the study area remained unchanged while 23.38% of the areas changed to other classes or suffered degradation. This study highlights an anthropization of Dayet Aoua wetland leading to a degradation of its natural resources.

AB  - The Black Sea estuaries are unique natural formations that havegreat geoecological and recreational importance. But their ecological state is almost critical and requires developing effective measures to preserve them and restore the geoecological balance. On the basis of literary and field materials, the article analyzes the information about the history of research of estuaries within the northwest coast of the Black Sea. The current state and problematic situations in the study of their morphology, dynamics and regime are determined, the current problems for each estuary are emphasized. On the basis of field geological and geomorphological investigations and remote sensing data, the features of gravitational geological processes within the coastal zones are characterized. Changes in the morphology of the coastline and estuary areas during 2015-2020 are analyzed. Modern hydrological characteristics and features of ecological condition of these estuaries are given. Perspectives of further research of these objects are determined. To preserve the natural value of the estuaries as a unique transition zone between sea and land (geoecoton), the geoecological research approachis proposed to use.

Three different sensor groups, namely, Inertial Reference System (IRS), Global Positioning System (GPS) and Instrument Landing System (ILS) are used complementarily to estimate aircraft 3D position in the final approach stage. The methodology takes advantage of set-membership tools and paves the way toward a new and simple online tuning of merging filter. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is evaluated in terms of validity and accuracy using real flight data provided by Airbus.

AB  - Shallow lakes present different responses to flooding and drought events. This paper presents an analysis of rainfall variability was carried out using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) applied to several locations in the study area with rainfall data from 1960-2017 to understand the response of this lagoon system to extreme events to enhance early warning. The morphometric variations of the shallow lakes and temporary ponds were also analyzed using, Landsat 5 TM path / row 228/086 satellite images following by Hutchinson (1957). The results indicates that the shallow lake system is characterized by the heterogeneity in the morphometric responses of water surfaces during extreme events of flooding and drought. On the other hand, in the northern and eastern areas of transversal valleys there were wetter and more extreme periods, but southern zones presented longer periods of drought. The total surface covered with water in extreme flood events was four times the extreme drought events area. The morphometric responses have a SW-NE direction in drought, while in flood events reverses to NE - SW. Therefore, monitoring morphometric variations of temporary pools would constitute a fundamental tool in the management of early warning advice in regional floods and droughts situations.

TI  - The utilization of specialized healthcare services among frail older adults in the Helsinki Birth Cohort Study
T2  - ANNALS OF MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The association between frailty and specialized healthcare utilization is not well studied. We, therefore, examined the utilization of specialized healthcare services among frail Finnish older adults. Methods A sub-sample of 1060 participants of the Helsinki Birth Cohort Study were followed prospectively for specialized healthcare utilization from nationwide registers between the years 2013 and 2017. The participants' frailty status was assessed according to Fried's criteria at a mean age of 71.0 (2.7 SD) years between the years 2011 and 2013. A negative binomial regression model was used to examine the association between frailty and the total number of visits, emergency visits, outpatient appointments separating the first outpatient appointments and the follow-up appointments, inpatient care including elective and non-elective hospital admissions and the total number of hospital days. We also calculated average length of stay (ALOS) and used the Kruskal-Wallis test to examine the differences between the groups. Results After adjusting for covariates, frailty was significantly associated with the number of specialized healthcare visits (IRR 1.50, 95% CI = 1.04-2.15) and all subgroups of visits apart from follow-up outpatient appointments. Frailty was particularly strongly associated with the number of hospital days (IRR 5.24, 95% CI = 2.35-11.7) and notably with emergency visits (IRR = 2.26, 95% CI = 1.45-3.51) and hospital admissions (IRR 2.23, 95% CI = 1.39-3.56). Frail older adults had also higher ALOS compared to non-frail participants (p = .009). Conclusions Frailty increases the use of most specialized healthcare services. Preventative interventions against frailty are needed to decrease the burden on specialized healthcare systems. KEY MESSAGE Frailty is associated with the utilization of most specialized healthcare services, the most expensive part of the healthcare in most high-income countries. The association of frailty with inpatient care is particularly strong. Preventative interventions against frailty are needed to decrease the burden on specialized healthcare systems.

TI  - Assessment of Land-Use Dynamics Effects on Water Erosion : Case of the Bouregreg Subwatershed Upstream of the Tiddas Dam, Morroco.
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper aims to assess the impact of land-use evolution on water erosion in the Bouregreg subwatershed upstream of the Tiddas dam in the central Moroccan plateau. The methodology adopted is based on a diachronic study of land use between 1989 and 2019 from Landsat images of 30 m resolution. After the necessary pre-proc8essing, a classification of the images of the area using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm was performed and validated via the data from the processing of aerial photographs from 1989, Google Earth satellite images at a high resolution from 2019 and field validation outputs. The predictive approach falling under the guidelines for mapping and measuring water erosion processes has been exploited to assess the evolution of potential areas for erosion (PAP/CAR guidelines). The results highlight the forest's regression of 5% during the 30 years and the increase in the stages of degradation, namely the rangeland of 6%. The level of erodibility occupying the subwatershed is high to extreme, totalling 63% of the total area. The high to very high levels of soil protection have experienced a regression in their areas ranging from 30% in 1989 to 18% in 2019. The areas vulnerable to a very high level of erosion have seen an increase from 21% in 1989 to 38% in 2019. These results clearly show the worrying state of the area's vulnerability, and thus, make it possible to provide decision-makers with scientific elements that can guide the planning and implementation of action programmes for the protection of the Tiddas Dam.

AB  - In the 1980’s, Lee Geun-sam wrote critiques that analyzed North Korea’s performing arts and ideology. In the critiques, he posits the following characteristics of North Korea’s performing arts. First, the works are designed in such a way to befit the purpose of the authorities’ policy. Second, the works embrace political ideology whose purpose concerns class struggle. During the critique process, Lee Geun-sam compares the “freedom” of the performing arts activities in South Korea and the “regulatory” aspect of North Korea’s performing arts activities and reveals implicitly the superiority of South Korea’s system. In addition, Lee Geun-sam criticizes the political ideology of North Korea’s performing arts and objects to viewing the concept of ideology from a Marxist viewpoint. According to Lee Geun-sam, an ideology is explained as an idea system representing an artist’s conscious/unconscious worldview. Also, he contends that arts should distance itself from political ideology.

TI  - SEMI-AUTOMATIC APPROACH OF BURNT AREA EXTRACTION BASED ON DIFFERENT INDICES
T2  - PLANET CARE FROM SPACE
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The following study is focused on the analysis of burnt areas extracted by the use of an automatic tool. The burnt areas are obtained by applying different vegetation and burnt areas indices available in the literature (NDVI, NDB, SAVI, BAIM and BAIS2), calculated as combinations of two or more bands of the satellite images to synthesize the information carried by multispectral sensors and frequently used for the mapping fires. The research aims to find strong and alternative methods to combine with survey field activities. Traditional methods can often be subject to sampling errors or even to the non-perimeter of the event where the area is inaccessible. Satellite images allow to perform these activities simply and automatically, reducing costs and significantly increasing the accuracy and completeness of the data. Some areas analysed in the Copernicus Rapid Mapping and Risk and Recovery Mapping service were taken as case studies. A validation test has been made on all the selected indices, to evaluate the limits and potential of the different approaches and provide a burnt area closer to reality. Not having ground surveys data, the reference information for validation is given by the

TI  - Christianity in Middle-Earth: St. Augustine and J.R.R. Tolkien
T2  - VOPROSY FILOSOFII
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the analysis of motives and ideas in the epics of J.R.R. Tolkien, which he borrows from the texts of Augustine and from the texts of the Augustinian tradition. Main thesis of the paper is that the theological aspects of Tolkien's "Middle-earthic" works are close to the ideas that Augustine asserts in his writings. Tolkien's and Augustine's opinions are similar on many central Christian issues, such as the problem of the relationship between free will and grace, the problem of the relationship between good and evil, the problem of the Fall and the problem of sin. For example, for Augustine, as for Tolkien, the fall is a consequence of the free will of an intelligent being who wants to take a higher place in the Hierarchy of Creation. This desire is called "pride" by both Augustine and Tolkien; for them pride is the mother of all subsequent vices. Both Augustine and Tolkien call the creatures that have taken possession of vice "evil", but evil itself in the writings of Augustine, as in the writings of Tolkien, is not an essence. Evil "parasitizes" on the created, which is originally good, and destroys it. Evil for Tolkien and Augustine is non-being, the denial of being. These individual aspects form the basis of the worldview systems of Augustine and Tolkien; therefore, they are given a special place in our article.

TI  - Neural-Based Hierarchical Approach for Detailed Dominant Forest Species Classification by Multispectral Satellite Imagery
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Among different forest inventory problems, one of the most basic is defining dominant species. These data are crucial in forest management to determine forest category, and a cheaper remote sensing-based approach would be a useful supplement to field surveys. We used WorldView multispectral satellite imagery to address this problem as an image segmentation task dividing the image into regions with particular dominant species. Neural networks have recently become one of the most useful tools for this kind of problem, including incomplete or erroneous training labels. However, it is still challenging to distinguish between such similar patterns as different forest compositions. To handle this, we represented the multiclass forest classification problem as a hierarchical set of binary classification tasks, which allowed us to reach better results with both high- and medium-resolution satellite imagery. We also examined supplementary data, such as tree height, to improve the species classification results for wider tree age diversity. We conducted experiments considering six neural network architectures to find the best one for each task in the hierarchical decomposition. The proposed approach was tested on sample territories in Leningrad Oblast of Russia, for which the field-based observations were acquired and made publicly available as a single dataset. The proposed approach showed significantly better results (average F1-score 0.84) than multiclass classification (average F1-score 0.7).

T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Present study focused on investigation of Land Use Land Cover (LULC) changes within three basins located in North-West part of Anatolia region, Turkey. The study area consisted of six provinces with 41 districts. Visible, near-infrared and shortwave-infrared bands of Landsat imageries, acquired in production seasons of 1984, 1999, and 2014, served as main data source. The area is covered by six Landsat scenes. Supervised classification maximum likelihood algorithm was adopted whereas LULC classes were considered as forest (F), grazing-other vegetation (G-O), agriculture (A), water surface (W), and residential area-bare soil (R-B). Prior to the classification process, scenes were subset according to district boundaries, and district-level images were classified to improve the classification precision, and then mosaicked to obtain LULC1984, LULC1999 and LULC2014 maps. The reliabilities of maps were evaluated by accuracy assessments using 900 stratified randomized control points with minimum of 90 points per class. LULC changes were evaluated in two terms; changes within study area (WSA) (ha, %) and changes within class area (WCA) (%). Moreover, distributions of class areas along three basins were presented. Finally, past statuses of each class were compared, particularly, impacts of urbanization on agriculture were highlighted, and population change patterns were evaluated as main underlying reason.

TI  - Three-Component Decomposition of Hybrid-Polsar Data With Volume Scattering Models
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - This work aims at addressing the overestimation of volume scattering in model-based decomposition of hybrid-polarimetric (hybrid-pol) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. Usually, in the hybrid-pol decomposition techniques reported in the literature, complete depolarized power has been considered as volume scattering power contribution. Assigning all the depolarized power to the volume scattering mechanism results in an overestimation of the volume scattering contribution. Further, this results in the scattering mechanism ambiguity and in turn, diminishes the classification accuracy for areas dominated by dihedral scattering and surface scattering. In order to address this overestimation problem, in this work, three popular volume scattering models are introduced into the Hybrid-pol Three-Component Scattering Model (HTM) framework. The three proposed algorithms are compared against each other and with the classical hybrid-pol methods, namely m - delta, m - chi, and modified m - chi decomposition. In addition, the performance of the original HTM algorithm is improved by replacing the pseudo quad-pol reconstruction process used therein with an entropy-based reconstruction approach available in the literature. This algorithm is referred to as "Modified HTM" in this work. One of the proposed algorithms is inspired by the Generalized Volume Scattering Model. It is found to provide a better average classification accuracy as compared to both, the classical HTM and the modified HTM algorithm. A relative assessment of all the algorithms has also been included based on ship detection. All the algorithms are tested using the hybrid-pol L-band dataset synthesized from ALOS-PALSAR 2 mission.

T2  - Journal of Diaspora Studies

M3  - research-article
AB  - Admitting the lack of highly qualified human capital for the comprehensive development of the country, the current Uzbekistan government is working on a policy to encourage the return of highly educated people from Uzbekistan who have been grown up as professionals through the study abroad programs in advanced countries. Their broad worldview, sociocultural capital, knowledge, and skills formed through foreign experiences are highly appreciated for securing the international competitiveness of the country. Therefore, to attract Uzbekistan’s highly skilled back to their home country, it is necessary to understand the factors considered in the decision to return to their home country. Korea has emerged as one of the major destination countries for Uzbekistan’s youth to study abroad, and thus, the number of Uzbekistan students is increasing. However, the future mobility after completing their graduate studies is unclear.Focusing on the cases of the students from Uzbekistan who have experience studying in graduate programs in Korea, this study analyzed the factors behind their decisions to return to their home country or stay in Korea after graduation. For this purpose, in-depth interviews were conducted overall with 26 participants who returned to Uzbekistan and currently residing in Korea. As a result, the study participants who returned to their home country explained the reasons for their return by linking mainly with micro-level factors (i.e. factors related to individuals and families). The reasons for reluctance to return to their home country were due to the macro-level factors of both countries. The results of this study suggest that to return Uzbekistan’s talented people to their home country, most of all, it is necessary to improve the domestic macro-structural situation. Moreover, it is necessary to promote continuous interest and active support at the government level, and also incentive programs for the return of highly skilled should be activated.

AB  - Technology literacy is one of the most important skills of the 21st century. Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays a vital role in today's life. It deliberately and unintentionally infiltrates a part of every human life on Earth. Understanding its essence is not only a challenge for computer scientists or software engineers, but also for every world citizen who does not wish to be left behind in the past world. In addition, many AI developers are mired in models that are elegant but not feasible to implement in the real world. In this study, we introduce an end-to-end process of an online workshop in developing AI-Driven mobile application for solving real problems that participants encountered in daily life through the lens of design thinking that is entirely inspired by Green oak! application. This ranges from teaching them a basic understanding of artificial intelligence, essential algorithms to building model architecture with a ready-made platform (Microsoft Azure and PerceptiLabs), and how to brainstorm with team members in order to work together effectively. In addition to opening up participants' worldview towards AI, this workshop model also develops their soft skills by practicing logic, discussing issues, and interacting within and between teams. We brought the developed workshop model to experiment with a sample of Generation Z people in Thailand who attended the "Aidea Workshop 2021" event. In summary, we found that 100% of workshop participants understand basic knowledge about AI, be able to develop a simple model from an assigned database, 4 out of 5 participants can pass a quiz (get 6 of 8 marks) we created to assess the effectiveness of each activity, 98% want to pass on the knowledge from the activity to the people around them and want this activity to happen again, and over 90.9% are interested in learning more about AI and the mathematics behind it. All of this was done in response to our research team's ultimate goal of being a middleman to transfer technology knowledge to people in society to make the digital ecosystem a reality.

AB  - Meltwater from glaciers makes significant contributions to general streamflow and provides water for flora and fauna. Continuous glacier monitoring programs enhance our understanding of the impacts of global warming on glaciers and their topographical features. The objective of this study is to measure spatial and temporal changes in Canada's Columbia Icefield glaciers. This study uses Landsat (TM 5 and OLI) images to delineate glacier extents in the Columbia Icefield between 1985 and 2018. The study also analyzes the retreat of the Athabasca, Castleguard, Columbia, Dome, Saskatchewan, and Stutfield Glaciers. The total area covered by the Icefield in 1985 was 227 km(2). By 2018, the Icefield had lost approximately 42 km(2) of its area coverage, representing 18% of its previous coverage. All glaciers in the study region retreated and decreased in area over the study period. The pattern observed in this study is one of general ice loss in the Columbia Icefield, which mirrors patterns observed in other mountain glaciers in Western Canada.

AB  - The research presented in the article was carried out within the framework of the conceptual and metaphorical theory of J. Lakoff and M. Johnson. One of the conceptual metaphors related to the conceptual metaphors of European culture is the metaphor TIME IS A LIMITED RESOURCE, TIME IS A VALUE. The meaning 'to waste time' is noted in the Russian verb to lose, French perdre, gaspiller, Spanish perder, Italian perdere, English lose, waste, misspend, squander, German verlieren, etc. Using the example of the Russian verb to lose, the classes of use of these predicates in the indicated meaning are presented in the article, as well as some features of the French and English units reflecting the specific features of the worldview of these languages are noted. The research is based on a large corpus of explanatory and bilingual dictionaries, data from linguistic corpuses. The relevance of the study is determined by the fact that, as it has been noted by the authors of the conceptual theory of metaphor, the basic values of culture are consistent with the metaphorical structures of its basic concepts. The relevance of the study is also determined by the fact that the study of metaphorical concepts is one of the ways to reconstruct the linguistic picture of the world.

TI  - Apocalyptic Fears in a Time of Dying (of) Whiteness
T2  - JOURNAL OF SPECULATIVE PHILOSOPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article considers what caused the resurgence of white nationalist rage, resentment, and fears before and after Donald Trump was elected to office. For the white working class, declining economic prospects for mobility were sutured to fears of a dying whiteness. The political right used information tactics that normalized a conspiratorial, "post-truth" worldview. For white middle- and upper-class Americans who have been thriving economically since the 1980s, the fears of a dying whiteness were overwhelmingly projected as future possibilities. Such emotional investments in defending whiteness forged a cross-class identification with Trump's white nationalist agenda. At the same time, racial and environmental justice movements made other white Americans increasingly aware that they might be dying of whiteness-a ontological and materialist system that is leading to a collective process of social degradation and ecological self-destruction. The essay speculates on what might motivate white Americans to join a broader divestment from systemic racism and to create a new ontology based on atonement and reparations.

AB  - Due to the increasing number of severe phenomena in many regions of the world, weather nowcasting, which is the weather forecast for a short time period, is one of the most challenging topics in meteorology. The weather radar and satellite are essential tools currently used by operational meteorologists for nowcasting. Issuing nowcasting warnings based on radar and satellite data is a complex task, due to the large volume of data that should be analyzed by meteorologists in order to make decisions. We are introducing in this paper DeePS at, a convolutional neural network architecture for short-term satellite images prediction that would be useful for weather nowcasting. The experimental evaluation is conducted on satellite data collected by EUMETSAT's Meteosat-11 satellite, using five satellite products. The obtained results are analyzed and compared to the results of similar approaches. An average normalized mean of absolute errors of 3.84% was obtained for all satellite products, highlighting this way the effectiveness of DeePS at model. (C) 2021 The Authors.

AB  - The term of Mudik (in Bahasa) is often interpreted as the return of migrants from foreign areas to their hometowns, or largely known as massive mobility among regions that especially carried out annually during the Eid al-Fitr holiday in Indonesia. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic occurred in 2020 and 2021, restrictions were placed on mudik during the Eid holiday. This study was conducted to see the extent of the effectiveness of the mudik restrictions carried out by the Indonesian government. This study was conducted by reviewing the levels of NO2 and CO in the months before and during the Eid al-Fitr holiday through spatiotemporal processing of images retrieved from Google Earth Engine. The data used is Sentinel-5p images to map air pollution levels from NO2 values and CO values in January-June 2019-2021. The study area includes two districts in DKI Jakarta Province and two districts in Central Java Province. The statistical tests are useful to see the trend of data that is obtained from the zonal analysis process. The statistical tests were carried out using the Mann-Kendall Test method to detect trends and the results were equipped with Sen's Slope analysis to measure the magnitude of the changes that occurred. According to the trend of NO2 and CO values obtained, the values in 2019 are higher than in 2021, and the values in 2021 are higher than in 2020. Thus, the policy of mudik restrictions in 2020 is assumed more effectively than in 2021. The trend in the levels of NO2 and CO in the air is more significant a month before the Eid al-Fitr holiday than in the Eid al-Fitr holiday. It can illustrate that the production of NO2 and CO from motor vehicles continues to increase before there are restrictions.

AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is the most efficient tool to provide high-resolution data for Earth Observation (EO). Doppler centroid (DC) estimation is indispensable for high precision SAR data analysis such as extracting the ocean surface current, which is important for scientific pursuits. Correlation doppler estimation (CDE), and energy balancing (EB) based DC methods are implemented in this paper. A 2-D sliding window is deployed to estimate DC on small blocks of data while covering the whole scene so that all parts of the scene are potentially represented. We analyzed Sentinel-1 single look complex (SLC) data from the coastline of a non-homogeneous scene. The CDE method utilizes the azimuth shift in the time domain which is associated with the DC, and this f(Dc) history is used to extract ocean surface current. We find the results of DC estimates are confined to primitive baseband (+/- PRF/2). Moreover, the corresponding retrieved ocean surface current component is reasonable, particularly values vary within the limit of error bounds. Finally, the parameters of ocean surface current are compared with ocean wave models reported in the literature. Efficacy and simulation of implemented methods are good fit for Sentinel-1 SAR data.

TI  - Topography Variable to Downscale GPM Satellite Precipitation Data Using Geographically Weighted Regression

AB  - GPM is a satellite that capture global precipitation data, using radar, microwave, and infrared sensor. The data has a rough spatial resolution, so it is necessary to detail the spatial resolution so that it can be used in a more local area. Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) is a regression-based method that can be used to detail spatial resolution by utilizing the relationship of an independent variable, in this case precipitation, with a predictor variable that has a strong correlation. Topography is a biophysical element that is closely related to precipitation, for example, local type of rainfall or orographic type of rain. ALOS PALSAR is a radar sensor satellite that records the altitude of the earth's surface. The DEM product can be processed into topographic elements, namely Slope and Aspect, so that it is expected to be a predictor for the GWR model. The results of the model formula show that the slope has the greatest influence, the DEM has the opposite value to the slope, and the coefficient of the distribution of the relevant Aspects reflects the orographic conditions. The results of the accuracy test show that GWR is not only able to detail the resolution but also slightly improve the accuracy of GPM accuracy.

TI  - A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE UNIVERSALIZATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE FACE OF SYSTEMIC RELATIVISM: A REALITY BEYOND HERMENEUTICS
T2  - QUAESTIO IURIS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article analyzes human rights based on the observation that their genesis occurs in a specific historical and cultural context, and that they express the worldview of their birthplace - the Western world - with its ideologies, customs, values and beliefs. Ramon Panikkar and Boaventura de Sousa Santos, who refer to this analysis, advocate the thesis that the universality of human rights can only be achieved through a diatopical hermeneutics, which contemplates the multiplicity of cultures existing in the whole world, because a hermeneutics that insists on the predominance of the values of Western cultures will not find legitimacy before several other cultures, which will feel excluded. The problem that pervades this research is rooted in the universalism/relativism binomial of human rights. The research is justified due to the disparate ways of understanding and applying Human Rights in the various regions of the world, and the importance of overcoming the universalism/relativism antithesis with regard to Human Rights. The diatopical hermeneutics and emancipatory multiculturalism, both making use of intercultural dialogue, are configured as a path for the construction of dialogue on the universalization of rights and the reconstruction and reconceptualization of human rights at a global level, respecting the local particularities of each culture. To this end, the analytical-deductive investigative methodology is employed.

TI  - PROSPECTS FOR PRECISION MANAGEMENT OF WHEAT PRODUCTIVITY IN THE CONDITIONS OF NORTHERN KAZAKHSTAN
T2  - Sel'skokhozyaistvennaya Biologiya
M3  - Article
AB  - More complete realization of the wheat genetic potential will ensure increasing its yield and quality in the conditions of the Republic of Kazakhstan. Innovative agrotechnological approaches, including a precision farming system (PFS) allow the problem to be addressed. Given the large area of Kazakhstan, the incorporation of precision farming systems needs assessment of the state of its vast territories using the Earth remote sensing (ERS) technology. In this paper, for the first time in the conditions of Northern Kazakhstan, the methods of precision management of spring wheat productivity were implemented. The aim of the work was to assess the prospects for precision farming in the conditions of Northern Kazakhstan and to develop an algorithm not only for passive monitoring of the state of crops, but also for active management of the spring wheat yield using ERS. The field trials were performed on dark chestnut soils in the seasons of 2019-2020 (a special precision farming landfill, Baraev Production Center of Grain Farming) with highly productive spring wheat (Triticum vulgare L.) varieties of local selection, the Shortandinskaya 95 and Astana. At the first stage, the main agrochemical indicators of the test sites were characterized using a ground-based mobile complex. Soil fertility parameters were assessed using survey grids with 1, 5, and 25 ha plot grids. The data were used to identify intra-field heterogeneity and calculate fertilizer doses for differentiated application. The second stage involved crop assessment using images from the Sentinel-2 group satellites and photographs form unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). Plant development during ontogenesis was characterized by normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and the yields were finally evaluated using electronic yield maps. At the third stage, the data were processed using the Stat and Microsoft Excel 2010 software package and AGROS-1 software (version 2.09-2.11/1993-2009). The main fertilizers were used at sowing and surface applied. Non-root feeding was also performed. Polymer fertilizers Vitanoll-NP (1 1/ha) and Vitanoll-micro (1 1/ha) (Agromarket-24 LLC, Russia), a complex chelated fertilizer CHF (2 1/ha) (Agrophysical Research Institute, Russia), and a humic fertilizer Stimullife (0.3 1/ha) (Agrofizprodukt LLC, Russia) were used. It was found that only one agrochemical inhomogeneity of the field was partially leveled by the PFS-based differentiated introduction of fertilizers. Soil fertility, landscape profile and hydrological parameters (soil moisture availability) are shown to dominantly affect the spring wheat yield in the arid conditions of Kazakhstan. The changes in the agricultural landscape conditions due to the slope of the terrain, allows us to trace watercourses that characterize the productive moisture availability in a particular part of the field. On the basis of remote sensing data and coupled ground measurements used to precisely assess and record soil, landscape and soil moisture conditions, an algorithm has been developed to manage the yield formation process in plants. It is shown that the more precise the data analysis, the higher the effect of crop yield management. An increase in yield was approximately 10 % for a 5-ha plot grid and 2 times more for a 1-ha plot grid. The correlation revealed between the wheat yield and NDVI is strong and uneven as depends on the spatial direction, that is, the r values are 0.64-0.99 along the slope transect and 0.62-0.98 broadwise the field.A significant increase in yield was obtained both due to the differentiated application of mineral fertilizers, by 9.5 % for the 5-ha grid and by 19.2 % the 1-ha grid, and due to timely nonroot fertilizing, by 15-22.3 %. In general, our findings indicate the PFS prospects in the management of spring wheat productivity under the conditions of Northern Kazakhstan.

T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In a specific remote sensing study design, the utilization of images from a particular satellite is necessary. However, the images might be unavailable in a certain time range. Therefore, a conversion method from available remote sensing images at the time range is required. In this paper, we proposed machine learning models that are capable to convert Landsat-8 images to Sentinel-2 images. The models are inspired by the advancement of super-resolution model based on Deep learning. The result of this study shows that the proposed models can predict Sentinel-2 images which are quantitatively and qualitatively similar to the original images.

TI  - Deep Learning for Regular Change Detection in Ukrainian Forest Ecosystem With Sentinel-2
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The logging is the leading cause for the reduction in the forest area in the world. At the same time, the number of forest clearcuts continues to grow. However, despite the massive scale, such incidents are difficult to track in time. As a result, huge areas of forests are gradually being cut down. Therefore, there is a need for regular and effective monitoring of changes in forest cover. The multitemporal data sources like Copernicus Sentinel-2 allow enhancing the potential of monitoring the Earth's surface and environmental dynamics including forest plantations. In this article, we present a baseline U-Net model for deforestation detection in the forest-steppe zone. Training and evaluation are conducted on our own dataset created on Sentinel-2 imagery for the Kharkiv region of Ukraine (31 400 km(2)). As a part of the research, we present several models with the ability to work with time-dependent imagery. The main contribution of this article is to provide a baseline model for the forest change detection inside Ukraine and improve it adding the ability to use several sequential images as an input of the segmentation model.

T2  - EARTH RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL REMOTE SENSING/GIS APPLICATIONS XII

CP  - Conference on Earth Resources and Environmental Remote Sensing/GIS Applications XII / SPIE Remote Sensing Conference
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Currently, the problem of illegal mining is still acute. Such illegal use of natural resources harms the environment and leads to irrational use of mineral resources. Modern methods with the use of remote sensing technologies will effectively detect such law violations. In the current study, a method for automatically detection of non-metallic mineral extraction sites based on remote sensing data analysis has been developed. The study uses Sentinel-2 satellite images with spatial resolution 10 m and 20 m and considers four types of minerals: sand, clay, carbonate rocks and sand gravel mix. The spectral indices help to determine the specific quantitative characteristics of the mineral resources. The result is probability maps with mineral resourses characteristics in each pixel. In order to determine to which of known classes relates the point, you need to find the covariance matrices for all classes and take the class with the smallest Mahalanobis distance to the point. Based on the obtained probability maps, an analysis of the applicability of the selected spectral indices was performed, as well as a visual assessment of the quality of interpretation. For each spectral channel and index, two frequency histograms were created to determine how different the channels values and spectral indices on the entire scene and at the reference objects. Each object found by the program was checked for it presence on the studied territory. The developed system is a modern, secure, non-contact method for the rational land use monitoring and natural resources extracted by open-pit mining study.

T2  - TRACE ELEMENTS AND ELECTROLYTES
M3  - Article
AB  - Human and animal experiments at low-concentration exposure to metallic mercury vapor have indicated the delayed appearance of mercury in plasma and urine, notwithstanding the clear accumulation of mercury in erythrocytes. In animal experiments, the lower the exposure level was, the longer the delay of mercury appearance in plasma; and for an 8-hour exposure to 0.03 mgHg/m(3) mercury, it was not detected in plasma, notwithstanding the clear increase of mercury in erythrocytes and urine. The present study of workers exposed to metallic mercury vapor at concentrations of 0.003 mgHg/m(3) or less might support the results of animal experiments. The previous conclusion in 1994, in which urinary mercury did not increase in low-concentration exposure to mercury vapor, might be corrected. The clear positive correlations were confirmed in mercury workers only between urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) activity and urinary protein. Among people without a history of occupational exposure to mercury vapor, these positive correlations were not observed. The positive correlations between urinary NAG activity and urinary protein might be a sentinel health event (occupational).

TI  - A New Land Cover Classification Method Using Grade-Added Rough Sets
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, the use of a rough set theory for land cover classification has progressed significantly, leading to the production of highly accurate maps. However, information loss can occur through the discretization of digital numbers (DNs), and an additional effort may be required to determine the parameter settings. Furthermore, previous studies have not clarified the characteristics of land cover classification based on the rough set theory. This letter develops a new method of grade-added rough sets (GRS) to solve the problems of the existing land cover classifications employing the rough set theory and investigates the characteristics of GRS as a representative land cover classification method. By considering the grade, GRS prevents information loss from discretization and does not require any parameters to be set. To assess the proposed GRS, three experiments were conducted. First, the accuracy of GRS was compared with that of classical rough sets (CRSs), a maximum likelihood classifier (MLC), and a support vector machine (SVM). The other experiments investigated the sensitivity of the classification accuracy with respect to the category class definitions and selection of training data, respectively. GRS was found to be as accurate as existing classification methods and more robust than both MLC and SVM in terms of the category class definitions and selection of training data. These results imply that the classes can be defined without considering the ease of classification based on spectral reflection characteristics, thus reducing the burden on users, and the classification results have a high degree of reliability because they are independent of the training data.

T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover alteration is an important driver of ongoing global environmental change. Developing countries with a fast-growing population have not been able to control a sustainable land-use transition that simultaneously increases both forest cover and agricultural production. Coastal regions of these countries are vulnerable to natural hazards. The present study aims to detect the land cover changes with shoreline shifting in Nijhum Dwip of Bangladesh. A supervised classification method is used for the Landsat images of 1998, 2008 and 2018 based on eight significant land covers. A field survey also facilitates the locational accuracy of the classification. According to the study, about 285 hectares of mangrove forest has disappeared between 1998 to 2018. Agricultural lands reduce to 14.89% from 23.13%, whereas settlement cover has increased rapidly from 3.73% to 11.93%. About 1153 hectares of land area is added, as accretion rate is higher than erosion. Water cover climbed to 7.04% from 0.69% because of sea level rise. Shoreline is expanding towards north-western and south-eastern direction. The major causes of such changes are population pressure, expansion of settlement area, and sea level rise. The findings of the study will help the policy makers to formulate planning for sustainable coastal management in coastal region of Bangladesh. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The industrialization process which began in Western countries in the 19th century has brought about the problem of urbanization in the following years. Urban population is increasing rapidly in comparison to the rural population. Today, in almost any country industrialization and rapid urbanization adversely affect many of our environmental values, such as our core ecosystem, regional climate variations and global diversity. In this study, the effects of regional urbanization on vegetation were examined by using satellite data and atmospheric variables. In the vegetation analysis, 2005-2018 multi-time index values obtained from TERRA-MODIS satellite, EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) and LST (Land Surface Temperature) were taken into account. In the analysis, temperature and precipitation were chosen as atmospheric variables. The expected variations of EVI values of Catalca, one of the districts of Istanbul with the highest rates of population increase, until the year 2030 were estimated. NARX (nonlinear autoregressive exogenous) neural network, which gives successful results in the estimation of nonlinear data sets, was used for analysis. In addition, a hybrid W-ANN (Wavelet-Artificial Neural Network) model was developed using NARX and DWT (Discrete Wavelet Transform) models to increase estimated performance. In the light of the information obtained, W-ANN estimates improved by %4.3 compared to the prediction conditions made only with the NARX model.

AB  - A wide variety of models have been developed and used in studies of land-atmosphere interactions and the carbon cycle, with aims of data integration, sensitivity analysis, interpolation, and extrapolation. This review summarizes the achievements of model studies conducted in Asia, a focal region in the changing Earth system, especially collaborative works with the regional flux measurement network, AsiaFlux. Process-based biogeochemical models have been developed to simulate the carbon cycle, and their accuracy has been verified by comparing with carbon dioxide flux data. The development and use of data-driven (statistical and machine learning) models has further enhanced the utilization of field survey and satellite remote sensing data. Model intercomparison studies were also conducted by using the AsiaFlux dataset for uncertainty analyses and benchmarking. Other types of models, such as cropland models and trace gas emission models, are also briefly reviewed here. Finally, we discuss the present status and remaining issues in data-model integration, regional synthesis, and future projection with the models.

AB  - We have developed a method that can effectively identify and map the distribution and semi-quantitative abundance of minerals in a volcanic terrain using NASA's spaceborne spectral instruments. Our method synergistically combines spatially extensive but spectrally low-resolution Landsat multispectral imageries with spatially narrow but spectrally high-resolution Hyperion hyperspectral imageries. This approach profits from the advantages of the two types of data while compensating the disadvantages, leading to retrievals of reasonably detailed mineralogical information within a practical processing timeframe. We mapped the mineralogy of the Altiplano-Puna volcanic province in the Central Andes and detected ferric iron minerals, alunite, and kaolinite. This contributes to the ongoing efforts to better understand the Altiplano-Puna region for scientific and industrial purposes, as well as a demonstration for analysis of other planetary surfaces using similar datasets.

TI  - Women's Issue in the Worldview of the Russian Right-wingers in the Late Imperial Period
T2  - VESTNIK SANKT-PETERBURGSKOGO UNIVERSITETA-ISTORIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper addresses and analyzes the attitude towards women and the question of women's rights of the Russian right-wing politicians in the early 20th century. The paper demonstrates the views of the right-wingers on the place of women in the Russian society; their attitude toward feminism and fight for women' rights; place and role of women in the right monarchical movement. The paper introduces some new sources into the scholarship which enable to reconsider conventional viewpoints on the attitude of rightists toward the question of women's rights and to enhance the perception of the place of this question in ideology and practice of the pre-revolutionary Russian conservatism. Based on church and patriarchal convictions, the right-wingers largely limited women's activities by family life, but their views on the issue of women's rights did not rule out progress in this area. Right-wingers were not opposed to extension of women's participation in labor activity, albeit with significant reservations. Being foes of feminism and emancipation of women, they tried to shapre a negative image of women's rights activists, connecting this fight with the revolutionary attacks on traditional social foundations and statehood. At the same time, the right-wingers were utterly alien to misogyny; they celebrated an ideal of womanhood corresponding to their conservative worldview. The right-wingers willingly admitted women into their unions, but tended to perceive them not as party activists and leaders but as a force that would quell political tension inside the monarchical movement and would primarily deal with issues of culture, philanthropy, education, and other "womanish" matters.

M3  - Article
AB  - The question of the attitude of the Orthodox Russian clergy to the right-wing political parties at the beginning of the 20th century - the Black Hundreds (the Union of the Russian People, the Russian People's Union named after Mikhail Archangel, etc.) and Russian nationalists (the All-Russian National Union and related organizations) is considered. The novelty of the research is seen in the introduction into scientific circulation of new sources (materials of the church press), which make it possible to make a number of significant clarifications in the existing ideas about the relationship between the Orthodox Church and right-wing political organizations. Particular attention is paid to the differences in the views of clergymen on the Black Hundred unions and political structures of Russian nationalists. The reasons for the cooperation of conservative Orthodox pastors with the Black Hundred unions and organizations of Russian nationalists and the circumstances that forced the clergy to show concern for the views and activities of right-wing parties are shown. It is argued that the secularization and Westernization of Russian nationalism, which led to the departure of its ideologists and followers from the foundations of the Orthodox doctrine and church worldview, became the main reasons for the wary attitude of church circles towards the political organizations of Russian nationalists.

AB  - Alepu marsh is a protected area in the category of natural landmarks, part of the Ropotamo Ramsar site and sand dunes Alepu. It is situated on the Bulgarian Black Sea coast, within Burgas Province, south of the resort town of Sozopol. It is also situated within the territory of the protected area of the European ecological network Natura 2000 under the Birds directive - Ropotamo Compex. Alepu marsh is covered with reeds and other swamp vegetation. The area is habitat for many rare animals and plant species. The main problem of this area is the overgrowing with reeds and the gradual swamping that leads to reduction of the open water areas in the protected area. This leads to the loss of valuable habitats, and respectively their inhabiting animal and plant species. In the study paper assessment of the dynamics of the marsh for a period of eight years (2013 - 2020) was done. Data from Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 were used. Classification of NDVI was made for this study period. Sentinel 2 data were also used to apply an orthogonal transformation model that classifies and analyzes the processes associated with the dynamics of change affecting the main components of the earth's surface: soil, water and vegetation. The NDGI model was also used, which evaluates the dynamics of the vegetation in the marsh. The results obtained show a monitoring of the wetland for a sufficiently long period of time, which gives an idea of its condition and the need to take the necessary conservation measures for its protection.

TI  - Modeling the Radial Stem Growth of the Pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i> L.) Forests Using the Satellite-Derived NDVI and LST (MODIS/AQUA) Data
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper considers a new approach to modeling the relationship between the increase in woody phytomass in the pine forest and satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Land Surface Temperature (LST) (MODIS/AQUA) data. The developed model combines the phenological and forest growth processes. For the analysis, NDVI and LST (MODIS) satellite data were used together with the measurements of tree-ring widths (TRW). NDVI data contain features of each growing season. The models include parameters of parabolic approximation of NDVI and LST time series transformed using principal component analysis. The study shows that the current rate of TRW is determined by the total values of principal components of the satellite indices over the season and the rate of tree increment in the preceding year.

M3  - Article
AB  - Tawhid means accepting that Allah is one. It, as an ancient tradition has been a doctrine that dates back to the time of human existence. Tawhid is the base of the Islamic Aqidah (creed). The main theme of disciplines such as Aqaid and Kalam is Tawhid. Tawhid is also one of the most important principles of Tasawwuf. For sufis, Tawhid is a testament, it is a promise given to Allah in bazm-i alast (contract between Allah and people). With this promise / contract, they have internalized the balance of this world (dunya) and the hereafter (akhira), the soul and the body, the material and the spirit. Tawhid, as a means of adaptation and harmony, is a guide for today's people as well. The mission of Tawhid is very important in the face of keening on the world, materialism and in the face of some concerns. In today's world where secularization and profanity increase, the individual strives to regain the holistic viewpoint suggested by Tawhid. However, that human literally can not get rid of depression and anxiety. Because the person is not conscious of this doctrine, which allows to look at the universe with a holistic perspective. The notion of Tawhid in sufi philosophy has aimed to increase this awareness. The sufis' interpretation of Tawhid has a guiding characteristic for both their own times and today's individual. Tawhid has a balancing function in the relationship of a human in the modern age with Allah, himself and the universe.

TI  - Examining satellite images market stability using the Records theory: Evidence from French spatial data infrastructures
T2  - JOURNAL OF SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial data infrastructures (SDIs) which constitute a direct link between spatial data users and the large Earth observation industry, have a leading role in establishing market opportunities in the space sector. The spatial information supplied through various forms of SDI platforms exhibits large increases in demand volatility. The users' demand is unpredictable and the market is vulnerable to high evolution shifts. We study the effect of extreme demands for a particular type of spatial information, the satellite images. Drawing on two French SDIs, GEOSUD and PEPS, we examine the shifts occurring on their platforms and assess the probability of witnessing a spike/drop in the short term of different satellite imagery schemes: the high resolution images through GEOSUD; the Landsat (U.S.), Sentinel (Europe) and SPOT (France) images through PEPS. We analyze the market stability through the two SDIs and evaluate the probability of future records by using the Records theory. The results show that the high resolution images demand through GEOSUD, for which the classical i.i.d. model fits the most, is stable. Moreover, the YangNevzorov model fits to the Landsat data, due to more records concentrated beyond the first observations. The Landsat demand is the less stable out of the other three satellite images series, and the probability of having a record in the coming years is the highest. While the use of Records theory drops mathematical constraints, it offers an alternative solution to the non-applicability of the machine learning techniques and long-term memory models.

TI  - How to distinguish a "scientoskeptic" from a "scientoenthusiast"? Psychometric properties and criteria for qualitative interpretation of the scores of the Views of Science Questionnaire in a Polish quota sample
T2  - CURRENT ISSUES IN PERSONALITY PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUNDThe main aim of this study was to develop criteria for qualitative interpretation of the scores of the Views of Science Questionnaire (VoSQ), which is a tool for measuring the level of scientistic worldview. Another goal was to verify the psychometric properties of the tool in an adequately large and demographically diverse sample.PARTICIPANTS AND PROCEDUREThe study involved 1,119 participants aged 18 to 87 who filled in the Polish version of the VoSQ via the Internet. The obtained results were subjected to reliability analysis, confirmatory factor analysis and analyses aimed at developing criteria for the qualitative interpretation of both individual and group scores of the VoSQ scales.RESULTSThe CFA analysis showed a satisfactory level of fit of the VoSQ factor structure containing one higher-order factor and four sub-factors. The reliability of the tool scales was also satisfactory. The obtained results showed gender and age differences, but no differences related to the level of education. This information was used to develop the percentile-based criteria for the interpretation of the individual scores and the mean and standard deviation-based criteria for qualitative interpretation of the group scores.CONCLUSIONSThe relationship between science and its social reception is becoming an increasingly important issue. The development of criteria for the qualitative interpretation of the results of the Views of Science Questionnaire makes it possible to use it as a tool for diagnosing attitudes towards science, displayed by both individuals and groups. This knowledge may be useful in improving the effectiveness of social implementation.

AB  - High-resolution satellite images have high potential to acquire geospatial information over inaccessible areas such as Antarctica. Reference data are often required to increase the positional accuracy of the satellite data but the data are not available in many inland areas in Antarctica. Therefore this paper presents a multi-image RPCs (Rational Polynomial Coefficients) sensor modeling without any ground controls or reference data. Conjugate points between multi-images are extracted and used for the multi-image sensor modeling. The experiment was carried out for Kompsat-3A and showed that the significant accuracy increase was not observed but the approach has potential to suppress the maximum errors, especially the vertical errors.

AB  - The analysis of hyperspectral characteristics of materials near the South Han River has been conducted using riverside area measurements by drone installed hyperspectral sensors. Each spectrum reflectance of the riverside materials were compared and analyzed which were consisted of grass, concrete, soil, etc. To verify the drone installed hyperspectral measurements, a ground spectrometer was deployed for field measurements and comparisons for the materials. The comparison results showed that the riverside materials had their unique hyperspectral band characteristics, and the field measurements were similar to the remote sensing data. For the classification of the riverside area, the K-means clustering method and SVM classification method were utilized. The supervised SVM method showed accurate classification of the riverside area than the unsupervised K-means method. Using classification and clustering methods, the inherent spectral characteristic for each material was found to classify the riverside materials of hyperspectral images from drones.

TI  - Evaluation of SMAP/Sentinel 1 High-Resolution Soil Moisture Data to Detect Irrigation Over Agricultural Domain
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Irrigation is not well represented in land surface, hydrological, and climate models. One way to account for irrigation is by assimilating satellite soil moisture data that contains irrigation signal with land surface models. In this study, the irrigation detection ability of SMAP enhanced 9 km and SMAP-Sentinel 1 (SMAP-S1), 3 km and 1 km soil moisture products are evaluated using the first moment (mean) and the second moment (variability) of soil moisture data. The SMAP enhanced 9 km soil moisture product lacks irrigation signals in an irrigated plain south of Urmia Lake, whereas SMAP-S1 products record irrigation signal in soil moisture variability. Despite observing higher variability over irrigated areas, there are only small and inconsistent wet biases observed over irrigated pixels relative to nearby nonirrigated pixels during the irrigation season. This is partly attributable to the climatology vegetation water content used in the SMAP-S1 soil moisture retrieval algorithm that is not accounting for crop rotation and land management. Thus, in the second part of this study, we updated the retrieval algorithm to use dynamic vegetation water content. The update increased vegetation water content up to 1 kg/m(2) which corresponds with a 0.05 cm(3)/cm(3) increase in soil moisture during irrigation season. The update does not notably change soil moisture retrievals off season. This study shows that irrigation signals are present in both the first and second moment of soil moisture time series, and employing dynamic vegetation water content in the SMAP-S1 algorithm can enhance the irrigation signal over agricultural regions.

TI  - Deep Neural Network Regression for Estimating Land Surface Temperature at 10 Meter Spatial Resolution Using Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - SEVENTH GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM 2021
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 7th Geoinformation Science Symposium
CL  - Yogyakarta, INDONESIA
AB  - Land Surface Temperature (LST) is an important factor in geophysical parameters such as hydrological modeling, soil moisture, monitoring crop, etc. LST data with detailed resolution and the large-scale area is very helpful data in many research fields. Satellite imagery with thermal infrared sensors can be used to produce LST using a retrieval algorithm. Currently, Landsat 8 with TIRS sensor is freely available thermal infrared bands with the highest spatial resolution (resampled from 100m to 30m). Based on that situation, this study aims to build a model from optical bands of Landsat-8 as the input data and LST from Landsat-8 as the target data using Deep Neural Network regression (DNNr) architecture and then applied to Sentinel-2 to get LST at 10m resolution. The main difference of DNNr architecture with DNN for classification is we use linear activation function in the output layer. The study area is located in Yilan County, Taiwan. The input data from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 are optical bands (Blue, Green, Red, NIR), NDVI, and emissivity from NDVI. Both the input data have been standardized using the standardscaler function before feeding into the model. The input data were separated as 70% for training, 20% for validation, and the other 10% as testing data. We use air temperature data to calculate indirect validation with LST from Sentinel-2. The result shows, the mean absolute error and mean squared of testing data from DNNr are 0.581 degrees C and 0.766 degrees C. The correlation and maximum difference of air temperature with LST Sentinel-2 from DNNr are 0.92 and 2.94oC. Based on the experiments, our DNNr achieved a more good result than other regression architecture. Our DNNr architecture has been tested in other areas and also shows acceptable result. Based on that results, our LST product at 10m resolution can be used in others research fields.

AB  - Burn severity analysis using satellite imagery has high capabilities for research and management in inaccessible areas. We extracted the forest fire area of the DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) in the western Imjin Estuary which is restricted to access due to the confrontation between South and North Korea.Then we analyzed the forest fire severity and recoverability using atmospheric corrected Surface Reflectance Level-2 data collected from Landsat-8 OLI (Operational Land Imagery) / TIRS (Thermal Infrared Sensor).Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), differenced NBR (dNBR), and Relative dNBR (RdNBR) were analyzed based on changes in the spectral pattern of satellite images to estimate burn severity area and intensity.Also, we evaluated the recoverability after a forest fire using a land cover map which is constructed from the NBR, dNBR, and RdNBR analyzed results. The results of dNBR and RdNBR analysis for the six years (during May 30, 2014 – May 30, 2020) showed that the intensity of monthly burn severity was affected by seasonal changes after the outbreak and the intensity of annual burn severity gradually decreased after the fire events. The regrowth of vegetation was detected in most of the affected areas for three years (until May 2020) after the forest fire reoccurred in May 2017. The monthly recoverability (from April 2014 to December 2015) of forests and grass fields was increased and decreased per month depending on the vegetation growth rate of each season. In the case of annual recoverability, the growth of forest and grass field was reset caused by the recurrence of a forest fire in 2017, then gradually recovered with grass fields from 2017 to 2020. We confirmed that remote sensing was effectively applied to research of the burn severity and recoverability in the DMZ. This study would also provide implications for the management and construction statistics database of the forest fire in the DMZ.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin often affects the scalp and neck region and has a potential for complex lymphatic metastases. The aim of this study was to examine the pattern of lymphatic drainage that would enable better insight and prediction of lymphatic metastasis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) in relation to the anatomical localization of the primary process.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective analysis included 64 patients who underwent sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy. The biopsy was performed in patients with high- risk cutaneous head and neck squamous cell carcinoma between 2006 and 2010.RESULTS: SLNs in tumors of the forehead, temporal region, lateral cheek, and auricle were found in the cervical region at level II and parotid lymph nodes (p<0.001). In tumors of the nose, periorbital region, and postauricular tumors, SLNs were found in parotid lymph nodes (p<0.001), in tumors of the medial cheek in level I cervical lymph nodes and parotid lymph nodes (p=0.003). In tumors of the neck, SLNs were detected in the cervical region at level IV, whereas in tumors of the posterior scalp they were found in the occipital region (p<0.001).CONCLUSIONS: The results of SLN biopsy in high-risk cutaneous HNSCCs show the regularity of metastasis based on which a lymphatic drainage map can be constructed and thus potential metastatic sites depending on the primary tumor localization predicted.

TI  - NORWID AND STANDARDS CONTRIBUTIONS TO INTERPRETATION AND RECEPTION HISTORY OF THE POEM "ZYDOWIE POLSCY" ("POLISH JEWS")-A TWO-VOICE APPROACH
T2  - PAMIETNIK LITERACKI
M3  - Article
AB  - The article falls into in a series of comments on a famous Cyprian Norwid's poem Zydowie polscy (Pol-ish Jews. 1861). The authors, referring to the poem's interpretations to this day, focus first and foremost on the potential of its actualisation in the context of the contemporary reflection on the Polish-Jewish relationships, and in effect they turn attention to the risk of instrumentalisation that this mode of analysis brings about. A flagrant example of such practices is the reception of the text that took place in connection with the celebration of the poet's 50th death anniversary in 1933 in the papers of disparate worldview and political orientation (from "Mysl Narodowa" ("National Thought") to "Nasz Przeglad" ("Our Review")). The analysis of the statements allows to settle that the poem's variously profiled clarifications reveal its ambiguous reading in the context of Norwid's alleged attitude to Polish Jews and their place in citizen society, and in our perspective also induces to verify the modes of their presentation in the Polish imaginarium.

TI  - The world seen by another. Identification and its limits in First Contact
T2  - MIRANDA
M3  - Article
AB  - Arrival (Denis Villeneuve, 2016) explores the link between language and cognition, espousing the linguistic theory known as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, according to which the language one speaks shapes one's cognition and worldview. The film focuses on a linguist who, after learning how to speak the language of extra-terrestrial visitors who recently landed on Earth, finds out that she can think and feel like the aliens do-she thus undergoes a revolutionary transformation, as the alien language enables the protagonist to transcend humanity's view of time, thus gaining the capacity to foresee the future. This article suggests that by staging such a perceptual and cognitive revolution, the film explores the possibility of cinematic identification: by identifying with the protagonist, can the viewers also experience a worldview that is so radically other? I posit that the film celebrates the ethical dimension of identification while encouraging viewers to reflect upon the limits of cinematic identification and, in the process, the limits of the human capacity to identify with an Other.

TI  - A review of image fusion techniques for pan-sharpening of high-resolution satellite imagery
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Pan-sharpening methods are commonly used to synthesize multispectral and panchromatic images. Selecting an appropriate algorithm that maintains the spectral and spatial information content of input images is a challenging task. This review paper investigates a wide range of algorithms, including 41 methods. For this purpose, the methods were categorized as Component Substitution (CS-based), Multi-Resolution Analysis (MRA), Variational Optimization-based (VO), and Hybrid and were tested on a collection of 21 case studies. These include images from WorldView-2, 3 & 4, GeoEye-1, QuickBird, IKONOS, KompSat-2, KompSat-3A, TripleSat, Pleiades-1, Pleiades with the aerial platform, and Deimos-2. Neural network-based methods were excluded due to their substantial computational requirements for operational mapping purposes. The methods were evaluated based on four Spectral and three Spatial quality metrics. An Analysis Of Variance (ANOVA) was used to statistically compare the pan-sharpening categories. Results indicate that MRA-based methods performed better in terms of spectral quality, whereas most Hybrid-based methods had the highest spatial quality and CS-based methods had the lowest results both spectrally and spatially. The revisited version of the Additive Wavelet Luminance Proportional Pan-sharpening method had the highest spectral quality, whereas Generalized IHS with Best Trade-off Parameter with Additive Weights showed the highest spatial quality. CS-based methods generally had the fastest run-time, whereas the majority of methods belonging to MRA and VO categories had relatively long run times.

M3  - Review
AB  - The intestinal epithelium is one of our main interfaces with the outside world, including the intestinal microbiota. This epithelium thus combines the two essential functions of nutrient absorption and barrier. In order to fulfill its different roles. the intestinal epithelium is made up of several specialized cell types. Among these, tuft cells have long remained in the shadows, but the understanding of their function has accelerated dramatically in recent years. The purpose of this review is to outline the characterization of tuft cells and the discovery of their sentinel function in the intestinal mucosa.

AB  - Energy needs are increasing from year to year. However, in many countries, fossil energy is utilized in a large portion even though the country has a lot of potential for new and renewable energy. Geothermal is renewable energy has an important role in Indonesia besides other potential renewable energy such as water, wind, solar, and ocean tidal. This study aimed to identify non-volcanic geothermal manifestation in North Konawe Regency, South East Sulawesi Province, based on Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) remote sensing satellite image. Land Surface Temperature (LST) method was conducted using thermal band processing of Landsat ETM. For this purpose, the single-window algorithm was applied. Validation was also conducted through a ground survey. The result of this study showed that at least two geothermal manifestations were founded in two separate locations in Wawolesea village and Toreo respectively. From the LST analysis, we found that the temperature reached 26.35 to 37.42 Celsius Degree in both locations, where hot water spring as geothermal manifestation exist. According to the ground check, the temperature correlation between in situ and LST is enough which R-2=0.5155.

TI  - Total Suspended Matter Distribution in the Hooghly River Estuary and the Sundarbans: A Remote Sensing Approach
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring of total suspended matter (TSM) concentration in the coastal waters is vital for water quality monitoring and coastal management. In this study, TSM over the highly dynamic Hooghly estuary region is derived using moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectances at 645 nm and in situ TSM observations. MODIS TSM products show a correlation of 0.95, root-mean-square error of 24.72 g/m(3), and mean absolute and percentage errors of 18.25 g/m(3) and 23.2%, respectively, when compared with in situ measurements. Subsequently, TSM variability in the Hooghly estuary from the derived TSM maps was analyzed during the period 2003-2018 on monthly and seasonal time scales. The annual cycle of TSM showed peak concentration (>250 g/m(3)) during the southwest monsoon season that could be attributed to large-scale river discharge as compared with the northeast and intermonsoon seasons (similar to 100-150 g/m(3)). Interannual variability showed higher TSM during the years 2004, 2012, and 2013 and low during 2005 and 2015. It could be concluded that the fine tuning of the existing TSM retrieval algorithm is essential based on the long-term earth observation data for monitoring the sediment distribution in the coastal and estuarine regions utilizing available satellite observations, particularly in the highly turbid estuaries, such as the Hooghly estuary.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to provide the direction of Christian Early Childhood Education for Global Citizenship and prove the importance of Christian Education through the possibility of utilizing Christian Early Childhood Education for Global Citizenship, which integrates existing studies with religious faith by reconstructing and executing Early Childhood Education for Global Citizenship with the Christian worldview upon the development model of Christian Integrated Curriculum. To this end, through the study of Christian Curriculum models and materials related to early Childhood Education for Global Citizenship, Integrated Christian Education models of Early Childhood Education for Global Citizenship has been developed by combining the Christian Curriculum Development models of Overman and Johnson with the understanding-oriented curriculum of Wiggins and McTighe. Next, through the advice of experts and the development model of Christian Integrated Curriculum, the first Early Childhood Education for Global Citizenship was reconstructed into Christianity.In order to find out the possibility and effectiveness of the Christian Early Childhood Education for Global Citizenship developed in this way, an experimental study was conducted with 20 children in the experimental group and 20 children in the control group, a total of 40 children, who conducted the Christian Early Childhood Education for Global Citizenship. Based on the preliminary research, through secondary experts and advice, Early Childhood Education for Global Citizenship was finally reconstructed into Christianity. As a result of the study, the use of Overman and Johnson's model, which determines the subject, unit, and time, and connects Christian worldview to the subject, reflects the identity of Christianity in education, so it was easy to apply Christian identity to public education sites. Since the instructional stage is a simple three-stage instructional stage, it is easy to apply collectively to the learning activities, and the learning activities are developed by reinterpreting the meaning and contents through the assessment tasks developed in the previous stage of the learning activity plans. It was not a simple linking work, but it was easy to construct Christian Early Childhood Education for Global Citizenship into practical contents

AB  - The purpose of this study is to analyze the effects of Christian Early Childhood Education for Global Citizenship has on childhood character and to prove the possibility of its use in childhood character education. In order to verify its effects, three groups were evaluated with both pre- and post-tests that were then analyzed further with t-tests and ANOVA of the SPSS WIN 24.0 program, which derived a significant difference and led to the use of the Scheffe test in the program. The first group was an experimental group that consisted of 20 individuals taking Christian education, whereas the second and third groups were both control groups. Control group A consisted of 20 individuals taking general education, and control group B consisted of 20 individuals taking the existing Nuri course. The test results found that Christian Early Childhood Education for Global Citizenship had a positive effect on both “personality as a whole” and “sharing, consideration, respect, order, and cooperation”, which are the core virtues of childhood character. Accordingly, a Christian approach may be a new valid method to childhood character education, suggesting that a Christian worldview and spirituality should be taught at education sites to deal with both social pathology and the dissolution of education.

AB  - Bangudae Petroglyphs was created by people who hunted as primary means of survival. The carving techniques and the subjects vary because the petroglyphs were carved multiple different times by different people. The game likely changed because the climate of Ulsan region shifted over time. Bangudae Petroglyphs confirm that the hunting tools and methods changed. Some of the carved scenes describe people using bows to hunt herbivores and harpoons on whales. They also show that a canoe-like ship for multiple people was used for whaling.People carved petroglyphs on the rocks of Bangudae because they believed the rocks had special powers, thinking that offering prayers to gods while engraving the game would lead to a catch. The horizontal worldview that is characteristic of hunting societies is also present in the Bangudae Petroglyphs. The figure that seems to be calling whales and another figure with exaggerated limbs suggest that the whalers may have belonged to a society based on a horizontal view of the world. The petroglyphs show that the hunters who carved the images had maintained a communal culture.Bangudae Petroglyphs also provide a clear view into how the aesthetics and expressive techniques evolved over time. The simple motifs that just represented the shapes evolve into a more distinctive carvings that are part of a short narrative or an overlooking view of an composition that comprise a complex story. Petroglyphs of the late stages showcase detailed and distinctive carnivores as the main subjects.Bangudae Petroglyphs is remarkable in that it is a manifestation of a belief system. The creators of the petroglyphs semed to have been aware that materializing their beliefs could reorganize and reestablish concepts. Bangudae Petroglyphs could be understood as a work that confirms a group’s agreement and reinforcement of special acts and taboos as well as narratives that develop during a regular rituals.

AB  - Human society has made a vertical leap forward in the upward trajectory in economic growth, productivity, and social structure while going through the modern age of science and technology (the axial age of technology). Currently, we are witnessing the transition to the ‘second machine agethe fourth industrial revolution’; a hyperconnected intelligent society. In the digital ecosystem of this age, the principle of reciprocity of profit sharing is emphasized, and at the same time, a sense of empathic solidarity functions as a link that connects the global network of present humanity. However, in the world of connected networks, there are integrated favorable functions and contagious dysfunctions such as financial crisis, eurozone crisis, climate crisis, and the COVID-19 disaster that spread to the whole when a problem occurs in one part of the network. In particular, the dysfunction of the latter shows that the mechanistic and centristic (hegemonic) worldview of the industrial civilization of the first machine age (1st and 2nd industrial revolutions) or the economic human form of monopolization of profit has expired. This heralds the dialectical birth of a new paradigm of empathy for life that accompanies a hyperconnected smart society, that is, bioecological universality (modernity) that leads to global solidarity and cooperation.This study explored the civilizational alternative theory of humanities aimed at ecoeudemonism by actively accepting the academic inspiration and vision of the big history theory of axial civilization in the meaning of a bioecologically evolving society. Karl Jaspers’ Axial Age (BC800~BC200) is a mental mechanism that not only resolves the existential crisis facing today’s human society and agendas the coevolution of humans and technology, but also constitutes a universal ‘knowledge network to empathy for life’ in the global community. This existential philosophy of the history model is the source of universal and valid human being; true human creation (growth). It is also a reference point for preparing and guiding a new spiritual revolution in the hyperconnected era of the 21st century, namely, HomoEmpathicus and HomoAutonomous. In short, Jaspers’ axial discourse is a meaningful and important knowledge resource for humanities’ search for a civilizational theory that evokes the human community of self-realization and other self-realizations in line with the Human being’s existential progressive belief of a bioecologically evolving society in the face of today’s crisis and inflection point of civilization history.

AB  - In Jeju Island which has peculiarity for its geological features and hydrology system, hydrological factor analysis for the effective water management is necessary. Because in-situ hydro-meteorological data is affected by surrounding environment, the in-situ dataset could not be the spatially representative for the study area. For this reason, remote sensing data may be used to overcome the limit of the in-situ data. In this study, applicability assessment of MOD16 evapotranspiration data, Globas Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) based evapotranspiration/soil moisture data, and Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT) soil moisture product which were evaluated their applicability on other study areas was conducted. In the case of evapotranspiration, comparison with total precipitation and flux-tower based evapotranspiration were conducted. And for soil moisture, 6 in-situ data and ASCAT soil moisture product were compared on each site. As a result, 57% of annual precipitation was calculated as evapotranspiration, and the correlation coefficient between MOD16 evapotranspiration and GLDAS evapotranspiration was 0.759, which was a robust value. The correlation coefficient was 0.434, indicating a relatively low fit. In the case of soil moisture, in the case of the GLDAS data, the RMSE value was less than 0.05 at all sites compared to the in-situ data, and a statistically significant result was obtained as a result of the significance test of the correlation coefficient. However, for satellite data, RMSE over than 0.05 were found at Wolgak and there was no correlation at Sehwa and Handong points. It is judged that the above results are due to insufficient quality control and spatial representation of the evapotranspiration and soil moisture sensors installed in Jeju Island. It is estimated as the error that appears when adjacent to the coast. Through this study, the necessity of improving the existing ground observation data of hydrometeorological factors is emphasized.

CP  - 21st International Radar Symposium (IRS)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a remote sensing technique capable of acquiring high-resolution images of Earth's surface independent of sunlight illumination and weather conditions. In conventional spaceborne SAR, nadir echo may significantly affect the SAR image quality, if the pulse repetition frequency (PRF) is not properly selected. Waveform-encoded SAR has been introduced to alleviate the constraint in PRF selection by varying the transmitted waveform from pulse to pulse and suppressing the nadir echo within the processing. In particular, cyclically-shifted chirps can be used. This work tackles the issue of reducing the number of required distinct waveforms to reduce system complexity and make the concept viable for implementation. A technique to generate a waveform sequence characterized by a reduced number of distinct waveforms is proposed based on the Eulerian circuit. The nadir echo suppression performance is assessed through simulations using real TerraSAR-X data and a realistic nadir echo model.

AB  - This study explores how to recover teachers’ educational rhythm due to the COVID-19 pandemic, based on Dewey’s concept of rhythm. The core of the rhythm concept proposed by Dewey can be summarized as ‘aesthetic repetition,’ ‘variation in balance,’ and ‘integration of time and space.’ Aesthetic repetition means repeating various elements and relationships that make up the environment, not mechanical repetition. This concept of rhythm is transformed into the concept of ‘balance.’ The balance, Dewey argues, is not a static distribution but a process of dynamic rearrangement. Finally, he explained that for this process of aesthetic repetition and dynamic relocation to be properly implemented, time and space must exist as an integrated rather than separate ‘situation.’ The situation in which time and space are integrated can be seen as ‘daily life’ in simpler terms. The overall process of integrating the various elements of daily life experience and pursuing meaning and growth in it can be seen as the process of forming ‘rhythm,’ as Dewey said. Based on this, I proposed the following: i) the inquiry of daily life, ii) the restoration of a balanced worldview, and iii) the formation of a community of growth, as a concrete way for teachers to recover the lost educational rhythm.

AB  - Metaphorical theology saw the cause of the problem of ecosystems as the dualistic understanding and recognition of God in Western traditional theology. In other words, the Western traditional Christian-centered idea of ‘God-human-world’ gave rise to a ‘human-centered worldview,’ and it was seen that today’s ecosystem is being destroyed. Therefore, in order to overcome the ecological crisis and enable the Christian church and missions in the postmodern era, we need to use the metaphor of ‘Mother, Lover, Friend’ rather than the metaphor of ‘God the Father’ representing Western traditionalism to understand and recognize a new God. It is to seek a new theological method for missions in an ecological crisis.

AB  - This paper examines of a shameful modern subject who cannot speak with his own voice, the main topic of Lee Cheong-jun’s literature, and the ruling discourse that creates a disciplined identity of the people. In particular, Lee Cheong-jun, who sees the single identity of the people as a “trivialization of human beings” suggests a shift to a subject with individual universality and analyzes that this subject is leaning on a mythical style as a literary quest for his realization. The subjects of the study are the short story “Death of Magi” and the play “The Third God” which allergized the unjust, and tyrannical events committed by the state power of the time. This text analyze the national power discourse by substituting Pierre Bredieu’s language and attributes of symbolic power. Symbolic power in the two works works in the same way as ‘a prophecy, an appointment, and a taboo.’ This non-visual symbolic power makes the subject subjugate to a discourse by giving a performative command like a spell. This situation causes the shame of the subjects. The subject’s perceptional overthrow and the transition of worldview are the prerequisites for political overthrow. It is languages and characters that lead the transition of the subjects, and Lee Cheong-jun is afraid his literature, which turn into a phenomenal dominance order. It is an aporia that one have to disappear without leaving it as fixed letters after proving what has not yet come and what has not been said. Myth is one of the literature solution that Lee Cheong-jun found. It is mythical to assume that a human being as to be converted into a third god. A myth is an oral genre that is not hardened by letters, and has many variants and editions. The ontological solution of human beings who want to resemble the divinity in the story of gods can be interpreted and re-talked in many ways by times, places, and listeners. His literature, like ‘sitgimjil’(healing and purifying) that testifies and disappears after leading the way, borrowed the style of myth. Lee Cheong-jun’s literature pursued the transition to a subject with universal individuality by borrowing mythical style.

TI  - On Deflections of Vertical Determined From HY-2A/GM Altimetry Data in the Bay of Bengal
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite altimetry is an important technique to derive oceanic deflections of vertical (DOV). HaiYang-2A (HY-2A) is the first Chinese altimetry satellite launched in August 2011 to observe the global marine dynamic environment. To assess the reliability of DOVs derived from HY-2A geodetic mission data, the Bay of Bengal and its adjoining area (0 degrees-23 degrees N, 80 degrees-100 degrees E) are selected as the research area, and the accuracy of HY-2A/GM-derived DOVs is compared with that of DOVs determined from CryoSat-2-measured sea surface heights (SSHs) and SARAL/AltiKa (SARAL)-measured SSHs which are in the same period as HY-2A-measured SSHs. Compared with the along-track DOVs calculated from Sentinel-3B-measured SSHs (from cycle 20 to cycle 33), the RMS of differences for HY-2A-determined DOVs is 0.1 mu rad smaller than that for SARAL-determined DOVs and CryoSat-2-determined DOVs. The differences of the along-track DOVs in the frequency domain are also analyzed by power spectral density. In addition, the XGM2019e model is adopted to evaluate the quality of the gridded DOVs model established by least-squares collocation method. Marine gravity anomaly models (SIO V30.1) and ship-borne gravity anomalies are also used to assess the accuracy of gravity anomalies derived from gridded DOVs. The whole results show that the accuracy of HY-2A-determined DOVs is coincident with that of CryoSat-2-determined DOVs and slightly lower than that of SARAL-determined DOVs. Therefore, HY-2A/GM altimetry data can be applied in establishing the global high-precision DOV model.

TI  - Characterization of sea ice and its snow cover in the Arctic Pacific sector during the summer of 2016
T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - A comprehensive analysis of sea ice and its snow cover during the summer in the Arctic Pacific sector was conducted using the observations recorded during the 7th Chinese National Arctic Research Expedition (CHIANRE-2016) and the satellite-derived parameters of the melt pond fraction (MPF) and snow grain size (SGS) from MODIS data. The results show that there were many low-concentration ice areas in the south of 78 degrees N, while the ice concentration and thickness increased significantly with the latitude above the north of 78 degrees N during CHIANRE-2016. The average MPF presented a trend of increasing in June and then decreasing in early September for 2016. The average snow depth on sea ice increased with latitude in the Arctic Pacific sector. We found a widely developed depth hoar layer in the snow stratigraphic profiles. The average SGS generally increased from June to early August and then decreased from August to September in 2016, and two valley values appeared during this period due to snowfall incidents.

TI  - Study of ultrasound-guided ropivacaine combined with butorphanol continuous paravertebral block to prevent pain syndrome by evaluating ccl2 gene expression after radical mastectomy
T2  - CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to investigate the clinical effect of ultrasound-guided ropivacaine combined with butorphanol continuous paravertebral block in preventing postoperative pain syndrome of breast cancer. For this purpose, 100 women treated for breast cancer from April 2018 to July 2019 were enrolled as research objects. Surgical procedures included local sentinel lymph node biopsy, mastectomy, sentinel lymph node biopsy for mastectomy, modified radical mastectomy, and implantation. The selected patients were randomly divided into two groups: control group (routine operation anesthesia; n = 50) and observation group (ultrasound-guided thoracic paravertebral block before induction of ropivacaine+butorphanol anesthesia; n = 50). The Real-time PCR technique was performed to evaluate CCL2 gene expression. VAS scores were recorded during the postoperative period. Compared with the control group, the observation group had lower VAS scores at six h, 24h, and 48h (P<0.05). The pain effect of the observation group was less than that of the control group. The observation group had better analgesic effects after anesthesia. The observation group had a lower incidence of pain syndrome at the 6th, 8th, and 12th months (P<0.05), and the incidence of pain syndrome in the two groups decreased with the extension of time. The observation group had lower levels of related factors (P<0.05), and the observation group had lower traumatic stress responses. The protein expression of IL-6, IL-17, and CRP in the observation group was lower than that in the control group (P<0.05). The results of CCL2 gene expression also showed that gene expression in the control group increased significantly (P=0.0047). Since the expression of this gene is one of the factors that stimulate pain signals in the body, the method used in the present study was able to reduce the amount of pain significantly. Therefore, the combination of ropivacaine combined with butorphanol ultrasound-assisted paravertebral block can reduce the intensity of postoperative pain in patients with breast cancer surgery, decrease the incidence of pain syndrome, and increase pain tolerance.

TI  - GA-SVR Algorithm for Improving Forest Above Ground Biomass Estimation Using SAR Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) features have been demonstrated that they have the potentiality to improve forest above ground biomass (AGB) estimation accuracy, especially including polarimetric information. Genetic algorithms (GAs) have been successfully implemented in optimal feature identification, while support vector regression (SVR) has great robustness in parameter estimation. The use of combined GAs and SVR can improve the accuracy of forest AGB estimation through simultaneously identifying the optimal SAR features and selecting the SVR model parameters. In this article, 14 SAR polarimetric features were extracted from C-band and L-band full-polarization SAR images and worked as input SAR features, respectively. C-band data was acquired on GaoFen-3 mission, we also call it GF-3 image. L-band data was ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data. Both feature subsets from GF-3 and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 and SVR hyper parameters used in the forest AGB estimation were optimized by a GA processing, where 8 different settings of 3 kinds of parameters, as 512 kind of different combinations were applied for SVR hyper parameters searching field. The results of GA-SVR performance using the two datasets were presented and compared with two traditional methods: the algorithm of GA feature selection companied with default SVR parameters (GA+ default SVR), and the algorithm of GA feature selection companied with grid searching for SVR parameter selection (GA+Grid SVR). The results showed that the proposed GA-SVR algorithm improved the forest AGB estimation accuracy with cross-validation coefficient of 80.21% for GF-3 and 71.41% for ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data.

M3  - research-article
AB  - While the tea ceremony is a Seon culture in which tea brought us into the world of enlightenment, temple food is a Seon culture that food brought us into the world of enlightenment. The tea ceremony and temple food are expressions of prajna based on the sentiments of the scholars who linked the concept of food to human survival and enlightenment. The tea ceremony and temple food are representative Seon culture of the image of Seon that projected the world of enlightenment from Buddha in the 5th century BC through the practice of prajna in the soil in the 6th and 7th centuries AD. The purpose of this article is to illuminate the worldview of the temple food and tea ceremony, which were made mainly in the contemporary era. The purpose of the Patriarch(祖師) in recommending the process of making temple food and the tea ceremony is only for one reason, and that is ‘enlightenment’. The teachings of the Patriarch are the Great Doe with No Gate(大道無門) that penetrates the world of the Uninterrupted Gate(不二門). Bodhidharma is the starting point from which the essential nature of ‘enlightenment’ is implied in the process of making temple food and the tea ceremony in China. It is because the direct experience of enlightenment could not exist if Bodhidharma had not passed on the saddle of the Buddha of Buddha from India to China. In this article, I would like to discuss the process of shaping the Seon of temple food and tea ceremony, which were inevitably made in the process of forming Chinese Seon. It was a golden age of culture. The development of Seon Buddhism caused the formation of Seon culture, and changed the food culture, such as food and water, directly related to meditation, into the world of enlightenment. The food culture is temple food, and water has formed a tea ceremony culture about tea. The world of temple food and tea ceremony was created for the purpose of one word: enlightenment. The unity of labor and goodness, which started from the East Mountain Teaching(東山法門), is a realistic projection of the realization of the tea ceremony and temple food as the linear image of labor.

TI  - Adaptive Component Discrimination Network for Airplane Detection in Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Airplane detection and recognition in the high-resolution remote sensing images (RSIs) remain a challenging task due to the factors of multiple view angles, multiple scales, multiple orientations, etc. This article proposes an adaptive component discrimination network for airplane detection and recognition in RSIs, which focuses on various scales from global to local, making full use of the overall contour as well as the dominant component features of airplanes. First, a standardization processing module is proposed for image projection conversion and resolution uniform to alleviate the confusion of different types of airplanes in different resolution images. Second, the rotatable boundingbox-based pyramid network is utilized to extract candidate airplane coordinates and categories. Furthermore, an adaptive aircraft component discrimination method is established for confusing few-shot airplane targets recognition, which consists of a target orientation adaptive adjustment module (OAAM) and a component discrimination module (CDM). OAAM obtains airplanes with the same orientations by predicting the orientation of the slices and rotating them adaptively. All the uniformed slices are then fed into the CDM for dominant components detection, which corrects the target preclassification results, improving the classification performance. Experiments conducted on the 2020 Gaofen Challenge demonstrate the efficacy and superiority of the proposed method.

AB  - Yangquan is rich in coal resources, and coal mining activities are frequent, which usually causes significant subsidence in the mining area. Substations and power stations around the mining area may be affected by subsidence. In this paper, the time series SAR images of the 25 Sentinel-1A satellite in Yangquan from January to November 2019 are obtained to monitor the deformation of substations and photovoltaic power stations by using the SBAS-InSAR technology. The results show that the deformation range of the study area is between -23.8cm and 11.2cm. In addition, there are multiple subsidence "bowl" due to coal mining. The deformation range of the feature points of the five substations in Wenchi, Niangziguan, Changling, Luhu and Ceshi is between -1cm and 1cm, which are in a stable state. However, there is a continuous linear subsidence phenomenon in Ququcheng photovoltaic power station. Among the Ququcheng three subsidence feature points, the maximum annual subsidence reaches more than 4cm. The main reasons for the subsidence are the gravity component of soil and the increased ground load caused by the power generation device in this area.

TI  - Spatial-temporal changes of China's mangrove forests over the past 50 years: An analysis towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
T2  - CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests are tropical trees and shrubs that grow in sheltered coastlines, mudflats, and river banks in many parts of the world. These forests are rated amidst the most productive natural ecosystems on the earth, and are ecologically and socioeconomically important because of their crucial roles in coastal ecosystem protection. However, these forests are declining at an alarming rate, which is possibly more rapid than that of inland tropical forests. This serious loss has prompted a worldwide movement to protect and promote the sustainable use of mangrove forests. Recently, many governments adopted the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs present an opportunity for nations to set realistic targets for achieving sustainable use of natural resources and environmental capital. Relevant to mangrove conservation, a range of targets were established for implementation by the year 2020, including Targets 6.6, 14.2, 14.5, and 15.2. To date, mangrove forests have been protected and restored for decades in China. However, little is known about achievements of China's SDGs implementation on mangrove forests. The issue highlighted the need for a long-term holistic view of China's mangrove forests dynamics. Although there have been multiple national datasets of China's mangrove forests, few studies focused specifically on mangrove forests and their surrounding land covers. Thus, the objectives of this study are: (1) to apply a systematic remote sensing method across the entire coast of China, and build a new dataset of long-term China's mangrove forests and surrounding land covers in 1973, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, 2015 (the first year of SDGs), and 2020 (the complete year of mangrove related SDGs); (2) to quantify the spatial-temporal changes of mangrove forests and conversion between mangrove forests and other coastal land covers; and (3) to discuss the achievements of China's SDGs implementation on mangrove forests. In this study, we applied a hybrid object-based and hierarchical classification method to Landsat series imagery and achieved a high accuracy dataset of China's mangrove forests and surrounding land covers. Results showed that: (1) on national scale, area of mangrove forests declined from 48801 to 18602 ha between 1973 and 2000, then partially recovered to 28010 ha in 2020; (2) the lost mangrove forests were mainly changed to croplands and aquaculture ponds, while the restored mangrove forests were mainly converted from tidal flats; and (3) during 2015-2020, China government restored 25% of national mangrove forests. To Sep. 2020, the area of mangrove nature reserves accounted for 16% of mangrove growth zone, and 77% of China's mangrove forests grew inside these nature reserves. A batch of relevant laws and regulations has been formulated to prohibit mangrove forests destruction. The protection and restoration of mangrove forests in China have already met Targets 6.6, 14.2, 14.5, and 15.2. However, since illegal logging is strictly prohibited and the awareness of protecting mangrove ecosystem has been increased continuously, losses of mangrove forests in some areas were mainly caused by natural disasters, such as extremely low temperature, hurricane, biological invasions, and insect outbreaks. For example, according to the Guangxi Mangrove Research Center, in March 2008 numbers of Avicennia plants along the coasts of Guangxi were killed by extremely low temperature, and in Guangxi Shankou Mangrove Nature Reserve, more than 167 ha of Spartina alterniflora (an invasive species) were discovered in 2005.The classification method and datasets of this study can support the evaluation of SDG 6.6 implementation, and provide important information for SDGs 13, 14, and 15 evaluation. In addition, the results of this study can serve as an important scientific basis and fundamental data for formulating China's mangrove protection and restoration strategies.

T2  - Marine Science Bulletin (Beijing)
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of Nansha Islands and reefs is affected by spatial location, exposed area and geological structure, and the evolution of reefs is accompanied by the change of spatial morphology. In this paper, remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) are used to map the density of Nansha Islands and reefs, and Kernel Density is used to further analyze the spatial distribution of Nansha reefs. The results show that the spatial form of Nansha Islands and reefs is complex with obvious regional pattern, the core density of islands and reefs with relatively large surface differences is concentrated in different places, and their distribution features are relatively dense. The number of islands and reefs fluctuates obviously in latitude direction and tends to be stable in longitude direction. With the increase of reef area, the reef average shape index increases gradually and the average compactness decreases gradually. The shape index (LSI) is between 0.90 similar to 2.87, and the reef compactness (RC) is between 0.31 similar to 0.97. The research results are helpful to understand the density of Nansha Islands and reefs and provide reference for marine administrators.

TI  - Learned Local Features for Structure From Motion of UAV Images: A Comparative Evaluation
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images have become the main remote sensing data sources for varying applications, and structure from motion (SfM) is the golden standard for resuming camera poses. Matching local feature descriptors is the prerequisite for the accurate and complete orientation of UAV images. Recently, some newly proposed learned methods have been shown to outperform the hand-crafted methods, such as the scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) and its variants, and almost all learned methods have been trained and evaluated by using images from the internet with varying focal lengths and varying size. It is of interest to investigate the performance of these learned methods with their pretrained models for feature detection and description in the context of the SfM-based orientation. Thus, this article conducts a comprehensive evaluation of both advanced hand-crafted and newly proposed learned detectors and descriptors by using four UAV datasets. The performance of these selected methods is compared in the context of feature matching and the SfM and (multiview stereo) MVS-based reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that the learned descriptors combined with the SIFT-like detectors can provide accurate and complete feature correspondences and achieve better or competitive performance in the SfM and MVS-based reconstruction. For UAV image orientation, the learned descriptors can be an alternative to the existing hand-crafted descriptors without their model retraining. The source codes of this evaluation would be made publicly available.

TI  - Surface Water Extraction and Dynamic Analysis of Baiyangdian Lake Based on the Google Earth Engine Platform Using Sentinel-1 for Reporting SDG 6.6.1 Indicators
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface water is an essential element that supports natural ecosystem health and human life, and its losses or gains are closely related to national or local sustainable development. Monitoring the spatial-temporal changes in surface water can directly support the reporting of progress towards the sustainable development goals (SDGs) outlined by the government, especially for measuring SDG 6.6.1 indicators. In our study, we focused on Baiyangdian Lake, an important lake in North China, and explored its spatiotemporal extent changes from 2014 to 2020. Using long-term Sentinel-1 SAR images and the OTSU algorithm, our study developed an automatic water extraction framework to monitor surface water changes in Baiyangdian Lake at a 10 m resolution from 2014 to 2020 on the Google Earth Engine cloud platform. The results showed that (1) the water extraction accuracy in our study was considered good, showing high consistency with the existing dataset. In addition, it was found that the classification accuracy in spring, summer, and fall was better than that in winter. (2) From 2014 to 2020, the surface water area of Baiyangdian Lake exhibited a slowly rising trend, with an average water area of 97.03 km(2). In terms of seasonal variation, the seasonal water area changed significantly. The water areas in spring and winter were larger than those in summer and fall. (3) Spatially, most of the water was distributed in the eastern part of Baiyangdian Lake, which accounted for roughly 57% of the total water area. The permanent water area, temporary water area, and non-water area covered 49.69 km(2), 97.77 km(2), and 171.55 km(2), respectively. Our study monitored changes in the spatial extent of the surface water of Baiyangdian Lake, provides useful information for the sustainable development of the Xiong'an New Area and directly reports the status of SDG 6.6.1 indicators over time.

TI  - New insights into heavy metal elements deposition in the snowpacks of mountain glaciers in the eastern Tibetan Plateau
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric heavy metals have important environmental and health threats. To investigate atmospheric deposition and contamination of heavy metal elements in the glaciers of the eastern Tibetan Plateau (ETP), we collected the surface snow (cryoconites) samples in the Lenglongling Glacier (LG), the Gannan Snowpack (GS), the Dagu Glacier (DG), the Hailuogou Glacier (HG) and Yulong Snow-mountain Glacier (YG) in summer 2017. Samples were analyzed for concentrations and enrichment factors (EFs) of Al and trace elements (Pb, Co, Cd, Ba, Mn, Ga, Sc, V, Zn, Cr, Ni, Cu, Rb, Sb, Cs, As, Mo, Li) using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Results showed that the concentrations and EFs of heavy metals (e.g. Sb, Cu, Cr, Ni, As, Mo) were generally high value in YG, GS and LG, while were relatively low value in DG and HG, implying that ETP glaciers may have been affected by atmospheric anthropogenic pollutants deposition to varying degrees. Comparing the heavy metal concentrations in the glaciers with those in the precipitation of middle/eastern China cities and also the South Asian cities, we find that the glacial heavy metal concentrations were generally low level, though the anthropogenic pollutants were still significantly enriched. Taking the spatial distribution of As and Ni concentration/EFs in the glaciers and surrounding urban precipitation as an example, we find that the heavy metal pollutants were probably transported to the glaciers through three routes from the surrounding densely populated area of Asia. The MODIS AOD and NCEP/NCAR wind vector also demonstrated that the atmospheric pollutants originated from anthropogenic emissions of urban areas of both South Asia, and northwest and east China, mainly caused by the large scale atmospheric circulation (e.g. the South Asian Monsoon, westerlies and Eastern Asian Summer Monsoon). Therefore, control of these potential pollution emission sources of the surrounding densely populated areas in Asia could be important to ETP glaciers in future perspectives.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to analyze the 『Standard Korean』 KSL text book for middle and high school students with multicultural backgrounds published by the National Institute of Korean Language in 2019 and to find out what social values and ideologies are reflected in students with multicultural backgrounds. Thus, this study looked at multicultural ideologies centered on ‘the otherness’ and ‘minority’.As a result, the intention of writing the 『Standard Korean』 textbook, the object of study, and the introduction of characters were able to see the ideology of ‘the otherness’. And it was confirmed that it implies a ‘minority’ ideology by creating a structure of ‘general students(superiority)-multicultural students(inferiority)’ through the dialogue in the textbook. To overcome these ideologies, the 『Standard Korean』 textbook for middle and high school students with multicultural backgrounds needs to be approached individually and subdivided by subjects and titles such as 『Korean textbook for immigrant youth』 or 『Korean textbook for foreign youth』. Also, within the dialogue, multicultural students need to play a more self-reliant role and emphasize what they are good at, not what they are lacking.‘Multicultural’ in Korean society has already become a discriminatory term, and embodied the ideology. Alos, it has already been used in many places without deep consideration. Therefore, when we erase the discriminatory ideology contained in the term ‘multicultural’ and become a society that can coexist with various students, we will be able to enter a ‘diverse community society’ where ‘diverse students’ exist, not ‘multicultural students’.

AB  - Meteorite impacts participated in the formation of the Solar System and continue to modify the planetary surfaces, originating a structure present in all of them, the craters. Terrestrial craters are abundant, geological and biological significant structures and are related to largemineral ores. The Earth impact record continues to be deciphered, currently 190 terrestrial impact structures have been confirmed, and it is estimated that several hundred remain to be discovered. One of the techniques to detect a crater candidate site is Remote Sensing, however it is a difficult task, due to the large information that must be processed, the lack of discriminant features for crater and non-crater regions and appropriated methods to recognize them. We propose an approach to identify meteorite impact structures, based on textural features of ALOS/PALSAR grayscale radar images, using supervised automatic learning. For this, the quotient of HV and HH polarimetric bands of these images was calculated. The resulting images were segmented by global thresholding to generate two sets of training samples: structure type and regions type of craters and non-craters, with them different kinds of classifiers (Bayesian, Fuzzy, Genetics, Bagging, and Boost) were trained, getting accuracy between 81 to 99% for craters identification.

TI  - Combining 3D Radiative Transfer Model and Convolutional Neural Network to Accurately Estimate Forest Canopy Cover From Very High-Resolution Satellite Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest canopy cover (FCC) plays an important role in many ecological, hydrological and forestry applications. For large-scale applications, FCC is usually estimated from remotely sensed data by inverting radiative transfer models (RTMs) or using data-driven regressions. In this article, we proposed a hybrid model, which combines a 3-D RTM and transfer learning-based convolutional neural network (T-CNN), to estimate FCC from very high-resolution satellite images (e.g., Chinese GaoFen-2, 1 m resolution with 4 bands). Unlike common hybrid models that are purely trained with simulation data, T-CNN combines simulation data-based pre-training and actual data-based transfer learning, which is a widely used technique in artificial intelligence for fine-tuning models. The performance of T-CNN was compared with a random forest (RF) model and two general CNN models, including CNN trained with actual dataset only (data-CNN) and CNN trained with RTM simulation data only (RTM-CNN). Results on the independent validation dataset (not used in training stage) showed that T-CNN had higher accuracy (RMSE = 0.121, R-2 = 0.83), compared with RF (RMSE = 0.26, R-2 = 0.61), Data-CNN (RMSE = 0.142, R-2 = 0.81), and RTM-CNN (RMSE = 0.144, R-2 = 0.73), which indicates that T-CNN has a strong transferability. Tests on different training sizes showed that T-CNN (0.084 < RMSE < 0.108) provided constantly better performances than RF (0.116 < RMSE < 0.122) and data-CNN (0.103 < RMSE < 0.128), which demonstrates the potential of T-CNN as an alternative to RTM-based inversion and data-driven regressions to estimate FCC, especially when training data is imbalanced and inadequate.

M3  - research-article
AB  - Zhuangzi's second chapter, Qiwulun 齊物論, deals with some of the most philosophical and subtle subjects in Zhuangzi. The Butterfly's Dream Fable at the very back of Qiwulun can be said to be a fable that represents the entire Zhuangzi philosophy. The Butterfly's Dream Fable contains important themes of enlightenment and change. One of the important teachings of the Butterfly's Dream Fable is that we must realize that the world is not objectively real, but is unconsciously constructed by ourselves. Zhuangzi reveals his worldview through the expression Wuhua 物化 in the parable of the butterfly's dream. Wuhua should be consistent with the ideology of the Zhuangzi philosophy of qiwu 齊物, but it causes difficulties in interpretation because of the 'fen 分' character immediately before the expression wuhua. Because fen is not compatible with qiwu. In this paper, by interpreting wuhua as a concept representing emergent generative theory, an interpretation that can reconcile fen and qiwu is proposed.

AB  - The Buddhism of the Eastern Jin Dynasty does not view traditional Chinese philosophy and Buddhism as synchronically parallel to one another, and is difficult to grasp. With this in mind, this paper focuses on Sun Chuo(孫綽), regarded as a typical intellectuals of the Eastern Jin Dynasty, to examine some aspects of the Buddhist philosophy and faith as espoused by the Buddhist intellectuals of the Eastern Jin Dynasty. To this end, the study examines the philosophical basis on which Sun Chuo created You Tiantai shan fu(遊天台山賦, Fu on Roaming the Celestical Terrace Mountains). Futhermore, the study examines the possibility that together with the then prevailing Prajna thought(般若思想) of Buddhism, various other concepts like Confucianism, Taoism, and thought of Sehn Xina(神仙 Immortality) were appropriated as the philosophical background of You Tiantai shan fu. Sun Chuo’s religious interest as demonstrated in You Tiantai shan fu pivots on “a Buddhist worldview” that serves as the foundation of the overall composition of the work. In You Tiantai shan fu, Sun Chuo does not stick to idealism, but identifies his experience with the attainment of Taoist trainees including shengren(聖人 Sage). In a nutshell, Sun Chuo integrated the three teachings(三敎 Confucianism, Buddhism and Taoism) by attaining “the way”(道). Therefore, he viewed Confucian conceptions of the Sage, Buddha, and Laozi as sharing the same horizon. Sun Chuo not only had an intellectual understanding of such idea attainments, but also tried to overcome various relative oppositions to reach beyond them.

AB  - Daoshi (道世) developed a Buddhist view of the universe in Fayuan Zhulin (法苑珠林 Forest of Gems in the Garden of the Dharma), and was most conscious of the confrontation with the Soushen Ji (搜神記 In Search of the Supernatural) because not only does the Soushen Ji record a number of changes, but it also contains "the theory of changes in the five pneumas (五氣變化論)" pursuing such a principle. Inspired by Xuanzang (玄奘), who translated Cheng Weishi Lun (成唯識論 Discourse on the Perfection of Consciousness-only), Daoshi established the theory of consciousness-only by breaking apart Gan Bao's (干寶) theory of changes in the five pneumas (五氣變化論) to succinctly demonstrate the superiority of Buddhism.The study of three religions of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism has thus far focused on the debate between Buddhism and Taoism. Yet, Buddhism has not overlooked the power of Confucianism, which established the worldview of the intellectuals in China. Gan Bao's Soushen Ji emphasizes the Qi(氣) as theorized by Liu Xin (劉歆) and Zheng Xuan (鄭玄) and includes the idea of zaiyi (災異 natural calamity), which preceded the theory of Xiangshu Yi (象數易). Therefore, Daoshi argued against the most important interrelations between Heaven and Mankind (天人相關說) among Confucianism incorporated in the Soushen Ji (搜神記), rather than against Taoism.

TI  - Sequence Image Interpolation via Separable Convolution Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote-sensing time-series data are significant for global environmental change research and a better understanding of the Earth. However, remote-sensing acquisitions often provide sparse time series due to sensor resolution limitations and environmental factors, such as cloud noise for optical data. Image interpolation is the method that is often used to deal with this issue. This paper considers the deep learning method to learn the complex mapping of an interpolated intermediate image from predecessor and successor images, called separable convolution network for sequence image interpolation. The separable convolution network uses a separable 1D convolution kernel instead of 2D kernels to capture the spatial characteristics of input sequence images and then is trained end-to-end using sequence images. Our experiments, which were performed with unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and Landsat-8 datasets, show that the method is effective to produce high-quality time-series interpolated images, and the data-driven deep model can better simulate complex and diverse nonlinear image data information.

TI  - Seismic sentinel? An analysis of captive giant panda behavior in response to the Lushan earthquake in China
T2  - EARTHQUAKE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - It is widely believed that various animal species can sense and respond to the geophysical stimuli that precede earthquakes, especially electromagnetic fields, although supporting field evidence is mostly anecdotal. Here we report on the reactions of four female giant pandas under observation over the three days prior to the Lushan (30.1 degrees N, 103.0 degrees E) magnitude 7.0 earthquake that occurred in Sichuan province, China, on April 20, 2013. We observed no significant generalized behavioral anomalies indicative of them perceiving an impending earthquake. We also observed no startle behaviors in the 5 s prior to tremors commencing, indicating that these pandas either did not detect or did not respond to precursor P-waves. Our findings suggest that although giant pandas have evolved in, and continue to occupy exclusively, a seismically active range in central China, they do not appear to perceive pre-earthquake geophysical warning signs.

TI  - PSRN: Polarimetric Space Reconstruction Network for PolSAR Image Semantic Segmentation
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To accurately extract various ground objects from polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images is a challenging research topic. The deep convolutional neural networks are widely used in SAR segmentation due to their remarkable performance in optical remote sensing images. However, they are still limited by the geometric deformation of the objects, the strong scattering interference among adjacent objects, and the difficulty in distinguishing similar things. A large part of the reason lies in the insufficient utilization and the damage of feature mining for PolSAR data. In this article, focusing on the scattering matrix and the polarimetric coherency matrix, a polarimetric space reconstruction network is proposed. First, to maintain the relatively initial spatial constraints and the complete polarimetric information, the inputs are arranged by a spatial amplification coding method for the polarimetric coherency and scattering matrices. Second, a statistics enhancement module based on scattering characteristics is proposed to mine the differential expression among multiple scattering and polarimetric components, which supplements the local feature representation of convolutional operators. Third, the designed dual self-attention mechanism can capture the amplitude and phase relations of matrix element context adaptively. The proposed method keeps the spatiality of each scattering vector and fully explores the complementary information involved in the fully polarimetric data. Moreover, it accomplishes the accurate land cover classification for PolSAR images, especially the traditional confusing categories, such as water and roads. The experimental results on the E-SAR, AIRSAR, Gaofen-3, and RADARSAT-2 datasets show that the proposed method is effective and promising for PolSAR image segmentation.

AB  - In the age of digital disruption, coming up with continuous innovation has become a major challenge. The first step to overcoming this challenge is to understand the current state of the innovation activities with reference to customer value. We propose an innovation evaluation framework using the state transition probability of a product. This framework not only provides cost and delivery efficiency in terms of customer contribution, but also provides the innovation characteristics of the enterprise. We applied the proposed framework to software products of FY 2018 and found that the average product had a 14% probability of being added to a service within one year of starting development and that 28% of the development costs contributed to customer value. We also uncovered various structural issues in the innovation process. These findings are consistent with our intuitive impressions, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework as a means of grasping the status quo.

TI  - Mannan-Based Nanodiagnostic Agents for Targeting Sentinel Lymph Nodes and Tumors
T2  - MOLECULES
M3  - Article
AB  - Early detection of metastasis is crucial for successful cancer treatment. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsies are used to detect possible pathways of metastasis spread. We present a unique non-invasive diagnostic alternative to biopsy along with an intraoperative imaging tool for surgery proven on an in vivo animal tumor model. Our approach is based on mannan-based copolymers synergistically targeting: (1) SLNs and macrophage-infiltrated solid tumor areas via the high-affinity DC-SIGN (dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin) receptors and (2) tumors via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. The polymer conjugates were modified with the imaging probes for visualization with magnetic resonance (MR) and fluorescence imaging, respectively, and with poly(2-methyl-2-oxazoline) (POX) to lower unwanted accumulation in internal organs and to slow down the biodegradation rate. We demonstrated that these polymer conjugates were successfully accumulated in tumors, SLNs and other lymph nodes. Modification with POX resulted in lower accumulation not only in internal organs, but also in lymph nodes and tumors. Importantly, we have shown that mannan-based polymer carriers are non-toxic and, when applied to an in vivo murine cancer model, and offer promising potential as the versatile imaging agents.

TI  - A Study on Epistemological Hermeneutics about Media Images through Gaston Bachelard’s Phenomenology of Imagination

M3  - research-article
AB  - (Background and Purpose) The study began with recognizing the problem that revolutionary changes in science and technology are shifting world space and things towards simulated spectacular images corresponding to the rate of dematerialization of virtual space and things, instead of the first-hand experience with humans by materiality. First, the study aims to find an epistemological method in Bachelard's image phenomenology to design media images and interpret them in the mutual process of experiencing them. Second, we analyze existing studies on the simulated phenomenon and spectacular images to consider the present situation. Third, it reveals that the image is not a spectacle, which blurs human rational judgment through one-dimensional immersion, but rather becomes the basis of human reason and emotional activity. (Method) First, it examines the concept of the spectacle and the image of the simulacrum, which has been expanded to cultural phenomena. Second, it examines the concept of Bachelard's image phenomenology. Third, the poetic image of Bachelard is analyzed by comparing it with the attributes of the spectacular image of a modern technology-oriented society. Fourth, the phenomenological orientation toward the act of producing media images in connection with the visually-centered phenomenon of design is summarized, and areas to be continuously discussed are proposed. (Results) First, media images must be able to summon artistic thoughts. Second, the media image should give rise to aesthetic thoughts. Third, furthermore, the process of discovering the ontological epistemological horizon of media images must be prioritized. Before producing media images, the philosophical topics required by the present era should be reviewed and discussed. This is because metaphors through philosophical and artistic thinking intervene with our unique sensibility and worldview in which we perceive things. This is linked to the production capacity to realize images latent in our consciousness. (Conclusions) The effort to replace existing media images with Bachelard’s phenomenological images is intended to reconstruct and restore the original nature of the image. The artistic thoughts for Bachelard's imagination and image must be summoned to restore media images from a life focused solely on science and technology. The act of producing media images must now turn to the direction of producing active phenomenological images. This is because the imaginative way of life can connect with the existential aesthetic consciousness, that is, the aesthetic way of life. Hopefully, discussions with expanded media ecology concepts will continue in the future by recognizing media images as environments.

M3  - research-article
AB  - This study explored the content analysis capabilities of Voyant Tools with fifteen letters written by the Southern Presbyterian missionary W. Junkin between 1892 and 1905. The results and findings of the study are as follows. First, the Summary tool presented that the most frequent content words in the first seven letters are little, Kunsan, church, good, and work. Second, the major factor that influenced the interpretation of the outcome of Cirrus turned out to be the human researcher’s subjectivity that is based on his or her worldview, prejudice and background knowledge. To be specific, the researcher’s focus on the missionary’s description of anonymous Korean kinds led to the subjective apprehension of the Cirrus result. Third, it was shown that the Distinctive Words list in the Summary tool can detect parts of topics that are particular to the letter in question. This is evident from the three demonstrations from this study, which compared the list of Distinctive Words with the researcher’s color-coded categorization.Next, it is proposed that when comprehending the meaning of the Cirrus result, it is necessary to consider the possible discrepancy between the researcher’s expectation and the actual content of the target text. This is because the visualized word cloud on a display panel is devoid of contexts that are critical in inferring significations whereas a human scholar tends to apprehend the meanings of words at the moment they are displayed on the screen. Furthermore, the study results imply that a humanities researcher can save time and energy with the use of the Distinctive Words in Summary, because he or she need not go through the whole texts line by line to extract key themes that are specific to the target text, compared to the contents in the rest of the corpus. Additionally, the Contexts tool is expected to provide an in-depth exploration of concordances, which can be easily refined according to a scholar’s area of interest. This is possible by typing a keyword into the search window embedded in the tool.Given the fact that a missionary’s letters are regarded as a valuable primary source of information for studying the humanities, it is hoped that this research will be a qualitative illustration of how a digital device can assist a scholar with performing text analysis on a vast amount of research materials.

T2  - THE EASTERN ART
T2  - 동양예술
M3  - research-article
AB  - Looking at the history of Chinese history, even the same person can find a person whose reasons and actions can be understood differently according to the criteria for evaluating the person. If such a person is selected among Confucius’ disciples, Yan Hui, who is called Confucius’ student and virtue, can be mentioned. As for Yan Hui, who was revered as a ‘restoration’ but failed to properly unfold his thoughts, the form of Yan Hui, which Zhu Xi understood, is mentioned. Zhu Xi’s view of Yan Hui contains Neo-Confucianism sage orthodoxy and Opposing heresy consciousness in Neo-Confucianism. Zhu Xi’s limited acceptance and exclusion of Yan Hui raised the problem of not properly identifying the aesthetics of Yan Hui’s aim for live in seclusion and its live in seclusion from an aesthetic level. The understanding of Yan Hui can be approached from three main perspectives, depending on what position you understand historically. First, it is an understanding of 『Zhungzi』 and Yan Hui in metaphysical dimension. Next, it is an understanding of Yan Hui that appeared in the new Confucian scholars of the Song Dynasty centered on Zhu Xi. Finally, it is Yan Hui understood by Yangming Scholar such as Wangshouren. This point is intended to be clarified by applying it to what Confucius said in Analect, “Yan Hui was close to Tao and often starved for meals.” In particular, we tried to pay attention to the possibility that the worldview pursued by Yan Hui could be understood differently depending on how we understand the ‘emptiness’ of “repeated emptiness”. This is because the various understandings related to Yan Hui’s life suggest a very important point in understanding a part of the aesthetic life that Confucian scholars are aiming for. From an aesthetic point of view, Yan Hui’s life, which did not let go of its joy while saying ‘live simple on a bamboo dish of rice and agourd of drink,’ and also ‘repeated efficiency,’ becomes a epitome of the life of live in seclusion that literati aims for afterwards. In this respect, the life of ‘repeated emptiness’ aimed at Yan Hui is meaningful in that it will form a model of the aesthetic life aimed at Confucian scholars in future generations, and re-recognition of Yan Hui's life is required at the level of philosophy by Yangming Scholar and Taoism is required.

TI  - Investigating the potential for global positioning satellite data to provide information on ewe behaviour around the time of lambing
T2  - New Zealand Journal of Animal Science and Production
M3  - Article
AB  - Global positioning satellite (GPS) devices allow spatial-temporal data sets to be generated which can describe ewe movement around the time of lambing and can potentially be linked to traits of interest, such as the timing and location of lambing events and maternal outcomes including lamb weaning weight. Collar-mounted GPS units were fitted to 25 ewes during their anticipated lambing period. Lambing timing and site were estimated based on a minimum of twice-daily checks of the ewes. Lambing and GPS data were ultimately available for 15 ewes. From the resulting data set, several traits were calculated including the average distance deviation from the central point of the three-hour time block. During the birthing event (at a resolution of hours), the ewes changed their movement behaviour and remained close to the centralised point of the three-hour block. There were significant associations among the weaning weight of the ewes' offspring (adjusted for rearing rank) and the GPS-derived traits: ewes that were comparatively inactive produced lambs with low weaning weights. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of GPS-derived traits to be of relevance in studies investigating ewe behaviour around and after-lambing and its impact on production outcomes.

TI  - Multidimensional Ground Reaction Forces and Moments From Wearable Sensor Accelerations via Deep Learning
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Monitoring athlete internal workload exposure, including prevention of catastrophic non-contact knee injuries, relies on the existence of a custom early-warning detection system. This system must be able to estimate accurate, reliable, and valid musculoskeletal joint loads, for sporting maneuvers in near real-time and during match play. However, current methods are constrained to laboratory instrumentation, are labor and cost intensive, and require highly trained specialist knowledge, thereby limiting their ecological validity and wider deployment. An informative next step towards this goal would be a new method to obtain ground kinetics in the field. Methods: Here we show that kinematic data obtained from wearable sensor accelerometers, in lieu of embedded force platforms, can leverage recent supervised learning techniques to predict near real-time multidimensional ground reaction forces and moments (GRF/M). Competing convolutional neural network (CNN) deep learning models were trained using laboratory-derived stance phase GRF/M data and simulated sensor accelerations for running and sidestepping maneuvers derived from nearly half a million legacy motion trials. Then, predictions were made from each model driven by five sensor accelerations recorded during independent inter-laboratory data capture sessions. Results: The proposed deep learning workbench achieved correlations to ground truth, by maximum discrete GRF component, of vertical F-z 0.97, anterior F-y 0.96 (both running), and lateral F-x 0.87 (sidestepping), with the strongest mean recorded across GRF components 0.89, and for GRM 0.65 (both sidestepping). Conclusion: These best-case correlations indicate the plausibility of the approach although the range of results was disappointing. The goal to accurately estimate near real-time on-field GRF/M will be improved by the lessons learned in this study. Significance: Coaching, medical, and allied health staff could ultimately use this technology to monitor a range of joint loading indicators during game play, with the aim to minimize the occurrence of non-contact injuries in elite and community-level sports.

AB  - NOAA provides sea surface temperature (SST) products from multiple Earth observing satellites in low Earth orbits (LEO) using its Advanced Clear-Sky Processor for Ocean (ACSPO) system. Historically, ACSPO SST products from individual LEO platforms have been provided as 10-minute granules (144/day) in L2P (swath) and 0.02 degrees L3U (gridded uncollated) formats. With the large, and increasing number of LEO sensors currently in orbit (two VIIRSs onboard NPP/N20, three AVHRRs onboard METOP-A/B/C and two MODISs onboard Aqua/Terra) and soon to be launched (N21/VIIRS and Metop-Second Generation METImage), the data volumes and number of files has grown dramatically and is now challenging to manage by an average user. Moreover, data from different sensors and overpasses may not be fully consistent. In response to multiple users' requests, the NOAA SST team has developed the 0.02 degrees gridded super-collated (L3S) line of LEO SST products, which collate L3U data from individual sensors into a multi-sensor products with higher information density, lower data volume consistent datasets. The L3S-LEO line comprises two products: from the afternoon ('PM') orbits (currently, two VIIRSs onboard NPP and N20) and from the mid-morning ('AM') orbits (currently, three AVHRR FRACs onboard Metop-A/B/C). Both products are reported twice daily, one nighttime and one daytime file, resulting in four files every 24 hours. The data are validated in the NOAA SST Quality Monitor (SQUAM) online system, and distributed to users via the CoastWatch service, in near real time. This work describes recent L3S-LEO algorithm developments, aimed at the reduced impact of cloud leakages from individual sensor L3U data, and improved SST imagery. We also present initial checks of the diurnal cycle in the L3S-LEO vs. GEO SST from the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) flown onboard GOES-16, and find the two datasets largely consistent.

AB  - This article attempts to reflect the ongoing issues and tasks of contemporary worship renewal. Worship renewal movement since Vatican Council II has been seeking the ways of promoting the worshipers to consciously, fully, and actively participate in the service. By stressing inculturation, contemporary worship has been developing and articulating the structure and components of the service of public worship as liturgical responses to contemporary culture. At the same time, as various and fresh expressions of liturgical integration of culture, contemporary worship tends to merely new style of service and highly depends on music and high-technology shaping the worshipers in strong and significant ways.These liturgical engagements and responses to contemporary culture has also been leading the contemporary worshipers to fulfillment of their intellectual or emotional expectations as an ideal vision of modern worldview. In this way, contemporary worship has unintentionally brought about an weakening of beyond-rational and emotional liturgical experience of the mystery and symbol as a sign of limiting full and active participation in worship. In this liturgical context of worship renewal, contemporary worship could continue renewing the service by considering people’s embodied participation in the technology and digital based worship, recovering the conversational structure of worship between God and people in the emphasis of worship performance, and reflecting the formative function of worship beyond intellectual and emotional fulfillment and satisfaction as ruling principle of the service of worship.

AB  - This paper compares characters and the narrative of the 18th century Korean old novel “Okhwankibong” set in the era of Emperor Guangwu and the 21st century Chinese TV historical drama “秀麗江山之長歌行(Singing All Along)”. And it was intended to examine the social and cultural significance of “Okhwankibon ”. As a result of the narrative comparison, the two works differed in terms of worldview, narrative composition, and subject. However, based on the records of “Houhansuh,” the two works showed high narrative similarity in that the conflict between Emperor Guangwu and the Empress during the deposition of the Empress was composed of the artist's imagination. On the other hand, despite the difference between the two works, the main character, Um Yeo-hwa, had a strong projection of her preferred female image during her time of creation, and in Kwak Seong-tong 's case, she was recreated as a three-dimensional figure to win public sympathy from the public. Based on the similarity between these two works, this paper concluded the discussion by considering the social and cultural significance of “Okhwan kibong” and emphasizing the literary achievement of the original work, focusing on the current historical drama.

AB  - This study examined the K-pop boy band BTS’s Love Yourself series to analyze whether BTS Universe (BU) content meets the requirements of transmedia storytelling. For analysis, we selected three music albums, seven music videos, a novel, and a webtoon as BU content, classifying it as music, video, publication, and webtoon, respectively. Based on previous studies, we extracted the elements for analysis. Our study showed that the BU content met the requirements of transmedia storytelling, such as the use of multi-platforms, transformation of the content into puzzles, and sharing of worldviews, thus presenting the possibility of using transmedia storytelling in the domain of domestically popular music and leading to the discovery of its key factorto engage the audience. As for BTS, the involvement of its fandom called ARMY was found to be effectual. Thus, the BU content shows that it is possible to mobilize fans and expand the scope of the music world when transmedia storytelling is used from the planning phase, allowing fans to participate the world of music by moving beyond simple fan activities such as listening, watching, and feeling the music.

TI  - Accounting for Seasonal Land-use Trends in Improving the Predictability of Irrigation Needs in Watersheds
T2  - JORDAN JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The calculation of water consumption for irrigation is critical in maintaining the water supplies for cultivation in tropical catchments. These water withdrawals change seasonally, depending on the rainy and dry seasons. A land-use map is one of the inputs required by hydrological models used to estimate water withdrawals in the basin. However, land-use maps usually offer stagnant details without reflecting the hydrological seasons, associated crop seasons and activities during the year. This research, therefore, assesses the importance of seasonal land-use maps for measuring water withdrawals in the basin. We have developed a crop calendar for the two main seasons (rainy and dry) for the semi-arid Mohgaon basin, Madhya Pradesh, India. Further, two Landsat 8 images from 2016 (March and December) were used to develop seasonal land-use and land-cover (LULC) maps (March: the non-monsoon season, December: the monsoon season). Classifications for land use were made using 10 land-use and land-cover classes for images from both seasons, which were dependent on the crop calendar. In addition, water withdrawals for irrigation were estimated using LULC maps. There were clear variations in land usage between dry and rainy seasons in rain-fed and irrigated areas. The maximum water withdrawal obtained for irrigating paddy crops was calculated at an average of 800 million m(3)/year (i.e., 56.2 cm/year). This research concluded that accurate seasonal land-use maps are important for quantifying the annual water use for irrigation in catchment areas with distinct dry and rainy seasons.

TI  - Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) Change in Suburb of Central Himalayas: A Study from Chandragiri, Kathmandu
T2  - Journal of forest and environmental science
M3  - research-article
AB  - Rapid urbanization and population growth have caused substantial land use land cover (LULC) change in the Kathmandu valley. The lack of temporal and geographical data regarding LULC in the middle mountain region like Kathmandu has been challenging to assess the changes that have occurred. The purpose of this study is to investigate the changes in LULC in Chandragiri Municipality between 1996 and 2017 using geographical information system (GIS) and remote sensing. Using Landsat imageries of 1996 and 2017, this study analyzed the LULC change over 21 years. The images were classified using the Maximum Likelihood classification method and post classified using the change detection technique in GIS. The result shows that severe land cover changes have occurred in the Forest (11.63%), Built-up areas (3.68%), Agriculture (-11.26%), Shrubland (-0.15%), and Bareland (-3.91%) in the region from 1996 to 2017. This paper highlights the use of GIS and remote sensing in understanding the changes in LULC in the south-west part of Kathmandu valley.

AB  - Forest and forest ecosystems have a big importance for the whole living world on the earth. Rapid deforestation poses a great danger and increases the effects of climate change. Large forest areas are cut down every year around the world and these activities need to be closely monitored to reduce their negative impact. Knowledge of valid and current geospatial data on forests and forest areas, obtained by interpreting the data by remote sensing methods has great importance for rapid response and management of forest areas. Decisions that are based on outdated and insufficiently precise data can have negative consequences.The researched area of Fruska gora is located in Vojvodina and occupies the northern part of Srem. Due to its natural properties, it enjoys the status of a special nature reserve. Pastures and fertile land, vineyards and orchards, decorate the slopes and lower parts of Fruska gora, while the areas above 300 meters above sea level are covered with dense, deciduous forests.This paper presents a method of analysis of radar Sentinel 1 SAR satellite images, together with a combination of multispectral Sentinel 2 images, with the aim of identifying missing and newly formed forest areas, as well as assessing the usability of free, for everyone available radar satellite images for forest observation.The described methodology is based on the selection of areas of interest, the selection of radar images for the chosen time epoch, image processing, the selection of training sets by combining radar and multispectral images. The classification of radar images was performed on the Cloud platform using the Random Forest classification algorithm. The study showed that in each analysed period from 2016 to 2019, the area under missing forest is larger in relation to the newly created area under forests, as well as the growing trend of new forest areas.Estimation of classification accuracy for each observed time epoch was performed by calculating the error matrix and Kappa statistics, and the average classification accuracy was about 97%. Visual analysis and comparison of the obtained results with historical data confirmed the high accuracy of identification of missing forest areas.The presented method showed that RF classification of free Sentinel 1 and 2 satellite images, can be used as a reliable and up-to-date data for forest monitoring with satisfactory quality and very quickly.

AB  - This paper discusses the meaning of time and vital space of pure memory in the text <Oneuri>, and further examines the acceptance pattern of the meaning of <Oneuri> experienced by the learner. This paper demonstrates that the meaning of time and space in <Oneuri> can be combined with literature education pursuing ethical values and correct worldview, and through this, we tried to find the significance of literature education. This process was a process of generating meaning centered on the time of pure memory and the Woncheon River and was also a process of deliberation of happiness and ethical values. The narrative world of <Oneuri> evokes pure memory with the appearance of a character in the text. The Woncheon River is a mythical and primitive space, consisting of a concentric space. This space is an ideal space where natural creatures can prove their own existence, and a space in which the meaning of utopia is embodied.As revealed through the pattern of acceptance of meanings experienced by learners, <Oneuri> is a potential for learning readers to have an important influence on their perceptions, emotions, and actions as they live their future lives.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to analyze the otherized lives of women who are vulnerable to disasters in Korean disaster novels and to explore the antagonistic relationship with state power. For this purpose, the position of women in the disaster community, the role of women called as citizens, and the author's worldview were studied on Park Wan-seo's The Thirsty Season and Kang Young-sook's Bunker X in Burim District.First of all, The Thirsty Season grants the qualifications of the people based on ideology in the process of reconstructing citizens/non-nationals through disasters. In the midst of a war disaster, women take on the role of a female head of household responsible for maintaining livelihoods and evacuating for the elderly and protecting male families, but fall victim between national power ideology and social customs.Author Park Wan-seo speaks as a woman's voice with justified anger at a society that does not recognize women who reflect on the true condition of the people as citizens.According to neoliberal economic logic, Bunker X in Burim District was classified as a risk of contaminated area-body-contagion as the underdeveloped city of Burim was closed after the earthquake disaster, and the victims of the area are designated as out-of-boundary citizens. Victims unite as a community of caring against the state power to archive personal information, class, status, etc. by inserting biometric identification chips into the bodies of earthquake survivors. The act of female characters showing sisterly family formation, protecting wounded animals, and listening ethics is a feminine ethics of the real that replaces public care.Kang Young-sook declares a voluntary non-citizen against the state power that restricts residence and movement due to local blockade and presents a solidarity local community as an alternative to overcoming disasters.In this way, considering the location and correspondence of women in the daily life of disasters, the study of the aspect against the national call of power will be an opportunity to reflect on the current nature of disasters and gender.

AB  - Flooding damage may occur due to an unexpected increase in rainfall in summer. Previously, the roughness coefficient, which is a major factor of conveyance, was calculated through on-site measurement, but in case of on-site measurement, there are many limits in accurately grasping changes in vegetation. In this study, the vegetation index (NDVI) was calculated using the Sentinel-2 optical images, and the modified roughness coefficient was calculated through the density and distribution area of the vegetation. Then the calculated roughness coefficient was applied to HEC-RAS 1D model and verified by comparing the results with the water level at the water level station directly downstream of the Soyang River dam. As a result, the error rate of the water level decreased about 14% compared to applying the previous roughness coefficient. Through this, it is expected that it will be possible to refine the flood level of rivers in consideration of seasonal flood characteristics and to efficiently maintain rivers in specific sections.

AB  - As a method of predicting the displacement of river levee in advance, Differential Interferometry (D-InSAR) kind of InSAR techniques was used to identify weak points in the area of the levee collapes near Gumgok Bridge (Somjin River) in Namwon City, which occurred in the summer of 2020. As a result of analyzing the displacement using five images each in the spring and summer of 2020, the Variation Index () of area where the collapse occurred was larger than that of the other areas, so the prognostic sysmptoms was detected. If the levee monitoring system is realized by analyzing the correlations with displacement results and hydrometeorological factors, it will overcome the existing limitations of system and advance ultra-precise, automated river levee maintenance technology and improve national disaster management.

AB  - Taegeokhakbo, the most active and active journal of the Japanese Student Association, has consistently featured various narratives. The magazine, Taegeokhakbo agonized over a variety of narrative styles, and among them, it has consistently published epic works of Mongryurok genre.One of the characteristics of the Mongryurok in this magazine, Taegeokhakbo is that it follows the traditional form of Mongryurok, but also shows the expansion of world historical perspective. In addition, The magazine, Taegeokhakbo series of epigraphs added a new narrative form, twisting the existing epigraphs significantly.In the modern enlightenment period, The magazine, Taegeokhakbo, especially Korean students studying in Japan, uses traditional Mongryurok narratives and uses a variety of narrative devices, while opening up the possibility of new narratives. Even if they use the same dream, they are expanding their worldview and crossing time and space, and are taking a step closer to modern literature through the narrative of inner confession and the subversion of relationships. This makes it possible to confirm that modern literature was beginning and developing at the boundary point that connects from tradition to modern literature, and at that boundary position.

AB  - The worldview of modern India is a product of the religious understanding of India as Hinduism, which was born from the background of Western studies of Indian history and the British East India Company's study of the history of India for the purpose of colonial rule. Through the education of India uncritically accepted this understanding of history, the worldview that understood India as a religion centered on Hinduism was formed, and its fixation was established through a long historical process. A Hindu-centered understanding of the modern Indian worldview is conversion when viewed through Charles Kraft's worldview change model. It is an example of the cultural conversion of the whole of India to Hinduism through the distortion of the history of India by the East India Company, which is an external pressure. Understanding one region as the center of religion in mission the age of globalization is a contradiction of the understanding of other regions judged by the West. A modern understanding of India approached from various angles of politics, economy, society and culture is required, and this is a matter to be corrected in understanding mission field guidance in modern missions.

AB  - This article introduces UN Harmony with Nature Program(‘HwN’) in the context of Earth Jurisprudence.The Program started over 10 years ago in 2009 when the UN General Assembly declared 22 April International Mother Earth Day and adopted the same year the first General Assembly Resolution on Harmony with Nature. Since then, it has been settled as  “harmony with nature” agenda, which was introduced in “The future we want”, the resolution of United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, held in Ro de Janeiro in 2012, under the bigger “Sustainable Development” one.The essence of this Program resides in non-anthropocentrism or Earth-centered worldview, which resonates with Earth Jurisprudence. The Program has commemorated annually 22 April with UN Interactive Dialogues of the General Assembly, with UN Secretary Reports on Harmony with Nature. To date the General Assembly had hosted 10 Dialogues on Harmony wih Nature and 10 UN Reports on it as well as a Supplement to the 2020 report along with the publication of the 2016 Expert’s report.In doing so, the Program has played a key role in spreading and educating the Earth jurisprudence spirit, accumulating 370 pieces of legislation and policy cases in 35 countries. It is pointed out, however, that the Program needs to reach Asia countries including South Korea, in which Earth jurisprudence is barely known, as well as South American, North American, African, and European countries, where Earth jurisprudence practices are relatively common.

AB  - The purpose of this thesis is to find out skopos in Bang Jeong-hwan's translation of fairy tale, The Prince and the Swallow. Bang Jeong-hwan’s version is based on Saito Sajiro's The Prince and the Swallow. Sajiro Saito aimed to make it easier for “children” to read, by rearranging the time structure of the original Oscar Wilde’s The Happy Prince.Bang Jeong-hwan is also aimed at children's readers, but there are many differences from the work of Saito Sajiro. This means that the purpose of Bang Jeong-hwan's translation of The Prince and the Swallow, or the difference in skopos, is revealed. The point of difference from the original manuscript was identified as refraction and divided into addition, reduction and omission, and replacement.In Bang Jeong-hwan's The Prince and the Swallow, through refraction, the effects of vividly realistic depiction, maximization of emotion, and complementation of probability are revealed. In his translation, the ideal worldview he aspires to be embedded. As such, The Prince and the Swallow shows children readers' immersion, empathy, and skopos to convey their thoughts, which can be presented as a characteristic of Bang Jeong-hwan's translation.

TI  - Urban Landscape Heterogeneity Influences the Relationship between Tree Canopy and Land Surface Temperature
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban trees play a key role in alleviating elevated summertime land surface temperatures in cities. However, urban landscape influences the capacity of urban trees to mitigate higher temperatures. We propose that both developed land characteristics and tree cover should be considered to accurately estimate the mitigation effects of canopy cover. We subclassified original land cover based on the canopy cover ratio to capture the within-land cover heterogeneity. We selected two coastal cities with different summertime climatic conditions: Seattle, Washington, USA, and Baltimore, Maryland, USA. We used Landsat-based grid cells (30 m x 30 m) as our spatial analytical unit, with corresponding land surface temperature, canopy area, canopy compactness, population size, and National Land Cover Database (NLCD)-based land cover group. We first used grouped boxplots, Kruskal-Wallis H tests, and post-hoc multiple comparison tests to detect the distribution of land surface temperatures by the land cover group. We then introduced statistical models to test the group effects on the relationship between land surface temperatures and canopy cover variables. We found: (1) land surface temperature increases with level of development, (2) land surface temperature decreases with canopy cover level, (3) the magnitude of the mitigation effects from canopy area differs based on development level and current canopy cover, (4) the differing efficacies of canopy area in decreasing land surface temperature follows a nonlinear threshold relationship, and (5) compactness of canopy cover was not significant in reducing the land surface temperature. These findings suggest the importance of considering heterogeneous canopy cover within developed land cover classes in urban heat island research. Tree planting strategies need to consider the nonlinear relationships between tree canopy cover and land surface temperature alongside environmental equity concerns.

AB  - This study aims to interpret the re-rise of white supremacy after Trump's appearance with the perspectives of sociology of religion. White supremacists’ rapid re-emergence is a new social phenomenon in the sense that white supremacy is in line with President Trump, religious conservatism, and political extreme right. In other words, the 'religious right' centered on fundamentalist evangelicalism, the 'political right' with American hegemony, and the 'alternative right' advocating white supremacy are aiming for 'American White Christian Nationalism' centering on Trump. Also it is working as a central axis of new conflict not only in the socio-political landscape of the United States but also around the world. Thus, this study examines first, the social position and role of white supremacy that changed after Trump’s entry on the political stage, and second, the 'Christian Identity' theology that, as an epistemological background of white supremacy, has provided religious justification of racism. Third, this research tries to clarify a Christian belief system that has influenced Trump's worldview, which is self-centered and sees the world as a battlefield between winners and losers. Finally, contact points among Trump, white supremacist, and conservative Christianity are being traced.

AB  - Guillermo del Toro’s 2017 film, The Shape of Water, tells an unconventional love story between a mute woman and an amphibious creature from the Amazon. Many critics illuminate the individuals of sexual, racial and social minority involved in the rescue plan of this creature, and highlight their affective solidarity. In addition to these analyses, this study contributes an ecological interpretation of the film by focusing on the identity of the non-human being itself. The violent acts of detention and torture that were imposed upon this creature, including its capture in the Amazon and shipment to the U.S., can be read as an allegory to “ecocide,” which is executed in the name of development and progress, and is embedded with the idea that humans and nature should be separated. While putting contemporary conceptions of anthropocentrism into question, del Toro shapes an alternative image of this ecologic idea through a romance drama. The intimate love between a human and non-human creature signifies the possibility for unlimited interaction, communication and negotiation between different species, and symbolizes the Amazonian worldview, which emphasizes co-existence. As a result, The Shape of Water suggests the need to create a new kind of relationship between humans and humans, humans and non-humans, and humans and nature.

AB  - The study of plant-insect interactions and how cultural groups perceive and manage them constitutes one of the interests of ethnoentomology. This work describes the association between host plants and longhorn beetles (Order: Coleoptera; Family: Cerambycidae), an important food among the Guarani peoples of the province of Misiones, Argentina. Different management methods of host tree species are analyzed in order to promote the rearing of larvae for edible use. We also discuss a story about the mythical origin of cerambicids relayed by the Ava Chiripa Guarani community. We reflect on the importance of the local worldview in the maintenance of ancestral practices, such as the cultural tasks involved in slash-and-burn agriculture and the intimate knowledge of biological relationships between the cerambycids and their woody host plants.

TI  - DEVELOPING A QUANTITATIVE MODEL FOR ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT IN THE FUNCTIONAL SCOPE OF LARGE DAMS. A CASE STUDY OF KARKHEH DAM
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was performed to quantify the effects of land use changes resulting from the construction of Karkheh Dam, in southwest of Iran, on the water quality of Karkheh River. For this purpose, the periodical Landsat TM and ETM+ images were used to assess the changing trends of the land use types before and after the dam construction. The water quality data were collected from the hydrometric stations and the possible correlation between the changes in the land use types and water quality parameters was detected through regression models. The obtained results showed a significant correlation between the changes in the different land use types and the variations of the water quality parameters in the lower basin of Karkheh Dam at the confidence intervals of 95% and 99% (p-values=0.05 and 0.01). The results indicated that the development of the irrigated lands and water supply for the farmlands would be the main factor for the declined water quality of the river at the downstream areas. The land use map showed that the current area of the irrigated lands is approximately 76% of the entire basin area, while the regression models revealed that the maximum permissible area of this land use type should be 46% of the total area of the basin. This indicates that the development of agricultural fields would be the main cause for the decline in the water quality of the river at downstream areas.

TI  - "To Rewrite All Ranks of People and Newcomers from Russian and Pomor Cities": Migrations in Tara District at End of 17th Century
T2  - NAUCHNYI DIALOG
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the study of the resettlement processes that took place on the territory of the Tara district of the Tobolsk category at the end of the 17th century. The source for the study was the Tara County Sentinel Book of 1701. It is noted that the main participants in the resettlement were service people and peasants, while a significant part of them arrived in Siberia at the call of the authorities, few moved voluntarily. The reasons for migrations, both organized by the state and independent, of a strategic, socioeconomic nature, are considered. There are two types of migrations: external, carried out from the European part of the country, and internal, occurring on the territory of the Siberian region. It is shown that the flow of residents and their subsequent redistribution in the region itself caused the emergence of new settlements, contributing to the creation of an area of continuous settlement. Calculations were made of the number of migrants who arrived in the Tara district at the end of the 17th century, and villages were identified in which the largest number of them was considered. It has been established that the most active participants in the migration processes in the Tara district were peasants; a significant proportion of immigrants arrived here in the 1690s. A conclusion is made about the potential of the 1701 Sentinel Book in terms of reconstructing an integral picture of the colonization of Siberia at the end of the 17th century.

TI  - The Potential of LiDAR and UAV-Photogrammetric Data Analysis to Interpret Archaeological Sites: A Case Study of Chun Castle in South-West England
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - With the increasing demands to use remote sensing approaches, such as aerial photography, satellite imagery, and LiDAR in archaeological applications, there is still a limited number of studies assessing the differences between remote sensing methods in extracting new archaeological finds. Therefore, this work aims to critically compare two types of fine-scale remotely sensed data: LiDAR and an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) derived Structure from Motion (SfM) photogrammetry. To achieve this, aerial imagery and airborne LiDAR datasets of Chun Castle were acquired, processed, analyzed, and interpreted. Chun Castle is one of the most remarkable ancient sites in Cornwall County (Southwest England) that had not been surveyed and explored by non-destructive techniques. The work outlines the approaches that were applied to the remotely sensed data to reveal potential remains: Visualization methods (e.g., hillshade and slope raster images), ISODATA clustering, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. The results display various archaeological remains within the study site that have been successfully identified. Applying multiple methods and algorithms have successfully improved our understanding of spatial attributes within the landscape. The outcomes demonstrate how raster derivable from inexpensive approaches can be used to identify archaeological remains and hidden monuments, which have the possibility to revolutionize archaeological understanding.

AB  - In methodologies that make use of the remote sensing images obtained by orbital sensors, it is very common the application of resampling methods with the adaptation of images contained bands with different spatial resolutions, for example, the Sentinel-2 sensor, with thirteen bands, four with a resolution of 10m, six of 20m and three with 60m. In this way, to calculate some vegetation indices, the difference of spatial resolution among bands does not allow index calculation, requiring the application of resampling. In the literature, there are several techniques, but the effects derived from that pixel transformation have not been explored much when related to sugarcane classification. Thus, this paper applies different resampling methodologies focused on remote sensing, verifying the effects of each transformation in the vegetation indices calculation to perform sugarcane varieties discrimination. It was possible to observe little variation in accuracy amid the applied methods, showing little influence in the process to identify sugarcane varieties. Thus, the use of indices related to chlorophyll demonstrated great potential for the purpose of discriminating/classifying sugarcane, presenting alternative vegetation indices to be applied for this type of purpose.

AB  - Rock-falls are catastrophic phenomena, which have been studied widely through remote sensing data and special software analysis. Rock-fall investigation is quite crucial and especially the rock-fall prediction, as these phenomena cause serious damages and fatalities that could be avoided with a correct susceptibility mapping. In this paper, the RocFall software was chosen aiming to achieve a rock-fall simulation. Kinetic energy illustration, velocity calculation, end points detection and bounces heights depiction can be calculated by the specific program. A well-studied landslide in Moira settlement, near to the city of Patras (Western Greece) was selected for the simulation as many geo-data sets already exist. Slope maps and elevation profiles were extracted, in GIS environment, from different Digital Surface Models (DSMs). Those derived products were implemented in RocFall software for further simulations. More specifically, free available DSMs such as DSM from the Greek Cadastral DSM, ALOS AW3D30 DEM, ASTER GDEM, SRTM30 DEM, SRTM90 DEM, TanDEM_X as well as UAV DSM created by field campaigns were used for slope profile extraction. The results were assessed based on the spatial resolution of DSMs and were validated with in situ observations and measurements. The current study has two objectives: Firstly, to evaluate RocFall software outcomes with the field measurements and secondly, to estimate the influence of the DSM spatial resolution and accuracy to rock-fall simulation. According to previous studies, the spatial resolution is affecting the vertical accuracy of the DSMs. Among the aforementioned DSMs, UAV DSM was proved more appropriate for landslides simulation.

AB  - This paper presents system concept and payload design of very high throughput satellite system based on beam hopping that is time domain switching in multicolour reuse concept. High throughput satellites (HTS), with large aggregate bandwidth, act as a backbone to support terrestrial communication in remote and unconnected areas. The Very high throughput satellites (VHTS), aiming at several hundred Gbps of capacity, employing hundreds of spot beams over coverage area, reduces the cost per bit of space infrastructure. The use of time switched beams (beam hopping, BH) in a VHTS system offers significant advantage by providing system flexibility with reduced space resources. This paper presents the system concept and payload design of a time switched VHTS system for Indian region; its comparison with the conventional frequency re-use (FDMA) system; and associated technological challenges. The time switched VHTS system shows reduction in payload mass and power requirements, with same spectrum and aggregate system throughput.

TI  - Impact of aerosols on surface ozone during COVID-19 pandemic in southern India: A multi-instrumental approach from ground and satellite observations, and model simulations
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) as a pandemic due to its widespread global infection. This has resulted in lockdown under different phases in many nations, including India, around the globe. In the present study, we report the impact of aerosols on surface ozone in the context of pre-lockdown (01st - 24th March 2020 (PLD)), lockdown phasel (25th March to 14th April 2020 (LDP1)), and lockdown phase 2 (15th April to O-3 rd May 2020 (LDP2)) on clear days at a semi-arid site, Anantapur in southern India using both in situ observations and model simulations. Collocated measurements of surface ozone (O-3), aerosol optical depth (AOD), black carbon mass concentration (BC), total columnar ozone (TCO), solar radiation (SR), and ultraviolet radiation (UV-A) data were collected using an Ozone analyzer, MICROTOPS sunphotometer, Ozonometer, Aethalometer, and net radiometer during the study period. The diurnal variations of O-3 and BC exhibited an opposite trend during three phases. The concentrations of ozone were -10.7% higher during LDP1 (44.8 +/- 5.2 ppbv) than the PLD (40.5 +/- 6.0 ppbv), which mainly due to an unprecedented reduction in NOx emissions leading to a lower O-3 titration by NO. The prominent increase in the surface zone during LDP1 is reasonably consistent with the observed photolysis frequencies (j ((OD)-D-1)) through Tropospheric Ultraviolet and Visible (TUV) model. The results show that a pronounced spectral and temporal variability in the AOD during three lockdown phases is mainly due to distinct aerosol sources. The increase in AOD during LDP2 due to longrange transport can bring large amounts of mineral dust and smoke aerosols from the west Asian region and central India, and which is reasonably consistent with the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) air mass back trajectories and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) fire counts analysis over the measurement location. Overall, a drastic reduction in BC concentration (similar to 8.4%) and AOD (10.8%) were observed in the semi-arid area during LDP1 with correspondence to PLD. The columnar aerosol size distributions retrieved from the spectral AODs followed power-law plus unimodal during three phases. The absorption angstrom exponent (AAE) analysis reveals a predominant contribution to the BC from biomass burning activities during the lockdown period over the measurement location.

AB  - In order to determine the long-term effect of thermal power plants, the satellite images of Seyitomer and Tuncbilek Thermal Power Plants and their vicinities were analyzed by using the software of ERDAS IMAGINE v9.1 and PCI Geomatica 2017. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was determined by using red and near-infrared bands of Landsat satellite images, and areas containing vegetation were revealed in the images. In order to obtain the temporal change in the vegetation areas, the relevant image change detection analysis was applied and the one-year and thirty-year temporal change of vegetation cover is for r = 4 km, r = 12 km, r = 50 km. In the remote sensing mapping studies, it was determined that as the diameter of the assessment area increases, the dominant wind loses its effect, and geomorphological conditions are more prominent.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study encompasses the Land use/land cover (LU/LC) change detection in Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation area by using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and Remote Sensing (RS) technology, over a period of a decade at an interval of 5 years, i.e., for the year 2005, 2011 and 2016. Based on geographical conditions, remote sensing data and field survey, the study area was classified into six categories. The comparison of LU/LC in 2005, 2011 and 2016 derived from Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation map and satellite imagery interpretation indicates that there is a consistent increase in built-up area and open tree cover area.On the other hand, dense tree cover, open land area and water spread area of waterbody declined correspondingly. Moreover, the overall tree cover of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation area has declined from 2523.01 ha to 2477.45 ha from the year 2005 to 2016 which may be due to rapid urbanization of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation area. This study of detailed LU/LU change analysis with regular monitoring will be fruitful to drag the attention of urban planners and decision makers for sustainable development, detailed area planning as well as to overcome the problem of decline in green spaces and urban sprawl. Additionally, the findings of the present study will beuseful in monitoring the dynamics of land use resulting from the changing demands of the growing population.

T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Between 30 May and 6 June 2019 a series of new eruptions occured in the south-east flanks of Mt. Etna, Italy, forming lava flows and explosive activity that was most intense during the first day of the eruption; as a result, volcanic particles were dispersed towards Greece. Lidar measurements performed at the PANhellenic GEophysical observatory of Antikythera (PANGEA) of the National Observatory of Athens (NOA), in Greece, reveal the presence of particles of volcanic origin above the area the days following the eruption. FLEXible PARTicle dispersion model (FLEXPART) simulations and satellite-based SO2 observations from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument onboard the Sentinel-5 Precursor (TROPOMI/S5P), confirm the volcanic plume transport from Etna towards PANGEA and possible mixing with co-existing desert dust particles. Lidar and modeled values are in agreement and the derived sulfate mass concentration is approximately 15 mu g/m(3). This is the first time that Etna volcanic products are monitored at Antikythera station, in Greece with implications for the investigation of their role in the Mediterranean weather and climate.

T2  - PLANET CARE FROM SPACE
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Mangroves forests are distributed in the intertidal region between sea and land in the tropical and subtropical latitudes. The World Heritage Site "Sundarbans" is the largest contiguous mangrove forest of the world. It covers 3% of the global mangroves forest area and is a hotspot for biodiversity conservation, and provides a wide range of ecosystem services for 7.5 million of people. Accurate monitoring of land cover change is key for determining impact on Sundarbans functions. In this study, maximum likelihood classification was performed on Landsat images spanning 45 years with cloud-free images in 1975, 1990, 2005 and 2020 and extracting dense forest, moderate dense forest, sparse forest, barren land and water. After that, change detection was carried out. For accuracy assessment, 100 Ground Control Points (GCPs) were collected and verified with Google Earth historical images. Partial results show dense forest decreasing by 1.3% from 1975 to 2020 mostly converted to moderate and sparse forest. The alteration rate was lowest from 1990 to 2005. The thematic changes from moderate dense to sparse forest increased gradually from 1975 to 2020. Moderate dense to dense forest classes is reported (56741 ha) with significantly higher rate between 1990 to 2005 than others two periods. The annual increment rate of water pixels was 0.58% from 1975 to 2020.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to analyze this work through the symbolic image of shamanism in Lewis Caroll’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland. The exchange of civilizations between East and West, which took place for a long time, was recognized by Westerners as a fantasy element of the shamanistic traditions of East Asian nomads. Watch, rabbit, Alice(Virgins), lizard, twins, turtle, and cat in Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland personalize real astronomical constellations. This shamanic connection can also be seen in Joanne Kathleen Rowling’s Harry Potter. Rowling presents the worldview of Celtic mythology based on shamanism in her work. Through the symbols of shamanism, Caroll implies the concept of the time order of the universe and the advent of a new era. Alice symbolizes the existing concept of time, “Virgin,” and Queen of Hearts symbolizes the “heart of the lion,” a symbol of a new era to come. In conclusion, Caroll symbolically depicts the conflict between the existing temporal order and the coming temporal order.

AB  - The character industry is one of the most important markets with a high growth rate and a large share of the overall content industry. These character markets are heavily influenced by the media environment. That’s why recognition and exposure are important for characters to be recognized and influenced. Therefore, Character industry must be exposed through the media. Therefore It is important for the character industry to adapt quickly to the changes as the media environment changes. Today, in the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, science and technology have become very advanced and the media has changed accordingly. This has changed the one-way media consumption propensity to two-way consumption, and even affected character consumption propensity. The character market that image were considered important in the past can no longer have competitiveness by itself. As communication and interaction are active through the media, The “marketing” part of the character is becoming more important. To use these character marketing well, it is important to use what factors. In this study, the element was considered a “Trend” in the current character market and was studied through one of the recent marketing trends, “Multi Persona.” Character marketing using the multi-persona is a ‘BUKE’. The ‘BUKE’ types are classified as ‘A character that reveals me’ and ‘A character who doesn’t reveal myself’. Each case was selected in this study as characters whose entertainment, trend, and creativity are divided into three components of multi-persona. We could derive the three keywords of the character of Trend, “Communication and empathy”, “Worldview” and “media platform” through that study which use multi-persona. We hope that these studies will help to understand the changes and trends in the character market. The analysis of multi-persona focusing on character industry aspects is significant in academic terms.

AB  - Rumiko Takahashi's representative work, “Inuyasha,” which is recognized as one of Japan's best writers, features traditional Japanese culture and religious materials such as goblin, lady, Buddhist, congregation, shinmok, and shrine, and is considered the most popular Japanese comics and animation in the world. Meanwhile, full-fledged research on the work was needed in academia as much as the influence of Inuyasa, but overall research is very insignificant.Therefore, this study examines the general notion of folk belief in Japanese content through prior research and studies how folk belief is incorporated and implemented in Inuyasha, and also how it is reflected in Takahashi's work world. As a result of the study, Takahashi's work world, which majored in history, showed a unique way based on the animism formed by the natural environment of the Japanese. Through the development and characteristics of Inuyasha, we can see that the divine divinity of the Japanese people who believe that souls exist in all objects, tales, myths, legends, and traditional Japanese or Eastern subjects, such as folk tales, have influenced her a lot. Japan's religion and folk belief are fundamental elements of Takahashi's work world, and modern devices such as Sailor's suits and the National Era, as well as popular entertainment materials such as romance, comedy, horror and time leap, have helped form Takahashi's unique worldview, “Rumik World.” Also, the reason why the national era appeared in the background of “Inuyasha” is that there are many stories to be fought with, such as “The Three Kingdoms” in China. Comics such as “Vagabond,” novel “Miyamoto Musashi,” and animation “Mononoke Hime” are set in the national era, and the story-rich national era plays a very important role in Japanese content market. The meaning and analysis of folk beliefs viewed through Inuyasha can serve as an important example of interpreting the features of Japanese cultural content, and we expect this study to be further studied in the framework of theory.

TI  - The life and the verse of "Gyeongho" Gang Dae-yeon
TI  - 鏡湖 姜大延의 生涯와 詩世界
T2  - 南冥學硏究
M3  - research-article
AB  - This paper examines the life and verses of "Gyeongho"(鏡湖) Gang Dae-yeon(姜大延)(1606-1655) who lived in Jeonggok-ri, Sancheong, North Gyeongsang Province, South Korea, to understand his worldview and perception of reality. One of "Dangam" Gang Ik-moon’s(戇庵 姜翼文, 1568-1649) sons, he settled in Jeonggok-ri on becoming the son-in-law of "Saho" Oh Jang(思湖 吳長, 1565-1617). Later, Jeonggok-ri became the residence for Jinyang Gang’s clan. At the beginning of the 19th century, the descendants of Gang Dae-yeon published a book called Hosangsaego(湖上世稿) to shed light on the clan's establishment and document the family. This book contains a collection of 13 writings by Gang Dae-yeon, who first settled in Jeonggok-ri, and his descendants. They share some characteristics with the Nammyong School, and they wielded considerable influence across the region while he was part of the Nammyong School. The family of Jinyang Gang’s clan, who resided in Jeonggok-ri, can thus be said to be a representative of the Nammyong school in the Gangwoo area.Gang Dae-yeon did not express an interest in pursuing an official career. He took a different path from that of his eldest brother, "Hansa" Gan Tae-soo(寒沙 姜大遂, 1591-1658), and his younger brother, "Gujoo" Gang Tae-jeok(鷗洲 姜大適, 1594-1678), both of who served as officials even though they belonged to the Northerner faction after the Injo Restoration(仁祖反正, 1623). The biggest reason behind his taking a different path was because his father-in-law and teacher, Oh Jang, was dead while in exile, in particular when the Qing invasion of Joseon occurred and Joseon thus formed an alliance with the Qing Dynasty in 1636. Gang Dae-yeon led a life pursuant to dokseon(獨善, literally meaning living life based on one’s own moral code). Therefore, most of the poems he left behind are related to seclusion based on the principle of dokseon(獨善). Furthermore, he expressed his righteousness by writing poems revealing chunchudaeui(春秋大義, meaning “the moral principle of the Spring and Autumn Annals” that reveres the former Han dynasties and advocates for expelling the barbarians, the jurchens of the Qing Dynasty). He retired to a mountain, where he contemplated on self-reflection and reality; he considered Zhongyong(中庸, the Doctrine of the Mean) as the most important book, and thus came to write a poem pursuing 存心養性(preserving the original pure heart and nurturing nature). Regarding the characteristics of his poetry, his poems involve his pursuit toward the right path(道) amid the backdrop of worldly self-righteousness(獨善的) and his strenuous efforts to preserve an innate part of human nature(性). This is similar to "Nammyong" Jo Sik(南冥 曺植, 1501-1572), who diverged from bureaucratic scholars as strove solely for practical learning without stepping into the path for an official. It can be inferred that Gang Dae-yeon, who lived in a chaotic period when scholars from the Northerner faction faced horrific reprisals following the Injo Restoration, was an individual who showcased the way of life of the remaining Nammyong School scholars.

CP  - 13th European Conference on Precision Agriculture (ECPA)
CL  - Budapest, HUNGARY
AB  - This paper demonstrates the estimation of crop variables by combining two public-domain spaceborne optical sensors to avoid the gaps in the time-series imposed by clouds. Ground measurements were conducted in Israel over four growing seasons to monitor the development of processing tomato, including crop coefficient (K-c), leaf area index (LAI) and crop height. Imagery acquired by Sentinel-2 and VEN mu S was used to derive vegetation indices (VIs). The conjoint use of Sentinel-2 and VEN mu S imagery facilitated accurate estimation of K-c (R-2 =0.82, RMSE=0.088), LAI (R-2 =0.79, RMSE=1.2), and crop height (R-2 =0.81, RMSE=7 cm) throughout the season. Accordingly, Sentinel-2 and VEN mu S imagery are a viable tool for agricultural monitoring that can support precision farming.

T2  - JOINT DISEASES AND RELATED SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Papillary intralymphatic angioendothelioma (PILA), an intralymphatic lesion of vascular ducts, is an extremely rare tumor. It is generally encountered as an unexpected pathology following excision of a vascular skin lesion. Re-excision is the commonly preferred treatment option once the pathological diagnosis is established. In this article, we present a 12-year-old male patient with a PILA treated with re-excision, skin grafting, and sentinel lymph node biopsy. The patient was symptom-free at annual follow-up. A sentinel lymph node biopsy during re-excision might be a good option in the surgical management of PILA. Frequent examination of lymph nodes and skin lesion also might be beneficial during the follow-ups.

TI  - Producing grain yield maps by merging combine harvester and remote sensing data
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE'21
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 13th European Conference on Precision Agriculture (ECPA)
CL  - Budapest, HUNGARY
AB  - High-quality combine harvester yield data are very important to produce yield maps. However, errors that derive from the combine harvester may be corrected. A data source that could be used to improve the yield maps obtained from harvester data is satellite-based data (e.g. Sentinel 2 (S2) imageries) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) based data that are commonly used to predict grain yield and also define fertilisation rates. In this study, yield data from a combine harvester, a multi-spectral camera mounted on a UAV and S2 images were collected to produce yield maps that offer more accurate representation. To calibrate and validate this method, biomass samples were acquired manually before harvesting while erroneous yield data were replaced by remote sensing data. A regression analysis between the ground-truth biomass samples and the filtered yield data had an R-2 value equal to 0.84, while the R-2 of the biomass with the yield data obtained by the proposed methodology was equal to 0.90.

TI  - <i>Short communication</i>: Heterosis and breed effects for milk production and udder health traits in crosses between Danish Holstein, Danish Red, and Danish Jersey
T2  - JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - During the last decade, the use of systematic crossbreeding in dairy cattle herds has increased in several countries of the world. The aim of this study was to estimate the effect of breed proportion and heterosis on milk production traits and udder health traits in dairy cattle. The study was based on records on milk yield (MY), protein yield (PY), fat yield (FY), somatic cell score (SCS), and mastitis (MAST) from 73,695 first-lactation dairy cows in 130 Danish herds applying systematic crossbreeding programs. Around 45% of the cows were crosses between Danish Holstein (DH), Danish Red (DR), or Danish Jersey (DJ), and the remaining were purebred DH, DR, or D.T. The statistical model included the fixed effects of herd-year, calving month, and calving age and an effect representing the lactation status of the cow. In addition, the model included a regression on calving interval from first to second lactation, a regression on the proportion of DH, DR, and DJ genes, and a regression on the degree of heterozygosity between DH and DR, DH and DJ, and DR and DJ. Random effects were the genetic effect of the cow and a residual. The effect of breed proportions was estimated relatively to DH. For MY, a pure DR yielded 461 kg milk less than DH, whereas a pure DJ yielded 2,259 kg milk less than a pure DH. Compared with DH, PY was 41.7 kg less for DJ, whereas PY for DR was 4.0 kg less than for DH. For FY, a DR yielded 10.6 kg less than DH, whereas there was no significant effect of breed proportion between DJ and DH. A DR cow had lower SCS (0.13) than DH, whereas DJ had higher SCS (0.14) than DH. There was no significant effect of breed proportion on MAST between the 3 breeds. Heterosis was significant in all combinations of breeds for MY, FY, and PY. Heterosis for crosses between DH and DR was 257 kg (3.2%), 11.9 kg (3.2%), and 8.9 kg (3.2%) for MY, PY, and FY, respectively. Corresponding figures for crosses between DIi and DJ were 314 kg (4.4%), 14.3 kg (4.4%), and 10.4 kg (4.0%), whereas heterosis between DR and DJ was 462 kg (6.7%), 19.6 kg (6.7%), and 13.9 kg (5.4%) for MY, PY, and FY, respectively. Heterosis was only significant for SCS in the crosses between DH and DR. Heterosis effects for MAST were nonsignificant for all the crosses. The results obtained in this study demonstrate that in first lactation cows, there is a positive effect of heterosis on milk production traits, but limited effect on udder health traits.

AB  - This study employs small story theory (Bamberg, 2006; Bamberg & Georgakopoulou, 2008; Georgakopoulou, 2006, 2015, 2017) and narrative positioning analysis (Bamberg & Georgakopoulou, 2008) to explore stories that are told by interpreters of Aboriginal languages and Aboriginal Liaison Officers (ALOs) when they discuss how they do their work and the challenges they face when interpreting for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients in hospital settings. Findings indicate that the interpreters and ALOs draw on stories to contribute their understanding of complexities of interpreting for Aboriginal patients and do so through the multiple, shifting positions they attribute to themselves as other social actors in the stories they narrate. These positions are reinforced in the ongoing interaction but are also located across the dataset, illustrating that capital-D discourses or master narratives are invoked to frame the role, skills and attributes of the professionals in this study.

TI  - Urban Ecology of Arboviral Mosquito Vectors Along the Kenyan Coast
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the ecology of the common arboviral mosquito vectors in Mombasa, Kilifi and Malindi urban areas of coastal Kenya. Mosquito larvae were collected using standard dippers and pipettes. Egg survivorship in dry soil was evaluated by collecting soil samples from dry potential larval developmental sites, re-hydrating them for hatching and rearing of the eventual larvae to adults. Adult mosquitoes were collected with CDC light traps and BG-Sentinel traps. All blood-fed females were tested for bloodmeal origin. Mosquitoes were screened for arboviruses using RT-qPCR. Overall, the predominant species were Culex quinquefasciatus (Say) 72.4% (n = 2,364) and Aedes aegypti (L.), 25.7%, (n = 838). A total of 415 larval developmental sites were identified indoors (n = 317) and outdoors (n = 98). The most productive larval developmental sites, both indoors and outdoors, were assorted small containers, water tanks, drainages, drums, and jerricans. Overall, 62% (n = 18) of the soil samples collected were positive for larvae which were used as a proxy to measure the presence of eggs. The mosquitoes fed on humans (29.8%) and chickens (3.7%). Of 259 mosquitoes tested for viral infection, 11.6% were positive for Flavivirus only. The most productive larval developmental sites for arboviral vectors indoors were small containers, water tanks, jerricans, and drums whereas small containers, water tanks, drainage channels, buckets, tires, and water troughs were the productive larval developmental sites outdoors.

TI  - Diurnal and Longitudinal Variations in the Equatorial Anomaly for Winter Solstice According to Interkosmos-19 Satellite Data
T2  - GEOMAGNETISM AND AERONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - The equatorial anomaly dynamics in the winter solstice is studied based on data from topside sounding of the ionosphere from the Interkosmos-19 satellite for high solar activity. This is the final study on the construction of the pattern of equatorial anomaly variations under conditions of high solar activity. Changes in the equatorial anomaly structure with local time and longitude are considered in detail. It is shown that the anomaly begins to form at similar to 800 LT during the creation of the winter northern crest, but the well-developed equatorial anomaly is formed only by 1000-1100 LT. The daytime maximum of the equatorial anomaly development is reached at 1200 LT. The foF2 value above the equator and the degree of the equatorial anomaly development (equatorial anomaly intensity, EAI) at 1200 LT vary with longitude according to changes in the vertical plasma drift velocity W. Three harmonics are observed in the longitudinal variations in W, foF2, and EAI at this time. The EAI increases up to the diurnal maximum 1.5-2.0 h after the evening W burst. Longitudinal variations in foF2 at 2000 LT are also associated with the relevant variations in W, in which two harmonics are revealed. The degree of equatorial anomaly development drops after the evening peak but equatorial anomaly is still well-developed at midnight and is completely absent at 0500-0700 LT. The EAI at different moments of local time differs rather strongly for different longitudinal sectors. The average position of northern crest is similar to 25 degrees of the geomagnetic inclination I, and the southern crest is at similar to-30 degrees I. During the day, the winter crest is higher than the summer crest; by night-time, it is quite the opposite. Thus, a well-expressed equatorial anomaly is observed from 1000-1100 to 0000-0200 LT during the winter solstice.

AB  - In space fairing countries, satellite-based remote sensing technology has been used for military purposes. Meanwhile, in other countries, like Indonesia, satellite-based remote sensing commonly only used for civilian purposes, such as agricultural and forest monitoring as well as urban planning. The main reason for the limited application is the availability of satellite images deemed qualified for military purposes. Therefore, the aim of the research is to identify military objects around Indonesia, using satellite images available in public domain. The data used is from Sentinel and Google Earth, and the techniques used are Index-based Built-up Index (IBI) for the medium resolution multispectral images, and toponymy for the visible-band images. The processing platform used are Google Earth Engine and ArcGIS. Due to the data characteristics, only statics military objects are able to be identified. Based on the mission urgency and similarity in geographical characteristics, two neighbouring countries, i.e. Malaysia and Singapore, are selected. The result show that in Malaysia, static military objects occupy total area of 139.47 km2, while in Singapore they occupy total area of 117.93 km2. The IBI of military facilities in Singapore is higher than non-military facilities, while in Malaysia is in reverse, which may indicate that Singapore invest more in military facilities. Such result concludes that public domain satellite images can be used to identify military objects.

TI  - Sensitivity, Specificity and the Diagnostic Accuracy of PET/CT for Axillary Staging in Patients With Stage I-III Cancer: A Systematic Review of The Literature
T2  - IN VIVO
M3  - Review
AB  - Background/Aim: Axillary lymph node (ALN) status plays a key role in the staging of breast cancer. Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) using 18-Fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)FDG) can visualise ALN metastasis. However, its utility compared to current methods is unclear. We systematically reviewed the role of (18)FDG PET/CT in breast cancer staging. Materials and Methods: PubMed, Ovid and Cochrane were searched systematically up until August 2020. Included papers had true positive (TP), false positive (FP), true negative (TN) and false negative (FN) rates, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV). Results: Nine studies (n=1486) were included, showing: i) sensitivity= 52 2%, ii) specificity=91.6%, iii) PPV=77 .8%, iv) NPV=77 .2, and v) accuracy=77 .3%. Conclusion: (18)FDG-PETICT has a low sensitivity but high specificity for ALN disease. Therefore, ultrasound-guided biopsy could be considered in a positive CT/PET. Modest accuracy prohibits the use of (18)FDG-PETICT alone in axillary staging. Prospective research using standardised protocols and quantitative cut-off points is warranted.

TI  - Expert examination of electoral legislation in the conclusions of the Venice Commission
T2  - VESTNIK OF SAINT PETERSBURG UNIVERSITY-LAW-VESTNIK SANKT-PETERBURGSKOGO UNIVERSITETA-PRAVO
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the theoretical and practical approaches of the European Commission for Democracy through Law (the Venice Commission) to the assessment of electoral processes and elections in states. Since the Venice Commission is a subsidiary body of the Council of Europe, special attention is paid to the observance of Council of Europe standards in the field of human and civil rights in regard to elections. Through an empirical analysis of various documents of the Venice Commission (conclusions, recommendations, codes of practice, etc.), a conclusion is drawn about the existential approach of this body to assessing the electoral legislation of states. This approach is based on a wide array of sources perceived by experts of the Venice Commission, which, in addition to state legislation and official comments, may also include reports from the media, the Internet, the personal worldview of the expert and comments from other persons familiar with the situation. Based on this broad range of sources, the Venice Commission also objectifies its assessments into different acts, which may have a variety of names, but have the force of recommendations for states. Thus, the conclusions of the Venice Commission are acts of soft law and can be perceived by national legal systems using various channels of implementation. The analysis of the documents of the Venice Commission on elections and electoral processes shows that in the orbit of expertise of this body are such issues as: prevention of abuse of power and administrative resources of power in the organization and holding of elections; prevention of discrimination against opposition and various minorities, etc. The issues of gender equality in state authorities, protection of the rights of stateless persons, and voting using digital technologies are also considered.

AB  - The present study deals with the strong earthquakes (M>5.0) that occurred in the Baikal Rift Zone between 2008 and 2020. Reference time intervals, with no earthquakes occurring, have been chosen. The effect of seismic activity on the ozone layer has been investigated by analyzing the trends of total ozone (TO) onset obtain from the Aura/OMI satellite data, using singular spectrum analysis. In the periods preceding seismic events, TO trends have been found to be more variable than the reference ozone trends. In the pre-earthquake time intervals, the oscillation period of the TO first harmonic decreases by a factor of 1.5-2 compared to the period of the reference first harmonic of ozone.

TI  - Are all NDVI maps created equal - comparing vineyard NDVI data from proximal and remote sensing
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE'21

CP  - 13th European Conference on Precision Agriculture (ECPA)
CL  - Budapest, HUNGARY
AB  - Vegetation indices (VI), particularly the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), are often used as data layers for management unit delineation. They can be derived from various sensor configurations and platforms, both remote and proximal. The question is how much difference is there between VI maps from various sensing systems in a production context? To address this question, this study involved a selection of methods to compare NDVI data from four sources, two terrestrial crop reflectance sensors and UAV and Sentinel-2 imagery, to determine how similar these data sources were. The correlation coefficients and the resulting management unit maps showed that NDVI obtained from different sensors, especially satellite platforms, generated differing information for decision making. All NDVI maps are not equal when converted to production decisions.

TI  - SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL CHANGES OF VEGETATION COVER IN CHINA BASED ON MODIS NDVI
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation in China experienced serious threat from several driving forces such as population growth and anthropogenic activities. Real-time mapping and assessment of yearly vegetation cover is vital to understand environmental conditions. Here, we examined the trend of vegetation cover changes in China over a 15-year period using remote sensed data. To achieve this, we reclassified the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values into four classes: No, Low, Medium, and High covers and proceeded to vegetation change detection. The results indicated a difference in values at each level. At the national level, there is an increase in vegetation cover as reflected by High cover class with 41.03% in 2015. At the regional level, the most significant changes were determined in the south where the rate of green cover was declining by -63622.3 km(2) from 2000 to 2015 in the High cover class. Vegetation cover changes varied from province to province. Some provinces showed a reduction in vegetation cover such as Guangdong; whereas Xinjiang experienced an increase (Tables A1 and A2). The findings of this study provide further information on China?s vegetation cover and will also serve as reference for future research.

TI  - An Investigation of the Wild Rat Crown Incisor as an Indicator of Lead (Pb) Exposure Using Inductively Couple Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) and Laser Ablation ICP-MS
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Lead (Pb) is a metal toxicant of great public health concern. The present study investigated the applicability of the rat incisor in Pb exposure screening. The levels of lead in teeth (Pb-T) in the crown and root of incisors in laboratory Pb-exposed Sprague Dawley rats were quantified using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The crown accumulated much Pb-T than the root of the Sprague Dawley rat incisor. The levels of lead in blood (Pb-B) were positively correlated with the Pb-T in the crown and root incisors of the Sprague Dawley rats. As an application of the Pb-T crown results in experimental rats, we subsequently analyzed the Pb-T in the crown incisors of Pb-exposed wild rats (Rattus rattus) sampled from residential sites within varying distances from an abandoned lead-zinc mine. The Pb-T accumulation in the crown of incisors of R. rattus rats decreased with increased distance away from the Pb-Zn mine. Furthermore, the Pb-T was strongly correlated (r = 0.85) with the Pb levels in the blood. Laser ablation ICP-MS Pb-T mappings revealed a homogenous distribution of Pb in the incisor with an increased intensity of Pb-T localized in the tip of the incisor crown bearing an enamel surface in both Sprague Dawley and R. rattus rats. These findings suggest that Pb-T in the crown incisor may be reflective of the rat's environmental habitat, thus a possible indicator of Pb exposure.

AB  - The Mongol Empire, which emerged as a result of the Mongol unity under the leadership of Genghis Khan has left its mark on world history as the world's largest land empire ever. It is as difficult to establishing establish such an enormous state and to keep it alive. For this reason, thanks to the public diplomacy, which was laid down by Genghis Khan and passed on to future generations with the Steppe Law, which is known as the Genghis Law, it has succeeded in attaining the identity of a world empire politically, economically, and culturally. It is worth mentioning that the foundations of this policy put forward by Genghis Khan correspond to the Turkic perception of world domination.As Genghis Khan believed in one God and one state as is the case according to Chinese and the Turkic state traditions. He put forward a holistic worldview in political, economic, and cultural terms: Genghis Khan's successors also continued to further his vision in all the lands they conquered, and especially in Eurasia which they dominated. After the second half of the XIIIth century, Mongol Empire ruled in Eurasia for more than a century and has been one of the first and most important examples of the holistic worldview with the policies followed by the Mongolian Khans.

AB  - Over the centuries, humanity's notions and worldview of what education should be have changed constantly in the order it serves both the development goals of society as a whole and the interests and needs of each individual. In the global educational environment, including Latvia, several educational paradigms have emerged and nowadays coexist which often complement each other. Among them, the Open Education paradigm plays an important role, where the main emphasis is on access to education. The aim of the research: to substantiate Open Education as a philosophical-methodological basis for distance education. The results of the research show that the origins of Open Education can be found in the philosophical thought of the Enlightenment era philosophers, as well as representatives of education, culture, and religion. The roots of the Open Education ideas can be traced to the history of distance learning, these ideas developed in close connection with the development of distance education/distance learning theories and their implementation in practice. From the 18th century to the present day, the ideas of Open Education developed and supplemented with new views on the aims, basic dimensions and principles, and functions of education, gaining more larger interpretation of this concept. At the end of the twentieth century, Open Education became the basis for a new educational paradigm in the Postmodernism era not only regarding distance education. Open Education became one of the most important doctrines of Postmodernism in the development of education, according to which the concepts of open education, open educational environment, and open school developed. There are three dimensions of Open Education: space, time, and process. Open Education and distance education have common three basic principles: openness, respect for distance in providing education, and flexibility.

TI  - Relationship between the number of pediatric patients with rotavirus and telephone triage for associated symptoms
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Earlier syndromic surveillance may be effective in preventing the spread of infectious disease. However, there has been no research on syndromic surveillance for rotavirus. The study aimed to assess the relationship between the incidence of rotavirus infections and the number of telephone triages for associated symptoms in pediatric patients under 4 years old in Osaka prefecture, Japan.Methods: This was a retrospective observational study for which the study period was the 3 years between January 2015 and December 2017. We analyzed data on children under 4 years old who were triaged by telephone triage nurses using software. The primary endpoint was the number of rotavirus patients under 4 years triaged old per week. Using a linear regression model, we calculated the R square value of the regression model to assess the relationship between the number of patients with rotavirus and the number of telephone triages made for associated symptoms. Covariates in the linear regression model were the week number indicating seasonality and the weekly number of telephone triages related to rotavirus symptoms such as stomachache and vomiting.Results: During the study period, there were 102,336 patients with rotavirus, and the number of people triaged by telephone was 123,720. The highest correlation coefficient was 0.921 in the regression model with the number of telephone triages for "stomachache + nausea/vomiting" and "stomachache + diarrhea + nausea/vomiting".Conclusion: The number of telephone triage symptoms was positively related to the incidence of pediatric patients with rotavirus in a large metropolitan area of Japan.

T2  - COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY C-TOXICOLOGY & PHARMACOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The toxicological risk assessment of chemicals is largely based on the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidelines. These internationally approved methodologies help shape policy and political strategy of environment and human health issues. Risk assessments which pertain to soil biota 'recruit' sentinel organisms, including the earthworm Eisenia fetida. Despite E. fetida being morphologically similar to Dendrobaena veneta, they are characterized by a several-fold difference in sensitivity to xenobiotics. Worms, sold as either as pure E. fetida stocks or E. fetida/D. veneta mixed cultures, were obtained from five commercial suppliers. The species identity of 25 earthworms was determined by sequencing the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 2 (COII). We revealed that only one of 25 worms was E. fetida, the remaining worms were all identified as D. veneta. This underlines the notion that E. fetida and D. veneta are easily mis-identified. The occurrence of cryptic speciation combined with the well-documented species-specific variation in toxicological responses highlights the pressing need to accurately classify earthworms to species level prior to any toxicological research. Only this will ensure the validity and reliability of risk assessments.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article substantiates the relevance of improvement of ecological professionalism in agriculture. The authors see the following dominant environmental problems in the agricultural sector: extensive agriculture (arable farming and cattle breeding) everywhere in the world leads to desertification; intensive management causes acute environmental conflicts associated with pollution of soil, water and air, deterioration of the quality of products, etc. The proposals of a prominent Russian theorist of environmental science N.F. Reimers on the greening of agricultural science and practice are given. The importance of studying natural-scientific fundamental ecological bases of conducting agriculture - the laws, rules and principles of agroecology defining "rules of behavior" in agricultural environmental management - by students of agricultural specialties is considered. It is pointed out that there is an urgent need for new approaches to solving environ-mental problems of agriculture. As a new, ecologically oriented worldview in agricultural science the integrative discipline economic ecology (the science of ecological and economic systems) is offered. The ecologization of planning and control of agricultural environmental management is one of the main directions of agricultural economic ecology. The results of economic and environmental studies and practical recommendations for environmental and economic optimization of the structure of agricultural lands in the Republic of Mordovia over the past 28 years are presented.

AB  - Landslides are among the most prevalent and harmful hazards. Assessment of landslide susceptibility zonation is an important task in reducing the losses of life and properties. The present study aims to demarcate the landslide prone areas along the Vathalmalai Ghat road section (VGR) using remote sensing and GIS techniques . In the first step, the landslide causative factors such as geology, geomorphology, slope, slope aspect, land use / land cover, drainage density, lineament density, road buffer and relative relief were assessed. All the factors were assigned to rank and weight based on the slope stability of the landslide susceptibility zones. Then the thematic maps were integrated using ArcGIS tool and landslide susceptibility zonation was obtained and classified into five categories ; very low, low; moderate, high and very high. The landslide susceptibility map is validated with R-index and landslide inventory data collected from the field using GPS measurement. The distribution of susceptibility zones is ;16.5% located in very low, 28.70% in low, 24.70% in moderate, 19.90% in high and 10.20% in very high zones. The R-index indicated that about 64% landslide occurences correlated with high to very high landslide susceptiblity zones. The model validation indicated that the method adopted in this study is suitable for landslide disaster mapping and planning.

AB  - The aim of this study is to analyze the forest fires, occurred in Manavgat, Bodrum and Marmaris districts in July and August 2021, using remote sensing techniques with multi-temporal optical satellite images and to determine the boundaries of the damaged areas. ESA's Sentinel-2 images acquired before, during and after fires were obtained for the analyses. Estimated results revealed that Manavgat fire damaged 47,824 ha areas and 59% of the burned area occurred within the first two days. The forest fires taken place in Mugla province were effective in an area of over 10,000 ha. Burn severity difference maps were also produced to evaluate both the visual and metric comparison of the burn severity levels of each study area during and after the forest fires. According to the obtained results, the areas labelled as high burn severity were much higher in both temporal periods for the study areas. Furthermore, the performance comparison of 5 spectral indexes (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Mid-infrared Burn Index (MIRBI), Burn Area Index (BAI), Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) and Chlorophyll Sensitive Index (CSI) in detecting of the boundaries of the damaged areas was performed based on M-statistics, and results showed that NDVI and NBR were the two most effective indices in separating the burnt areas from the unburned areas.

AB  - With the growth of remote-sensing technology, remote-sensing image processing plays an important role in different application areas, such as geological exploration and prevention from natural disaster. Normally, remote-sensing data are downlinked to the ground station, then preprocessed, and distributed towards users. This process is time consuming. Therefore a real time processing system is required. This paper proposed combination of hardware and software tools for image processing as well as for vegetation indices calculations. First FPGA is used as a hardware tool to read image. We have applied three image processing algorithms with the help of Xilinx's software. Second, for the crop segmentation we developed a website, in which we have calculated vegetation indices NDVI, SAVI, OSAVI. The experimental results demonstrate that the system not only meets real time requirements but also gives a new approach for vegetation indices calculations.

TI  - BILINGUAL WORLDVIEW IN THE POETRY OF OLEG MISIN - ARMAS HIIRI: THE STUDY OF SELF-TRANSLATION
T2  - STUDIA LITTERARUM
M3  - Article
AB  - The article analyzes the interaction of two worldviews that coexist in the mind of a bilingual poet, on the example of self-translation. Finnish-Ingrian by birth, A.I. Mishin (Oleg Mishin - Armas Hiiri) begins his literary career in Karelia in the 1950s as a Russian poet. After a decade and a half of creative work in the Russian language, Mishin-Hiiri begins to publish poems in Finnish as well. The 1970s is the first stage of his bilingual work that has memory and symbolic return to the roots by learning the native Finnish language as its main theme. Being a native speaker of two languages (Russian and Finnish), the bilingual author enters the cognitive intercultural dialogue reflected in his poetic worldview that bears a mark of his national identity. The article discusses the author's self-translations of Finnish poems into Russian, the result of the dialogic creative thinking in two languages. These self-translations are the texts semantically different from the originals. The poet not only begins to explore the possibilities of versification in two different languages but also employs different poetic images and symbols and uses different intonation. His poems and their self-translations reflect the difference in mentality of Russian and Finnish people that harmoniously coexist in Mishin's poetry shifting between two language systems.

AB  - The article explores the detection of unauthorized landfills based on remote sensing data. We have developed a mathematical approach that translates ordinary images to the 2-D manifold or 3-D manifolds in stereo images. At the same time, the posed task when developing algorithms is the transformation (convolution) of these manifolds into a one-dimensional sample. The developed method corresponds to the following two conditions: 1) preservation of the topological proximity of the elements of the original and expanded spaces, 2) preservation of correlations between the elements of the original and transformed spaces. The basic idea that underlies the mathematical support of the developed automated system is the concept of fractal sets. The concept of continuous orthogonal transformations, including the Fibonacci transform, is used as a mathematical basis for determining anomalous signal structures in the surrounding background. The problem of monitoring and decoding space images from the point of view of the synthesis of orthogonal systems with predetermined properties (speed of calculations, order of transformation, etc.) is presented. Examples of processing by the proposed algorithm are presented on the satellite images of the Moscow Region territories of the Russian Federation.

T2  - SOCIOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR SOCIOLOGICAL DEBATE
M3  - Article
AB  - This article describes how pandemic preparedness has transformed relations between hu-mans and birds in Hong Kong. If preparedness requires to imagine that a pathogen emerg-ing from birds becomes pandemic, what is the role of memory, experience and heritage in the production of this imaginary? Preparing for future pandemics is linked to repairing vulnerable environments if it focuses on the diversity of relations and the material ecolo-gies which are threatened by an emerging pathogen. After describing the measures imple-mented in Hong Kong to prepare for an influenza pandemic coming from birds, the article focuses on a specific location, Kadoorie Farm and Botanical Gardens, which recapitulates all the tensions experienced by the Hong Kong population in trying to repair the massive loss of bird life at the time of the handover of the British colony to the Chinese People???s Republic. The logic of conservation and heritage is applied to the diversity of the bird population as a sentinel species for emerging pandemics.

M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: An optimal approach to older women with breast cancer is still a major challenge. In this paper, we present a retrospective analysis of treatment in patients aged 75 years and older who were treated at the Holycross Cancer Centre in 2015-2019.Material and methods: The analysed group consisted of 259 women. For estimation of the general status of patients, we used the Geriatric 8 questionnaire. For every patient, an individual treatment plan was established. Survival analysis was performed; disease-free survival (DFS), cancer-specific survival, and overall survival (OS) were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. For DFS and OS, the Cox proportional-hazard regression was applied.Results: The mean age in the analysed group was 80 years. Stage I and II cancer accounted for over 80% of patients. Radical mastectomy was performed in 56% and breast-conserving surgery in over 34% of patients. Sentinel lymph node biopsy was used in 114 patients. Preoperative systemic treatment was applied in 34 and postoperative chemotherapy in 51 patients, respectively. Trastuzumab was used in 23 patients. Postoperative hormonal therapy was applied in 205 and radiotherapy in 178 patients. During the observation after the treatment 32 patients died, while 227 survived. In multivariate analysis for DFS hormonotherapy was statistically significant for OS clinical stage and hormonotherapy.Conclusions: The treatment plan for older women consisted of surgery and radiation therapy, and systemic treatment should be always considered. The decision should be made by the breast cancer team.

Unpublished data are those that have never been described and referenced by a peer-reviewed publication. Overview of the raw data repositories Refer to the article for full details on cell line generation and cell culture conditions.  Cells were imaged using a custom widefield epifluorescence microscope (Nikon, Eclipse Ti2) with a Spectra-X light source (Lumencor), a 100x/1.49NA oil objective (Nikon, CFI Apochromat), an iXon Life 888 EM-CCD camera (Andor), a HLD117NN stage (Prior), a Nano-ZL100 stage piezo (Mad City Labs) and a microscope enclosure chamber (Okolab) to maintain temperature and humidity. The microscope was controlled by the MicroManager software [doi:10.1002/0471142727.mb1420s92]. Unless stated otherwise, z-stacks of 21 to 24 planes were taken (∆z=0.21 or 0.3 mum) with 100ms exposures and Spectra-X powers at 4% or 5% for the GFP, mCherry and SiR-DNA channels. Illumination powers were chosen to be minimal and blue/UV light was excluded, as to avoid light-induced artefacts in chromatin motion [doi:10.1016/j.cub.2006.03.059]. In the 30 min pull-release (30'-PR) experimental scheme, individual z-stacks were taken in all 3 fluorescence channels prior to the time-lapse experiment. Then, the external magnet was place onto the microarray holder and a ∆t=2min time-lapse acquisition was started for 60 min over 6 to 8 stage positions (i.e. micropillar tips), with only the GFP and SiR-DNA channels. The external magnet was removed 30 min into the time-lapse acquisition. Whenever the external magnet is not on the holder, a counterweight was placed onto the holder to minimize mechanical drifts. However, on occasions where placement or removal of the external magnet led to a loss of focus, the acquisition was stopped, adjusted and resumed (note that all analyses rely the actual timestamp of each image to accommodate for the resulting variable frame intervals - see 'Image analysis' section). In the 100 sec pull-release (100&rdquo;-PR) experimental scheme, a single z-plane was acquired every 5 section in the GFP and SiR-DNA channels for 3000 sec (600 frames) with the same imaging setting as the 30'-PR scheme. After starting the acquisition, the external magnet was placed and removed every 100 sec (20 frames) 10 times, adjusting the focus while acquiring when necessary. After the 10th magnet removal the acquisition was left to finish for the remaining 1000 sec. Each Zenodo dataset represents one day of acquisition, including the data that was not retained (QC) for further downstream analysis. Each dataset contains: The raw MicroManager folder architecture (one folder contains multiple positions on the coverslip). On occasions where placement or removal of the external magnet led to a loss of focus, the acquisition was stopped and restarted, creating a new MicroManager folder each time. For instance: The various positions were imaged before injection, in a folder with the _preInjection; this folder contains one TIFF file per position These positions were imaged again after injection and before the magnet was added, leading to a folder with the suffix _beforeAttraction They were imaged again with the magnet added; folder _attraction1 They were finally imaged after the magnet was removed; folder _release1 If the focus had to be adjusted during the attraction of release period, this leads to additional folders (e.g. _attraction2, _release2) A text file named labjournal.txt, that contains extra information about specific details of the acquisition Note: the MicroManager metadata in the TIFF file are fully populated  Overview of the concatenated datasets In this Zenodo repository, each position (acquired in different folders), is concatenated into a single TIFF movie using code available in the Github repository s4. The folder contains: One TIFF file per selected position One .xls file per selected position, with extra timestamp information Timestamps.xls data format This file contains one line per frame, ordered chronologically, from frame 1 to n. path (Relative path): Reference to the original (raw MicroManager) file start_time (Timestamp): Timestamp saved by MicroManager when the acquisition was started (the 'acquire' button was pressed). time_in_file (seconds): Number of seconds between start_time and the acquisition of the current timepoint start_time_s (seconds): Variable start_time converted to a number of seconds time (seconds): Sum of start_time and time_in_file timestamp (Timestamp): Variable time, back-converted to a timestamp timeOn (Timestamp): Time(s) when the magnet was added. This timestamp is provided in the datasets.cfg file in the github repository chromag-pipeline timeOff (Timestamp): Time(s) when the magnet was removed. This timestamp is provided in the datasets.cfg file in the github repository chromag-pipeline forceActivated (Boolean): If the magnet is present during the current frame (calculated from timeOn and timeOff) seconds_since_first_magnet_ON (seconds): Number of (relative) seconds since the magnet was added for the first time. Frame (Integer) Frame number (1-indexed) Positions (Integer): The position number Overview of the processed datasets For each one of the selected concatenated movies, band-passed versions of the GFP and SiR-DNA channels were generated using Fiji (sigma1=0.8 px,sigma2=10 px) and treated alongside the raw channels in all subsequent steps. Correction of mechanical drifts was performed using the 'Correct 3D drift' Fiji plugin using the micropillar and/or debris on the coverglass as cues. The single-MNP 3D force map (see article for detail; code and maps available at https://github.com/CoulonLab/MagSim) was aligned with the micropillar, merged with the microscopy movie and multiplied by the number of MNPs deduced from the fluorescence intensity of the locus: the amount of MNP is calculated on a cell-by-cell basis from the first z-stack of the time-lapse acquisition, and is multiplied by the 3D force vector from the single-MNP force map on a frame-by-frame basis (since the locus and the cell move over time relative to the micropillar). The resulting movie was rotated to align the force vertically, and the Fx and Fy channels of the force map were adjusted accordingly. The motion and deformation of the cell nucleus was corrected solely based on the SiR-DNA channel, first using the 'Correct 3D drift' Fiji plugin and then refined manually using visual landmarks in the area of interest in the nucleus, visualized both on top and side views. 3D tracking of the genomic locus was performed in the resulting movie using a custom-written ImageJ/Python software and the Fx, Fy andFz components of the force were extracted as the values of the force map at the location of the genomic locus on each frame. The 100&rdquo;-PR movie was analyzed in a similar manner as the 30'-PR movie, with few differences: All the steps were performed in 2D since the 100&rdquo;-PR movie is a single-plane acquisition. The SiR-DNA channel was band-passed using sigma1=2.5 px (to reduce further imaging noise) and sigma2=10 px. To account for the occasional loss of focus of the locus on a few frames due to the placement/removal of the external magnet, we created an extra channel with a Gaussian at the center of mass of the locus (which hence locates precisely the locus whether in focus or not). This was used for both calculating the trajectory and for visualizations. This repository contains one TIFF file per concatenated movie. Overview of the calibration data and simulations Calibration of force maps This Zenodo upload describes the experimental data an associated image-processing code used to to calibrate our simulated force maps (see article for details). Raw data (`raw_data` folder): Images of 6 different pillars obtained as follows. We covered an area of the magnetic microarray with a drop of diluted MNP solution (25 nM) and imaged the spatial distribution of MNPs subject to the magnetic field around the pillars. Using a spinning-disk confocal microscope (Yokogawa CSU-X1 on a Nikon Ti stand with a Plan Apo 100x/1.4 oil objective and an Andor iXon3 camera) to achieve z-sectioning, z-stacks of GFP signal (MNPs) were obtained along with a homogenous control (TMR) in a second channel. Code for image analysis (`scripts` folder): Raw z-stack timeseries images were corrected for intensity offset and non-homogenous illumination/light collection ('flat-field' correction), time-averaged and down-sampled to minimize noise, and the GFP channel (MNPs) was normalized by the TMR channel (homogenous control) to correct for shadowing effects due to partial obstruction of the confocal light beam at the vicinity of the pillar. Within an intermediate range of fluorescence intensity, the resulting images are assumed to approximate a Boltzmann distribution of MNPs, so that F=kBT &nabla;[log(fluo)]. See article for details. For the comparison with the simulated maps, masks were made to exclude areas of low fluorescence signal (prone to noise and inaccurate flat-field correction) and areas of high signal (prone to non-linearity due to steric exclusion and fluorescence quenching). Since even a small amount of photobleaching during the spinning-disk acquisition makes the z component of the experimental force maps inaccurate, only the x and y components were used for comparison with the simulated maps. Processed data (`output` folder): We provide the final output as a single TIFF file with all the channels described above and with all 6 pillars provided as raw data.  Fluorescence-to-MNPs conversion factor To estimate the fluorescence of single ferritin MNPs, we used imaging conditions where we can see individual ferritin MNPs. We injected low amounts of MNPs into cells and performed short-exposure (5 ms) max-power imaging. After temporal binning of the images and exclusion of bright and static objects, single MNPs were detected and averaged into a single-MNP image. The integrated fluorescence intensity was computed and converted into a 'fluorescence-to-MNP conversion factor' accounting for our default imaging conditions used for time-lapse acquisitions.

However, on occasions where placement or removal of the external magnet led to a loss of focus, the acquisition was stopped, adjusted and resumed (note that all analyses rely the actual timestamp of each image to accommodate for the resulting variable frame intervals - see 'Image analysis' section). In the 100 sec pull-release (100&rdquo;-PR) experimental scheme, a single z-plane was acquired every 5 section in the GFP and SiR-DNA channels for 3000 sec (600 frames) with the same imaging setting as the 30'-PR scheme. After starting the acquisition, the external magnet was placed and removed every 100 sec (20 frames) 10 times, adjusting the focus while acquiring when necessary. After the 10th magnet removal the acquisition was left to finish for the remaining 1000 sec. Each Zenodo dataset represents one day of acquisition, including the data that was not retained (QC) for further downstream analysis. Each dataset contains: The raw MicroManager folder architecture (one folder contains multiple positions on the coverslip). On occasions where placement or removal of the external magnet led to a loss of focus, the acquisition was stopped and restarted, creating a new MicroManager folder each time. For instance: The various positions were imaged before injection, in a folder with the _preInjection; this folder contains one TIFF file per position These positions were imaged again after injection and before the magnet was added, leading to a folder with the suffix _beforeAttraction They were imaged again with the magnet added; folder _attraction1 They were finally imaged after the magnet was removed; folder _release1 If the focus had to be adjusted during the attraction of release period, this leads to additional folders (e.g. _attraction2, _release2) A text file named labjournal.txt, that contains extra information about specific details of the acquisition Note: the MicroManager metadata in the TIFF file are fully populated  Overview of the concatenated datasets In this Zenodo repository, each position (acquired in different folders), is concatenated into a single TIFF movie using code available in the Github repository s4. The folder contains: One TIFF file per selected position One .xls file per selected position, with extra timestamp information Timestamps.xls data format This file contains one line per frame, ordered chronologically, from frame 1 to n. path (Relative path): Reference to the original (raw MicroManager) file start_time (Timestamp): Timestamp saved by MicroManager when the acquisition was started (the 'acquire' button was pressed). time_in_file (seconds): Number of seconds between start_time and the acquisition of the current timepoint start_time_s (seconds): Variable start_time converted to a number of seconds time (seconds): Sum of start_time and time_in_file timestamp (Timestamp): Variable time, back-converted to a timestamp timeOn (Timestamp): Time(s) when the magnet was added. This timestamp is provided in the datasets.cfg file in the github repository chromag-pipeline timeOff (Timestamp): Time(s) when the magnet was removed. This timestamp is provided in the datasets.cfg file in the github repository chromag-pipeline forceActivated (Boolean): If the magnet is present during the current frame (calculated from timeOn and timeOff) seconds_since_first_magnet_ON (seconds): Number of (relative) seconds since the magnet was added for the first time. Frame (Integer) Frame number (1-indexed) Positions (Integer): The position number Overview of the processed datasets For each one of the selected concatenated movies, band-passed versions of the GFP and SiR-DNA channels were generated using Fiji (sigma1=0.8 px,sigma2=10 px) and treated alongside the raw channels in all subsequent steps. Correction of mechanical drifts was performed using the 'Correct 3D drift' Fiji plugin using the micropillar and/or debris on the coverglass as cues. The single-MNP 3D force map (see article for detail; code and maps available at https://github.com/CoulonLab/MagSim) was aligned with the micropillar, merged with the microscopy movie and multiplied by the number of MNPs deduced from the fluorescence intensity of the locus: the amount of MNP is calculated on a cell-by-cell basis from the first z-stack of the time-lapse acquisition, and is multiplied by the 3D force vector from the single-MNP force map on a frame-by-frame basis (since the locus and the cell move over time relative to the micropillar). The resulting movie was rotated to align the force vertically, and the Fx and Fy channels of the force map were adjusted accordingly. The motion and deformation of the cell nucleus was corrected solely based on the SiR-DNA channel, first using the 'Correct 3D drift' Fiji plugin and then refined manually using visual landmarks in the area of interest in the nucleus, visualized both on top and side views. 3D tracking of the genomic locus was performed in the resulting movie using a custom-written ImageJ/Python software and the Fx, Fy andFz components of the force were extracted as the values of the force map at the location of the genomic locus on each frame. The 100&rdquo;-PR movie was analyzed in a similar manner as the 30'-PR movie, with few differences: All the steps were performed in 2D since the 100&rdquo;-PR movie is a single-plane acquisition. The SiR-DNA channel was band-passed using sigma1=2.5 px (to reduce further imaging noise) and sigma2=10 px. To account for the occasional loss of focus of the locus on a few frames due to the placement/removal of the external magnet, we created an extra channel with a Gaussian at the center of mass of the locus (which hence locates precisely the locus whether in focus or not). This was used for both calculating the trajectory and for visualizations. This repository contains one TIFF file per concatenated movie. Overview of the calibration data and simulations Calibration of force maps This Zenodo upload describes the experimental data an associated image-processing code used to to calibrate our simulated force maps (see article for details). Raw data (`raw_data` folder): Images of 6 different pillars obtained as follows. We covered an area of the magnetic microarray with a drop of diluted MNP solution (25 nM) and imaged the spatial distribution of MNPs subject to the magnetic field around the pillars. Using a spinning-disk confocal microscope (Yokogawa CSU-X1 on a Nikon Ti stand with a Plan Apo 100x/1.4 oil objective and an Andor iXon3 camera) to achieve z-sectioning, z-stacks of GFP signal (MNPs) were obtained along with a homogenous control (TMR) in a second channel. Code for image analysis (`scripts` folder): Raw z-stack timeseries images were corrected for intensity offset and non-homogenous illumination/light collection ('flat-field' correction), time-averaged and down-sampled to minimize noise, and the GFP channel (MNPs) was normalized by the TMR channel (homogenous control) to correct for shadowing effects due to partial obstruction of the confocal light beam at the vicinity of the pillar. Within an intermediate range of fluorescence intensity, the resulting images are assumed to approximate a Boltzmann distribution of MNPs, so that F=kBT &nabla;[log(fluo)]. See article for details. For the comparison with the simulated maps, masks were made to exclude areas of low fluorescence signal (prone to noise and inaccurate flat-field correction) and areas of high signal (prone to non-linearity due to steric exclusion and fluorescence quenching). Since even a small amount of photobleaching during the spinning-disk acquisition makes the z component of the experimental force maps inaccurate, only the x and y components were used for comparison with the simulated maps. Processed data (`output` folder): We provide the final output as a single TIFF file with all the channels described above and with all 6 pillars provided as raw data.  Fluorescence-to-MNPs conversion factor To estimate the fluorescence of single ferritin MNPs, we used imaging conditions where we can see individual ferritin MNPs. We injected low amounts of MNPs into cells and performed short-exposure (5 ms) max-power imaging. After temporal binning of the images and exclusion of bright and static objects, single MNPs were detected and averaged into a single-MNP image. The integrated fluorescence intensity was computed and converted into a 'fluorescence-to-MNP conversion factor' accounting for our default imaging conditions used for time-lapse acquisitions.

AB  - Various remote sensing systems are used to monitor the condition of rapeseed plants from sowing to harvest. The possibilities of using drones to determine the NDVI index were studied. In the experimental field, three flights during the oilseed rape growing season were performed on the property of Jeruzalem SAT d.d. at GERK Lopersice levo, which is 18.4 ha in size and is located between Ormoz and Sredisce ob Dravi. We used Phantom 4 drone in combination with Sequoia + multispectral camera to capture photographs, which were processed using PIX4D Fields software. Photographs were combined into an orthomosaic. The values of the NDVI index were determined. Measurements confirmed the conclusions of other studies. The values obtained from the drone images were compared with the images from the Landsat-8 satellite. Our drone shots are much better and more convenient. The images are important for targeted selective fertilization and application of reduced amounts of phytopharmacy protection products. Savings and contribution to environmental protection are very important.

TI  - Healing Practices in the Epistle of James Applied to New Prophetic Churches in South Africa
T2  - NEOTESTAMENTICA
M3  - Article
AB  - A social-scientific reading of the healing practices-in reference to the worldview of the author of James (as demonstrated in James 5:13-16)-illustrates that he encouraged the laying on of hands and the use of ointment in healing, as well as confessional and communal prayer, to aid the faith of believers in God. The argument within healing ritual theory is that the new prophetic churches in South Africa encourage these healing practices for the purpose of commercialisation, and not necessarily to enhance the faith of their followers. This article will argue that James simply defined sickness as a symptom of the angry spiritual world and recommended that the living appease God through healing rituals. James thus supported healing rituals within the early church, such as prayer, the laying on of hands by elders, and ointment. But James did not make a connection between these practices and the commercialisation of religion. Therefore, a social-scientific reading of James 5:13-16 has scholarly implications when it comes to healing practices in light of the new prophetic churches in South Africa. This study challenges the way in which both scholars and practitioners of faith understand healing practices and the commercialisation of religion.

TI  - A Multimodal Feature Selection Method for Remote Sensing Data Analysis Based on Double Graph Laplacian Diagonalization
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - When dealing with multivariate remotely sensed records collected by multiple sensors, an accurate selection of information at the data, feature, or decision level is instrumental in improving the scenes' characterization. This will also enhance the system's efficiency and provide more details on modeling the physical phenomena occurring on the Earth's surface. In this article, we introduce a flexible and efficient method based on graph Laplacians for information selection at different levels of data fusion. The proposed approach combines data structure and information content to address the limitations of existing graph-Laplacian-based methods in dealing with heterogeneous datasets. Moreover, it adapts the selection to each homogenous area of the considered images according to their underlying properties. Experimental tests carried out on several multivariate remote sensing datasets show the consistency of the proposed approach.

TI  - The Integration of Multivariate Statistical Approaches, Hyperspectral Reflectance, and Data-Driven Modeling for Assessing the Quality and Suitability of Groundwater for Irrigation
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainable agriculture in arid regions necessitates that the quality of groundwater be carefully monitored; otherwise, low-quality irrigation water may cause soil degradation and negatively impact crop productivity. This study aimed to evaluate the quality of groundwater samples collected from the wells in the quaternary aquifer, which are located in the Western Desert (WD) and the Central Nile Delta (CND), by integrating a multivariate analysis, proximal remote sensing data, and data-driven modeling (adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and support vector machine regression (SVMR)). Data on the physiochemical parameters were subjected to multivariate analysis to ease the interpretation of groundwater quality. Then, six irrigation water quality indices (IWQIs) were calculated, and the original spectral reflectance (OSR) of groundwater samples were collected in the 302-1148 nm range, with the optimal spectral wavelength intervals corresponding to each of the six IWQIs determined through correlation coefficients (r). Finally, the performance of both the ANFIS and SVMR models for evaluating the IWQIs was investigated based on effective spectral reflectance bands. From the multivariate analysis, it was concluded that the combination of factor analysis and principal component analysis was found to be advantageous to examining and interpreting the behavior of groundwater quality in both regions, as well as predicting the variables that may impact groundwater quality by illuminating the relationship between physiochemical parameters and the factors or components of both analyses. The analysis of the six IWQIs revealed that the majority of groundwater samples from the CND were highly suitable for irrigation purposes, whereas most of the groundwater from the WD can be used with some limitations to avoid salinity and alkalinity issues in the long term. The high r values between the six IWQIs and OSR were located at wavelength intervals of 302-318, 358-900, and 1074-1148 nm, and the peak value of r for these was relatively flat. Finally, the ANFIS and SVMR both obtained satisfactory degrees of model accuracy for evaluating the IWQIs, but the ANFIS model (R-2 = 0.74-1.0) was superior to the SVMR (R-2 = 0.01-0.88) in both the training and testing series. Finally, the multivariate analysis was able to easily interpret groundwater quality and ground-based remote sensing on the basis of spectral reflectance bands via the ANFIS model, which could be used as a fast and low-cost onsite tool to estimate the IWQIs of groundwater.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article identifies the deep causes of the new wave of minors' criminalization in the Russian society. The authors considered the expert opinions on this issue and found them inconsistent; described the main forms of behavior associated with the adoption of criminal values - primary, game, and re-criminalization which usually have different social localization; summarized the historical aspects of adolescent criminalization in the Russian society and its social-cultural factors. Based on the analysis of the official statistics and the results of the empirical studies conducted in 2019-2020 within the project "Deep causes of teenage (neo)criminalization in contemporary Russia" supported by the RFBR, the authors assess the scale of real and virtual criminalization, features of legal outlook, social-psychological well-being, and worldview of criminalized and 'ordinary' teenagers. In addition to the traditionally identified causes of criminalization (social-economic and cultural-educational inequality, deprivation, territorial-geographical specificity, etc.), the authors consider social-cultural factors: first, violations in socialization and child-parental relations - as leading to the deprivation of the need for love and recognition of minors by their parents and to the attempts to compensate this deprivation destructively, with criminal practices; second, the types of minors' heroes, which determine the normative and gender inversion and the spread of the criminal subculture - as a source of the surrogate pseudo-masculine discourse. The authors make a conclusion that the prevention of minors' criminalization should be based on psychological-pedagogical and social-cultural technologies, the main actors of which are the family, school and state information policy, while the normative-legal technologies of social control, the actors of which are administrative and law enforcement agencies, should focus on the crime-deterrent function.

TI  - Deep Semisupervised Teacher-Student Model Based on Label Propagation for Sea Ice Classification
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we propose a novelteacher-student-based label propagation deep semisupervised learning (TSLP-SSL) method for sea ice classification based on Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar data. For sea ice classification, labeling the data precisely is very time consuming and requires expert knowledge. Our method efficiently learns sea ice characteristics from a limited number of labeled samples and a relatively large number of unlabeled samples. Therefore, our method addresses the key challenge of using a limited number of precisely labeled samples to achieve generalization capability by discovering the underlying sea ice characteristics also from unlabeled data. We perform experimental analysis considering a standard dataset consisting of properly labeled sea ice data spanning over different time slots of the year. Both qualitative and quantitative results obtained on this dataset show that our proposed TSLP-SSL method outperforms deep supervised and semisupervised reference methods.

TI  - Estimation of aerosol optical depth in relation to meteorological parameters over eastern and western routes of China Pakistan economic corridor
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study finds out seasonal and monthly variations in Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) over eastern and western routes of China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and the relationship between AOD and meteorological parameters (i.e., temperature, rainfall and wind speed). The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) data was used from the terra satellite for the period of 2000-2016. This study aims to overtake the conventional view of the purpose of using the satellite datasets. This study takes on to the concept that validated satellite data sets rather should be used for the analysis instead of just validation specifically for our study region. Hence, after comparing MODIS AOD with MISR AOD, only MISR AOD dataset is used for further analysis. The results show a decreasing trend of AOD in summer season, a positive relationship between temperature and AOD during winter and spring seasons whereas a positive relationship between wind speed and AOD in winter and spring seasons over eastern and western routes. Periodic analysis of MODIS AOD and MISR AOD depicts May-Aug as the peak period of aerosol concentration over central Pakistan. The inter-annual analysis shows the aerosol trend remained higher during summer season however rainfall shows the washout effect. Eastern route has higher standard deviation and larger values for aerosol prevalence as compared to western route. The trajectory analysis using the HYSPLIT model suggests the bias of air mass trajectory caused deviation in the aerosol trend in the year 2014.

TI  - Gender Discrimination in the Media of Eastern Europe: A Historical and Comparative Aspect
T2  - RUPKATHA JOURNAL ON INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES IN HUMANITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The research analyzes a topical issue of gender balance in media in its historical cutoff. The authors consider imbalance regarding the gender of the key figures in publications as one of indicators of latent discrimination. The subject of the content-analysis is Globus, an illustrated magazine published in Kyiv in 1923-1935. This progressive periodical paid significant attention to the issue of female emancipation; that is why its research is also demonstrative for studying the diachrony of a gender stereotypization phenomenon. The purpose of the content analysis was to determine the qualitative indicators with respect to distribution between verbal and visual women's and men's images in this magazine as a material indicator of worldview stereotypization. As the research results show, Globus had extremely low rate concerning the women's representation in text materials (15%) and illustrations (18%). Correspondingly, the ratio of women's and men's images in total amounts to 1:5. Moreover, a tendency to gender asymmetry in 1930's only increased, since the quantity of men's representations in the magazine of 1932 reached almost 90% and women's ones decreased respectively. Thus, the comparison of women's and men's images already amounted to 1:7, i.d. gender disproportion grew up. The data received have been compared with the monitoring results of current media content related to the compliance with gender balance; that allowed specification and analysis of main tendencies in representation of women and men in the media discourse in the beginning of XX and XXI centuries.

AB  - The purpose of our research work is to understand the efficiency and advantage of applying machine learning technique on remote sensing data collected from one of the largest mangrove forests in the world, named Sundarbans. Our study area was Sundarbans mangrove forest, and we have detected land cover changes in this area. The images we have used were collected from Landsat 8 OLI, ETM+, TM data. After pre-processing the images, we classified them applying the Maximum Likelihood classifier. We got overall accuracy of 80%, 75%, and 77.1% and kappa efficiency 0.80, 0.62, and 0.69 for the years 2001, 2011, 2021 respectively. To determine the overall accuracy and kappa efficiency, we have used confusionmatrix. In the last 20 years, Sundarbans mangrove forest has declined by 0.2% due to human settlements, deforestation, natural calamity, increasing water salinity etc.

AB  - Remote sensing data is available free of cost with an ever-increase in the number of satellites. This satellite imagery can be used as raw input from which cultivated/non-cultivated and crop fields can be mapped. Previous trends included the use of traditional ML techniques and standard CNN, RNN for such mappings. In this paper, we investigate the segmentation models for the task of Landcover and Crop type Classification. We investigate the UNet, SegNet, and DeepLabv3+ in the data-rich states of Nebraska, Mid-West, United States. We acquire dataset from Cropland data Layer provided by USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service. Our Experimental results show that cultivated and non-cultivated landcover is classified with an accuracy of 90% and crop types are classified around 70% ensuring the models trained on one geographical area can be used for accurate classification in other geographical areas, which makes it more reliable for real-time application in agricultural business.

TI  - MAPPING AND MONITORING OF URBAN SPRAWL TO PROMOTE SUSTAINABLE URBANIZATION USING GEOSPATIAL TECHNIQUES
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization is a global phenomenon, but in undeveloped countries like Pakistan, urban sprawl ratio has proliferated. Non-systematic development, increased migration, and sharp population growth have been predominant factors. These variables boosted the population and resulted in quickly built-up areas in the Peshawar district. The present research was to investigate spatial and temporal change in the urban sprawl from 2000 to 2018. Remotely sensed data and Maximum Likelihood Classification were used to investigate the urban sprawl. Remotely sensed data is fundamentally appropriate for providing information and characteristics for urban land cover on spatial and temporal scales. The results show that the total urban built-up areas were 54.39 km(2), 54.62 km(2), 64.64 km(2), 69.65 km(2) and 77.39 km(2) with annual growth rates of 0.084%, 3.06%, 1.43% and 3.3%, respectively, in 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2018. The overall accuracy of the classified imagery was 80 %. Our finding of analysis shows that major changes were detected in the built-up area of Peshawar during this 18-year time period. According to the Peshawar Development Authority report, in 2017 the total urban built-up area was 84km(2) while our analysis shows that the total built area was 77 km(2). The primary driving force for the development was education, health, and microeconomic centers, and the population shift to the Peshawar district from neighboring tribal regions because of military operations. It has been recommended that hyper spectral imagery would be useful for monitoring the urban expansion of larger cities.

TI  - Menthol Mint (<i>Mentha arvensis</i> L.) Crop Acreage Estimation Using Multi-temporal Satellite Imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop acreage estimation is an essential component for forecasting crop production. Menthol mint acreage estimation is a necessity as the crop production data change every year due to fluctuations in the market prices of menthol mint oil; hence, the rate available to farmers also changes every year. These acreage estimation studies would be helpful in reducing the uncertainties of menthol mint production as lower price results in low production and high price results in higher production next year. Thus, it in turn would help in stabilizing the market prices. Nowadays, remote sensing technologies due to their availability and adaptability are being widely used for crop acreage estimation nationally and internationally. This study focuses on menthol mint crop acreage estimation in the Barabanki district of Uttar Pradesh, India, using 2017 Sentinel-2A satellite data. Adaptive maximum likelihood classification algorithm was applied after intensive ground survey to obtain reliable menthol mint crop acreage estimation for talukwise statistics. Results have shown that menthol mint was extensively cultivated in the Fatehpur and Barabanki taluks as compared to the Haidergarh and Ram Sanehi Ghat taluks of Barabanki district. Menthol mint crop acreage estimation in the study area was estimated to be about 58,284.70 ha with (89.13% and 87.23%; users and producer's accuracy) with overall accuracy (90.67%) and kappa value (0.844). In this study, early and late menthol mint crop acreage estimation was also attempted and it was found that about 26,123.50 ha and 29,911.40 ha were the area of early and late menthol mint, respectively. This method can be useful for localized-level crop acreage estimation from early to mature stage of menthol mint during its growing season.

TI  - MODELING EVAPOTRANSPIRATION OF WINTER WHEAT USING CONTEXTUAL AND PIXEL-BASED SURFACE ENERGY BALANCE MODELS
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface energy balance (SEB) models based on thermal remote sensing data are widely used in research applications to map evapotranspiration (ET) across various landscapes. However, their ability to capture ET from winter wheat remains underexplored, especially in practical applications such as integrated resource management and drought preparedness. Investigating winter wheat ET dynamics is important in agricultural regions such as the Southern Great Plains of the U.S., where winter wheat is extensively cultivated. The goal of this study was to evaluate the performance of five fully automated SEB models, three contextual-based (CB) and two pixel-based (PB), in estimating instantaneous and daily ET of winter wheat by comparing the model results with flux tower observations. The CB models included Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL), Mapping Evapotranspiration at high Resolution with Internalized Calibration (METRIC), and Triangular Vegetation Temperature (TVT). The PB models included Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) and Two-Source Energy Balance (TSEB). Model evaluation during two winter wheat growing seasons (2016-2018) using 28 Landsat images showed that the instantaneous ET estimates from METRIC and TSEB had the smallest (RMSE = 0.14 mm h(-1)) and largest (RMSE = 0.27 mm h(-1)) errors, respectively. At the daily scale, SEBAL was the best performing model (RMSE = 1.0 mm d(-1)), followed by TVT (RMSE = 1.1 mm d(-1)), METRIC (RMSE = 1.2 mm d(-1)), SEBS (RMSE = 1.3 mm d(-1)), and TSEB (RMSE = 1.5 mm d(-1)). Overall, the CB models provided smaller errors than the PB models. Larger errors in daily ET estimation were observed during low vegetation and drier conditions, especially for the PB models.

AB  - Hyperspectral satellite data collections have been successfully leveraged in many domains such as meteorology, agriculture, forestry, and disaster management. There is also a collection of publicly available satellite observation networks. However, gaps in scanning frequencies and inadequate spatial resolutions limit the capabilities of geoscience applications. In this study, we target the temporal sparsity of high-resolution satellite images. In particular, we propose a novel methodology to estimate high-resolution images between scheduled scans. Our model SATnet, falls broadly within the class of Generative Adversarial Networks. SATnet allows us to generate accurate high-resolution, high-frequency satellite data at diverse spatial extents. SATnet achieves this by learning relations between a sequence of high-resolution/low-frequency satellite imageries (from Sentinel-2) and an ancillary satellite image that is high-frequency/low-resolution (from MODIS). Our benchmarks demonstrate that SATnet outperforms existing approaches such as ConvLSTMs, Dynamic Filter Network, and TrajGRU with a PSNR accuracy of 31.82. We trained and deployed SATnet over a distributed storage cluster to support the high-throughput generation of imputed satellite imagery via query evaluations. Our methodology preserves geospatial proximity and facilitates the dynamic construction of satellite imagery at a particular timestamp for arbitrary spatial scopes.

AB  - Sensitivity to weather conditions, and specially to clouds, is a severe limiting factor to the use of optical remote sensing for Earth monitoring applications. Typically, the optical satellite images are often corrupted because of poor weather conditions. As a rule, the measure of degradation of optical images is such that one can not rely even on the brightness inside of the damaged regions. As a result, some subdomains of such images become absolutely invisible. So, there is a great deal of missing information in optical remote sensing data. In this work, we propose a new variational approach for exact restoration of multi-spectral satellite optical images. We discuss the consistency of the proposed variational model, give the scheme for its regularization, derive the corresponding optimality system, and discuss the algorithm for the practical implementation of the reconstruction procedure. Experimental results are very promising and they show a significant gain over baseline methods using the reconstruction through linear interpolation between data available at temporally-close time instants.

TI  - The Dichotomy between the Notions "Self" and "Other" in the Animalistic Kalmyk Ballads
T2  - NOVYI FILOLOGICHESKII VESTNIK-NEW PHILOLOGICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The article examines the dichotomy "ours" and "aliens" in the animalistic ballad of the Kalmyk poets of the 20th century. The relevance of the study is determined by the insufficient study of the ballad of Kalmyk poets on the theme of the literary bestiary. The article deals with the dichotomy between the notions "self" and "other" within the animal world of the ballad of the Kalmyk poets of the 20th century. The relevance of the study is determined by the unexplored ballads of the Kalmyk poets on the theme of nature, with the heroes-representatives of the animal world of the steppe region. The purpose of the article is to explore the poetics of the Kalmyk literary ballad concerning the relationship between man and animals in the aspect of position, opposition and disposition. In the ballads by Timothy Bembeev "(sic) tohrun" ("The Ballad of the Clipped Wings"), Vladimir Nurov's "Bargin tusk ballad" ("The Ballad of the Dog Baltyk"), Mikhail Khoninov's "(sic)m zalhsn shovum duulna" ("About the Bird Wounded in a Combat") of the 1960s-1970s. The "self" vs. "other" dichotomy manifests the natural world and the human world both in conflict against each other and in alliance with each other. Whereas in heroic-patriotic and political ballads of Kalmyk authors the protagonists are usually designated by specific names, in the animalistic ballads about the animal world people are depersonalized: the nameless narrator actualizes this or that incident, emphasizing moral values; animal characters, as a rule, are not personalized, with the exception of a dog named Baltyk in V. Nurov's ballad. The application of historical-literary and comparative-comparative methods allows us to identify the authors` intentions in the depiction of people and animals, wild and domestic, in conflicting situations of war and peace, freedom and bondage, good and evil, loyalty and enmity, strength and weakness. The poetics of the Kalmyk ballad emphasize the genre nature of the work, expressed either in the title or in the subtitle of the original text or its Russian translation. The ecological theme in the stories is translated by the authors as love for their native land, protection and preservation of the animal world. The national worldview of the Kalmyk poets projects a picture of the steppe fauna from the perspective of folk culture, customs and beliefs. Preserving the traditions of national versification, poets structure texts in different ways: with no division into stanzas (T. Bembeev), with division into quatrains (V. Nurov, M. Khoninov). The zoopoetics of the animalistic ballad of the three poets is closer to a story in verse.

TI  - THE EFFECT OF LANDSCAPE PATTERN ON THE 2010 WILDFIRE SPREAD IN THE MORDOVIA STATE NATURE RESERVE, RUSSIA
T2  - NATURE CONSERVATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was aimed to identify natural complexes, which, after the wildfire of 2010, served as natural barriers to the fire spread in the Mordovia State Nature Reserve (Russia), and to assess the role of landscape surroundings in reducing the fire severity. The paper investigates the properties, size and pattern of landscape complexes at the local scale in 200-m boundary zones where a fire stops or changes its severity. Three fire severity classes were associated with field and spectral diagnostic features. The high-severity class is detected on satellite images by a sharp reduction in phytomass from June to September in the year of the wildfire impact. Classes of medium and low severity fire are detected by a gradual decrease in phytomass within four years after the wildfire. In the Mordovia State Nature Reserve, the area affected by the fire is estimated at 151 km'. Based on the landscape map of the Mordovia State Nature Reserve, the proportion of various types of landscape complexes was calculated within the border zones, adjacent to the front side: 1) to the general fire perimeter, 2) to the boundaries of the inner non-burned islands. 3) to the boundaries dividing a high-severity fire from a medium and low fire severity. We found that the occurrence of hydromorphic complexes is 1.5-10.0 times higher on the side of the considered boundaries where the fire energy decreases. Within the fire perimeter, hydromorphic complexes either become hotbeds of high fire severity due to the high amount of available fuel, or form islands of unburned forest. The success of hydromorphic complexes in stopping or slowing a fire depends more on their size than on the level of wetness. The width of swampy and damp river channels was measured along the entire length with a 1-km interval. Diameter measurements were made for swampy depressions. We found that narrow swampy river channels of 150-160-m wide do not present a fire barrier and completely burn out in a high-severity fire. River segments, where the channel width increases up to 170-180 m, present a barrier for a low-severity fire, but do not slow down the spread of medium or high-severity fire. River valleys of 200-250-m width mostly do not burn, but also do not present a barrier because a high-severity fire jumps to other sides of the valley and spreads further. A lowseverity fire dies down, and a stronger fire subsides when it meets a river channel 250-300 m wide. River valleys, over 700 m wide, act as a barrier to any wildfire type. Swampy depressions do not act as fire breaks, but their clusters increase landscape heterogeneity and slow down the fire. The average diameter of mires in the perimeter of a high fire severity is 32 m; their area proportion is 0.07%. The diameter of mires in the perimeter of medium and low fire severity increases on average up to 63-77 m. And their area proportion increases up to 0.40-0.59%.

M3  - Article
AB  - For the first time, the article deals with the uniqueness of artistic consciousness and perception of the world and the features of conveying them by means of the Russian language using the example of the kinds of literature of the small-numbered peoples of the Russian Arctic. The authors' attempt to identify the the features of the non-Russian perception of the world and the reflection of national life through the Russian language makes it possible to detect and analyze such types of bilingual creative work as conditional bilingualism and creative bilingualism in the artistic work of indigenous writers of the Russian Arctic. The historiography of the matter indicates that the problem of bilingualism in the prose of the indigenous peoples of the Russian Arctic has been poorly studied in national literary criticism.

T2  - SKHIDNOIEVROPEISKYI ISTORYCHNYI VISNYK-EAST EUROPEAN HISTORICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The Topicality of the Research. The topicality of the issue under study is driven by the need to carry out a smooth coverage of Karazin's biography, which presents poorly researched pages of his life. When characterizing the socio-political views of Karazin, a range of studied aspects of his worldview has been extensively extended. The Purpose of the Research. The purpose of the article is to throw light on a life journey of the prominent political and public figure, a scientist of the early XIXth centuty Vasyl Nazarovych Karazin, to investigate the facts and fill gaps in his biography, to outline landmarks in his life and creative activity, to analyze his fundamental scientific achievements and their importance for descendants. The Methodology of the Research. The main methods, which have been used to study the matter at issue, are as follows: chronological, historical genetic, comparative historical, historical typological, synchronous, biographic, and prosopography approaches. The Research Results. In the article there has been elucidated Karazin biography, which provides insight into the milestones of the formation of his worldview. The authors have specified features of the social and political views of Karazin, which shaped his unique interpretation of topical political matters concerning the form of government, role of the state authority in the development of political and ideological areas. It has determined the scope and motivation for activity of Karazin as a landowner and the founder of many non-governmental organizations of that time. The Practical Signance The research findings can be used while investigating sources of the formation of the ideology of conservatism of the XIXth century, a degree of its assimilation of the provisions of innovative public opinion and pattern of the use of West European socio-political theories, a role of conservative nobility in the social movement, sequence of their ideas and policy of the ruling elite.

TI  - New Inventory of the Russian glaciers based on satellite data (2016-2019)
T2  - LED I SNEG-ICE AND SNOW
M3  - Article
AB  - The new Inventory of the Russian glaciers has been created at the Institute of Geography of the Russian Academy of Sciences mainly on the basis of the Sentinel 2 satellite images for 2016-2019 with the aim of assessing the current state of glacier systems and as a basis for monitoring and re-inventorying. Delineation of glacier outlines was manually made to reduce uncertainties, especially for small glaciers. The database structure is compatible with the global and national glacier archives and includes the main glacial parameters. Additionally a classification of possible catastrophic phenomena of glacial genesis was developed: dynamically unstable glaciers, glacier lakes, icebergs, etc. The data base is available online (www.glacrus.ru ). At present, there are 22 glacial systems in Russia with a total area of 54,518 km(2). The largest glacial systems by area are located in the Arctic archipelagos: Novaya Zemlya, Severnaya Zemlya, and Franz Josef Land. The glacial systems of the Caucasus, Kamchatka, and Altai are the largest by area in the continental part of Russia. The main group consists of 13 small glacial systems, the area of which does not exceed 100 km(2). They are located in different glaciological zones: from the De Long Islands in the Arctic to the Eastern Sayan in southern Siberia. Since the compilation of the USSR glacier Inventory (1965-1982), the area of glaciers has decreased by 5,594 km(2), or 9.3%. The area of polar glaciers has decreased in smaller degree than that of glaciers in mountainous regions. The results of our research confirm the trend of reducing the area of glaciers throughout the Russian territory. The magnitude and rate of changes depend on local climatic and orographic features. The exception is the glaciers of the volcanic regions of Kamchatka, the area of which has increased or remained unchanged.

T2  - 한국지적학회지
M3  - research-article
AB  - The primary purpose of this study is to identify the spatiotemporal change patterns of heat islands in Sejong City, a planned new city. This research used Landsat 8 images and spatial autocorrelation to achieve this goal. The results of the analysis show that the temporal and spatial distribution patterns of heat islands in Sejong City have significantly changed since 2013. In particular, the proportion of building area was found to be the most crucial factor in determining the spatial distribution patterns of urban heat islands. Besides, heat islands in urban areas were confirmed to be considerably affected by vegetation density in urban parks. This study is very different from previous studies in that it uses both spatial autocorrelation and classification performance analysis to investigate the spatial and temporal change patterns of urban heat islands. However, this research has limitations in that it analyzes the spatiotemporal variations of heat islands only in Sejong City, which is a planned new city, despite its differentiation and usefulness. In particular, since the spatial structures of most of Korea's naturally formed cities differ from that of Sejong City, it may be a good research topic to compare the temporal and spatial patterns of heat islands in Sejong City and other cities.

M3  - research-article
AB  - The Christian worldview is often criticized for being neither biblical nor ethical. The worldview that are supposed to see the world from a biblical perspective stands far from the biblical story. It is not really 'viewing the real world', even though the its purpose should be the transformation of the world and the practice of believers. The reason for this is to identify the Bible as a doctrinal statement or a philosophical proposition.This paper finds alternative to this and solutions in John Yoder's doctrine of Bible. According to him, the Bible as canon is the standard of Christian life. It is the story of the historical Jesus. It is political and realistic. Biblical realism, which reads the Bible as the story of Jesus, confronts Reinhold Niebuhr's Christian realism. Niebuhr understands the biblical story as absolute ethics. Fallen human beings cannot live the Bible in reality. This is a weakening of the authority of the Bible and we can't live the story of the Bible. Furthermore, Yoder states that the story of Jesus is our story, and our story is an interpretation and commentary of the story of Jesus. He says our story should be the story of Jesus.Therefore, Yother's biblical theory will be a valid way to read the Bible in a sense that it secures the position and authority of the Bible as a canon and demands discipleship and discipleship community that lives the Bible.

TI  - Improved food-insecurity prediction in smallholder-dominated landscapes using MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index and Google Earth Engine: a case study in South Central Ethiopia
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent droughts and food insecurity underline the need for objective, timely, spatially explicit food aid prediction in Ethiopia. We developed a generic user-friendly method to detect greening of agricultural areas and derive predictions of agricultural production for potentially food-insecure areas. We used the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) from combined Terra/Aqua MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) images to generate EVI time series over multiple growing seasons. Maximum seasonal greening (EVImax), as proxy for biomass and expected crop yield, was related to rainfall variability and to indicate areas of risk for crop failure due to drought within the necessary reaction time for emergency aid. Four agroecological zones were covered from 2003 to 2019. Vegetation periods per 250m pixel were calculated back from EVImax. EVImax was validated against measured yields on large-scale farms. Interannual means and variability of EVImax served to assess production and drought risk. Yield predictions corresponded well with wheat production (r(2) approximately equal to 0.5 p <= 0.05). High temporal variability and low absolute EVI indicated drought-prone areas. EVI was positively correlated with rainfall data in cropped drought-prone areas (r(2) approximately equal to 0.4, p <= 0.05), but negatively in temporally water-logged highlands (r(2) approximately equal to 0.3, p <= 0.05). Our user-friendly approach on Google Earth Engine can accurately detect imminent food insecurity and facilitate timely interventions.

TI  - Max Weber and political theology of Friedrich Naumann
T2  - RUDN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY-VESTNIK ROSSIISKOGO UNIVERSITETA DRUZHBY NARODOV SERIYA SOTSIOLOGIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Weberian literature, it has been repeatedly noted that there is no serious theological interest in the most important provisions of the sociology of religion by Max Weber. This seems paradoxical given the religious-theological context for the development of Weber's intellectual project of the social-theoretical hermeneutics of Western modernity. In the first part of the article, the author reconstructs the family and friends' religious constellation which determined Weber's understanding of the existential significance of religious meanings for certain groups of the modern era. The author mentions Weber's close ties with a number of leading theologians of Germany in the late 19th - early 20th centuries, which influenced the heuristics of his writings. The second part of the article focuses on the multifaceted figure of Friedrich Naumann, a public intellectual, who was a Protestant pastor and a reactionary-conservative theologian and became a spiritual-political leader of the German left liberals. The author shows the initial ambivalence of the political-religious situation in the German Empire in the 1880s-1890s, in which Naumann tried to combine Christianity and socialism, and provides a brief overview of the young theologian and social activist's gradual turning into a prominent figure of the German journalism and politics. In the third part of the article, the author describes the meeting of two thinkers as fateful for both Weber and Naumann, and emphasizes a radical turn in the worldview of the famous religious theorist and practitioner, who under the powerful influence of Weber's personality and argumentation gave up both many previous ideas and pastor's office. In conclusion, the author identifies the paradigmatic nature of Nauman's ideological-political evolution as typical for a significant part of German intellectuals at the beginning of the 20th century, and considers Naumann's Hegelian acceptance of the modern nation-state as the highest value (following Weber) as a self-fulfilling diagnosis for the crisis modernity on the eve of the First World War catastrophe.

This document consist of four columns in which there are eight passages concerning religious offenses. According to the analysis of the mentioned religious offenses of the “the Crimes of Nabu-suma-iskun,” these crimes can be categorized the following four ways: the acts of ignoring divine will; the acts against divine hierarchies; offenses against religious taboo, especially concerning etiquette toward the gods; and theft of god’s possessions. These crimes were traditionally considered religious offenses in the concept of Ancient Near Eastern Religion. Thus, even if this document is written in the Seleucid period, the document reflected the Ancient Near Eastern religious worldview.

TI  - Using Consumer-Grade Physical Activity Trackers to Measure Frailty Transitions in Older Critical Care Survivors: Exploratory Observational Study
T2  - JMIR AGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Critical illness has been suggested as a sentinel event for frailty development in at-risk older adults. Frail critical illness survivors are affected by increased adverse health outcomes, but monitoring the recovery after intensive care unit (ICU) discharge is challenging. Clinicians and funders of health care systems envision an increased role of wearable devices in monitoring clinically relevant measures, as sensor technology is advancing rapidly. The use of wearable devices has also generated great interest among older patients, and they are the fastest growing group of consumer-grade wearable device users. Recent research studies indicate that consumer-grade wearable devices offer the possibility of measuring frailty.Objective: This study aims to examine the data collected from wearable devices for the progression of frailty among critical illness survivors.Methods: An observational study was conducted with 12 older survivors of critical illness from Kingston General Hospital in Canada. Frailty was measured using the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) at ICU admission, hospital discharge, and 4-week follow-up. A wearable device was worn between hospital discharge and 4-week follow-up. The wearable device collected data on step count, physical activity, sleep, and heart rate (HR). Patient assessments were reviewed, including the severity of illness, cognition level, delirium, activities of daily living, and comorbidity.Results: The CFS scores increased significantly following critical illness compared with the pre-ICU frailty level (P=.02; d=-0.53). Survivors who were frail over the 4-week follow-up period had significantly lower daily step counts than survivors who were not frail (P=.02; d=1.81). There was no difference in sleep and HR measures. Daily step count was strongly correlated with the CFS at 4-week follow-up (r=-0.72; P=.04). The average HR was strongly correlated with the CFS at hospital discharge (r=-0.72; P=.046). The HR SD was strongly correlated (r=0.78; P=.02) with the change in CFS from ICU admission to 4-week follow-up. No association was found between the CFS and sleep measures. The pattern of increasing step count over the 4-week follow-up period was correlated with worsening of frailty (r=.62; P=.03).Conclusions: This study demonstrated an association between frailty and data generated from a consumer-grade wearable device. Daily step count and HR showed a strong association with the frailty progression of the survivors of critical illness over time. Understanding this association could unlock a new avenue for clinicians to monitor and identify a vulnerable subset of the older adult population that might benefit from an early intervention.

TI  - Buddhist Relational View of Pratityasamutpada(緣起)                          as A Social Ecological Foundation

M3  - research-article
AB  - This study examines the possibility of the Buddhist relational view of pratityasamutpada(緣起), which is “interdependent co-arising” as an ideological basis of social ecology. One of the discussions on the reflection of modern civilization that began at the turn of the 19th century was ecology, which dealt with the world’s ecological issues. Among them, the scholar Murray Bookchin argued that the problems of natural ecology should be examined in relation to the problems of social ecology. He suggested that natural ecology stems from social ecology, and in particular, social hierarchy and dominance are the root causes of natural ecological problems. Therefore, the reorganization of the social structure that would do away with the domination- subjugation relationships is the solution to the problems, and for this, he advocated that dialectical reasoning is necessary.Bookchin’s argument has limitations in resolving all the fundamental relationships between nature and society. The reason is that his social ecology was unable to escape from the modern worldview based on the Western pragmatic ontology and dualistic relational view. Although the fundamental basis that produced the problem in the first place cannot be the basis for solving the problem, Bookchin overlooked this point in developing his argument. Therefore, the current study presented the Buddhist pratityasamutpada theory as a relational theory that can overcome the limitations of Bookchin’s social ecology. The Buddhist pratityasamutpada theory in which the essence and action of all phenomena fuse with each other and there are no obstacles can go beyond the limits of the relational theory of social ecology proposed by Bookchin.The relational view of Buddhism allows us to approach the relationship between nature and society from a relationship of pratityasamutpada rather than a pragmatic approach to life and existence, and to grasp the problem diagnosis from a unilinear and dichotomous relationship to a holistic relationship of pratityasamutpada. This point can be the foundation for a new social ecology that goes beyond Bookchin’s limitation, as the Buddhist pratityasamutpada theory can become the basis for analyzing the omnidirectional, multi-layered, and complex causes of social ecological problems.

AB  - The present study investigates the Korean reformist intellectuals’ (kaehwap’a) worldview (Weltanschauung) in the 1880s with respect to its continuity with Sirhak. Previous studies have already discussed the continuity between Sirhak and the reformists’ thought (kaehwa sasang), but their focus was limited to human connections and similarities between their ideas/policies. This approach has limits in elaborating the continuity, specifically with regard to the entire development of Confucian political thought in Choson. Moreover, a number of scholars have cast doubts on the continuity thesis. From the vantage point of worldview, we can say that Sirhak as a development of ‘political necessity’ ideas within Confucian political thought maintained practical, rational, empirical, and positivist worldviews as well as the traditional ethical worldview. This division of worldview within Sirhak, which reflected circumstances in Choson in the 18th century, continued even in the period of the waning of Shirhak during the first half of the 19th century. The reformists inherited the novel worldviews within Sirhak and strengthened them, while deciphering the world more realistically. So from the outlook of the development of political thought in Choson, the kaehwa sasang was in continuity with Sirhak.

AB  - This article focuses on global warming, which has been one of the hottest ethical issues of this era. The majority number of Christians tends to believe that Carbon Dioxide(CO2), especially manmade CO2 has been the main cause of this phenomenon. Thus, unless putting every effort in reducing CO2 in the atmosphere, humankind will inevitably have to face horrific catastrophes in the near future.However, one evangelical group in America, known as “Evangelical Right,” unlike this general understanding mentioned above, claims that this CO2 produced by humankind has not been scientifically proven to be the decisive factor in causing global warming. They further assert that spending huge amounts of money in abating CO2 in the atmosphere would rather be an inefficient, irrational, and unscientific countermeasure on the issue of global warming, and worst of all, not fit for biblical worldview. Instead, they con- tend that the money should be spent in solving the current issues that the third world nations and the poor around the world are facing such as water shortages and the improvement on living conditions. Moreover, these coun- termeasures, they believe, are biblically in compliance with environmental stewardship. This article has introduced the evangelical right’s perspective, along with their Christian worldview, and the countermeasures to global warming, ana- lyzed the strong and weak points of their assertions, found, as a result, their claims on the global warming issue positive.In conclusion, this article has shown and asserted that humankind need to more wisely respond to global warming issues with sound and balanced biblical perspectives.

AB  - In this paper, we have suggested the approach of satellite imagery acquisition and processing techniques to build Foundation Geospatial-intelligence (FG) in the defense field. FG indicates the basis of GEOINT which is the combination of the seven major geospatial information : aeronautical, maritime, topographic, elevation, human geography, geographic names and boundaries, and geodetic (NGA 2018). Previously, the FG in military has been considered as static maps which mean unchanged topography. Consequently, the FG used in the military did not often reflect the real topography of areas of operations since the past imagery was used, e.g., imagery outdated 1 to 3 years. To monitor and identify the enemy and their locations, information should be overlaid on the accurate FG. Therefore, the accurate and up-to-date FG is a critical factor for the success of military operations. In this paper, we monitored and estimated the inundated areas caused by the Xe Pian Xe Namnoy Dam Collapse (2018) in Laos using the open-source imagery, European Space Agency’s Sentinel-1A Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. We have successfully monitored and identified the inundated areas in the case of the flash flood event. This implies that even though SAR data provides information of medium-spatial resolution (∼ tens of meters), it could provide critical and important information owing to its relatively higher temporal resolution. For example, SAR satellites can identify the inundated areas of maneuvering routes, capture the boundary between land and sea caused by tides in the West Sea, and monitor the land use land cover classification in North Korea. In the use of this approach, we expect that more up-to-date and accurate data can be produced and proliferated for defense GEOINT and FG purposes.

TI  - A Study on Improvement of the Use and Quality Control for New GNSS RO Satellite Data in Korean Integrated Model
T2  - ATMOSPHERE-KOREA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examined the impact of assimilating the bending angle (BA) obtained via the global navigation satellite system radio occultation (GNSS RO) of the three new satellites (KOMPSAT-5, FY-3C, and FY-3D) on analyses and forecasts of a numerical weather prediction model. Numerical data assimilation experiments were performed using a three-dimensional variational data assimilation system in the Korean Integrated Model (KIM) at a 25-km horizontal resolution for August 2019. Three experiments were designed to select the height and quality control thresholds using the data. A comparison of the data with an analysis of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) integrated forecast system showed a clear positive impact of BA assimilation in the Southern Hemisphere tropospheric temperature and stratospheric wind compared with that without the assimilation of the three new satellites. The impact of new data in the upper atmosphere was compared with observations using the infrared atmospheric sounding interferometer (IASI). Overall, high volume GNSS RO data helps reduce the RMSE quantitatively in analytical and predictive fields. The analysis and forecasting performance of the upper temperature and wind were improved in the Southern and Northern Hemispheres.

AB  - The post-human era after humanism influences human lives scientifically and technologically. In this case, science and technology will be positioned at the center of human life, and furthermore, liberal arts education will also be affected by the scientific and technological worldview. Also, we have to answer the question of how living conditions changed will influence on the liberal arts and liberal arts education and what kind of changes liberal arts education should prepare for the mankind. In order to find out one example of such a change in this time, this paper examines two perspectives of the so-called posthuman era: transhumanism and posthumanism. Different perspectives can explain the meaning of liberal education and the latent danger of technology imprinted in human lives. These considerations will not separate post-humanity from humanities but re-examine the meaning of liberal arts, understanding what kind conditions changed in human lives.

AB  - This paper is an analysis of how Goethe’s “Young Werther’s Anguish” was cited in a radio script written by poet Shin Dong-yeop. Through this study, Shin Dong-yeop’s thought of love and Goethe’s thought of love can be revealed.When Shin Dong-yeop calls it “one-sided love”, the love goes beyond just love between men and women. It seems like simple love between a man and a woman, but it is love that burns the artistic soul (Opereta <Sakyamuni’s Stone Pagoda 석가탑>). It seems like a love between a woman who escaped from the palace and a young man who participated in the revolution, but the love is a love that dreams of a start(Epic <Geumgang River 금강>. Through the accidental meeting of male and female soldiers who fell behind in the modern war, Shin Dong-yeop also recreated the tragic love of overcoming the Cold War (A poetic drama <The Shade of Their Lips 그 잎술에 파인 그늘>). At the heart of it lies the “Jeon Kyung-in(전경인, 全耕人) love,” which loves the earth, poetry, and revolution.Beyond the polarized human being, he described humans who passed “one life that embodied all perception in one body as a whole” as the term “Jeon Kyung-in.” The unrequited love of the foreground will be the nature, revolution, and the total love loved by men and women beyond the polarized love. The total love is in line with Goethe’s “Young Werther’s anguish” and later with Goethe’s “Faust”.Shin Dong-yeop might have written a radio script about love, a superficial theme in “Young Werther’s anguish,” and a revolutionary individual trying to break down stereotypes at that time. In the work, Goethe wroted which the first is very noble and pire love, the second is revolutionary will, the third is the ecological community. Goethe’s love, revolutionary will, and ecological community are similar to the world of Shin Dong-yeop’s work.Goethe’s worldview and Shin Dong-yeop’s worldview are much alike. It is a meeting between two writers who have never met, two accidental and beautiful thinkers.

AB  - The coming extension of cellular technology to base-stations in low-earth orbit (LEO) requires a fresh look at terrestrial 3GPP channel models. Relative to such models, sky-to-ground cellular channels will exhibit less diffraction, deeper shadowing, larger Doppler shifts, and possibly far stronger cross-cell interference: consequences of high elevation angles and extreme "sectorization" of LEO satellite transmissions into partially-overlapping spot beams. To permit forecasting of expected signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), interference-to-noise ratio (INR), and probability of outage, we characterize the powers of desired and interference signals as received by ground users from such a LEO satellite. In particular, building on the Shadowed Rician (SR) channel model, we observe that co-cell and crosscell sky-to-ground signals travel along similar paths, whereas terrestrial co- and cross-cell signals travel along very different paths. We characterize SNR, signal-to-interference ratio (SIR), and INR using transmit beam profiles and linear relationships that we establish between certain SR random variables. These tools allow us to simplify certain density functions and moments, facilitating future analysis. Numerical results yield insight into the key question of whether emerging LEO systems should be viewed as interference- or noise-limited.

AB  - This paper revisits Lu Xun’s preface to “A Madman’s Diary” from the perspective of medical humanities. Written in classical Chinese, the preface is often regarded as a metaphor for the cannibalistic feudal society surrounding the madman. However, a detailed analysis of the three characters appearing in the preface debunks the common belief. First, the narrator of the preface, who identifies the madman’s symptom as persecution mania and intends to serve his diary as a subject for medical research, sees the madman’s madness from the perspective of psychiatry and psychoanalysis of the West which was introduced through Japan. Naming his diary “A Madman’s Diary,” the madman himself participates in the translingual and transcultural practice in which the traditional concept of kuang, by way of the Western discourse of psychiatry, is transformed into the modern concept of kuangren. Different from the two characters, the madman’s older brother seems to waver between the traditional and the modern. Nevertheless, he too is far from being a hard-line adherent of the traditional worldview. The world of the preface, which is much more modern than it appears, urges us to make a complete change in direction of our second, allegorical reading of the preface as well.

M3  - research-article
AB  - This paper revisits Lu Xun’s “Hard translation” from a critical view of literalism and post-colonialism. Lu Xun consistently adhered to literal translation for highly educated readers but it was not to represent the original text as it is. Rather, he chose “Hard translation” in order to reveal the ‘dead' native language of the translator and his subjectivity and worldview that fundamentally frustrate the ideal of literal translation. His “Hard translation” consists of two phases “cooking” and “chewing.” “Cooking” is to deconstruct the subjectivity and worldview of the self; “Chewing” is to deconstruct even a subjective image of the other so that the particles deconstructed by the “cooking” process can go forward to complete newness. Through this double deconstruction that is also the revolution of both self and other, Lu Xun’s “Hard translation” makes a breakthrough in the existing postcolonial discourse which seems to be in a stalemate.

AB  - Over twenty years of development, Internet literature in China is no longer limited to literature, but has evolved into a source IP that is adapted in the form of animations, movies, dramas and games. As a leader in Internet literature, ‘Yuewen Group(閱文集團)’ is rapidly changing its commercial model, and a series of events in 2020 have symbolized its coordination and transition.‘2019 Yuewen Wenchuang Wenxue Fengyun Shengdian(閱文原創文學風雲榜盛典)’, which aired at the beginning of 2020, showed that generating profits through copyright operations has become another growth engine for the Internet literature industry, away from the simple online subscription-dependent operation. The resignation of Yuewen Group‘s senior management and dispute over “new contract” which heated up online from late April to early May 2020, showed that the Internet literature subscription system is shifting from a paid model to a free model. This was a case in which Chinese Internet literature was put on the brake amid a shift from “need” to “market” and readers from “user” to “consumer”.The era of the first generation of Internet literature has passed and is now entering the era of ‘2.0’. It is necessary to continuously observe and track what the future of Chinese Internet literature will be like, and the content, value and evaluation of Chinese Internet literature will be changed accordingly.

AB  - Ecocentric worldview is considered as worldview that overcomes present environment problems and increases animal right. This study explores the formation of an ecocentric worldview for 4th-6th graders based on Peter Singer’s research that divides the development of morality into family-centered, species-centered, and ecocentric worldview. The subjects of this study were 77 4th graders, 84 5th graders, and 91 6th graders in Daegu Metropolitan City. The results of surveying students’ worldview based on the questionnaire developed by dividing into 6 questions are as follows. In most of the items in grades 4-6, the rate of formation of a species-centered worldview or a family-centered worldview was higher than that of an ecocentric worldview. However, in the case of 6th grade students was significantly higher than in other grades because they learned lesson on wolf restoration in the 5th grade science class. This may be seen as an effect of education, but since the ecocentric worldview did not appear high in other questions, it is reasonable to assume that 6th graders simply recited what they learned rather than forming a true ecocentric worldview. Therefore, there is a need for education that can help students to think, judge, and act on the basis of the ecocentric worldview consistently in any situation, rather than just memorizing the knowledge of the ecocentric worldview learned.

AB  - The goal of this paper is to examine the patterns and roles in which individual signification, that is, connotation, appear within the text. For this study, we looked at the status of denotation, myth, connotation in the category of signification. Based on Barthes’s research, we can see that denotation, myth, and connotation are an individual's selective signification. In other words, denotation and myth can be broadly included in the connotation. Connotation is the act of the subject who significations the world. It is not possible to define the nature of semantic action as only personal. These connotations are subject to double limitations. The fixedness of linguistic signs and the collective nature of myths violate the individuality of the connotations. Human thinking that gives meaning continues to seek new meanings while constantly referring to denotations and myths. If the semiosis, which combines signifier and signified, is an act of giving meaning to the world and interpreting it, then signification can be said to be a key mechanism to make the world symbolized and meaningful. Through this semantic action, the subject lives verbally, socially, and culturally as a member of a group. However, not all of the subjects of society live the way the group defined or intended. Therefore, every individual has an individual worldview through its connotations. We confirmed this through Kim Hoon's novel Heuksan.

M3  - research-article
AB  - After the collapse of the USSR, the revival of various religions, including Russian Orthodoxy, began, as well as the penetration into Russia of religious branches not so well known to Russians. Various peoples of Russia paid attention to their traditional religions based on animism, shamanism and other archaic forms of belief. The movement for the restoration of ancient religions was especially strong in ethnic territories, including the Republic of Mari El, whose titular people, the Mari, are known as “the last pagans of Europe”, “the only pagans of Europe”.Despite the process of Christianization and all sorts of oppression from the Russian government, there were many unbaptized Mari, and in the 19th century there was even a movement to return to their religion. In the late 1980s, with the beginning of Gorbachev's glasnost policy, this movement was revived, reflecting a high interest in national culture. Religiousness became an important ground for the Mari intelligentsia and nationalists who tried to revive "ethnicity." They tried to develop a traditional religion on the model of world religions, and introduce a hierarchical system of priests (karts), unification of various rituals and prayers spread over villages. In the early 2000s, this hot fire of ethnocentrism began to fade, but nevertheless, the Mari traditional religion became more and more popular among the urban population and young generation who had previously remained distant from it.Even today there are many adherents of the traditional religion, and many Mari are ‘double-believing’ Christians (the followers of dvoeverie). They visit their sacred grove and perform the traditional rituals, which reflect the Mari’s special worldview that have been passed down from generation to generation. The Mari traditional religion is not just paganism for the Mari, but an important part of their cultural heritage and mentality.

M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite magnetic observations reflect the magnetic properties of deep crust about the depth of Curie isotherm that is a boundary where the magnetic nature of the rocks is disappeared, showing long wavelength anomalies that are not easily detected in near-surface data from airborne and shipborne surveys. For this reason, they are important not only in the analyses on such as plate reconstruction of tectonic boundaries and deep crustal structures, but in the studies of geothermal distribution in Antarctic and Greenland crust, related to global warming issue. It is a conventional method to compute the spherical harmonic coefficients from global coverage of satellite magnetic observations but it should be noted that inclusion of erroneous data from the equator and the poles where magnetic observations are highly disturbed might mislead the global model of the coefficients. Otherwise, the reduced anomaly model can be obtained with less corruption by choosing the area of interest with proper data processing to the area.In this study, I produced a satellite crustal magnetic anomaly map over East Asia (20 degrees similar to 55 degrees N, 108 degrees similar to 150 degrees E) centered on Korean Peninsula, from CHAMP satellite magnetic measurements about mean altitude of 280 km during the last year of the mission, and compared with the one from global crustal magnetic model (MF7). Also, a comparison was made with long wavelength anomalies from EMAG2 model compiled from all near-surface data over the globe.

(이하는 아래 methodoloty로 이동) Methodology: Data on the ALOS, the average admission cost, and the out-of-pocket expenditure for patients under 15 years of age from 2015 to 2019 were obtained from the National Health Insurance database. Policy effects were measured by analyzing three dependent variables before and after policy: the average length of stay (ALOS), the average admission cost, and the out-of-pocket expenditure for patients under 15 years of age. The collected data were analyzed using the SAS package, and the analysis methods used in this study were the mean difference test and linear regression analysis.Findings: The study results reveal that, after the copayment reduction policy in the year 2017, the ALOS and the out-of-pocket expenditure were significantly decreased, but the average admission cost was significantly increased.Practical Implications: These results imply that the policy of copayment reduction for the patients under the age of 15 has contributed to mitigating the patients' financial burden with little concern about growing medical utilization.

AB  - This Study explores the symbolism of the Ten-tier Pagoda of Won’gaksa Temple, as part of the layout survey of the capital city Hanyang. First, the temple’s location, shown in the map centrally located initially as King Sejo’s memorial temple, is noted as an indication of the core earth worldview. Accordingly the ten-story pagoda signifies the number ten as all directions of the world thus to realize the three-dimensional space theory of Buddhism. Furthermore, the complexity of this architecture is noted with the theory of 33 horizontal heavens and 28 heavens in the three vertical realms, thus to realize the myth of central axis of universe centered in Mt. Sumi and Buddhist king of the gods.Historically the Great Bell of Wongaksa Temple (1465) had been neglected due to flourishing Neo-Confucianism until after the Japanese invasion (1592). King Seonjo moved the bell to the South Gate to replace the destroyed time-signal bell in the belfry (1594). King Gwanghae later moved the bell to the newly-built belfry, Jong’gak (1619). Since then it rang for 300 years announcing time twice a day in the morning and evening. At the end of Joseon, King Gojong reconstructed the belfry and renamed it Bosingak (1895). Thus the bell has since been called Bosingak Bell, and is now located in the National Museum of Korea. The last stroke of the bell was at New Year’s Eve 1985. The record thus shows the Great Bell kept breathing through history for 521 years (1465-1985), from King Sejo till modern Korea.The Great Time-Signal Bell gave off 33 and 28 strokes each day at morning break and at curfew from the beginning of the dynasty. This indicates that the myth of Buddhist cosmology of space and time theory had been vividly kept alive in the society. The propagation of Buddhist bell sound in the Confucian society however appears to be cultural irony. No new time-signal bell was molded in late joseon, while the two Great Bells of Wongaksa and Heungcheonsa were reused. It came to conclude that King Sejo’s pursuit of the Buddhist cosmology of time and space had been passed on guarding Joseon sky throughout the dynasty history.

TI  - The different versions' characteristics and status of ‘Geumsansachangeopyeonrok’ lines written in Chinese
TI  - 한문본 ‘金山寺創業宴錄’ 계열의 이본적 특성과 위상

AB  - This paper sheds light on the different versions' characteristics and status of the ‘Geumsansachangeopyeonrok’(金山寺創業宴錄) lines, which were often excluded during discussions on the stylistic characteristics and thematic consciousness of the <Geumhwasamongyurok>(金華寺夢遊錄). Although the number of ‘Geumsansachangeopyeonrok’ lines have been small, the difference between different versions is very large, and there are many narratives that have been expanded and extended compared to the ‘Geumhwasaamongyurok’(金華寺夢遊錄) and ‘Geumhwasagi’(金華寺記) lines, so it was considered to be a unique version. However, additional copies belonging to ‘Geumsansachangeopyeonrok’ lines were recently discovered to provide a foundation for studying the characteristics and orientation of the lines, and as it is confirmed that this version has been translated into Korean and actively distributed, a reconsideration of its different versions' status is requested. Thus, this study sought to examine 12 different versions, research the aspect of changes and the meanings, and finally reveal the status of this lines of the works.A summary of the different versions' properties and meanings of ‘Geumsansachangeopyeonrok’ written in Chinese is as follows. First, the role of the first king of Myeong(明太祖) in the work was greatly emphasized to emphasize that there was a God's will to the king of Myeong. As the contents such as the prophecy of the Jade Emperor, the confrontation with the first king of Won(元太祖), the tales of the founding of the first king of Myeong weren’t appeared in ‘Geumhwasa’ series, it was explicitly revealed that there was the God’s will in the first king of Myeong by newly adding in this line’s different versions. Second, the scene of the war against Orangkae(胡族) coalition led by The first king of Won has been expanded in various dimensions, which was not just an addition to the narrative for interest. As the military tales of the first king of Jin(秦始皇) and Han Mu-je(漢武帝) were appeared shortly in ‘Geumhwasa’ series, in most ‘Geumsansachangeopyeonrok’ lines through the conclusion that the first king of Myeong had done a complete and pleasant victory, the write emphasized that what the Orangkae's luck would be over and the consciousness of Chinese centered would be restored were the God’s will. Furthermore in ‘Geumsansachangeopyeonrok’ lines the writer actively expressed the writer's personal views on character reputation through a focus on special characters, which reflects the writer's individual sense of history and worldview.The ‘Geumsansachangeopyeonrok’ written in Chinese which has characteristics as above, was produced and distributed based on critical perception of the different versions of ‘Geumhwasa’ series. Compared to the ‘Geumhwasa’ series, the theory of the logic that there was God’s will in the first king of Myeong dynasty and the strength of the consciousness of Chinese centered were further strengthened appears to have affected the existence of Cheong(淸) and the changed consciousness of Chinese centered which had continued to change in various ways since Myeong(明) collapsed. ‘Geumsansachangeopyeonrok’ lines shows how readers read, accept the works of ‘Geumhwasa’ series and respond to the requests of the times. In addition, the status of ‘Geumsansachangeopyeonrok’ lines should be re-examined in that the active distribution of ‘Geumsansachangeopyeonrok’ written in Korean proves the popularity factor of <Geumhwasamongyurok> and the expansion of readers.

T2  - Journal of Breast Disease
M3  - research-article
AB  - Purpose: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a well-established staging procedure for patients with early breast cancer who have clinically negative axillary lymph node. However, no consensus exists about the number of sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) that should be removed based on radioactivity counts in breast cancer. We reviewed and analyzed cases in which more than one SLN was detected and there was at least one pathologically positive node. Methods: We retrospectively studied breast cancer patients who underwent lymphoscintigraphy with injection of a radioactive colloid and SLNB along with intraoperative determination of radioactive counts of lymph nodes using a gamma probe between 2006 and 2018. In total 326 patients with more than one radioactive SLN were enrolled in this study. Results: Fifty-four patients had nodal metastases, of whom 46 (85.2%) had metastases in the hottest lymph node. All metastatic SLNs were identified as one of the first three lymph nodes dissected. The lowest radioactive count of a positive SLN corresponded to 10% of that of the hottest node. Conclusion: We suggest that removal of the first three lymph nodes or nodes covered by the “10% rule” is sufficient in SLNB for patients with breast cancer.

AB  - Based on Choi Seung-hee's world of work, this study analyzed the characteristics of stage makeup, an important language that represents the artist's worldview and the mission of the times, and examined differences from everyday makeup. In Analysis I, research was conducted focusing on Japanese colonial era activities at home and abroad during the first half of his activities, and in Analysis II, his activities in North Korea after liberation.The world of Choi Seung-hee's work, which emphasized harmony of good, colorful colors, and static beauty through inheritance and transformation of tradition, is also shown in various ways through the characteristic aspects of stage makeup. The characteristic aspect of modern dance makeup, which is the main feature of the early stage, embraces much of the characteristic aspects of Japanese kabuki. However, Choi Seung-hee's world of work was reinterpreted based on the unique traditional dance of Asian countries, so the sculptural features were slightly different in stage makeup depending on the theme.Choi Seung-hee's fashion and makeup methods, which were admired as a trend symbol in Japan as well as Joseon, seem to have been influenced by Western makeup methods. However, for new women, makeup was an expression of one's willingness to reject patriarchal practices and function as an independent person and a member of society, so Choi Seung-hee's makeup was more than just a pursuit of beauty.

AB  - This paper aims to explain the novelization of modernity in Lee Kwang-su’s Mujeong (Heartlessness) through the concept of “semi-civilization” which justified Japanese colonialism. The identity of the modern enlightenment subject by Hyeong-sik is formed by a love triangle and it is similar to “semi-civilization,” based on the otherization of premodern “barbarism” and the pursuit of modern “civilization.” When the contradiction regarding the love triangle is solved, the falsehood of “semi-civilization” is revealed because Hyeong-sik needs the sacrifice of Yeong-chae and the obedience of Seon-hyeong in the Confucian patriarchy. In other words, “semi-civilization” rejects premodern “barbarism,” but in the same time it actually depends on premodern order. Due to this contradiction, Hyeong-sik cannot escape the guilt of being “heartless.” Yeong-chae also does not disappear with the traditional value system either. In the second half of the novel, attempts to conceal the contradiction regarding “semi-civilization” are made. In Samrangjin, Hyeong-sik otherizes flood victims as “barbarians” in order to emphasize the necessity of the modern enlightenment movement and strengthen the binary confrontation between premodernity and modernity. Therefore, Mujeong has literary significance because it reveals numerous contradictions and difficulties encountered in novelizing orientation towards modernity in colonial Chosun.

AB  - The Hwanggang Dam in North Korea is located upstream of the Imjin River which is a shared river on the border. It is known to have a reservoir capacity of 350 million cubic meters, which is about 1.5 times larger than Paldang Dam in South Korea, and releases a discharge largely for generating hydroelectric power and partly for transferring to the Yesung River basin. Due to the special national security issues in the region, data sharing between the south and north Koreas is not made, and flood damage risk due to heavy storm and unauthorized discharge is remained in the south Korean-side downstream region. However, It is still difficult to forecast the flood because the operating information of the Hwanggang Dam is not shared. In this study, a dam inflow and reservoir water level change modeling system was constructed using lumped hydrological model and reservoir operation algorithm based on AutoROM. Dam inflow was verified indirectly using remotely sensed water level derived by Sentinel-2 optical satellite and 10m high-resolution terrain map. Coefficient of determination (R2) derived as 0.76 for water level changing from Jan. 2017 to Aug. 2020.

AB  - This study examined the effectiveness of wind corridor construction by analyzing the thermal environment, cold air generation, ventilation, and geographical characteristics to improve urban thermal environment and establish the basis for specialized strategy in Changwon-si, Gyeongsangnam-do. Using spatial analysis and remote sensing techniques, surface temperature, land cover and land use, wind field, and slope were measured and through this, a wind corridor analysis model was constructed. As a result of the analysis as of 2020, Changwon-si generally has land cover characteristics that are advantageous for the generation of cold air, but the temperature in most urban areas is the highest, and the temperature in areas such as north Changwon area, Jinbukmyeon, Ung-dong, and Ungcheon-dong are relatively high. There was a typical trend of high average wind speed in mountain regions and low average wind speed in urban areas. Accordingly, the north Changwon area, the former Changwon downtown area, the Hogye-ri and Pyeongseong-ri areas, and the Changpo Bay area are derived as vulnerable areas to thermal environment, and various measures to reduce temperature and improve air quality that the inflow of cold air into the area considering the characteristics of each area and securing wind ventilation between the surrounding mountains, reservoirs, and park areas were proposed.

AB  - To proactively respond to changes in droughts, technologies are needed to properly diagnose and predict the magnitude of droughts. Drought monitoring using satellite data is essential when local hydrogeological information is not available. The characteristics of meteorological, agricultural, and hydrological droughts can be monitored with an accurate spatial resolution. In this study, a remote sensing-based integrated drought index was extracted from 849 sub-basins in Korea's five major river basins using multi-sensor collaborative approaches and multivariate dimensional reduction models that were calculated using monthly satellite data from 2001 to 2019. Droughts that occurred in 2001 and 2014, which are representative years of severe drought since the 2000s, were evaluated using the integrated drought index. The Bayesian principal component analysis (BPCA)-based integrated drought index proposed in this study was analyzed to reflect the timing, severity, and evolutionary pattern of meteorological, agricultural, and hydrological droughts, thereby enabling a comprehensive delivery of drought information.

M3  - research-article
AB  - You can see the black line decoration around the collar, sleeve, trimming, slitting, and belt of Korean and Chinese Po and Jeogori. During ancient times, the black line was used for everyone without distinction of gender or status in Korea and China, and later it remains as Confucian or royal court’s uniforms. This study aims to examine the appearance of the black lines in Korean and Chinese costumes, and to prepare academic basic data about detailed elements of Korean and Chinese traditional costumes through analyzing the shapes and meanings of the black lines.For this purpose, literature studies related to Korean and Chinese clothing, culture, philosophy, and religion were examined together with paintings, murals, and relics. In clothing, the line refers to the edge or hem of a garment, and the hem refers to a fabric that is the same as or different from the body fabric attached to the edge. For the East culture, the symbol of the color, black, has been passed down in relation to the sky, the universe, and the Tao. In Confucianism, it means the sky as the original concept of the universe, and in Taoism, it means the Tao, which means the morality or principle of all things. These kinds of black lines decorations symbolize the beginning and end of the connection between the universe and man, and the immaterial and material by wrapping it around all open edges of the garment, and symbolize the close relationship between human beings, who exist as matter, and the universe that exists as non-material. The decorations with the black lines were used as a line in harmony with the Buddhist concept of the relationship in the process of differentiation and development of the concept of black, which corresponds to the universe and sky of Confucianism, the principle of all creations in Taoism. Furthermore, the black line decorations remain as the royal robes and clothes that understand the close connection between the universe and human beings for dealing with heaven and earth, and they remain as the royal uniform for a practical ritual that contains the meaning of training for the unity of mind and body. The value of this study lies in providing basic data that intensively analyzes the formative elements of traditional clothing by examining the historical movement and symbolic meaning of black line decorations containing the shared ideas of the Korean-Chinese worldview.

TI  - TEC and Ionospheric Height Estimation by Means of Azimuth Subaperture Analysis in Quad-Polarimetric Spaceborne SAR Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The total electron content (TEC) is probably the most important single parameter to characterize the ionospheric state and its impact on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. Its accurate estimation is therefore essential when it comes to the correction and calibration of SAR data distorted by the ionosphere. In recent years, the estimation of Faraday rotation (FR), i.e., the rotation of the polarimetric plane of the transmitted and scattered EM pulses as they propagate through the ionosphere, has become a key element of TEC estimation. FR is proportional to TEC and to the line-of-sight (LOS) component of the geomagnetic field. The availability of quad-polarimetric SAR data allows the precise estimation of FR, and thus TEC. However, an accurate TEC estimation requires knowledge of the geomagnetic field that varies with height. In this sense, the knowledge of the ionospheric height becomes an important issue for a correct FR to TEC conversion. While the estimation performance of FR is well understood, our understanding of the ionospheric height estimation by means of SAR is yet not established. In this article, a new estimator that allows the simultaneous estimation of TEC and ionospheric height from FR measurement is proposed. It exploits the variation of the parallel-to-LOS component of the geomagnetic field across azimuth sublooks. The performance of the proposed estimator is demonstrated using ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 data. The achieved estimation accuracy, precision, and the prerequisite for an accurate estimation are discussed.

AB  - The Zeitgeist of self-determination, which started from the international move- ment for people with disabilities, has recently emphasized the right to self-determination even in bioethical topics. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to establish a correct view of humanity by illuminating the spirit of the era of self-determination that is universally spreading in the subject of bioethics today from a Christian point of view. After all, the starting point of a long debate about self-determination surrounding human bioethics is the difference in worldview. Modernism, an anthropocentric worldview, sees artificial death as a personal right and liberation for those who live a so-called 'meaningless life'. On the other hand, the Christian worldview starts from the belief that God is the essence of the universe based on the basic structure of creation, fall, and redemption, and sees that all life is precious and that God is the master of life. Therefore, it is considered that the hospice system needs to be socially revitalized to have spiritual hope based on the Christian worldview, to minimize psychological anxiety or physical pain about death, to protect life until the last minute, and to finish life as dignifiedly as possible.

M3  - research-article
AB  - several thousand years ago in the East asia, ki has been used as a concept to explain the change in all things, encompassing nature and society, matter and spirit. This thesis is a study to prepare a humanistic theoretical basis for the circulation and value establishment of poop in Science Walden's ‘feces Standard Money’ research project. In particular, this thesis discusses the value and meaning of poop, focusing on the philosophy of Hwadam Seo Gyeong-deok. The first thought that the ‘feces Standard Money’ project can be obtained from the Ki philosophy is cyclical thinking. In particular, Zhuang-tzu, Jang-jae, and Seo Hwa-dam explained the change of all things as gathered and scattered, all beings could not escape from the great cycle. Second, the point of preview of Ki philosophy is the perspective of equality in all things. By relativizing everything, Zhuang-tzu drew on the idea that all things are equal. Jang-jae also developed the idea that all things are equal in that all things are made of qi and the cycle repeats the cycle through the extraction of qi. And Seo Kyung-duk expanded such thinking and moved on to practice in reality. Third, Ki philosophy enables a change in the perception that poop is dirty, and based on this, draws out the unity of all things. The idea of ​​Zhuang-tzu and Jang-jae that all things are one, and the idea that the order of Qi is reduced to the order of numbers and the order of numbers is reduced to the order of sound, and is the story of Seo Kyung-deok, who dreamed of a world of dialogue and harmony in harmony with nature. All thoughts make such a transformation of perception possible. If the ‘feces Standard Money’ project aims to solve problems such as income inequality, human alienation, generational conflict, and educational gap according to grades and degrees in modern society, then based on this thinking, the separation of human to human and human to nature is It should be possible to change to a worldview of sympathy and communication, which is not a struggle, but a feeling of empathy and communication.

AB  - This paper argues that Christian counseling is a Christian habitus which embodies biblical teloes: God’s glory, love, and covenant relationships. An individual’s worldview is often far from a lived experience or a behavior. In this reality, James K.A. Smith points out limitations of an intellectualistic model of worldview and emphasizes “habitus as practical sense.” Habitus is an unconscious tendency, a habitual practice, or an environment embodied in telos. Theo-drama does not ideologically present a redemptive story of creation, fall, redemption, and consummation, but invites all mankind to live in the salvation drama and to live out biblical teloes in it. The drama itself is the ultimate Christian habitus, which forms God’s people and con- structs God’s kingdom. In this context, Christian counseling functions as a kind of Christian habitus that helps people consciously and unconsciously experience biblical teloes and create a teleological way of life. A Christian counselor in this sense plays an important role to be Christlike embodying God’s glory, love, and covenant.

AB  - Natural jurisprudence was one of the most important intellectual traditions, along with republicanism, that weighed upon early modern European thought. If Republicans were concerned with popular Libertas and the health of states, the self-imposed task of natural lawyers was to find out what, in God’s or Reason’s eyes, was right and what was wrong. To live freely in a dynamic society was the goal of republican thought, whereas the priority of natural jurisprudence was to lead a peaceful life in a just society ruled by law. To understand the latter tradition in historical terms, one must grasp its Christian roots and moral worldview. Beyond the post-Enlightenment and French revolutionary concepts of natural rights and democracy appropriated by reformers, this article delineates the basic tenets of natural law from a historical perspective, dealing with its most crucial components such as duties and rights, human nature, social design, and political thought.

AB  - This study insists that hermeneutics should be actively used for translation, focusing on Russian-Korean translation. Gadamer argued that in the interpretation of texts, an individual's understanding formed in the traditional sphere of influence works.  Uulike the theological hermeneutics of previous hermeneutics researchers, Gadamer in his hermeneutics argues that only acquiring related to experience and existence forms the world of true hermeneutics. He says that the text must be approached from a hermeneutical point of view, and what is simply being written is an isolated thing. In other words, a text can be reproduced through interpreters. In this study, it is argued that the translation of the hermeneutic dimension is divided into Partial reprocessing and Complete reprocessing. It means both Partial and Complete  reprocessing should be reprocessed in accordance with TL's world view. However, Partial reprocessing means that the expression of ST is reflected as much as possible, but is derived as an expression suitable for TL, and Complete reprocessing means that the meaning represented by the ST expression is accepted, but completely replaced with an expression suitable for TL. However, under the premise of hermeneutic translation tailored to the worldview of TL users, the meaning of ST should not be distorted. Hermeneutic translation is for the purpose of clearly grasping and conveying the implications of ST and the intention of the author, but does not create a new meaning in TT.

AB  - Purpose: This study was conducted to investigate alloys spectrophotometrically including yttrium of nickel-chromium (Ni-Cr) alloys, which are used as substitutes for the regulation of beryllium and provide helpful improvements in Ni-Cr alloys.Methods: Four groups of specimens (ZN, ZY, SN and EM) were prepared for analysis. Color parameters were measured with a spectrophotometer, and color difference (ΔE*) was cal-culated. The t-test and one-way analysis of variance test were used to determine significant difference, and the Tukey test was used to identify where the differences were. To measure the spectroscopic reflectivity, the spectroscopic reflectance was measured and converted into CIE L*, a*, b* color system.Results: The ΔE* value of each metal ceramic group after opaque firing of Ni-Cr alloy with and without yttrium was <2, and the total group color difference (ΔE*) was below 1 in the dentin ceramic all experimental group. However, the a* and b* values of the metal ceramic groups were higher than that in the lithium disilicate all ceramic group, and the chroma was higher than the natural tooth. The brightness of all experimental groups was similar to that of the shade guide sample.Conclusion: Yttrium added to Ni-Cr alloys showed similar CIE L*, a*, b* values to Ni-Cr al-loys that did not contain yttrium, indicating that yttrium had no effect on color in metallic ceramic systems.

TI  - 존 롤즈의 정의론과 성경적 정의관
T2  - Studies in Philosophy East-West
T2  - 동서철학연구
M3  - research-article
AB  - This paper aims to defend that the biblical worldview can achieve an overlapping consensus over two principles of justice of John Rawls. Rawls' conception of justice boils down to the ‘equal liberty’ principle, the principle of fair opportunity and the difference principle. As for the ‘equal liberty’ principle, I will show that the equal distribution of basic liberties, which Rawls argues, is essential for the freedom of faith and the leading of a Bible-based life plan. In light of the biblical worldview of “Creation-Corruption-Salvation,” human beings are equal, so Christians will have no choice but to agree on the principle of fair opportunity. And the preferential care for the socially disadvantaged in laws of Moses or the infinitesimal in the teachings of Jesus justifies Rawls' difference principle that stresses the priority of the least advantaged. Above all, the moral arbitrariness argument of natural assets, which is the basis of the difference principle, is not exactly overlaps with the Bible's teachings of considering talent as a gift of God, but also is in line with Christian ‘steward ethics’. In this sense, Rawls' theory of justice can be said to be the secularization of the biblical conception of justice.

T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - While broad consensus exists that temperatures are increasing, there is uncertainty surrounding the direction of change manifested in actual evapotranspiration (ET) worldwide. This study assessed trends in ET across the land surface using 11 widely used global datasets for a 32-yr study period. To demonstrate the agreement and disagreement of trends, the spatial distribution, concurrence, correlation, and similitude were estimated. The results showed that while the global average trend in ET is -0.072mm month(-1) yr(-1), the trends from individual datasets show a wide range of differences in magnitudes and directions. The considerable differences in the trends in each dataset were found to be weakly correlated with each other and highly divergent in their distribution and direction. No single dataset was sufficiently similar to another to offer a fair representation of trends. In a dynamic trend analysis using a 10-yr moving window over the study period, high concurrence in the significant trends throughout the datasets was found to be rare for each time period. In general, the global data concurrence became negative by 1997 but rebounded to positive toward the end of the study period. In terms of spatial tendency, some regions were more prone to change the direction of their significant trends within the study period. This result shows a high inconsistency in the location and direction of significant ET trends, implying that selection of an ET dataset should consider its spatiotemporal uncertainty before use for any water balance study aiming to infer hydrological change over time.

AB  - Acoma Pueblo poet Simon J. Ortiz depicts in his poetry the diverse flora, fauna, and inanimate entities of the native land as vivid and vibrant beings. This should be understood in terms of the traditional values of survival, coexistence, and reciprocity. Particularly, reciprocity is a concept that refers to the mutually respectful, complementary, and mutually equal relationship between humans and non-humans. Encompassing and including all living and non-living things, the holistic approach of Indigenous epistemology constitutes, develops, and sustains Indigenous ecology through oral traditions. In this context, this article examines the early poems of Simon J. Ortiz, which were published from the mid-1970s to early 1980s in collections such as Naked in the Wind, Going for the Rain, and A Good Journey. The article particularly focuses on how Ortiz embodies the relationship between human and non-human living or non-living things, and between humans and nature or the land. It identifies the specific instances where Ortiz’s poetic expressions connect with the Indigenous concept of community and ecology, especially those of Pueblos. It thus argues that, by restoring and modernizing the Indigenous view of the ecological or natural community, Ortiz’s ecology clearly distinguishes itself from that of other Western and mainstream White ecological poets, and resists the anthropocentric discourse of the West.

AB  - The ‘attitude’ category in literary education has not yet been stabilized, as it is difficult to explicitly present the contents and methods for attitude education. In order to solve this problem, this study examined the high school students' perceptions on the value of literature, so as to examine the questions and confusions that learners have about literature.The results of the survey showed that high school students had a conflict of opinion about the doctrinal value and comfort value of literature, the function of cultural homogeneity and critical reflection on heterogeneous culture, and the utility of contemporary and universal values. As these questions of learners are closely related to the process of forming their own values for human and the world, it is desirable to help the students evaluate literary texts in multifaceted ways, contemplate on the basis of their evaluation, and share the basis with fellow learners, so that they can check and reflect on their own human and world views.

AB  - Agricultural and forestry satellite for agriculture and forestry monitoring are scheduled to be launched in the Republic of Korea in 2025. The Agricultural and Forestry Satellite CAS500(Compact Advanced Satellite 500)-4 is a multi-spectral satellite with a spatial resolution of 5 m and with a revisit cycle of 3 days. Prior to launch, this study intends to develop a NDVI composite technique to minimize the effect of clouds. A high-altitude Korean cabbage field (>67ha), which has a relatively large area as a single crop field in Korea, was selected as the study area. Sentinel-2A/B (10m spatial resolution, 5-day revisit cycle) acquired from May 2019 to July 2021 for the study area was used. For monthly compositing, the MaxNDVI technique, which is a representative composite technique, and the recently suggested score-based composite technique were applied and compared. The score-based method calculates the fitness score for compositing for each pixel by assigning various factors and weights to minimize the effect of clouds during NDVI composite and maximize temporal representativeness. Therefore, the reflectance of the pixel with the highest score is used for compositing. The reflectance composite image produced in this way is converted to NDVI. Although both composite techniques minimize the effect of clouds, both results show that MaxNDVI shows high NDVI at the end of the month at the time of early growth after sowing, whereas the score based technique shows NDVI at the middle of the month. Compared to the MODIS composite data from 2019 to 2021, the monthly composite data of Sentinel-2 NDVI showed various growth patterns by site in more detail.

T2  - Muslim-Christian Encounter
M3  - research-article
AB  - This study argues that oral transmission must be utilized to evangelize Kyrgyz Muslims and suggests directions that will contribute to the development of techniques that are appropriate for contextualization. Most Muslims have been living in oral transmission based cultures, and deftly learn and communicate through oral transmission. Therefore, Quran and Hadith, the central texts for their faith, have also been taught and learned through this technique. In contemporary culture, such techniques are carried on not only to continue religious traditions. The historical experiences of Muslims inform how preservation of history through memory can shape worldview and tie their communities.Oral transmission holds a particular significance to Kyrgyz Muslims. The Epic of Manas is a central poem to their religious nationalistic identity, formulating their worldview and identities. As the heroes that appear in the epic are all strong believers in Islam and Shamanism, Kyrgyz consider Folk Islam, the intermix of Shamanism and Islam, to be essential to Kyrgyz Islam. In order to share the gospel with people in oral transmission cultures, we must identify myths, lyrics, and music that form national identity, and the Epic of Mana is exemplary for Kyrgyz cultural identity.A Church in Kyrgyzstan utilizes oral transmission of the Epic of Manas as a tool to disciple people. This unique case, which is not observed in any other place in Central Asia, suggests a potential in developing an oral transmission technique that is appropriate for Kyrgyz. Contrived independently by a local Church leader, such a method has been proven to be fruitful in disciple training. When using this technique, believers who recite the Bible are experiencing how the Gospel follows wherever they go, perpetually reminding them to live by God’s will. In addition, when interacting with others, having memorized scriptures in their minds adds confidence in sharing the gospel. While reciting Bible verses through replicating the oral transmission of the Epic of Manas is an excellent contextualized approach for Kyrgyzstan, additional reinforcements can be made to optimize this method. Directly reciting verses does not fully utilize the forte of dictative narratives. Even though adding cadence allows the written text to be transmitted orally, simple recitation lacks narrative and still possesses dominantly literary qualities. The reason why the Epic of Manas holds cultural significance not solely due to the way it is transmitted; rather, it is due to the grandiosity of its narrative that is transmitted orally. The Bible has a meta-narrative that progresses from creation-corruption-redemption-restoration. Numerous stories of each person converge with this meta-narrative.As a result, arranging Biblical stories as chronology can redress Islamic narratives that are innate in Kyrgyz people and transform their lives through accepting Jesus Christ. Therefore, it is imperative for local leaders and missionaries to contrive strategic arrangements of Biblical stories that fuse with folk tunes and meters.

AB  - With the recent development of satellite sensor technology, high-spatial-resolution imagery of various spectral wavelength bands have become possible. Worldview-3 satellite sensor provides panchromatic images with high-spatial-resolution and VNIR (Visible Near InfraRed) and SWIR (ShortWave InfraRed) bands with low-spatial-resolution, so it can be used in various fields such as defense, environment, and surveying. In this study, mineral detection was performed using Worldview-3 satellite imagery. In order to effectively utilize the VNIR and SWIR bands of the Worldview-3 satellite image, the sharpening technique was applied to the spatial resolution of the panchromatic image. To confirm the utility of SWIR bands for mineral detection, mineral detection using only VNIR bands was performed and comparatively evaluated. As the mineral detection technique, SAM (Spectral Angle Mapper), a representative similarity technique, was applied, and the pixels detected as minerals were selected by applying an empirical threshold to the analysis result. Quantitative evaluation was performed using reference data on the results of similarity analysis to evaluate the accuracy of mineral detection. As a result of the accuracy evaluation, the detection rate and false detection rate of mineral detecting using SWIR bands were calculated to be 0.882 and 0.011, respectively, and the results using only VNIR bands were 0.891 and 0.037, respectively. It was found that the detection rate when the SWIR bands were additionally used was lower than that when only the VNIR bands were used. However, it was found that the false detection rate was significantly reduced, and through this, it was possible to confirm the applicability of SWIR bands in mineral detection.

This study evaluated the occurrence and diffusion patterns of pollutants in the Musan mine, the largest iron mine in North Korea. Based on the time-series analysis of the Landsat images, continuous mining activities were confirmed. In addition, mining areas were classified using Sentinel-2 images. Areas where pollutants were deposited by the typhoon were identified through InSAR analysis using Sentinel-1 images. As a result of the GIS-based flow analysis, it was confirmed that pollutants can diffuse in four directions and flow into nearby rivers and lower areas. Therefore, in order to prevent the spread of pollutants and pollution of rivers, it is necessary to install facilities in vulnerable areas.

AB  - In the face of the 4th Industrial Revolution and the Information Age, communication in the virtual space is increasing while human relations in the real world are becoming more and more difficult. Accelerating Christians’ biblical recovery of relationship interaction suffering from relationship difficulties has become an essential task for their integrated healing and maturity. Therefore, this study tries to develop and propose a relational interaction model to help Christians undergo psycho-spiritual integration healing and maturity. We first explored the aspects of relational interaction shown by the psychological theories of Freud and other scholars, and extracted ‘Aggression’, ‘Dependency’, and ‘Evasion’, as three basic element that activate relational interaction. We examined the overall structure and dynamics of Christian interactions and develops the model of relationship interaction on the frame of reference of the Christian worldview of creation, fall, and redemption, for the purpose of helping Christians who were suffering from erroneous relationship interactions to recover their life of the channel of God’s true love. To this end, the three-fold relational interaction model(ADE), reflecting three basic elements of the relationship interaction of ‘Aggression’, ‘Dependency’, and ‘Evasion’ on the basis of the structure of relation with ‘IGod’, ‘I-Other’, and ‘I-I’, was proposed. This model can be used to help Christians who are struggling with relationships with others to gain insight into themselves and to recover their life of a channel of God’s true love.

In this study, strategic factors to be considered from the perspective of a Christian worldview from the standpoint of a biblical company that provides services using metaverse technology were derived using a Delphi analysis method targeting 15 academics, research institutes, and industry experts. The first questionnaire was conducted through an open FGI (Focus Grouping Interview) through four metaverse classifications by the technology research group ASF: Virtual worlds, Augmented Reality, Life-Logging, and Mirror Worlds, strength and opportunity factors, weaknesses and risk factors, and important consideration factors of each technical classification were collected, and the 2nd questionnaire collected the importance of factors derived from the 1st questionnaire from experts. Thus, an agreed conclusion was drawn. This study presents Christian academic and practical implications by understanding the metaverse from the perspective of a Christian worldview and deriving a biblical guide for companies that provide metaverse services.

AB  - The existence of Christian alternative schools is threatened by antipathy to Christianity, a decrease in the school-age population, and an increase in household debt. Moreover, the first-generation leaders of the schools, which have been established and operated since the mid-2000s, are now retiring. In order for the schools to survive while maintaining their identity as Christian schools, it is necessary to identify the legacy left by the first-generation leaders of the schools and pass it on to the next-generation leaders of the schools. Therefore, this study first tried to confirm the legacy the first-generation leaders left through interviews with the leaders who served as the principals of Christian alternative schools for more than 10 years. Second, this study checked what tasks the next-generation leaders of the schools should undertake.Through interviews with the first-generation leaders, it was confirmed that they had a clear educational philosophy and purpose in accord with Christian worldview. It was also found that they put a lot of effort into making sure that all members of the Christian Alternative School shared that philosophy and purpose. In the Christian alternative schools that were the subjects of this study, teachers and students lived together in dormitories. Living together, the teachers were teaching their students to live in harmony with the biblical worldview.The next-generation leaders are the people who should defend the educational philosophy and purpose pursued by the school. Therefore, the next-generation leaders seemed more likely to come from among the members of the school who had already learned what the school was pursuing. They are given the responsibility to protect the educational philosophy and vision they had held so far, and to enable the students of the school to excel not only in faith and character, but also in academic excellence.

AB  - As the utility of an optical satellite image with a high spatial resolution (i.e., fine-scale) has been emphasized, recently, various studies of the land surface monitoring using those have been widely carried out. However, the usefulness of fine-scale satellite images is limited because those are acquired at a low temporal resolution. To compensate for this limitation, the spatiotemporal data fusion can be applied to generate a synthetic image with a high spatio-temporal resolution by fusing multiple satellite images with different spatial and temporal resolutions. Since the spatio-temporal data fusion models have been developed for mid or low spatial resolution satellite images in the previous studies, it is necessary to evaluate the applicability of the developed models to the satellite images with a high spatial resolution.For this, this study evaluated the applicability of the developed spatio-temporal fusion models for KOMPSAT-3A and Sentinel-2 images. Here, an Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Fusion Model (ESTARFM) and Spatial Time-series Geostatistical Deconvolution/Fusion Model (STGDFM), which use the different information for prediction, were applied. As a result of this study, it was found that the prediction performance of STGDFM, which combines temporally continuous reflectance values, was better than that of ESTARFM. Particularly, the prediction performance of STGDFM was significantly improved when it is difficult to simultaneously acquire KOMPSAT and Sentinel-2 images at a same date due to the low temporal resolution of KOMPSAT images. From the results of this study, it was confirmed that STGDFM, which has relatively better prediction performance by combining continuous temporal information, can compensate for the limitation to the low revisit time of fine-scale satellite images.

AB  - Ground subsidence is a major engineering problem in urban areas where population growth and rapid urban development are taking place. Central Florida is also known as the karst area with its unique hydrogeological setting, posing potential ground instability such as sinkhole-induced subsidence and ground settlement due to urban construction and development. Monitoring of ground subsidence can help not only mitigate its negative impacts in many engineering ways but also enhance the related risk management. With recent advances in remote sensing technology, Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) can be a promising tool to measure and monitor ground subsidence. The goal of this study is to explore the feasibility of InSAR for the ground subsidence assessment. Particularly, we investigated the spatial distribution of ground subsidence in the Orlando metropolitan area and its near vicinities over two different times. For this, the Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) method was applied to develop a ground subsidence map between May 8, 2018, and May 9, 2020, using the European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel-1 SAR images. The results show that the study area is clearly showing a cumulative ground movement trend of varying degrees, with -22.9 cm (subsidence) and +2.0 cm (uplift), over the past two years. It also shows that the magnitude of ground subsidence in this area was largely related to land use and development activities. This study demonstrates that the multitemporal InSAR processing technique is capable of high-precision monitoring of ground subsidence in urban areas for engineering purposes.

AB  - This study investigates how Gwoneop Shinmun and Dehanin Jeonggyobo inherited and transformed the nationalism in the 1900s. The nationalism of the Korean community was apparently influenced by 1900s' nationalism in the sense of individuals being interpellated as atoms that served the interests of the nation-state. However, in opposition to theory for Fostering Capacity, which rapidly lost its purchase on peopele's thinking after the loss of Korean sovereignty, there was a new demand for a nationalistic framework, and in response, the press prompted 'mentalistic' path through which people could dream of achieving independence without sufficient 'preparation'. The thought and sensibility that focused on the potential of 'mind' instead of 'capability' were largely revealed through three discourses: hero discourse, personality evolution theory, and sympathy discourse. These discourses connoted anti-(or quasi-)evolutionary thinking which doubted the hierarchies of civilization and the law of the jungle, and sought to formulate a new and alternative worldview. Until now, Gwoneop and Jeonggyobo have been described as anti-Japanese outlets which expressed a strong national consciousness, but the various aspects of their articles have received little attention. This study is different from others in that it analyzed the the reason why the committed independence movement was able to sustain itself despite the fall of the Korean Empire. In addition, it helps to lay the groundwork for the Kareisky culture and literature studies which deal with the 'existence' of the Koreans, given that it explored fissures in national consciousness that cannot be assimilated into a concept of nationalism.

M3  - research-article
AB  - In modern Korea, Buddhist scholars have used traditional methods to interpret Buddhism, with some also making use of modern methods. Kim Gyeongju studied in Japan, and, at that time, wrote “The Contents of the Huayan Philosophy” (hwa-eomcheolhag-ui naeyong). He interpreted the thought of Huayan using modern methods. Later, he published his article in a Buddhist magazine in Korea. He learned the Buddhist philosophy he used while studying in Japan, which was established by Buddhist scholars during the Meiji period in Japan. Meiji Buddhist philosophy was, basically, based on Western philosophy.Kim Gyongju also recognized Western philosophy as a universal philosophy and interpreted the thought of Huayan based on this concept. In particular, he defined the Huayan Philosophy as idealism. He also defined Buddhism, as a whole, as a philosophy of the mind. He further regarded the Huayan Philosophy as the perfect form of idealism. In this extension, he identified the system of classification of the Five Teachings, as proposed by the Fazang (法藏), as the stage of development of idealism, re-establishing the doctrines of various Buddhist denominations using Western philosophical methods.He also asserts that the philosophy of Huayan is the source of the Phenomenal Reality. This claim is actually the view of the Buddhist philosophers of the Meiji – thus, he actively agreed with their views. In particular, He understood “the ontology of the Phenomenal Reality” using the arising of the tathagata’s nature (xingqi 性起) theory, which is also the worldview promoted by Huyan philosophy.In “The Contents of the Huayan Philosophy”, he reinterpreted the thoughts of Huayan, which was a part of traditional thought, as a so-called “modern universal philosophy”. In this respect, this article carries a modern meaning. Furthermore, in view of the subsequent development of Buddhist studies, it can be said that, through this article, he presented a new interpretation framework for the thought of Huayan. From the perspective of Korean Buddhist studies, this article can be said to signal a new era.

M3  - research-article
AB  - In this paper I explain why Brazilian indigenous land rights are being violated by the government's large-scale development projects, by industrial farming, and by mining development. I also analyze why indigenous land rights are not historically and legally protected in Brazil. For indigenous peoples, the land is a geographic space of their own lives, a cultural space for the preservation of tribal culture, and a space for recognition that secures an identity based on their own values ​​and worldview. It can be said that the indigenous peoples are the land. The problems related to indigenous land rights are summarized by the following four issues. First, the land rights law, which does not recognize the natural rights of indigenous peoples, is a form of implicit colonialism in that it does not take into account the past lives or sacrifices of indigenous peoples. Second, indigenous peoples can live in, but cannot own indigenous lands. This is because the owner of the indigenous lands is the federal government. Third, since the administrative procedure for designating a protected area for indigenous peoples has not been carried out within five years as specified in the Constitution, hence, it is not binding and the procedure itself imposes bureaucratic barriers which make it difficult for indigenous peoples to protect their rights. Fourth, there is a problem of equity with other minority groups. In the case of the escaped slave community known as the “Quilombo,” common property rights are recognized. However, indigenous peoples and non-indigenous traditional peoples are not recognized as exercising common property rights. Therefore, indigenous lands are occupied by the government's development policy, corporate agriculture and mine development, and indigenous people's right to live is also seriously infringed.

AB  - This study reviewed the Myeongjbuoweolbing series through a comparative analysis. Based on aspects of personality appearance and ranking. It was found that the narrative proposed in Myeongjuboweolbing extended to YunHaJeongSammunchirok, however. Eomsihyomuncheongrok revealed a new narrative based on that of YunHaJeongSammunchirok. The Myeongjuboweolbing series is based on the worldview of the Myeongjuboweolbing series and has diversity. Through its various narratives, the Myeongjuboweolbing series created a vast fictional inspired by the worldview of Yunhyeon. However, the portrayal of a single worldview does not imply homogeneity of narratives or consistency of narrative consciousness. Nevertheless, the popularity of the Myeongju- boweolbing series indicates that readers found the various stories centered on different worldviews more interesting than the subject or completeness of the work.

AB  - This study started by questioning the background of the appearance of the three works entitled , , . In the light of the artist"s longevity, three works, which are thought to be from the early 17th century to the beginning of the 19th century, are different from those of the beggars in the Chosun Dynasty.Through the annals of the Joseon Dynasty, the reason people became beggars was different from the past. In other words, it was at the limit of the late Joseon society. There were many beggars because of two wars, a flawed poverty reduction system of the state, and capitalism. The beggar was no longer located on a personal level but in a social context. Also, the change in the social status of these beggars was reflected in the "Geolinjeon" in the late Joseon period.I examined the shape of the beggar by categorizing it with the heroine’s life, the unusual behavior, the attitude toward life, and the back story. All four features were derived. The characteristics are as follows. First, the beggar"s past cannot be known. Second, beggars have a special face and special talents. Third, the way a beggar lives is distinct. Fourth, beggars disappear from the work after the story ends.Beggars had a different desire than ordinary people. This means that the worldview itself can be different. The novelty of the protagonists is that they created new human relationships. In the work, beggars meet people outside of profit relations. In the end, the author"s consciousness in the late Joseon period originated from the criticism of the existing and the spirit of inquiry into life.

AB  - In the early 21st century, the global COVID-19 pandemic, which has arisen during the development of the technological science of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, has been a great challenge in all fields including politics, economy, industry, education and religion in Korean society. To prevent the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic, the Korean government announced ‘social distancing guidelines,’ focused on the 'prohibition of three conditions'(crowd, closeness, airtight) for safety reasons. These quarantine guidelines made it more difficult for Korean churches and Sunday schools to operate. In general, looking at the statistical data of the major denominations of the Korean Church in the second half of the 20th century, shows that the Church has entered a period of stagnant or declining growth. Data also show that the number of students attending Sunday School is decreasing. The researcher identified four causes of the crisis faced by the Korean church and Korean Sunday school entering the 21st century. These trends are influenced by the tendencies of postmodernism, the deconstruction of modern universalism, the certainty and objectivity of knowledge, and the grand narrative and worldview of diffusion. Moreover, it is a phenomenon in which the young population decreases in contrast to the increasing elderly population in the age of population cliff in Korean society. Sunday Schools are also facing a crisis, as the youth population, who will become the future heroes of the Korean church, is declining. Finally, constraints of Church and Sunday school education activities are due to COVID-19 Pandemic. As analysis shows the loss of the Church's educational vision and a decrease in the passion for education. Accordingly, the researcher suggests four new strategies for the next generation of Korean Sunday schools, whose ranges from 200 members or less; this range covers the majority of Sunday School program run by churches in Korea. First, in the age of postmodernism, a time of uncertainty and relativism, Christian Societies requires teachers who are certain of absolute Christian truth and faith. Second, in an era of declining population cliffs for younger generations, a shift to a home-friendly Sunday school paradigm is needed. Third, during the COVID-19 pandemic, educational activities must appropriately utilize face-to-face and non-face-to-face communication. Finally, even in difficult times, Korean Sunday school should nevertheless remember the Lord's great commandment(Matthew 28:18-20) and restore the vision and passion of education to announce and teach the gospel. The researcher hopes that this study will provide small, positive steps in rebuilding Korean Sunday school educational activities for future generations in difficult times.

AB  - Currently, the creation and development of technology for determining forest taxation characteristics based on satellite data is actual. Numerous studies are aimed at determining the key parameters of the forest canopy height and biomass. Effective results are obtained by methods of radar interferometry. In this article, the forest height is determined based on the difference between the interferometric phases of the X and L-bands. In this case, radar waves of the centimeter and decimeter ranges are reflected from the upper and lower boundaries of the forest environment, respectively. Interferometric data from TerraSAR-TanDEM-X and ALOS PALSAR (wavelengths 3 and 23 cm) were used. The study site is a mountainous area with elevation differences up to 300 m, slopes up to 10-15 degrees. The territory is covered with forest, mainly pine, with small inclusions of birch and aspen. Satellite and sub-satellite measurements were made at 84 test sites, measuring 30x30 sq.m. The initially weak correlation of the "interferometric" forest height with the forest taxation characteristics (height, growing stock or biomass, trunk diameter and completeness) significantly increases after taking into account systematic and random errors. Empirical formulas for the dependence of the specified forest characteristics on errors in determining the height are obtained. Residual errors of calculated heights and biomass decreased to 7-14%.

TI  - Relationship between soil sealing and local to regional climate in Germany
T2  - METEOROLOGISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil sealing affects local climate via changes in the energy and radiation budget and represents a major causation for urban-rural temperature differences. In the present study, we investigate to what extent and at what spatial scales soil sealing accounts for signif cant spatial differences in mean near-surface climate characteristics as given by the relatively dense meteorological network in Germany. The study is based on soil sealing data from satellites and f ve near-surface meteorological parameters related to temperature and atmospheric humidity. We employ different spatial aggregation levels and classif cation methods of the soil sealing data. All analyzed meteorological variables are a clear function of soil sealing. The link is barely sensitive to the applied classificati n approach but differs depending on the level of spatial aggregation of the soil sealing data. At an aggregation level of 1-5 km, the local to regional climate exhibits an almost monotonous and statistically significa t tendency towards warmer and dryer conditions when soil sealing increases from class to class. At the original 20 m resolution of the soil sealing data, the local picture is less coherent but still reveals statistically significa t differences, especially for the classes with maximum sealing. The spatial distribution of meteorological stations assigned to the soil sealing classes shows that, at higher aggregation levels, soil sealing is an unambiguous indicator for urban agglomerations and metropolitan areas in Germany. At the local scale, stations assigned to the highest soil sealing class are more widespread and independent of urban regions. Thus, local soil sealing around rural meteorological stations can lead to local climatic conditions that are almost as warm and dry as on average in large metropolitan areas.

TI  - From the history of emotions to emotions in history
T2  - SCANDIA
M3  - Article
AB  - This article examines the current state of the field of the history of emotions. Within the last two decades, the amount of historical studies within the field has skyrocketed. Despite this boom, the field appears both theoretically stagnant and disparate. Although an agreement seems to have been reached on which works to include in the theoretical "canon" of the history of emotions, an essentialist worldview still looms large. Humanities scholars, including those who aim to point out how emotions cannot be separated from culture and the social, have also tended to at least partly heed the view that emotions are biologically determined when developing theories and methods. This is unsatisfactory to historians, who aim to explain change over time. Recent work on emotions within the natural sciences has instead sought answers from the humanities and social sciences, highlighting the plasticity of the brain and how emotions are biocultural. As such, historians studying their sources should not be afraid to take emotions at face value.Asking questions such as "how did it feel" and why, cannot then simply be discarded as irrelevant or left for natural scientists or neurologists to entangle. Instead, as formulated by historian Rob Boddice, historians might in fact be particularly apt at reconstructing how society, individual subjectivity and our surroundings have shaped emotional experience over time. Such a worldview is outlined in the relatively novel field of the history of experience. Here, it is asked how political and economic systems that historians know so well come to be instilled in individuals. A short outline of my own work in progress on the emotional politics of apartheid in South Africa shows how a historical study may run along these lines. In essence, I ask how racial segregation "felt" to those who were subjected to it.Emotions, I conclude, when thought of in this manner, must be regarded as vital in any attempt to access lived historical experience.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article discusses the formation of the poetics of the 1841 poem by M. Yu. Lermontov's Svidanie (Rendez-vous) from first to final draft. The reconstruction of the creative history of the text allows us to imagine the peculiarities of M. Yu. Lermontov's reasoning, his path to the creation of artistic reality in its spatial and objective design. Landscape details, visual plans, and the image of the lyrical hero change in the creative process. The novelty of research has a factual (for the first time the process of creating a poem is presented in as much detail as possible) and interpretative character, associated with the clarification of Lermontov's poetics and worldview. The poem is interpreted as a contamination of reality, dream and transitional states, with particular attention paid to the poetics of dreams. The incompleteness of the text is presented as an aesthetic device for the reliable portrayal of the sleep phenomenon. The poem is understood as an aesthetically and metaphysically integral text, in which the author manifests himself as a person with knowledge and experience of spiritual life.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial heterogeneity in Dead Sea surface temperature (SST) was pronounced throughout the daytime, based on METEOSAT geostationary satellite data (2005-2015). In summer, SST peaked at 13 LT (local time), when SST reached 38.1 degrees C, 34.1 degrees C, and 35.4 degrees C being averaged over the east, middle, and west parts of the lake, respectively. In winter, daytime SST heterogeneity was less pronounced than that in summer. As the characteristic feature of the diurnal cycle, the SST daily temperature range (the difference between daily maxima and minima) was equal to 7.2 degrees C, 2.5 degrees C, and 3.8 degrees C over the east, middle, and west parts of the Dead Sea, respectively, in summer, compared to 5.3 degrees C, 1.2 degrees C, and 2.3 degrees C in winter. In the presence of vertical water mixing, the maximum of SST should be observed several hours later than that of land surface temperature (LST) over surrounding land areas due to thermal inertia of bulk water. However, METEOSAT showed that, in summer, maxima of SST and LST were observed at the same time, 13 LT. This fact is evidence that there was no noticeable vertical water mixing. Our findings allowed us to consider that, in the absence of water mixing and under uniform solar radiation in the summer months, spatial heterogeneity in SST was associated with inhomogeneity in evaporation. Maximal evaporation (causing maximal surface water cooling) took place at the middle part of the Dead Sea, while minimum evaporation took place at the east side of the lake.

T2  - IMPLICIT RELIGION
M3  - Article
AB  - The article discusses supernatural experiences within the wider culture of the supernatural as a discourse in communication and performance in the liminal area between the credible and the incredible. The interviews analysed in the article were recorded within the context of research into the paranormal that includes several themes, for example apparitions of ghosts, humanoids, dowsing. The concept of belief pervades vernacu-lar discussion and takes the form of the performance of truth in various forms. The teller's position to the truth of the story can be seen from their narrative strategies, which present the teller as an expert in the super-natural, or on the contrary as an individual struggling in the face of the unknown. Paranormal enthusiasts give social legitimation to single expe-riences and to networks of thinking, along within the wider culture of the supernatural. Moreover, the places of these encounters can become expe-riential evidence for meeting the supernatural through dowsing practices that shape the spiritual worldview of those engaged. Thus, single experi-ences and stories will be woven into a wider story about the intervention of the supernatural in everyday life.

TI  - Classic and novel approaches to sentinel lymph node detection in patients with invasive breast cancer
T2  - BRATISLAVA MEDICAL JOURNAL-BRATISLAVSKE LEKARSKE LISTY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy is a revolutionary approach used in a complex management of patients with invasive breast cancer. Only a few decades ago, all patients diagnosed with this condition underwent a radical removal of all axillary lymph nodes to determine the stage of the cancer and to prevent further lymphatic metastasis. This surgery has been associated with numerous side effects, sometimes even more serious than complications after the removal of the primary tumour. The growing understanding of lymph circulation and its drainage patterns led to the concept of sentinel lymph nodes, which in turn led to the development of assorted techniques used for their mapping/detection. This review paper discusses the classic methods of sentinel lymph node detection, their status in clinical practice and novel emerging approaches. The classic is a "gold standard" combination of lymphoscintigraphy and blue dye. Although dominant in practice, it has numerous drawbacks. Novel techniques implement superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, indocyanine green fluorescence and contrast-enhanced ultrasound. These have a potential to establish a new gold standard, which will meet all the most important criteria in this regard - optimal sensitivity, specificity, economic and technical availability and least burden for a patient (Ref. 60).

TI  - World? Which World? On Some Pitfalls of a Concept
T2  - FILOZOFSKI VESTNIK
M3  - Article
AB  - "The world" as a concept necessarily involves many difficulties and contradictions. The text presents some of them in a rather circular way, underlining the fact that we are always confronted with the dilemma of what to do with the world, or rather, what, which, and whose world we are dealing with. Beginning with some arguments about the claim that "the world is (out there)," and then moving on to certain dilemmas related to some views on the two-world theory, one inevitably comes across Marx's thesis that the ultimate goal in relation to the world should be to "change it". The text also presents some contemporary views thereon of Badiou, Nancy, and Ruda. Taking into account all these arguments and adding insights from Freud, Husserl, Heidegger, and Adorno as to the world and one's worldview, we can only agree with Badiou's statement about the only true goal of philosophy: "Philosophy has no other legitimate aim except to help find the new names that will bring into existence the unknown world that is only waiting for us because we are waiting for it."

TI  - With Dreams in Our Hands: An African Feminist Framing of a Knowledge-Making Project with Former ESP Students
T2  - EDUCATION AS CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - This article introduces a research project that works with former Extended Studies Programme students to make knowledge that emerges through online, multimodal collaborations. Knowledge-making is not politically neutral, and the project and article are responding in part to the calls of the 2015/2016 South African student protesters to decolonise and transform university curricula. The project draws on African feminist ideas, emphasising the intersectional oppressions of colonialism, capitalism and patriarchy, which continue to influence theoretical choices in the knowledge hierarchies of South African and African universities. The "race", class and gender inequalities that drive success or failure at university and in society become some of the topics addressed in the project, where former students as co-researchers collaborate to devise the topics, responses, and kinds of dissemination. Ntseane's overlapping principles of a collective worldview, spirituality, a shared orientation to knowledge, and communal knowledge-making are motifs that influence how the project is imagined and run. My positionality as lead researcher and former lecturer of the co-researchers is navigated using African feminist guidance, which also informs the ethical principles of the project.

M3  - research-article
AB  - The assessment of wind resources must be carried out to choose wind farm sites adequately. Additionally, input data on surface roughness maps and topographic maps are required to evaluate wind resources, where input data accuracy determines the accuracy of their overall analysis. To estimate this accuracy, we used met-mast data in Jeju and produced the ground roughness value for the Jeju region. To determine these values, an unsupervised classification method using SPOT-5 images was carried out for image classification. The wind resources of the northeastern part of Jeju were predicted, and the ground roughness map of the region was calculated by the WindPRO software. The wind speed of the Pyeongdae region of Jeju from the ground roughness map was calculated using WindPRO as 8.51 m/s. The wind speed calculated using the remote sensing technology presented in this study was 8.69 m/s. To assess the accuracy of the measured WindPro and the remote sensing technology values, we compared these results to the observed values in the Pyeongdae region using met-mast. This comparison shows that remote sensing data are more accurate than the WindPro data. We also found that the ground roughness map calculated in this study is useful for generating an accurate wind resource map of Jeju Island.

TI  - Evaluating Drought Events by Time-Frequency Analysis: A Case Study in Aegean Region of Turkey
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a slowly progressing and complex natural phenomenon, so the nature of drought events remains unclear. Remote sensing is preferred as an effective tool for finding, evaluating, and monitoring drought especially for large areas throughout long-term periods by providing near real-time and accurate data. Besides, Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a cloud-based service to provide analysis and visualization of geospatial datasets. The ability of GEE as a remote sensing platform to analyze high-impact societal issues, including water management diseases, disaster, deforestation, and climate monitoring environmental protection, offers it as the best option for drought monitoring. Here, Vegetation Health Index (VHI) index that combines Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) and Temperature Condition Index (TCI) has been chosen for agricultural drought assessment in a case study (Aegean Region of Turkey) from 2000 to 2018 (19 years). Thence, the land surface temperature (LST) data and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor have been used and analyzed as remotely sensed data. The major data processing steps have been efficiently done on the GEE platform. Also, the time series and periodic behavior of these satellite-based indices have been examined. Besides, as the meteorological drought index, Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) time series were calculated for the region in question at different time scales (SPEI3, SPEI6, SPEI12, etc.) from 1980 to 2018 (39 years). Also, the frequency analysis of both satellite-based and meteorological station-based indices has been done. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for satellite-based indices frequency analyzing and Wavelet Transform (WT) for time-frequency analyzing of SPEI sequence have been used. Cross Wavelet (XWT), and Coherence Wavelet (CWT) were used to evaluate the time-frequency relationship of the satellite-based and the meteorological station-based time series.

T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We use the remote sensing data from Lake Aslykul demanding appropriate processing and special mapping technologies. A mathematical model of image processing is proposed, based on numerical optimization of a multi-parameter nonlinear function with linear constraints with respect to the standard, the latter being set by the expert for the selected image at the beginning of processing. As the image, the satellite imagery data from Lake Aslykul, obtained by the Landsat-5 satellite during 10 years since 1987, are used. The parameters of the measuring function of the technical vision system, which are necessary for the numerical measurement of a water body, have been determined. The calculation of the area of the lake and the collection of data are carried out, which are processed by the algebraic and statistical methods. A periodic change in the surface area of the lake was established. The results of the study showed that the lake area increased by 2.5-3 km(2). We suggest that one of the reasons of changing the lake area is tectonic activity.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 2nd International Symposium on Instrumentation, Control, Artificial Intelligence, and Robotics (ICA-SYMP)
CL  - Bangkok, THAILAND
AB  - The control of economic activities by governments for the purpose of minimizing COVID-19 spread influenced atmospheric conditions. Satellite-based technology is promising to monitor these changes and even non-specialists in geospatial analysis can use it through cloud-based open platforms. This study aims to give scientific interpretation on the causes of the atmospheric changes based on these governmental controls on human activity. The nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels were monitored in Ayutthaya Province in Thailand in an urban area including industrial zones during January 1 to April 30, 2020. An analysis was conducted with Google Earth Engine by using four datasets including NO2 data from Sentinel-5P. The mean value of NO2 density in 2020 decreased 12.5% compared with that in 2019. The closure of industrial facilities by the government seemed to be a key cause of the phenomena. The decline was statistically tested and resulted in a significant difference between the two periods. As the new daily cases decreased to single digits, the difference became non-significant from May 1, 2020. Single timeseries analysis on NO2 density change enabled visualization of the brief impact of responses and policies made by the government and subsequent economic activities; however, further atmospheric and industrial activity data are required for further assessment.

TI  - Can Satellite-Based Weather Index Insurance Hedge the Mortality Risk of Pine Stands?
T2  - JOURNAL OF FOREST ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to rising temperatures, forest stands are increasingly exposed to drought stress, which affects forest productivity through lower growth rates and higher mortality rates. Satellite-based index insurance could be an option for hedging the mortality risk of trees. Therefore, we calculated three remotely-sensed vegetation health indices from MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite images. As indices for index insurance we use the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), the Temperature Condition Index (TCI) and the Vegetation Health Index (VHI). We generate temperature, precipitation and a combined index of the two as benchmark indices. For 12 pine stands in northeastern Germany, we calculate the hedging effectiveness for hypothetically designed index insurance contracts based on satellite and meteorological indices. Both station- and satellite-based insurance contracts have been shown to be effective in hedging standing timber mortality risk. The average hedging effectiveness ranges from 36% for TCI-based to 48% for VHI-based index insurance contracts.

T2  - MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - 'Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite' photometry of 10 young stars with very complex periodic light curves is considered. Previous findings that these cannot be due to dark surface spots are re-evaluated by allowing arbitrarily shaped areas on the stellar surface to have sub-photospheric fluxes. This is done by approximating flux integrals by sums over surface elements. The unknown ratios of spot to photospheric fluxes are determined by lasso or ridge regression procedures. It is found that almost all light curves can be modelled very accurately in this way. The usual, if rarely stated, caveat applies - star-spot models presented in the paper are not unique.

AB  - The Inpatient Clinieo-Occupational Survey collected data from 3.76 million patients, showing that the average length of stay declined by 16.1 d in FY2008 and by 14.1 d in FY2015. In this study, we assessed the length of hospital stay and readmission, stratified by ICD-10 and employment status. A cross-sectional study was conducted on data from FY2008, including those from 65,806 first hospitalizations and 16,653 readmissions in FY2008, where 62,260 first admissions and 29,242 readmissions in FY 2015. The length of hospital stay was longest in those admitted due to external influences (24.8 d), followed by musculoskeletal disorders (22.5 d). This remained unchanged in FY2015, however, lengths of stay of those were reduced by 20.1 and 20.0 d, respectively. The length of hospital stay for most diseases was longer upon readmission than on first admission, and longer for those who were unemployed. It is necessary to give attention to patients who need to be discharged early due to work, or plan for frequent hospitalization in order to reduce the length of each hospital stay because of the expected increase in the number of elderly workers brought on by a declining birth rate and an aging population.

T2  - EPHEMERIDES THEOLOGICAE LOVANIENSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Before the publication of Morton Smith's scholarly and popular monographs on the Letter to Theodore ascribed to Clement of Alexandria, scholars generally summarized rather than critically interrogated the heresiological sources about the Carpocratians. Smith's historical reconstruction of the beliefs and praxis of Carpocrates, Epiphanes, and their followers, therefore, represented a significant advance in the academic study of the Carpocratians. Further, he added the Letter to Theodore to the database on the Carpocratians, though there is no consensus among scholars regarding the authenticity of this document. Nevertheless, Smith's interpretations of the Patristic and Medieval testimonies about the Carpocratians have become outdated in the light of recent scholarship. More specifically, Smith undervalued the philosophical underpinnings of the Carpocratians' worldview and overemphasised the antinomian and magical practices that were attributed to the Carpocratians by their Christian opponents.

TI  - Analyzing urban growth and land cover change scenario in Lagos, Nigeria using multi-temporal remote sensing data and GIS to mitigate flooding
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - Lagos, Nigeria's economic hub and one of Africa's fastest-growing cities, has experienced remarkable urban growth due to rapid urbanization. The city has recently faced persistent urban flooding due to unsustainable growth and inadequate data for proper planning. Therefore, we analyzed urban growth and land cover change in Lagos, Nigeria, using multi-temporal datasets downloaded from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) at an interval of 10 years from 1990-2020. We employed the maximum likelihood classification and post-classification change detection to analyze the city's urban growth and change dynamics. The study revealed three phases of growth in Lagos and a substantial increase in the city's built-up area from 496 km(2) in 1990 to approximately 860 km(2) in 2000. This area increased further to 1113 km(2) in 2010, and presently over 1256 km(2). The result also revealed a substantial decrease in the city's vegetation, water bodies, and bare soil by approximately 398 km(2), 246 km(2), and 115 km(2), respectively, between 1990 and 2020. These changes contribute to urban flooding, the prominent natural and human-induced disaster in the city. Therefore, this study's findings provided the historical and scientific data for the effective planning, management, and sustainable development of the city.

TI  - The "Bright City" Mythologeme in Lyric Poetry of Pimen Karpov
T2  - PROBLEMY ISTORICHESKOI POETIKI
M3  - Article
AB  - The article analyzes the poet Pimen Karpov's understanding of the "Bright City" mythologeme. The need to analyze this mythologeme stems from the fact that the image of the Bright City is at the core of the mythopoetic concept that forms the basis of Karpov's worldview. The toponymy of the sacred space of the Bright City, the Heavenly City, the City of God in Karpov's lyric poetry is multifaceted. It is realized in poetry both as a real earthly space, and as a certain symbol with blurry borders: it is a heavenly city, a potential paradise on earth, the promised land, the land of the forefathers, and even simply the land for the peasant. The ideal world order has both spatial and temporal reference points. According to Karpov, it is only possible to reach the Bright City through self-sacrifice. Out of pain and suffering, happiness is born, and this is the only possible way to attain the coveted Paradise. But for Karpov, it is not merely a personal path, but also Russia's path, its mission, and the lyrical hero's participation in its fate is undeniable. Karpov sees Russia's historical mission in sacrificial self-immolation as a path to Transformation. The paradoxical convergence of Christ and the antichrist in his works reflects the spiritual context of the turn of the 20th century, i.e., the extreme ambivalence of personal principles. The fragmentary and aphoristic nature of Karpov's poetic language, the kaleidoscopic nature of his artistic space, on the one hand, and the hidden integrity emanating from the unity of the visible and invisible worlds, on the other, make his poetry akin to the culture of modernism.

TI  - SISYPHUS FROM LENINGRAD: THE CREATIVE LIFE OF REED GRACHEV
T2  - PHILOLOGICAL CLASS
M3  - Article
AB  - This is the first time the historico-literary materials related to the creative biography of Reed Grachev (R. I. Vita, 1935-2004), a Leningrad writer well-known in the 1960s and almost forgotten at the present time, are published in a scholarly journal. It poses a research hypothesis concerning a special type of the writer's autobiographism based not on the description of real events but on the reflection of the mental states that accompanied them. Among Grachev's literary discoveries, new types of characters are identified - "faceless man", "stranger", "nobody's brother". Attention is drawn to the unusual poetics of "zero writing" producing an expressionistic explosion at the expense of the plots that contain in the deep subtextual conflict between the character and reality. The article suggests a structural-semiotic analysis of the stories "The House Stood on the Outskirts", "Snabsbyt", "Suspicion" and explores the subtext elements originating from the writer's general worldview. The study characterizes the publicistic heritage including the articles "The Meaningful Absence", "Why Art Does Not Save the World", "There is no More Intelligentsia" that rationalized the ethical and aesthetic views of the writer, expressed in his literary works and described more consistently his creative credo. Grachev also wrote poems, three of which - "How everything is fine with people", "Among the plants cut into a circle" and "Mozart and Salieri" are included in the article. Grachev's mental disease is described as a fact of his biography that played a tragic role in his fate. It was provoked by the impossibility of creative realization caused by the refusal to publish his works for censorship reasons. During the writer's life, only one book "Where is Your House" (1967) was published, greatly abbreviated; it did not match the then reputation of the writer. Censors considered Grachev's characters to be too much vulnerable, deprived of an optimistic spirit. It is concluded that Grachev followed the humanistic traditions of classical Russian literature, primarily of F. M. Dostoevsky, and that Grachev's literary heritage - the heritage of an undeservedly forgotten original Russian writer - is worth popularizing and studying by specialists.

TI  - MEANS OF REPRESENTATION OF THE IDIOGLOSSES "CHILDREN", "FAMILY", "LIFE" IN THE NOVEL BY F. M. DOSTOEVSKY "THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV"
T2  - VESTNIK VOLGOGRADSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-SERIYA 2-YAZYKOZNANIE
M3  - Article
AB  - The article introduces the main idioglosses ("Children", "Family", "Life") of F. M. Dostoevsky's novel "The Brothers Karamazov", which are understood as mental and cognitive categories, according to Yu. N. Karaulov, the constants of certain author's lines in the text, and describes the means of their representation (phonosemantic, lexical, phraseological and syntactic). The study of phonetic shells and the meanings of the words that form considered idioglosses, it is proved that representation in their meanings and words as a psycholinguistic phenomenon exhibits the traits of the writer's language personality development, his worldview and value system. The author's choice of exact lexemes and their syntagmatic partners included in the studied idioglosses demonstrates the harmonization of the nature of the language sign: a) the sound supports the meaning; b) the meanings of 'children', 'family', 'life' are interdependent. The novelty of the study is determined by the fact that it defines the semantic components of the idioglosses "Children", "Family", "Life" and the means of their representation. On the basis of computer phonosemantic analysis of words, their sound content is characterized. The novelty of the research is connected with the understanding of harmony or disharmony of the language sign and the ideological and aesthetic content expressed in the text by Dostoevsky.

M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, we have studied the signals of auroral kilometer radiation (AKR) from sources in the auroral regions of the Northern and Southern hemispheres simultaneously recorded by one satellite. We have carried out a detailed statistical analysis of more than 20 months of continuous AKR measurements made by the ERG satellite (also known as Arase). This made it possible to confirm the previously obtained results on the location of AKR sources and seasonal changes in the radiation intensity. Open questions about the processes in the AKR source can be solved using data on the radiation pattern under various geomagnetic conditions. To answer these questions, we have estimated the cone angle of directional diagrams in the dusk and dawn sectors of Earth's magnetosphere.

TI  - Bolshevization of Students of Pedagogical Education Institutions of National Minorities in Ukrainian SSR in the 1920s - 1930s: Purpose, Means, Tasks
T2  - UKRAINSKYI ISTORYCHNYI ZHURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the study is to clarify the purpose, means and objectives of Bolshevization students of pedagogical educational institutions of national minorities in the 1920s and 1930s, coverage of socio-political and educational activities of student youth, purposeful and controlled by party and Komsomol cells in pedagogical colleges and institutes, in general, party-state structures, as well as manifestations of opposition among her. Research methods. The authors used a set of general scientific (analysis, synthesis, method of comparison, dialectical) and special scientific (historical-genetic, historical-comparative, historical-typological, problem-chronological) methods of historical cognition. Scientific novelty. The social and political life of the students of pedagogical educational institutions through the prism of its Bolshevization, subordination to the means and tasks of the Soviet-Stalinist leadership in the interwar period is analyzed. Conclusions. For the Bolshevization of student youth, the imposition of Soviet-Stalinist ideology and the model of society, party and Komsomol cells in the educational institutions of national minorities practiced the organization of political circles, circles of "current politics", political and Komsomol schools, "political battles", "socialist competition", propaganda of atheistic ideas, celebration of state holidays, honoring the memory of Bolshevik leaders, etc. In practice, such events, and in fact the party and Komsomol committees themselves, did not enjoy the proper authority among students. Instead, various debates and discussions on political topics with a free exchange of views were popular among young people, which, according to the authorities, posed a threat to the development of a "Marxist worldview". The socio-political and educational activities of students were subordinated to the political and ideological guidelines of the Bolshevik Party and the Komsomol. In particular, they were involved in work in trade unions, public organizations, clubs, in various national campaigns, boss work in villages, urban enterprises, workers' clubs, units of the Red Army, the elimination of illiteracy and more. In general, students of pedagogical colleges and institutes were less active in social work, especially in rural areas, than their colleagues from purely Ukrainian universities. Some students did not accept the Bolshevik model of society, which strengthened their opposition, which inevitably led to repression in their environment.

AB  - In this study, our technique for automated extraction of sea ice concentration from RADARSAT-2 data was adapted to the recently launched RADARSAT Constellation mission (RCM). Ice concentrations were derived from more than 2,600 RCM images acquired between August 1, 2020 and March 31, 2021. The retrieved ice concentrations were compared against the Canadian Ice Service (CIS) Image Analysis products. A very good agreement between RCM-derived and CIS Image Analysis ice concentrations was found with the root-mean square error of 2.2% and R-2 of 0.997. Our results suggest that automatically derived ice concentrations from RCM are well suited for further assimilation in sea ice numerical prediction systems such as Environment and Climate Change Canada Regional Ice-Ocean Prediction System.

TI  - MAPPING AND SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION ANALYSIS OF HERBACEOUS VEGETATION IN THE TRANSITION AREA OF POLISTOVSKY RESERVE
T2  - Russian Journal of Ecosystem Ecology
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Meadows of the temperate zone are characterized by high biodiversity. Recently their area has been reduced as a result of land use change. Therefore it is important to assess their current state and spatial distribution. However, for the territory of European Russia patterns of spatial distribution are not known, ecology of grasslands is poorly studied, and syntaxonomy is not fully developed. Our aim was to fill this gap using traditional geobotanical methods and mapping with remote sensing data. Materials and methods. We use 278 releves of grasslands made in the vicinity of the Polistovsky Reserve (Pskov Oblast') and 11 scenes of Sentinel-2 (2018-2019). We carried out vegetation classification by floristic criteria, DCA-ordination and calculation of Ellenberg's indicator values. Remote data (Sentinel scenes) were classified by Random forest algorithm using 234 predictors (derivatives of satellite images). The resulting maps were validated with randomly distributed points and drone images. Results. The vegetation classification scheme has been developed, maps of the distribution of syntaxonomical classes and alliances have been obtained. Overall map accuracy was 83 % for classes and 87.3 % for alliances. The gradients of environmental factors that determine the differentiation of vegetation are identified. Conclusions. Alliances of herbaceous vegetation are well detected on the basis of time series of Sentinel-2 images. Peculiarities of spatial distribution of these communities are explained by their ecology. The largest areas are occupied by communities of Molinio-Arrhenatheretea class due to their high diversity. The most valuable meadows of the Molinion caeruleae alliance are poorly represented in the transition zone of the reserve. On the alliance level, the largest areas are occupied by the communities of the Convolvulo arvensis-Agropyrion repentis alliance.

TI  - Epidemiological and co-infection characteristics of common human coronaviruses in Shanghai, 2015-2020: a retrospective observational study
T2  - EMERGING MICROBES & INFECTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is a major challenge worldwide. However, the epidemic potential of common human coronaviruses (HCoVs) remains unclear. This study aimed to determine the epidemiological and co-infection characteristics of common HCoVs in individuals with influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI). This retrospective, observational, multicentre study used data collected from patients admitted to nine sentinel hospitals with ILI and SARI from January 2015 through December 2020 in Shanghai, China. We prospectively tested patients for a total of 22 respiratory pathogens using multi-real-time polymerase chain reaction. Of the 4541 patients tested, 40.37% (1833/4541) tested positive for respiratory pathogens and 3.59% (163/4541) tested positive for common HCoVs. HCoV infection was more common in the non-endemic season for respiratory pathogens (odds ratio: 2.33, 95% confidence interval: 1.64-3.31). HCoV-OC43 (41.72%, 68/163) was the most common type of HCoV detected. The co-infection rate was 31.29% (51/163) among 163 HCoV-positive cases, with HCoV-229E (53.13%, 17/32), the HCoV type that was most frequently associated with co-infection. Respiratory pathogens responsible for co-infections with HCoVs included parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, influenza A virus, and adenovirus. Furthermore, we identified one patient co-infected with HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63/HKU1. The prevalence of common HCoVs remains low in ILI/SARI cases, in Shanghai. However, the seasonal pattern of HCoVs may be opposite to that of other respiratory pathogens. Moreover, HCoVs are likely to co-exist with specific respiratory pathogens. The potential role of co-infections with HCoVs and other pathogenic microorganisms in infection and pathogenesis of ILI and SARI warrants further study.

TI  - End-to-end multispectral image compression framework based on adaptive multiscale feature extraction
T2  - JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multispectral image compression can considerably reduce the volume of data and promote their application. However, conventional single-scale compression schemes, such as JPEG2000 and three-dimensional set partitioning in hierarchical tree (3D-SPIHT), do not accurately preserve the features of images due to the complex features of multispectral images. A compression framework based on adaptive multiscale feature extraction with a convolutional neural network is proposed. First, an adaptive multiscale feature extraction module, which is the basic component of the compression framework, is designed to extract the multiscale spatial-spectral features of the multispectral images and adaptively adjust the weights of the features according to the content of the images. Second, the encoder, which is composed of multiscale feature extraction modules, extracts the multiscale spatial-spectral features of the multispectral images, and the extracted features are quantized and encoded by the quantizer and the entropy coder to generate a compressed bitstream. Third, the decoder, which is structurally similar to the encoder, is utilized to recover the images. The rate-distortion optimizer is embedded in the encoder to control the trade-off between the rate loss and the distortion. The results of these experiments on multispectral images of the Landsat 8 satellite and the WorldView-3 satellite validate the better performance of our compression framework compared with the performances of conventional schemes, including JPEG2000 and 3D-SPIHT. In order to further verify the effectiveness of multiscale features, the framework is compared with a single-scale compression algorithm based on deep learning, the experimental results validate that the performance of the single-scale compression algorithm superior to the conventional schemes but inferior to our multiscale algorithm, which indicates that the multiscale features can significantly improve the performance of the compression algorithm.

TI  - Spectral-Spatial Feature Partitioned Extraction Based on CNN for Multispectral Image Compression
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, the rapid development of multispectral imaging technology has received great attention from many fields, which inevitably involves the image transmission and storage problem. To solve this issue, a novel end-to-end multispectral image compression method based on spectral-spatial feature partitioned extraction is proposed. The whole multispectral image compression framework is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN), whose innovation lies in the feature extraction module that is divided into two parallel parts, one is for spectral and the other is for spatial. Firstly, the spectral feature extraction module is used to extract spectral features independently, and the spatial feature extraction module is operated to obtain the separated spatial features. After feature extraction, the spectral and spatial features are fused element-by-element, followed by downsampling, which can reduce the size of the feature maps. Then, the data are converted to bit-stream through quantization and lossless entropy encoding. To make the data more compact, a rate-distortion optimizer is added to the network. The decoder is a relatively inverse process of the encoder. For comparison, the proposed method is tested along with JPEG2000, 3D-SPIHT and ResConv, another CNN-based algorithm on datasets from Landsat-8 and WorldView-3 satellites. The result shows the proposed algorithm outperforms other methods at the same bit rate.

T2  - BOIS ET FORETS DES TROPIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate warming is a global phenomenon which is affecting the whole climate system. One of its consequences is the longer duration of drought periods, which is increasing the frequency of bush fires. Uncontrolled wildfires disrupt the ecology and functions of ecosystems, sometimes eroding them. This study, focusing on satellite monitoring during the bush fire season in 2018-2019, offers a contribution to support bush fire management in Togo. We explore the potential of new satellite data from Sentinel-2 (S-2), available as open-access remote sensing data for optical detection of burned areas and mapping of both utilitarian and uncontrolled fires. The data can also be used to test the performance of bush fire mapping methods by means of the NBR index (Normalized Burn Ratio), initially designed for Landsat images to assess burned plant biomass. The results show the potential usefulness of S-2 images in mapping burned areas and a satisfactory performance of the NBR method with S-2 images. Mapping of bushfires shows that utilitarian fires account for 21.75% of all fires as opposed to 78.25% for uncontrolled fires. Together, the bush fires recorded destroyed plant cover over 5,878 km(2), or 10.39% of Togo's surface area. The plant cover burned mainly comprises savannah land (33.12%), crops and fallows (24.48%), plantations (14.59%), open woodland (14.43%) and riparian forest (13.02%). The results obtained provide tangible evidence to support monitoring, awareness-raising, planning and development of bush fire prevention and management plans.

TI  - Witness and Christian: Historical Writing in Late Antiquity
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - When we begin to study historical sources and, in particular, works of the genre of historical writing, we should understand how the authors of these texts perceived their activities. The understanding of the meaning of historical writing in a particular historical period, the tasks and requirements that are set for the author is the basis for a reasoned decoding of a historical text. Similar research work is currently underway in the history of concepts. Reinhart Koselleck worked on the problem of historical shifts in the understanding of historical writing in his articles on the modern period and the Enlightenment. The aim of this article is to elicit an understanding of historical writing in late antiquity by adjusting existing historiographic positions. The toolkit of history of concepts is used to achieve this aim. The period of late antiquity is traditionally regarded as the decline of literature skills, including historical writing. However, it seems that this historiographic position arose more as a result of the steady discursive pattern of Latin authors than as a reflection of the actual situation of late antiquity. Researchers' attention to this period has grown significantly since the 1990s, but, at the same time, the concept of historical writing was not significantly revised. The image of the period as a decline extended to historical writing. The departure from the classical tradition of historiography was associated with the spread of Christianity in the empire. Christianity offered different guidelines in the past, shifted value priorities replacing historical precedents with the Old Testament and evangelical examples. In addition, the genre of historical writing within the framework of Christianity was transformed into the history of the church, changing its purposes to describe the ideological and political struggle of various religious factions and to make apologetics of the Christian worldview as opposed to the pagan one. However, despite the validity of such notions, it should be emphasized that the spread of Christianity was not a crucial factor that influenced the change in priorities in historical writing. Moreover, the positioning of historical writing as a statement of truth about current events remained unchanged. That means that the understanding of the activity of the author of a historical work did not undergo significant shifts in the period of late antiquity compared to the classical one. The main changes affected the subject matter of historical writing, that is, a sample of precedents that the authors considered necessary to describe within the framework of their current priorities. This conclusion is also confirmed by the fact that most Latin Christian historians directly or indirectly point out that they are based not only on their Christian predecessors, but also on pagan classics. The knowledge of the latter was included in grammatical and rhetorical education at least in the form of epitomes, and served as a source of direct and indirect quotes, imitations and stylizations - not as explicit as, for example, Christian patristics, but rather, by default, as a kind of conventional agreement.

TI  - "I don't Write a Commissioned Play, but Something of my Own": The Play "The Earthly World" by Boris Pasternak as a Milestone on the Way to the Novel "Doctor Zhivago"
T2  - NOVYI FILOLOGICHESKII VESTNIK-NEW PHILOLOGICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The article discusses poorly studied drama by B. Pasternak "The Earthly World" (1942), which was a step on the writer's creative path to the novel "Doctor Zhivago". Pasternak thought to name the creating novel (1947) by the name of the main character of the drama - "Innokentiy Dudorov". Poetics of the title indicates the relationship between "The Earthly World" and "Doctor Zhivago". The research provides an overview of the transformation of the characters images, that appeared in the drama (Druzyakina/Bezocheredeva), when they were transferred to the novel. Dudorov's opinion about revolution and the Great Patriotic War reveal Pasternak's worldview in the years immediately preceding "Doctor Zhivago". Similar lexical and stylistic techniques in the depiction of heroes from common people, close mythopoetic and biblical motives bring together "The Earthly World" and "Doctor Zhivago". Based on the research, the existence of plot invariants in "Patrick's notes, "The Earthly World" and "Doctor Zhivago" is proved. The image of Innokenty Dudorov is considered in the process of evolution in the three mentioned works. The research proposes to consider the alternate change of the titles of the novel "Boys and girls", "Innokenty Dudorov" and "Death will not happen" in the line of the shift of emphasis from the fate of the Pasternak generation of the 1890s to the immortality of creativity. The article first time publishes excerpts from P. Vasiliev's letter from the front to B. Pasternak (1944).

TI  - Performance evaluation of anti-avalanche measures at the "Krasnaya Polyana" ski resort
T2  - LED I SNEG-ICE AND SNOW
M3  - Article
AB  - For the first time, a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the effectiveness of anti-avalanche measures was carried out for the territory of the "Krasnaya Polyana" ski resort, located in the Western Caucasus on the Aibga ridge. The following materials were used for this work: the results of field survey in 2019, which made it possible to map the resort's infrastructure exposed to possible snow avalanches and protected by existing preventive (anti-avalanche) measures, experience of similar studies from other regions as well as identification of the avalanche release zones by means of digital elevation model and analysis of remote sensing data, archive data on the snow avalanches regime at the site, and numerical modeling of the snow avalanches with different starting conditions. Modeling of the avalanches was performed in the RAMMS program basing on three scenarios: 1) taking account of the successful operation of existing anti-avalanche measures; 2) with regard for the failures in the work of existing anti-avalanche measures that were recorded earlier during the operation of the resort; 3) without considering any anti-avalanche measures, which corresponded to the conditions at the stage of the territorial planning of the resort. Differences in the impact of simulated avalanches on the resort infrastructure were interpreted as "high", "medium" and "low" effectiveness of existing anti-avalanche measures. It was found that the dynamical characteristics of the local avalanches (run-out distance, volume, velocity, and pressure) had different importance for different types of the infrastructure with regard to the effectiveness of anti-avalanche measures. Under existing conditions of the relief, climate and vegetation of the investigated territory the artificial triggering (at the ski resort it is mainly made by the Gazex systems) is the most efficient. Snow-retaining structures often do not perform their functions, while dams and avalanche cutters can be successful only in combination with the properly functioning artificial triggering. It was found that there are areas where the run-out distance of artificially controlled avalanches is smaller than that of possible natural avalanches, and these areas can still be dangerous for the infrastructure of the resort due to the high values of the avalanche speed and pressure.

TI  - THE END OF PAX AMERICANA AND THE RISE OF MULTIPOLARITY
T2  - SRAVNITELNAYA POLITIKA-COMPARATIVE POLITICS
M3  - Book Review
AB  - The world is in the midst of a systemic transition from unipolarity to multipolarity, which has prompted many experts to think deeply about the future of the international order. Leonid Savin, a leading figure of the International Eurasian Movement, is one such expert. His latest book, "Ordo Pluriversalis: The End Of Pax Americana And The Rise Of Multipolarity", covers a wide range of topics in arguing that the coming world order will be a post-liberal one characterized by civilizations acting similar to how nation-states presently do in the current order. Savin reveals how a rich diversity of social, political, religious, legal, and other systems have survived the brief period of American-led liberal unipolarity, which will lay the basis for the coming reorganization of international (or it should be said, inter-civilizational) relations. Intriguingly, since one of the foundations of this worldview is that these various systems will become more prominent in the wake of America's decline, he also attempts to incorporate many social theories into the field of political science to account for the increasingly complex nature of inter-entity relations. Savin's work is therefore practical but also highly theoretical, though this review simplifies the gist of his ideas by focusing only on the most important ones which contribute to his conclusion of nation-state-like civilization-level actors becoming a subject in global affairs.

TI  - The genre of a ballad in Khanty literature
T2  - VESTNIK UGROVEDENIYA-BULLETIN OF UGRIC STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: the article is part of a complex of studies of the genre specifics of literature and actualizes the genre features of a ballad in the creative practice of Khanty poets.Objective: to analyze the specifics of ballad forms in the works of two Khanty poets - R. P. Rugin and M. I. Novjukhov.Research materials: the works of the ballad genre in the works by R. P. Rugin and M. I. Novjukhov.Results and novelty of the research: for the first time the article analyzes the works of the ballad genre found only in the works of two poets in the history of 'Chanty literature - R. P. Rugin and M. I. Novjukhov. Less than a dozen samples of the ballad genre were identified, which indicates that the ballad genre has not received a decent development in Khanty art literature. The analysis of the ballad forms of R. P. Rugin and M. I. Novjukhov showed that most often their works are based on a plot. Only one sample of M. I. Novjukhov has the plot replaced by a dialogue. Combination of the real and the fantastic is clearly seen in the poets' appeal to the folklore and mythological symbolism of images, in the inclusion of folklore traditions and religious beliefs of the Khanty people in the literary text. The motifs of mystery. death, and world duality become mandatory components of the ballad genre of R. P. Rugin and M. I. Novjukhov. The themes of freedom, war /battle, and ethical dilemmas are the plot-forming in their ballads. The poets and translators do not preserve the ballad strophe in all their works. The ballad forms of the Khanty poets reflect the national worldview and poetic traditions of Russian literature.

TI  - T cell infiltration on local CpG-B delivery in early-stage melanoma is predominantly related to CLEC9A<SUP>+</SUP>CD141<SUP>+</SUP> cDC1 and CD14<SUP>+</SUP> antigen-presenting cell recruitment
T2  - JOURNAL FOR IMMUNOTHERAPY OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundWe previously reported CpG-B injection at the primary tumor excision site prior to re-excision and sentinel node biopsy to result in immune activation of the sentinel lymph node (SLN), increased melanoma-specific CD8(+) T cell rates in peripheral blood, and prolonged recurrence-free survival. Here, we assessed recruitment and activation of antigen-presenting cell (APC) subsets in the SLN and at the injection site in relation to T cell infiltration.MethodsRe-excision skin specimens from patients with clinical stage I-II melanoma, collected 7 days after intradermal injection of either saline (n=10) or 8 mg CpG-B (CPG7909, n=12), were examined by immunohistochemistry, quantifying immune subsets in the epidermis, papillary, and reticular dermis. Counts were related to flow cytometric data from matched SLN samples. Additional in vitro cultures and transcriptional analyses on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were performed to ascertain CpG-induced APC activation and chemokine profiles.ResultsSignificant increases in CD83(+), CD14(+), CD68(+), and CD123(+) APC were observed in the reticular dermis of CpG-B-injected skin samples. Fluorescent double/triple staining revealed recruitment of both CD123(+)BDCA2(+) plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DCs) and BDCA3/CD141(+)CLEC9A(+) type-1 conventional DC (cDC1), of which only the cDC1 showed considerable levels of CD83 expression. Simultaneous CpG-B-induced increases in T cell infiltration were strongly correlated with both cDC1 and CD14 counts. Moreover, cDC1 and CD14(+) APC rates in the reticular dermis and matched SLN suspensions were positively correlated. Flow cytometric, transcriptional, and chemokine release analyses of PBMC, on in vitro or in vivo exposure to CpG-B, indicate a role for the activation and recruitment of both cDC1 and CD14(+) monocyte-derived APCs in the release of CXCL10 and subsequent T cell infiltration.ConclusionThe CpG-B-induced concerted recruitment of cDC1 and CD14(+) APC to the injection site and its draining lymph nodes may allow for both the (cross-)priming of T cells and their subsequent homing to effector sites.

TI  - The Motif of Sinful Passion and Marital Infidelity in the Novels <i>King</i>, <i>Queen</i>, <i>Knave</i> and <i>Camera Obscura</i> by V. Nabokov
T2  - PROBLEMY ISTORICHESKOI POETIKI
M3  - Article
AB  - The article examines the artistic depiction of vicious passion in Vladimir Nabokov's Russian-language novels King, Queen, Knave and Camera Obscura. The purpose of this work is to describe the stylistic and narrative mechanisms used by Nabokov to examine the roots, development and final reign of the forbidden passion that enslaves a human soul. Contrary to the common stereotype of Nabokov as a predominantly "aesthetic" writer, the texts of his works reveal a profound moral dimension, Moreover, Nabokov's approach to the concepts of sin and virtue, ethics and aesthetics often echoes, and sometimes completely coincides with the teachings of the founders of Christian theology and asceticism (Marcus Eremita, Peter of Damascus etc.). For example, the four -step description of the evolution of sinful passion into a destructive obsession finds unconditional embodiment in the texts analysed herein. On the other hand, marital love, based on kinship of souls and mutual fidelity stays in clear contrast to an ordinary consumer lust. A happy and harmonious marriage, understood precisely in the spiritual and personal sense, overcomes social and everyday boundaries in Nabokov's work, definitely breaking into a transcendent dimension. This fact is all the more curious because Nabokov was never a religious person and, judging by his own words, never displayed any interest in theological matters. Consequently, the common features that unite Nabokov's morality and metaphysics with the foundations of the Christian worldview can be seen as rooted in the universal ethical laws of human life.

TI  - Cosmography as Cultural Capital: Power Struggle in the Visigothic Kingdom
T2  - SCIENCE & SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Bourdieu's concept of cultural capital can be used to show that the cosmography of the learned bishop Isidore of Seville (560-636) was intended to acculturate the Visigothic elite to the Roman worldview, shedding new light on the relations of these two ruling elites. By being the provider and guardian of the culture, the Hispano-Roman aristocracy retained significant power and exercised its influence through the Catholic Church. Three dialectical categories-transformation of quantity to quality, development through contradiction, spiral forms of development - help advance the analysis of Isidore's cosmography. A case study on lsidorian planetary orbital values provides an illustration of this dialectical development. It was, therefore, cultural capital as exemplified by Isidore that enabled the Hispano-Roman aristocracy to maintain its position as a ruling elite.

AB  - Seven years in orbit ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 has provided the world's first long-term pantropical L-band forest observation archive. In the frame of the JICA-JAXA forest early warning system in the tropics (JJ-FAST), Japan's SAR earth observation excellence has pioneered for a seamless and timely monitoring of the tropical forest belt from 2016 to 2021. In this paper, we discuss the tremendous contributions to fundamental SAR forest research, forest mapping, biomass estimation, and operational deforestation detection and demonstrate the merits of the unprecedented dense forest timeseries for the entire tropical forest belt. As preparation for the coming "golden-age of L-band SAR", we show examples of how ancillary precipitation information and machine learning can improve the monitoring and protection of tropical forests.

TI  - THE EVOLUTION OF THE MYTHOLOGICAL IMAGE OF THE BEAR IN THE CULTURE OF THE EASTERN SLAVS
T2  - QUAESTIO ROSSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The subject of this study is the evolution of the image of the bear among the Eastern Slavs between the tenth and seventeenth centuries. The authors maintain that totemic ideas about bears as creatures that escort the souls of the deceased to the kingdom of the dead began to spread in the East Slavic lands only from the mid-tenth century. Such ideas were influenced by the beliefs and cults of the neighbouring Finno-Ugric and Baltic tribes and were not characteristic of traditional East Slavic paganism. Based on ancient Russian writings and archaeological excavations into ancient pagan sanctuaries, the authors outline the origin and formation of the myth of the supernatural ancestor bear, the protector of the human race, in all East Slavic lands. With the help of archaeological and zoological materials from the excavations of Russian settlements from the pre-Mongol era, as well as several ancient Russian written documents, the authors determine the period of transformation in the folk mythological consciousness of the Eastern Slavs of the mythological image of the bear from the ruler of destinies and guide in the kingdom of the dead into a forest demon. This paper emphasises that the myth of the supernatural ancestor bear gave rise to the custom of taking trained bears around Russian cities to rid them of evil spirits, as well as folk divination. The authors conclude that in the minds of these ancestors, the image of the bear went through several stages - from the idea of the bear as a tribal totem to the image of a benevolent spirit, a protector of people from evil spirits. The ancient pagan ideas about the bear as a deity remained part of the worldview of the East Slavic peoples until the early twentieth century, finding their reflection in folk fairytales, legends, and traditions.
