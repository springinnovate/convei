TI  - Evaluating SWOT water level information using a large scale hydrology simulator: A case study over India
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - An important goal of the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission is to provide river width, height, slope to estimate global river discharges. To appraise the feasibility of SWOT data over India, the present study utilizes the SWOT simulator from Centre National D'Etudes Spatiales (CNES) to generate a long time-series (three years) of SWOT observations over the Mahanadi River basin in India. Two independent sources of river geometry are used in this study, namely satellite-based and hydrodynamic model-based esti-mates. Satellite-based river geometry is derived using a web-based User Interface (UI) developed in-house to generate time series of accu-rate river width shapefiles from Sentinel-1 satellite imagery. To compare these results, a 1D unsteady flow analysis is carried out over the Mahanadi River to simulate channel water depth and inundation extent using the Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis Sys-tem (HEC-RAS) model. The simulated observations are used in this study to assess the potential error in SWOT channel water depth measurements. Results indicate a good spatial correlation between the water surface area derived from Sentinel and HEC-RAS models with a correlation of 0.74. The simulated data shows a bias of 20 cm compared to gauge observations. This study is conducted as a proof of concept in demonstrating the ability of simulated SWOT data in capturing river water surface elevation with respect to the conven-tional HEC-RAS model. It also implements a new tool in google earth engine (GEE) to generate input to SWOT simulator. (c) 2022 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - [A Study of Longitudinal NPS Measurement in CT Images Based on the Central Cross-section Theorem].
T2  - Nihon Hoshasen Gijutsu Gakkai zasshi
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - PURPOSE: Various approaches in noise power spectrum (NPS) analysis are currently used for measuring a patient's longitudinal (z-direction) NPS from three-dimensional (3D) CT volume data. The purpose of this study was to clarify the relationship between those NPSs and 3D-NPS based on the central slice theorem.METHODS: We defined the 3D-NPS(fx, fy, fz) that was calculated by 3D Fourier transform (FT) from 3D noise data (3D-Noise(x, y, z), x-y scan plane). Here, fx, fy and fz are spatial frequencies corresponding to the axes of x, y and z, respectively. Based on the central slice theorem, we described three relationships as follows. (1) The fz-directional NPS calculated from the 3D-Noise(x=0, y=0, z) is equal to the profile obtained by projecting 3D-NPS(fx, fy, fz) in fx- and fy-directions. (2) The fz-directional NPS calculated from the profile obtained by projecting 3D-Noise(x=0, y, z) in the y-direction is equal to the profile at fy=0 in the data obtained by projecting 3D-NPS(fx, fy, fz) in the fx-direction. (3) The fz-directional NPS calculated from the profile obtained by projecting 3D-Noise(x, y, z) in x and y-directions is equal to the profile of 3D-NPS(fx=0, fy=0, fz). To verify them, we compared the NPSs measured from actual 3D noise data that were obtained using a cylindrical water phantom.RESULTS: In each relationship (1)-(3), the fz-directional NPS matched the profile obtained from the 3D-NPS(fx, fy, fz).CONCLUSION: Based on the central slice theorem, we clarified the relationships between fz-directional NPSs and 3D-NPS. We should understand them and then consider which method should be used for fz-directional NPS measurement.

TI  - Monitoring land use dynamics, urban sprawl, and land surface temperature in Dimapur urban area, Nagaland, India
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The study's primary objective is to measure the rate and pattern of land use and land cover changes in Dimapur city, as well as their impact on land surface temperature (LST). Landsat TM (Thematic mapper) data from 2000 and 2007, as well as Landsat OLI (Operational land imager) and TIR (Thermal infrared sensor) data from 2020, were used in the study. In order to examine the city's population patterns, the study was supplemented using LandScan global gridded data for the pre-defined years (1KM x 1KM). The urban sprawl index (USI) was employed to detect urban sprawl in Dimapur, while the urban thermal field variant index (UTFVI) was utilized to investigate surface urban heat islands. Dimapur's built environment grew from 14.74 percent to 39.36 percent between 2000 and 2020, while green spaces shrank from 33.21 percent to 19.44 percent. Between 2000 and 2007, the USI value increased from 0.0037 to 0.0055, indicating substantial urban sprawl in recent years. Between 2000 and 2020, these changes resulted in an increase in mean LST of 17.27 degrees C (winter) and 26.86 degrees C (summer) to 19.01 degrees C (winter) and 31.43 degrees C (summer). According to UTFVI, the number of locations classified as ecologically bad or worse in Dimapur has increased in recent years. The larger positive correlation between population and built-up areas and LST, as well as the stronger negative correlation between vegetation and population and LST, support the impact of population-induced land use and land cover change on LST development in Dimapur urban area.

TI  - Using multi-temporal tree inventory data in eucalypt forestry to benchmark global high-resolution canopy height models. A showcase in Mato Grosso, Brazil
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The global monitoring of forest structure worldwide is increasingly being supported by refined and enhanced satellite mission datasets. Forest canopy height is a global metric to characterise and monitor dynamics in forest ecosystems worldwide. Satellite mapping missions as NASA???s Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) are creating opportunities to refine global forest canopy height models adding forest structural information to time-series satellite imagery. A recent global canopy height model presented by Lang et al., (2022) using GEDI and 10-m Sentinel-2 and the map from Potapov et al., (2020) using GEDI and Landsat are both tested in this study using multi-temporal tree-level data collected over eucalypt plantations in Brazil. Our results at plot-level showed Lang et al., (2022)'s estimates of canopy height came short compared to 2020 maximum and mean tree height records in the plots, 7.6 and 3.6 m, respectively, but adding CHM standard deviation improves the agreement of ground records for maximum tree height. Higher errors were computed for the plots in 2019 using the Potapov's 30-m CHM: 14.2 and 9.5 m, respectively. Averaged stand values were more similar between the three sources tested. We report improvement from the 30-m CHM to the 10-m, but still height saturation problems were observed when accounting for height differences in tall eucalypt trees. As more global products for forest height and biomass are becoming available to users, more validation exercises as presented in this study are needed to assess the suitability of CHM products to forestry needs, and facilitate the uptake and actionability of the next generation of global height and biomass products. We provide recommendations and insights on the use of GEDI laser data for global mapping and on the potential of commercial forestry areas to benchmark the accuracy of satellite mapping missions focusing on tree height estimation in the tropics.

TI  - Protecting our coast for everyone's future: Indigenous and scientific knowledge support marine spatial protections proposed by Central Coast First Nations in Pacific Canada
T2  - PEOPLE AND NATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - We, the Hailzaqv, Kitasoo Xai'xais, Nuxalk and Wuikinuxv First Nations, are the traditional stewards of our territories in the Central Coast of British Columbia, Canada. Our traditional laws obligate us to manage and protect our territories for current and future generations. Spatial management is inherent to our cultures through the Hereditary Chief governance system, in which specific people within a lineage inherit the rights and responsibilities for stewarding specific areas. Since the 19th century, we have been experiencing cultural disruptions caused by settler colonialism, which are now worsened by the declines of marine species vital to our cultures. These declines reflect fishery impacts exacerbated by climate change. Western fisheries management focuses on maximum sustained yields (MSY), ignoring body size declines that disrupt food webs and diminish population productivity for vertebrate and invertebrate taxa, thereby eroding resilience to climate change. The worldview encompassed by the MSY framework-take the most that you can without compromising future exploitation while assuming no environmental change-is the antithesis of ours-take only what you need and leave lots for the ecosystem. Furthermore, standard stock assessments do not account for uncertainties inherent to climate change effects on distributions and productivity, and many by-catch species are unassessed. Consistent with our traditional knowledge, scientific evidence indicates that marine protected areas (MPAs), coupled with other measures to reduce fishing mortality, can restore exploited species, safeguard biodiversity and contribute to fisheries sustainability. In the 2000s, we paired Indigenous knowledge and Western science to develop marine spatial plans. These plans are foundational in our contribution to the ongoing development of the Marine Protected Area Network for Canada's Northern Shelf Bioregion (MPAN-NSB), for which we are co-governance partners with 14 other First Nations and the governments of Canada and British Columbia. Our proposed spatial protections for the MPAN-NSB encompass areas important to many exploited taxa and to corals, sponges, eelgrass beds and other carbon stores. Their implementation would fill conservation gaps which have persisted under current fishery management. Given our history of spatial management through the Hereditary Chief governance system, the MPAN-NSB is a culturally appropriate way forward for marine conservation in our territories.

TI  - Flood vulnerability of a few areas in the foothills of the Western Ghats: a comparison of AHP and F-AHP models
T2  - STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Flooding is one of the most destructive natural catastrophes that can strike anywhere in the world. With the recent, but frequent catastrophic flood events that occurred in the narrow stretch of land in southern India, sandwiched between the Western Ghats and the Arabian Sea, this study was initiated. The goal of this research is to identify flood-vulnerable zones in this area by making the local self governing bodies as the mapping unit. This study also assessed the predictive accuracy of analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and fuzzy-analytical hierarchy process (F-AHP) models. A total of 20 indicators (nine physical-environmental variables and 11 socio-economic variables) have been considered for the vulnerability modelling. Flood-vulnerability maps, created using remotely sensed satellite data and geographic information systems, was divided into five zones. AHP and F-AHP flood vulnerability models identified 12.29% and 11.81% of the area as very high-vulnerable zones, respectively. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is used to validate these flood vulnerability maps. The flood vulnerable maps, created using the AHP and F-AHP methods, were found to be outstanding based on the area under the ROC curve (AUC) values. This demonstrates the effectiveness of these two models. The results of AUC for the AHP and F-AHP models were 0.946 and 0.943, respectively, articulating that the AHP model is more efficient than its chosen counterpart in demarcating the flood vulnerable zones. Decision-makers and land-use planners will find the generated vulnerable zone maps useful, particularly in implementing flood mitigation plans.

TI  - Assessing the predictive efficacy of six machine learning algorithms for the susceptibility of Indian forests to fire
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing numbers and intensity of forest fires indicate that forests have become susceptible to fires in the tropics. We assessed the susceptibility of forests to fire in India by comparing six machine learning (ML) algorithms. We identified the best-suited ML algorithms for triggering a fire prediction model, using minimal parameters related to forests, climate and topography. Specifically, we used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) fire hotspots from 2001 to 2020 as training data. The Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve (ROC/AUC) for the prediction rate showed that the Support Vector Machine (SVM) (ROC/AUC = 0.908) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) (ROC/AUC = 0.903) show excellent performance. By and large, our results showed that north-east and central India and the lower Himalayan regions were highly susceptible to forest fires. Importantly, the significance of this study lies in the fact that it is possibly among the first to predict forest fire susceptibility in the Indian context, using an integrated approach comprising ML, Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Climate Engine (CE).

TI  - Employing relaxed smoothness constraints on imaginary part of refractive index in AERONET aerosol retrieval algorithm
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) retrieval algorithm, smoothness constraints on the imaginary part of the refractive index provide control of retrieved spectral dependence of aerosol absorption by preventing the inversion code from fitting the noise in optical measurements and thus avoiding unrealistic oscillations of retrievals with wavelength. The history of implementation of the smoothness constraints in the AERONET retrieval algorithm is discussed. It is shown that the latest version of the smoothness constraints on the imaginary part of refractive index, termed standard and employed by Version 3 of the retrieval algorithm, should be modified to account for strong variability of light absorption by brown-carbon-containing aerosols in UV through mid-visible parts of the solar spectrum. In Version 3 strong spectral constraints were imposed at high values of the Angstrom exponent (440-870 nm) since black carbon was assumed to be the primary absorber, while the constraints became increasingly relaxed as aerosol exponent deceased to allow for wavelength dependence of absorption for dust aerosols. The new version of the smoothness constraints on the imaginary part of the refractive index assigns different weights to different pairs of wavelengths, which are the same for all values of the Angstrom exponent. For example, in the case of four-wavelength input, the weights assigned to short-wavelength pairs (440-675, 675-870 nm) are small so that smoothness constraints do not suppress natural spectral variability of the imaginary part of the refractive index. At longer wavelengths (870-1020 nm), however, the weight is 10 times higher to provide additional con- straints on the imaginary part of refractive index retrievals of aerosols with a high Angstrom exponent due to low sensitivity to aerosol absorption for longer channels at relatively low aerosol optical depths. The effect of applying the new version of smoothness constraints, termed relaxed, on retrievals of single-scattering albedo is analyzed for case studies of different aerosol types: black- and brown-carbon-containing fine mode aerosols, mineral dust coarse mode aerosols, and urban industrial fine mode aerosol. It is shown that for browncarbon-containing aerosols employing the relaxed smoothness constraints resulted in significant reduction in retrieved single-scattering albedo and spectral residual errors (compared to standard) at the short wavelengths. For example, biomass burning smoke cases showed a reduction in singlescattering albedo and spectral residual error at 380 nm of similar to 0.033 and similar to 17 %, respectively, for the Rexburg site and similar to 0.04 and similar to 12.7% for the Rimrock site, both AERONET sites in Idaho, USA. For a site with very high levels of blackcarbon-containing aerosols (Mongu, Zambia), the effect of modification in the smoothness constraints was minor. For mineral dust aerosols at small Angstrom exponent values (Mezaira site, UAE), the spectral constraint on the imaginary part of the refractive index was already relaxed in Version 3; therefore the new relaxed constraint results in minimal change. In the case of weakly absorbing urban industrial aerosols at the GSFC site, there are significant changes in retrieved single-scattering albedo using relaxed assumption, especially reductions at longer wavelengths: similar to 0.016 and similar to 0.02 at 875 and 1020 nm, respectively, for 440 nm aerosol optical depth (AOD) similar to 0.3.The modification of smoothness constraints on the imaginary part of the refractive index has a minor effect on retrievals of other aerosol parameters such as the real part of the refractive index and parameters of the aerosol size distribution. The implementation of the relaxed smoothness constraints on the imaginary part of the refractive index in the next version of the AERONET inversion algorithm will produce significant impacts at some sites in short wavelength channels (380 and 440 nm) for some biomass burning smoke cases with significant brown carbon content and possibly in mid-visible channels (500 and 675 nm) to near-infrared channels (870 to 1020 nm) for some urban industrial aerosol types. However, most differences in single-scattering albedo retrievals between those applying the new relaxed constraint and the standard constraint will be within the uncertainty of the single-scattering albedo retrievals, depending on the level of aerosol optical depth, Angstrom exponent, brown carbon content and wavelength.

TI  - Real-world trends in incidence of bacterial sexually transmissible infections among gay and bisexual men using HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in Australia following nationwide PrEP implementation: an analysis of sentinel surveillance data
T2  - LANCET INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Although data from large implementation trials suggest that sexually transmissible infection (STI) risk increases among gay and bisexual men who initiate HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), there are few data on the trends in population-level STI incidence in the years following widespread PrEP implementation. We aimed to describe trends in bacterial STI incidence among gay and bisexual men using PrEP across Australia in the context of broad PrEP availability through Australia's subsidised medicines scheme.Methods We analysed linked clinical data from HIV-negative gay and bisexual men aged 16 years or older who had been prescribed PrEP across a sentinel surveillance clinical network, including 37 clinics in Australia, between Jan 1, 2016, and Dec 31, 2019. Patients were included if they had STI testing at least twice during the observation period. Repeat testing methods were used to calculate chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis, and any STI incidence rates during individuals' periods of PrEP use. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for estimated change in incidence per half calendar year (6-month) period were calculated using negative binomial regression. Secondary analyses compared STI incidence rates across individuals initiating PrEP in each year from 2016 to 2019, as well as by length of time using PrEP (per each additional 6 months of PrEP use).Findings 22 730 men were included in the analyses. During the observation period, 11 351 chlamydia infections were diagnosed in 6630 (30.1%) of 22 034 men over 25 991.2 person-years of PrEP use (incidence rate 43.7 cases [95% CI 42.9-44.5] per 100 person-years). Chlamydia incidence decreased from 48.7 cases per 100 person-years in July-December, 2016, to 42.0 cases per 100 person-years in July-December, 2019 (IRR for estimated change per 6-month period 0.98 [95% CI 0.97-0.99]; p=0.0031). 9391 gonorrhoea infections were diagnosed in 5885 (26.9%) of 21 845 men over 24 858.7 person-years of PrEP use (incidence rate 37.8 cases [95% CI 37.0-38.5] per 100 person-years). Gonorrhoea incidence decreased from 45.5 cases per 100 person-years in July-December, 2016, to 37.2 cases per 100 person-years in July-December, 2019 (IRR 0.97 [95% CI 0.96-0.98]; p<0.0001). Declines in chlamydia and gonorrhoea incidence were most prominent in the first 18 months of observation and incidence was stable thereafter. 2062 syphilis infections were diagnosed in 1488 (7.7%) of 19 262 men over 21 978.9 person-years of PrEP use (incidence rate 9.4 cases [95% CI 9.0-9.8] per 100 person-years). Syphilis incidence increased from 6.2 cases per 100 person-years in July-December, 2016, to 9.8 cases per 100 person-years in July-December, 2019 (IRR 1.08 [95% CI 1.05-1.10]; p<0.0001).Interpretation Chlamydia and gonorrhoea incidence among gay and bisexual men using PrEP were highest in the early months of PrEP implementation in Australia and stabilised at slightly lower rates thereafter following wider PrEP uptake. Lower prospective STI risk among people initiating PrEP in later years contributed to the observed trends in STI incidence. Widespread PrEP implementation can contribute to increased STI screening and detection. Copyright (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Assessing impact of land-use changes on land surface temperature and modelling future scenarios of Surat, India
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the nexus between land use land cover (LULC) and land surface temperature (LST) of a rapidly growing city may help planners mitigate the effects of uncontrolled urbanization on the micro- and macro-environment. The primary focus of the study is to monitor the transient LULC of Surat, one of the rapidly growing cities in India. To comprehend the urban dynamics, the study analyses the tri-decadal LULC of Surat using temporal Landsat imagery corresponding to 1990, 2001, 2009, and 2020. Besides classification of satellite data to derive LULC using the maximum likelihood algorithm, emphasis has been given to evaluate the normalized difference vegetation index and normalized difference built-up index, which help in differentiating vegetation and built-up from other land-use types. In addition, the LST of Surat is computed, and zonal analysis is performed to examine its association with LULC. Results show that the built-up area of Surat increased by 3.22 times during the considered time, while the aerial extent of vegetation decreased by 1.58 times. Future land-use dynamics are predicted using the Markov model. Findings revealed that the built-up area is expected to increase by 20% between 2020 and 2030, while the vegetation area is likely to decrease by 13%. The developed model attained an accuracy of 52.08%, which is in agreement with the past studies. The findings of this study help urban planners and stakeholders to devise effective policies that can mitigate the detrimental effects of rapid urbanization on environment.

TI  - An automated extraction of small- and middle-sized rice fields under complex terrain based on SAR time series: A case study of Chongqing
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial assessment of rice cultivation area is a crucial activity, which is the foundation for the government to effectively improve the comprehensive rice production, promote the continuous increase of farmers' income and accelerate the construction of a modern rice industry system. In recent decades, large areas of arable land in Chongqing were converted to built-up land or restored to forests and grasses, resulting in a rapid decline in the rice planting area. Chongqing has an annual average of 104 cloudy and foggy days, the terrain is complex, and rice fields are generally fragmented with small-or middle-sized. How to timely obtain updated and accurate rice planting maps in Chongqing remains challenging. In this study, we processed 411 time series Sentinel-1A SAR scenes of vertical-horizontal polarization in 2020 over Chongqing, and analyzed the characteristics of rice phenological parameters under different terrain conditions, including rice transplanting date, mature grain date, length of growing season, rice agronomy flooding decline speed during sowing-transplanting period, and green -up speed during transplanting-mature period. On these bases, a decision tree algorithm integrating topographical features and rice phenological characteristics was proposed for collectively mapping patches of rice field. The identified rice results had user, producer, and overall accuracies of 0.96, 0.85 and 0.88, respectively. Meanwhile, SAR-derived rice area was compared against official rice statistical area at the county/district level with the correlation coefficient of 0.96. According to the rice map in 2020, there was a total area of 6125.70 km2 paddy rice in Chongqing, which was 6.27% lower than the data from the Chongqing statistical yearbook. Our study demonstrates the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed rice mapping method that comprehensively deliberate the topographical and rice phenological features in the complex landscapes with diverse crop types, small-medium sized and fragmented rice fields, and frequent cloudy and foggy weather.

TI  - The origins of resident macrophages in mammary gland influence the tumorigenesis of breast cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL IMMUNOPHARMACOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Macrophage is the important sentinel cell type of innate immune system, and bridge with the adaptive immune response via antigen presentation. Tissue-resident macrophages are universal in almost all organs and play essential roles in maintaining specific organ homeostasis, inflammation responses, and disease genesis, including tumorigenesis. Macrophage is generally divided into two extreme statuses, M1 and M2, with sophisticated continuous subtypes due to different stimuli and microenvironments. Tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) is regarded as the key factor related to the prognosis, staging, classification, and treatment strategy of various cancers. However, emerging evidence indicated potential opposite functions of TAM in different tumor models. Recent studies found that different originated resident macrophages show notably different profiles in the same tissue niche. More evidence pointed out that the strategies to repolarize the subtypes of TAM or resident mac-rophages are valuable in carcinoma treatments. In the breast cancer model, studies pointed that macrophages located differently in histology show obvious different cell markers and functions. In this review, we will illustrate the profiles of resident macrophages in breast cancer with various aspects, including origination, po-larization, tumoricidal activity, tumorigenesis, and the factors that could regulate the functions of macrophages.

TI  - Contrasted geomorphological and limnological properties of thermokarst lakes formed in buried glacier ice and ice-wedge polygon terrain
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - In formerly glaciated permafrost regions, extensive areas are still underlain by a considerable amount of glacier ice buried by glacigenic sediments. It is expected that large parts of glacier ice buried in the permafrost will melt in the near future, although the intensity and timing will depend on local terrain conditions and the magnitude and rate of future climate trends in different Arctic regions. The impact of these ice bodies on landscape evolution remains uncertain since the extent and volume of undisturbed relict glacier ice are unknown. These remnants of glacier ice buried and preserved in the permafrost contribute to the high spatial variability in ground ice condition of these landscapes, leading to the formation of lakes with diverse origins and morphometric and limnological properties. This study focuses on thermokarst lake initiation and development in response to varying ground ice conditions in a glacial valley on Bylot Island (Nunavut). We studied a lake-rich area using lake sediment cores, detailed bathymetric data, remotely sensed data and observations of buried glacier ice exposures. Our results suggest that initiation of thermokarst lakes in the valley was triggered from the melting of either buried glacier ice or intrasedimental ice and ice wedges. Over time, all lakes enlarged through thermal and mechanical shoreline erosion, as well as vertically through thaw consolidation and subsidence. Some of them coalesced with neighbouring water bodies to develop larger lakes. These glacial thermokarst lakes formed in buried glacier ice now evolve as "classic" thermokarst lakes that expand in area and volume as a result of the melting of intrasedimental ground ice in the surrounding material and the underlying glaciofluvial and till material. It is expected that the deepening of thaw bulbs (taliks) and the enlargement of Arctic lakes in response to global warming will reach undisturbed buried glacier ice where it is still present, which in turn will substantially alter lake bathymetry, geochemistry and greenhouse gas emissions from Arctic lowlands.

TI  - Lymphedema in Inflammatory Breast Cancer Patients Following Trimodal Treatment
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) is a debilitating sequela of breast cancer treatment and is becoming a greater concern in light of improved long-term survival. Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare and aggressive malignancy for which systemic therapy, surgery, and radiotherapy remain the standard of care, thereby making IBC patients highly susceptible to developing BCRL. This study evaluated BCRL in IBC following trimodal therapy. Methods IBC patients treated from 2016 to 2019 were identified from an institutional database. Patients were excluded if they presented with recurrent disease, underwent bilateral axillary surgery, did not complete trimodal therapy, or were lost to follow-up. Demographic, clinicopathologic factors, oncologic outcomes, and perometer measurements were recorded. BCRL was defined by clinician diagnosis and/or objective perometer measurements when available. Time to development of BCRL and treatment received were captured. Results Eighty-three patients were included. Median follow-up was 33 months. The incidence of BCRL was 50.6% (n = 42). Mean time to BCRL from surgery was 13 (range 2-24) months. Demographic and clinicopathologic features were similar between patients with and without BCRL with exception of higher proportion receiving delayed reconstruction in the BCRL group (38.1% vs. 14.6%, p = 0.03). Forty patients (95.2%) underwent BCRL treatment, which included physical therapy (n = 39), compression (n = 38), therapeutic lymphovenous bypass (n = 13), and/or vascularized lymph node transfer (n = 12). Conclusions IBC patients are at high-risk for BCRL after treatment, impacting 51% of patients in this cohort. Strategies to reduce or prevent BCRL and improve real-time diagnosis should be implemented to better direct early management in this patient population.

TI  - A simple proteinuria-based risk score predicts contrast-associated acute kidney injury after percutaneous coronary intervention
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Contrast-associated acute kidney injury (CA-AKI) is a complication of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Because proteinuria is a sentinel marker of renal dysfunction, we assessed its role in predicting CA-AKI in patients undergoing PCI. A total of 1,254 patients undergoing PCI were randomly assigned to a derivation (n = 840) and validation (n = 414) dataset. We identified the independent predictors of CA-AKI where CA-AKI was defined by the new criteria issued in 2020, by a multivariate logistic regression in the derivation dataset. We created a risk score from the remaining predictors. The discrimination and calibration of the risk score in the validation dataset were assessed by the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curves (AUC) and Hosmer-Lemeshow test, respectively. A total of 64 (5.1%) patients developed CA-AKI. The 3 variables of the risk score were emergency procedures, serum creatinine, and proteinuria, which were assigned 1 point each based on the correlation coefficient. The risk score demonstrated a good discriminative power (AUC 0.789, 95% CI 0.766-0.912) and significant calibration. It was strongly associated with the onset of CA-AKI (Cochran-Armitage test, p < 0.0001). Our risk score that included proteinuria was simple to obtain and calculate, and may be useful in assessing the CA-AKI risk before PCI.

TI  - Exploring personal and relational motivations and processes of forgiveness in religious families
T2  - FAMILY RELATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective and Background We used qualitative methodology to explore forgiveness motivations and processes in an ethnically, economically, and geographically diverse sample of 198 highly religious Christian, Muslim, and Jewish families in the United States (N = 480). Prior research has identified several significant relational implications and outcomes of forgiveness. However, there is a need for additional research on forgiveness processes and motivations among highly religious families. Method Families were interviewed jointly through a semistructured interview protocol. Analysis was conducted using thematic and team-based coding procedures. Results Core themes included (a) "Why forgive?": Relational, religious, and spiritual motivations; (b) "What enables state forgiveness?": Relational, religious, and spiritual processes; and (c) The role and development of trait forgiveness (forgivingness). Conclusion Findings highlight the relational, religious, and spiritual motivations and processes present in forgiveness and the role religious/spiritual beliefs and practices play in those processes. Additionally, findings illustrate participants' value of the virtue of forgivingness and reported religious and relational processes that helped in developing the trait of forgivingness. Implications We offer several questions that can be used as a starting point for practitioners to work within the worldview of religious clients to empower individuals, couples, and families to forgive.

TI  - Environmental controls of plankton community dynamics in a sub-tropical river system of Bangladesh
T2  - AQUATIC ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Surma River of Bangladesh is a representative of sub-tropical river system which is complex, dynamic and interacting socio-ecological system. Though land-based activities control the water quality of this river system, no studies have been conducted on the role of land-use patterns on water quality and biotic communities. Therefore, this study aimed to understand the impacts of water quality on the plankton community dynamics of Surma River basin. In addition, the study also examined the impacts of land-use patterns on water quality of river. Land-use patterns were identified by analyzing Landsat-8 imageries of the United State Geological Survey. Data on biotic and abiotic variables were collected from 15 sampling stations during dry season. Unsupervised and supervised classification techniques were used to identify the land-use patterns. Weighted arithmetic method was used to develop water quality index of river system. This study found four types of land-use patterns around Surma River basin (i.e., built-up area, barren land, river, vegetation and agriculture). Water quality index indicates that water quality is good in the rural area, while bad in the urban areas. Our study found that land-use pattern is a good predictor of water quality (R-2 = 0.97) of Surma River basin. Our study also found that high plankton species diversity coincides with the good water quality of the river. This study will serve as tool for the management of Surma River basin of Bangladesh.

TI  - Remotely sensed reservoir water storage dynamics (1984-2015) and the influence of climate variability and management at a global scale
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Many thousands of large dam reservoirs have been constructed worldwide during the last 70 years to increase reliable water supplies and support economic growth. Because reservoir storage measurements are generally not publicly available, so far there has been no global assessment of long-term dynamic changes in reservoir water volumes. We overcame this by using optical (Landsat) and altimetry remote sensing to reconstruct monthly water storage for 6695 reservoirs worldwide between 1984 and 2015. We relate reservoir storage to resilience and vulnerability and investigate interactions between precipitation, streamflow, evaporation, and reservoir water storage. This is based on a comprehensive analysis of streamflow from a multi-model ensemble and as observed at ca. 8000 gauging stations, precipitation from a combination of station, satellite and forecast data, and open water evaporation estimates. We find reservoir storage has diminished substantially for 23 % of reservoirs over the three decades, but increased for 21 %. The greatest declines were for dry basins in southeastern Australia (-29 %), southwestern USA (-10 %), and eastern Brazil (-9 %). The greatest gains occurred in the Nile Basin (+67 %), Mediterranean basins (+31 %) and southern Africa (+22 %). Many of the observed reservoir changes could be explained by changes in precipitation and river inflows, emphasizing the importance of multi-decadal precipitation changes for reservoir water storage. Uncertainty in the analysis can come from, among others, the relatively low Landsat imaging frequency for parts of the Earth and the simple geo-statistical bathymetry model used. Our results also show that there is generally little impact from changes in net evaporation on storage trends. Based on the reservoir water balance, we deduce it is unlikely that water release trends dominate global trends in reservoir storage dynamics. This inference is further supported by different spatial patterns in water withdrawal and storage trends globally. A more definitive conclusion about the impact of changes in water releases at the global or local scale would require data that unfortunately are not publicly available for the vast majority of reservoirs globally.

TI  - <i>Karenia brevis</i> bloom patterns on the west Florida shelf between 2003 and 2019: Integration of field and satellite observations
T2  - HARMFUL ALGAE
M3  - Article
AB  - Harmful algal blooms of the toxic dinoflagellate Karenia brevis occur almost annually on the West Florida Shelf (WFS) of the eastern Gulf of Mexico. To date, however, comprehensive assessments of K. brevis bloom spatial extent and temporal occurrence are lacking due to limitations in the two primary bloom monitoring techniques: microscopy evaluation of field-collected water samples and satellite remote sensing of ocean color. This is despite community efforts in expanding sampling coverage statewide and developing remote sensing algorithms to interpret color changes of surface waters. In this work, an approach is developed to combine the strengths of both techniques to estimate mean bloom occurrence frequency and bloom intensity as well as bloom extent at weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, and annual intervals between 2003 and 2019. Here, due to technical constraints on ocean color remote sensing, a bloom is defined as waters with K. brevis concentrations greater than 1.5 x 10(5) cells L-1. While microscopy examination of surface water samples provides K. brevis cell concentrations to help delineate bloom locations from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer on Aqua (MODIS/A) images, the imagery provides far more synoptic and frequent observations to make the bloom characterization statistically meaningful. Such derived bloom statistics often show bloom patterns that are not always known previously or at the time of the event, and in some years, they also differ from those determined from microscopic taxonomy data alone. For example, in terms of bloom size, two major bloom periods are observed in 2005 - 2007 and 2014 - 2018, respectively, when annual cumulative bloom size exceeded similar to 50,000 km(2). While preliminary in nature, the approach and results from this work may represent a first step to integrate water sample analysis and satellite remote sensing towards an improved characterization of K. brevis blooms on the WFS.

TI  - Crop classification based on phenology information by using time series of optical and synthetic-aperture radar images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop classification provides essential information for ensuring global food security, allowing early crop monitoring practices and water irrigation management. Despite of high importance of sat-ellite imagery in identifying agricultural products, a significant number of optical images could become inaccessible due to cloud cover, which makes mapping agricultural products difficult. Therefore, the provision of up-to-date data integration methods and the availability of time series of optical and radar images such as Sentinel-1 data have provided new opportunities for mapping agricultural products with high spatial and temporal resolution. In this study, the results of classification accuracy were investigated based on the phenology of agricultural products and using time series of Landsat 8, Sentinel-1 and the digital elevation model (DEM). To do so, the key phenological parameters of the products such as start of season, length of season and end of season were first extracted using time series of the NDVI vegetation index calculated from the optical images and the TIMESAT model. Then, based on vegetation phenology of crops using optical (Landsat-8) and radar (Sentinel-1) time series data along with Digital Elevation Model (DEM) to increase the accuracy of classification, we applied the support vector machine method based on machine learning. The performance of this model was investigated on a part of Mian-doab catchment basin located in the catchment of Lake Urmia in the northwest of Iran. Also, five major agricultural products of the study area, such as alfalfa, wheat, sugar beet, apple and grape were identified with overall accuracy of 89% using the support vector machine algorithm. Classification results demonstrated that using a combination of different data (overall accuracy (OA) = 89%, Kappa = 0.78) were more accurate than the only single-sensor inputs (OA = 77%, Kappa = 0.64), and when differences between crop types were largest, classification performance increased throughout the season until July.

AB  - Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is a prominent technology to assess the environmental changes in the open cast Limestone mining region. However, traditional EIA methods and Limestone deposit identification involves time consuming, cost effective and manpower requirements. We cope-up these problem and incorporated with different satellite image processing techniques and field studies to estimate the impact on environment. Landsat imageries have been used to calculate NDVI, NDWI, LULC, LST for the buffer zone within a 10 km radius of the mines from the period between 1997-2017. The noise pollution of the mining region is identified using a random sample method. To access water quality analysis in the area, the Water Quality Index (WQI) is generated using 12 water quality parameters. EIA is analyzed using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) and future EIA is also predicted using empirical Bayesian Kriging approach.

TI  - Use of the international classification of diseases (ICD)-11 method applied to veterinary forensic pathology for coding the cause and manner of death in wildlife
T2  - FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The growth of human population has led, in recent years, to increasingly frequent contacts with the wild animals with which we share the territory, sometimes leading to negative interactions with them. The purpose of the study is to apply the codes contained in the 11th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) method to investigate the cause and the manner of death, also to entrust the veterinarian with the task of recognizing and describing a suspected animal abuse as a sentinel indicator of violence toward humans and non-humans, thus expanding the concept of "One Health" from a forensic investigation perspective. The subjects recruited are wild mammals submitted for autopsy to the Pathology Unit of the Department of Veterinary Science, University of Parma, Italy, from 2015 to 2018. The manner and the cause of death of 167 wild animals of 16 different species have been investigated. When possible, an on-site inspection where the corpse was found was performed. Injuries were classified according to the on-line 11th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases method. Section 22 (Injury, poisoning or certain other consequences of external causes) was used to record the "immediate cause of death" (cause of death) and Section 23 (External causes of morbidity or mortality) was used to record the "underlying cause of death" (manner of death) for each animal. In most cases, death occurred as a result of road trauma but in some cases, abuse and voluntary killing were investigated. The recognition of non-accidental injuries is particularly important for both the defense in court of animals and for the connection between crimes committed against animals and against humans, known as "The Link". The use of the ICD-11 method, as a sort of summary of the autopsy report, was confirmed to be of great value for the clarity and simplicity of processing the data collected also by veterinary pathologists. The veterinary pathologists can use this evidence-based method with the aim of creating a national register and therefore, to understand the real extent of the human impact on wildlife and document it in a scientific and statistically usable way.

TI  - Boat encounter with the 2019 Java bioluminescent milky sea: Views from on-deck confirm satellite detection
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - "Milky seas" are massive swaths of uniformly and steadily glowing ocean seen at night. The phenomenon is thought to be caused by luminous bacteria, but details of milky sea composition, structure, cause, and implications in nature remain largely uncertain. Between late July and early September 2019, specialized low-light satellite sensors detected a possible bioluminescent milky sea south of Java, Indonesia, spanning >100,000 km(2). Upon learning of these findings, crew members of the yacht Ganesha reached out to confirm and share details of their personal encounter with this same event. Here, we document Ganesha's experience as recalled by the crew, compare their course to satellite data, and assess their photography of this milky sea.

TI  - "The world is so white": improving cultural safety in healthcare systems for Australian Indigenous people with rheumatic heart disease
T2  - AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To examine the views of senior health system knowledge holders, including Aboriginal experts, regarding the spaces where elimination strategies for rheumatic heart disease take place: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander ways of knowing, being and doing; and biomedical healthcare models. We aimed to support the implementation of the RHD Endgame Strategy by providing some of the 'how'. Methods: In-depth interviews were undertaken with 23 participants. The design of the interview questions and analysis of the data used strengths-based approaches as directed by Aboriginal researchers. Results: Given the dominance of the biomedical worldview, and the complex trajectory of RHD, there is significant tension in the intersection of worldviews. Tensions that limit productive dialogue are juxtaposed with suggestions on how to reduce tension through reflexivity, power shifting and endorsing Aboriginal leadership and governance. Evidence supported cultural safety for RHD care, prevention and elimination as the key action. Conclusions: Recommendations include addressing power imbalances between dominant and minority populations throughout the health system; reform that both supports and is supported by Non-Indigenous and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander leadership. Implications for public health: Increased understanding of and support for Indigenous leadership and cultural safety will enable implementation of the new RHD strategy.

T2  - ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 72nd International Astronautical Congress (IAC)
CL  - Dubai, U ARAB EMIRATES
AB  - Detecting anomalies in telemetry data captured on-board a spacecraft is critical to ensure its safe operation. Although there exist various techniques for automatically detecting point, contextual, and collective anomalies from time-series data, quantifying their performance remains under-researched. In this paper, we thoroughly validate our approach for the task of anomalous event detection that is built upon a two-stage technique, in which the telemetry signal is predicted using a long short-term memory network based on the historical data, and then the prediction is compared with the actual (captured) data. If the difference between those two is sufficiently large, we can infer that an anomalous event has happened. To evaluate the capabilities of such detection techniques over the simulated and benchmark time-series data, we investigate a set of commonly used metrics obtained for a range of anomaly detection approaches, and present their shortcomings, especially related to their inability of capturing the temporal aspects of the detectors. We tackle this issue by introducing new quality metrics which enable us to objectively verify if the detectors can timely spot the anomalies in sequential data. The experimental study showed that inferring the conclusions based on a subset of metrics can lead to biased observations, as the best algorithms determined based on the overlap metrics, including the Dice coefficient, do not necessarily correspond to the algorithms that offer the fastest detection. Finally, we discuss the Antelope Toolbox???our software tool for simulating nominal telemetry data of given characteristics, alongside well-defined anomalous events, and to perform the quantitative and qualitative analysis of anomaly detection algorithms over such simulated events.

TI  - 3D aneurysm wall enhancement is associated with symptomatic presentation
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROINTERVENTIONAL SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Aneurysm wall enhancement (AWE) is a potential surrogate biomarker for aneurysm instability. Previous studies have assessed AWE using 2D multiplanar methods, most of which were conducted qualitatively. Objective To use a new quantitative tool to analyze a large cohort of saccular aneurysms with 3D-AWE maps Methods Saccular aneurysms were imaged prospectively with 3T high resolution MRI. 3D-AWE maps of symptomatic (defined as ruptured or presentation with sentinel headache/cranial nerve neuropathy) and asymptomatic aneurysms were created by extending orthogonal probes from the aneurysm lumen into the wall. Three metrics were used to characterize enhancement: 3D circumferential AWE (3D-CAWE), aneurysm-specific contrast uptake (SAWE), and focal AWE (FAWE). Aneurysms with a circumferential AWE higher than the corpus callosum (3D-CAWE >= 1) were classified as 3D-CAWE+. Symptomatic presentation was analyzed with univariate and multivariate logistic models. Aneurysm size, size ratio, aspect ratio, irregular morphology, and PHASES and ELAPSS scores were compared with the new AWE metrics. Bleb and microhemorrhage analyses were also performed. Results Ninety-three aneurysms were analyzed. 3D-CAWE, SAWE, and FAWE were associated with symptomatic status (OR=1.34, 1.25, and 1.08, respectively). A multivariate model including aneurysm size, 3D-CAWE+, age, female gender, and FAWE detected symptomatic status with 80% specificity and 90% sensitivity (area under the curve=0.914, =0.967). FAWE was also associated with irregular morphology and high-risk location (p=0.043 and p=0.001, respectively). In general, blebs enhanced 56% more than the aneurysm body. Areas of microhemorrhage co-localized with areas of increased SAWE (p=0.047). Conclusions 3D-AWE mapping provides a new set of metrics that could potentially improve the identification of symptomatic aneurysms.

TI  - Pathological processing of sentinel lymph nodes in endometrial carcinoma - routine aspects of grossing, ultra-staging, and surgico-pathological parameters in a series of 833 lymph nodes
T2  - VIRCHOWS ARCHIV
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph nodes are widely accepted in the treatment of endometrial carcinoma. Whereas surgical aspects are well studied, the pathological work-up in terms of grossing, frozen section, and the so-called ultra-staging is still a matter of debate. This results in conflicting national or center-based recommendations. In a series of consecutive 833 sentinel lymph nodes from 206 patients in endometrial carcinomas, we compared three different grossing techniques and the use of frozen section in terms of anatomy, detection rates, and survival. In total, 42 macro-metastases, 6 micro-metastases, and 25 nodes with isolated tumor cells were found. Lymph nodes affected at least with micro-metastasis were about 0.5cm enlarged. Detection rates in lamellation technique increased with a step of 5.9% to 8.3% in comparison to bi-valved or complete embedding. The lamellation technique presented with a slight beneficial prognosis in pN0 subgroup (OS, p=0.05), which besides size effects might be attributed to trimming loss. In frozen section, this effect was less pronounced than expected (OS, p=0.56). Ultra-staging only revealed additional micro-metastases and isolated tumor cells. Exclusively, macro-metastases showed poor survival (p<0.001). In multivariate analysis, T-stage, subtype, and lympho-vascular invasion status outperformed this staging parameter significantly. Grossing of sentinel lymph nodes is the most essential step with evidence to prefer lamellation in 2 mm steps. Step sectioning should consider widely spaced protocols to exclude macro-metastases. Frozen sections might add value to the intra-operative assessment of endometrial carcinoma in selected cases. The excellent biological behavior of cases with isolated tumor cells might question the routine application of pan-cytokeratin as ultra-staging method.

TI  - Node Positivity Among Sonographically Suspicious but FNA-Negative Axillary Nodes
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Fine needle aspiration (FNA) of sonographically suspicious axillary lymph nodes is helpful to clinically stage patients and guide consideration of neoadjuvant therapy in breast cancer. However, data are limited for suspicious nodes that are FNA negative. Our goal is to compare the frequency of node positivity between patients with negative axillary ultrasound (AUSneg) versus suspicious AUS with negative FNA (FNAneg). Methods With IRB approval, we identified all clinically node-negative (cN0) patients with invasive breast cancer treated with upfront surgery at our tertiary care center between 2016 and 2021. AUS is routinely performed with FNA of suspicious lymph node(s). We compared clinicopathologic characteristics and nodal positivity rates between AUSneg and FNAneg groups. Results A total of 1580 cN0 patients with invasive breast cancer were analyzed, including 1240 AUSneg and 340 FNAneg patients. The FNAneg group was younger (median age 59.7 years versus 63.5 years, p < 0.001) and had higher clinical T (cT) category (29.1% versus 21.7% with cT2-cT4 disease, p = 0.005). Final axillary pathologic node positivity did not differ significantly between the AUSneg and FNAneg groups (16.5% versus 19.1%, p = 0.25). Among FNAneg patients, 58/340 (17.1%) had a clip placed, with retrieval confirmed in 28/58 (48.3%). Of the 28 retrieved clipped nodes, 27 were sentinel nodes. Final pathologic nodal status (pN+%) did not differ between patients in whom retrieval of the clipped node was confirmed versus not confirmed (28.6% versus 16.7%, p = 0.28). Conclusions Both patients with sonographically suspicious node(s) and negative FNA and patients with negative AUS have a similarly low chance of positive nodes. Additionally, routine targeted excision of FNA-negative clipped nodes is not warranted.

TI  - A high-resolution inland surface water body dataset for the tundra and boreal forests of North America
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Inland surface waters are abundant in the tundra and boreal forests of North America, essential to environments and human societies but vulnerable to climate changes. These high-latitude water bodies differ greatly in their morphological and topological characteristics related to the formation, type, and vulnerability. In this paper, we present a water body dataset for the North American high latitudes (WBD-NAHL). Nearly 6.5 million water bodies were identified, with approximately 6 million (similar to 90 %) of them smaller than 0.1 km(2). The dataset provides area and morphological attributes for every water body. During this study, we developed an automated approach for detecting surface water extent and identifying water bodies in the 10 m resolution Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite data to enhance the capability of delineating small water bodies and their morphological attributes. The approach was applied to the Sentinel-2 data acquired in 2019 to produce the water body dataset for the entire tundra and boreal forests in North America. The dataset provided a more complete representation of the region than existing regional datasets for North America, e.g., Permafrost Region Pond and Lake (PeRL). The total accuracy of the detected water extent by the WBD-NAHL dataset was 96.36% through comparison to interpreted data for locations randomly sampled across the region. Compared to the 30m or coarser-resolution water datasets, e.g., JRC GSW yearly water history, HydroLakes, and Global Lakes and Wetlands Database (GLWD), the WBD-NAHL provided an improved ability on delineating water bodies and reported higher accuracies in the size, number, and perimeter attributes of water body by comparing to PeRL and interpreted regional dataset. This dataset is available from the National Tibetan Plateau/Third Pole Environment Data Center (TPDC; http://data.tpdc.ac.cn, last access: 6 June 2022): https://doi.org/10.11888/Hydro.tpdc.271021 (Feng and Sui, 2020).

TI  - Structure-from-motion photogrammetry demonstrates that fine-scale seascape heterogeneity is essential in shaping mesophotic fish assemblages
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Benthic components of tropical mesophotic coral ecosystems (MCEs) are home to diverse fish assemblages, but the effect of multiscale spatial benthic characteristics on MCE fish is not well understood. To investigate the influence of fine-scale benthic seascape structure and broad-scale environmental characteristics on MCE fish, we surveyed fish assemblages in Seychelles at 30, 60 and 120 m depth using submersible video transects. Spatial pattern metrics from seascape ecology were applied to quantify fine-scale benthic seascape composition, configuration and terrain morphology from structure-from-motion photogrammetry and multibeam echosounder bathymetry and to explore seascape-fish associations. Hierarchical clustering using fish abundance and biomass data identified four distinct assemblages separated by the depth and geographic location, but also significantly influenced by variations in fine-scale seascape structure. Results further revealed variable responses of assemblage characteristics (fish biomass, abundance, trophic group richness, Shannon diversity) to seascape heterogeneity at different depths. Sites with steep slopes and high terrain complexity hosted higher fish abundance and biomass, with shallower fish assemblages (30-60 m) positively associated with aggregated patch mixtures of coral, rubble, sediment and macroalgae with variable patch shapes. Deeper fish assemblages (120 m) were positively associated with relief and structural complexity and local variability in the substratum and benthic cover. Our study demonstrates the potential of spatial pattern metrics quantifying benthic composition, configuration and terrain structure to delineate mesophotic fish-habitat associations. Furthermore, incorporating a finer-scale perspective proved valuable to explain the compositional patterns of MCE fish assemblages. As developments in marine surveying and monitoring of MCEs continue, we suggest that future studies incorporating spatial pattern metrics with multiscale remotely sensed data can provide insights will that are both ecologically meaningful to fish and operationally relevant to conservation strategies.

TI  - Impact of Preprocessing on Tree Canopy Cover Modelling: Does Gap-Filling of Landsat Time Series Improve Modelling Accuracy?
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Preprocessing of Landsat images is a double-edged sword, transforming the raw data into a useful format but potentially introducing unwanted values with unnecessary steps. Through recovering missing data of satellite images in time series analysis, gap-filling is an important, highly developed, preprocessing procedure, but its necessity and effects in numerous Landsat applications, such as tree canopy cover (TCC) modelling, are rarely examined. We address this barrier by providing a quantitative comparison of TCC modelling using predictor variables derived from Landsat time series that included gap-filling versus those that did not include gap-filling and evaluating the effects that gap-filling has on modelling TCC. With 1-year Landsat time series from a tropical region located in Taita Hills, Kenya, and a reference TCC map in 0-100 scales derived from airborne laser scanning data, we designed comparable random forest modelling experiments to address the following questions: 1) Does gap-filling improve TCC modelling based on time series predictor variables including the seasonal composites (SC), spectral-temporal metrics (STMs), and harmonic regression (HR) coefficients? 2) What is the difference in TCC modelling between using gap-filled pixels and using valid (actual or cloud-free) pixels? Two gap-filling methods, one temporal-based method (Steffen spline interpolation) and one hybrid method (MOPSTM) have been examined. We show that gap-filled predictors derived from the Landsat time series delivered better performance on average than non-gap-filled predictors with the average of median RMSE values for Steffen-filled and MOPSTM-filled SC's being 17.09 and 16.57 respectively, while for non-gap-filled predictors, it was 17.21. MOPSTM-filled SC is 3.7% better than non-gap-filled SC on RMSE, and Steffen-filled SC is 0.7% better than non-gap-filled SC on RMSE. The positive effects of gap-filling may be reduced when there are sufficient high-quality valid observations to generate a seasonal composite. The single-date experiment suggests that gap-filled data (e.g. RMSE of 16.99, 17.71, 16.24, and 17.85 with 100% gap-filled pixels as training and test datasets for four seasons) may deliver no worse performance than valid data (e.g. RMSE of 15.46, 17.07, 16.31, and 18.14 with 100% valid pixels as training and test datasets for four seasons). Thus, we conclude that gap-filling has a positive effect on the accuracy of TCC modelling, which justifies its inclusion in image preprocessing workflows.

TI  - Innovation in Breast Surgery: Practical and Ethical Considerations
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The adoption of innovation is essential to the evolution of patient care. Breast surgical oncology advances through incorporating new techniques, devices, and procedures. Historical changes in practice standards from radical to modified radical mastectomy or axillary node dissection to sentinel node biopsy reduced morbidity without sacrifice in oncologic outcome. Contemporary oncoplastic techniques afford broader consideration for breast conservation and the potential for improved cosmetic outcomes. At present, many breast surgeons face the decision of which wireless device to use for localization of nonpalpable lesions. Consideration for future changes, such as robotic mastectomy, are on the horizon. No guideline exists to assist breast surgeons in the adoption of innovation into practice. The Ethics Committee of the American Society of Breast Surgeons acknowledges that breast surgeons confront many questions associated with onboarding innovation. This paper aims to provide a framework for asking relevant questions along with the ethical principles to consider when integrating an innovation into practice.

TI  - An analysis of the recent fire regimes in the Angolan catchment of the Okavango Delta, Central Africa
T2  - FIRE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background This paper presents an analysis of fire regimes in the poorly studied Angolan catchment of the Okavango Delta in Botswana. We used MODIS data to examine the frequency and seasonality of fires over 20 years (from 2000 to 2020) in three dominant vegetation types (miombo woodlands, open woodlands and grasslands, and short closed to open bushlands), and in areas where people were present, and where they were absent. Results The median fire return intervals for both open woodlands and grasslands and short bushlands were relatively short (1.9 and 2.2 years respectively). In miombo woodlands, fires were less frequent (median return periods of 4.5 years). Human population density had no discernible effect on the fire return intervals, but about 14% of the miombo woodlands experienced no fires over 20 years. Ongoing shifting cultivation within miombo woodlands has led to structural changes and the introduction of fire into this vegetation type where fires were rare or absent in the past. About 12% of the miombo did not burn during the period examined where people were present, whereas close to 20% of the sites remained unburnt where people were absent. This suggests that people did not change the fire return interval in any of the vegetation types studied, but that they altered the amount of the landscape that is flammable in miombo vegetation. Fires occurred between June and September, with a peak in the late dry season (August and September). Conclusions Historical research indicates that late dry-season fires are detrimental to miombo woodlands, and our analysis suggests that degradation in parts of the catchment has led to the introduction of fire to this previously fire-free and fire-sensitive vegetation type. Deforestation of miombo woodlands, and the consequent introduction of fire, is a cause for concern with respect to the ecological stability of the Okavango Delta. Managers should therefore aim to protect the remaining closed-canopy miombo stands from further clearing and to attempt to shift the timing of burns to the early dry season to reduce their intensity.

AB  - This paper examines the role of ideas and identities in the making of the AKP's foreign policy in Turkey. After briefly examining the institutional and international constraints on Turkish foreign policy before 2002, the discussion turns to the driving factors in three evolutionary stages of AKP's foreign policy. It becomes apparent that a neo-Ottoman worldview and accompanying identity constitute the interpretive framework of the AKP's political elite. The article traces how this worldview became dominant in Turkey's policy making after the government dismantled the country's Kemalist institutions and the AKP consolidated its political power.

This study evaluates the spatial and temporal changes in coral community attributes (diversity, live cover, and coral assemblage structure) over 14 years (2005-2019) at Clipperton, an extremely remote Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP) atoll. The atoll exhibited overall high coral cover (similar to 50-60%) dominated by massive species (Porites spp.), yet we observed large variation (44-56%) in coral community attributes among survey years (2005, 2016, 2019) with depth explaining most of the variation. Live coral cover increased in 2019 after a severe thermal stress event (El Nino, 2015-2016) and many tropical cyclones, which also caused a shift in assemblage structure from branching Pocillopora to massive Porites in the shallower reef zones, resulting in a less well-defined depth gradient. These changes in coral assemblage structure may have long-term effects on the configuration of the physical reef framework of the well-conserved coral reef ecosystems at Clipperton and consequently may alter the ecological functionality of one of the most important biogeographic stepping stones in the central Pacific and ETP regions.

TI  - Coastal Zone Changes in West Africa: Challenges and Opportunities for Satellite Earth Observations
T2  - SURVEYS IN GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The West African coastal population and ecosystems are increasingly exposed to a multitude of hazards. These are likely to be exacerbated by global climate change and direct impacts from local human activities. Our ability to understand coastal changes has been limited by an incomplete understanding of the processes and the difficulty of obtaining detailed data. Recent advances in satellite techniques have made it possible to obtain rich coastal data sets that provide a solid foundation for improving climate change adaptation strategies for humanity and increasing the resilience of ecosystems for sustainable development. In this article, we review West African coastal layout and current socio-environmental challenges together with key parameters that can be monitored and several coastal management programs that rely on satellite techniques to monitor indicators at the regional level. The social, technical and scientific problems and difficulties that hinder the interest of coastal practitioners and decision-makers to use the satellite data are identified. We provide a roadmap to precisely respond to these difficulties and on how an improved satellite earth observation strategy can better support future coastal zone management in West Africa.

TI  - Osteoclast-like stromal giant cells in invasive ductal breast cancer: A case series
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Breast Cancer with osteoclast-like stromal giant cells (OLGCs) is a rare pattern of invasive non -special type ductal carcinoma. The OLGCs are specific type of macrophage and are likely distinct from true osteoclasts. The aim of this case series was to describe the characteristics of this invasive ductal carcinoma rare histotype. Presentation of cases: The authors present the cases of two young women that, during national screening, discovered with mammography X-ray a breast lump suspected for malignancy. The core needle biopsy confirmed the malignancy of both nodule and in one patient the histological analysis revealed pre-operative OLGCs. In both cases the sentinel lymph node biopsy was negative therefore a quadrantectomy without axillary lymphadenec-tomy was done. The definitive histopathological examination was positive for invasive ductal carcinoma with OLGCs and CD 68 marker positivity. After surgery, patients underwent adjuvant therapy and multidisciplinary follow-up. Discussion: The origin and mechanism for developing osteoclast-like giant cells is unknown. The OLGCs directly descend from the precursors of the monocyte-macrophage. The rarity of this entity often promotes a misleading diagnosis, with >50 % of erroneous diagnosis of benign lesion. The prognostic significance of OLGCs in breast cancer is controversial, however it doesn't seem to influence the axillary lymph nodes spread. The presence of preoperative OLGCs didn't modify our surgical and oncological approach. Conclusion: Breast Cancer with OLGCs is a rare tumour that has a similar prognosis to other carcinomas of identical grade and stage in most cases. The rarity and characteristics of this neoplasm require personalized treatments, discussed by a multidisciplinary team.

TI  - Early validation study of the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from the GCOM-C satellite in Mongolian grasslands
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Global Change Observation Mission-Climate (GCOM-C), launched in 2017, has suitable bands matching the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) definition. It also has the bands for the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The PRI has a unique capability to detect plant stress caused by excessive light and drought. However, no moderate-resolution satellites had suitable bands for the PRI, requiring two narrow bands in green light in the definition. In this study, we conducted the early validation study of PRI and NDVI derived from the GCOM-C satellite and demonstrated those accuracies and characteristics in Mongolian grassland. The Mongolian Steppes (dry grasslands) are widely distributed on the plateau and therefore suitable for satellite validation. It is particularly suitable for the PRI validation because Mongolian grasslands have water stress due to the small amount of precipitation in summer. Therefore, we carried out field campaigns at three study sites in Mongolia. In this study, we found the seasonal pattern of PRI suggesting the potential to detect the water stress of vegetation, which is essential information for informed management of the grasslands. However, the correlation between the satellite-derived PRI and the in-situ PRI was negative because of the dependence of GCOM-C PRI on the soil moisture at sparse vegetation. For the accuracy assessment of PRI, which depends on rapidly changing light and soil moisture in a day, more exact synchronization of in-situ and satellite observation is required. On the other hand, we found that the NDVI derived from GCOM-C was highly accurate: The correlation coefficient (R) between the satellite-derived NDVI and the in-situ NDVI was 0.988 (RMSE=0.052). GCOM-C NDVI has enough similarities with MODIS NDVI in terms of accuracy, spatial resolution, and frequency. For example, we demonstrated that GCOM-C NDVI could detect the phenology with the same or better accuracy than MODIS NDVI. We also demonstrated their difference: the soil moisture dependence in sparse vegetation. The less dependency of GCOM-C NDVI on the soil moisture leads to a better classification of vegetation and non-vegetation in the sparse grassland than MODIS NDVI.

TI  - In-orbit geometric calibration of multi-linear array optical remote sensing satellites with tie constraints
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - When some sub-images lack ground control points (GCPs) or GCPs are not evenly distributed, the estimated camera parameters are often deviated in in-orbit geometric calibration. In this study, a feasible in-orbit geometric calibration method for multi-linear array optical remote sensing satellites with tie constraints is presented. In the presented method, both GCPs and tie points are employed. With the help of tie constraints provided by tie points, all charge coupled devices (CCDs) are logically connected into a complete CCD. The internal camera parameters of all CCDs can then be simultaneously and precisely estimated, even if sufficient evenly distributed GCPs in some sub-images are unavailable. Three GaoFen-6 images and two ZiYuan3-02 images were tested. Compared with the conventional method, the experimental results showed that the deviations of the estimated camera parameters could be effectively eliminated by the presented method. The average geometric stitching accuracy of the adjacent sub-images of all the tested images were improved from approximately 0.5 pixel to 0.1 pixel. The geometric quality of the stitched images was thereby improved. (C) 2022 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI  - Fine scale variability in Green Vegetation Fraction Over the Southern Great Plains using Sentinel-2 satellite: A case study
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We estimate the green vegetation fraction (GVF) at high spatial resolution (10 m) by applying a new method based on image histogram equalization and utilizing images with multiple spectral bands from Sentinel-2 satellite observations. True color and multi-spectral images at 10 m resolu-tion are used over 50 x 50 km2 domain centered on the US Department of Energy (DOE) Atmos-pheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) site over the Southern Great Plains to recognize green pix-els and estimate the vegetation fraction. The GVF retrieved from several spectral bands is com-pared with Sentinel-2 true color images, Sentinel-3, MODIS vegetation products, and observa-tions from the US DOE research aircraft on selected days from the Holistic Interactions of Shallow Clouds, Aerosols, and Land-Ecosystems (HI-SCALE) campaign. Unlike MODIS or Sentinel-3, our approach to retrieve the GVF is independent of absolute reflectance or photosynthetic response. Spatial patterns in vegetation distribution are similar in all three satellite approaches, however MODIS underestimates the vegetation cover by about 10% compared to the Sentinel-2,-3 re-trievals over the study domain. The largest contrast in MODIS and Sentinel-2,-3 is found when the GVF is less than 0.2 or greater than 0.9, likely as a result of different retrieval approaches and spectral bands used to estimate the vegetation products. The NDVI retrieved from MODIS is also underestimated compared to the aircraft observations suggesting that MODIS underestimates both NDVI and GVF. In the past, various satellite observations have been used to retrieve the veg-etation fraction at medium (0.25-0.50 km) and coarser resolutions (15 km) but our approach is extended to a much higher (10 m) resolution. Our analysis from Sentinel-2 shows large spatial variability in GVF and a clear disparity with estimates from MODIS and Sentinel-3 satellites. The new approach to estimate GVF has the potential to increase spatial accuracy and precision of sur-face properties relevant for crop and forest management, surface and energy balance processes, and land surface parameterizations in atmospheric models.

TI  - Methods and technologies for spatial analysis of regional ecosystems based on the watershed approach
T2  - INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The watershed management approach is an efficient tool for organizing and implementing natural resource management at the regional and interregional levels. Statistical processing of watershed information contributes to a comprehensive assessment of the environment of the river watersheds at different hierarchical levels. The purpose of this work is to use spatial analysis and data simulation for assessing the state of ecosystems in hydrologically defined geographical areas such as watersheds. The minimal watersheds of the "pilot" territory of four watersheds in Eastern Siberia with an average area of approximately 1ha are used as elementary territorial units. For each watershed, spatial analysis tools form a set of attributes of unique natural characteristics, which are obtained using ground and satellite data. Such a set of attributes can be used to assess the state of the territory employing various methods of mathematical modeling and statistical and cluster analysis. Watershed modeling of the territory was carried out based on the MERIT Hydro digital elevation model. Based on Terra MODIS satellite information, data on temperature, vegetation indices, and vegetation cover were obtained for each watershed. The NASA Global Precipitation Measurement reanalysis data were used to generate the data on accumulated precipitation for all elementary watersheds. Analysis of the seasonal dynamics of the surface temperature in the study area was made, and statistical distributions of temperature variations during the year were obtained for each watershed. Effective temperature sum was calculated. Statistical values and average annual characteristics of trends in several vegetation indices were obtained for each watershed. The necessary methods and technologies for generating, storing, and processing data on each watershed have been developed. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2022;00:1-8. (c) 2021 SETAC

TI  - A hierarchical network densification approach for reconstruction of historical ice velocity fields in East Antarctica
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate ice flow velocity data are essential for studying the mass balance of the Antarctic ice sheet. However, there is a lack of ice velocity maps of 1960s-80s in basin-wide regions or the entire ice sheet. In this study, an enhanced hierarchical network densification approach is developed for basin-wide Antarctic velocity mapping using historical ARGON and Landsat images. The produced multiple historical velocity maps from 1963 to 1989 in the region of the Fimbul and Jelbart ice shelves, East Antarctica, achieved an accuracy better than 29 m a(-1). They revealed that the ice flow velocity had no significant changes over the period. Combining the surface mass balance estimate with the ice discharge estimated from our historical velocity maps and recently published velocity maps, we estimated a positive mass balance of 8.6 +/- 3.9 Gt a(-1) in the study area from 1963 and 2015. Our results indicate that the region's positive mass balance, as estimated in recently published studies, has been maintained since the 1960s. It is also in concordance with the low level of mass balance from 1992 to 2017 in East Antarctica. This suggests that the study area has been stable since the 1960s.

TI  - Fast robust fuzzy clustering based on bipartite graph for hyper-spectral image classification
T2  - IET IMAGE PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyper-spectral image (HSI) clustering has become a hot spot in remote sensing image research. However, due to the large amount and high dimension of HSI data, some traditional image clustering methods are no longer suitable, and even lead to poor clustering performance and long computing time. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel clustering method for HSI to make up for the shortcomings of traditional clustering methods. Firstly, a fuzzy similarity matrix is constructed by using the bipartite graph to obtain low-dimensional hyper-spectral data, which can reduce the complexity and the operation time of the algorithm. Secondly, fuzzy membership mapping is carried out through the constructed bipartite graph, and a non-negative regularization term is added to limit ill-conditioned problems. Thirdly, this paper uses the Geman-McClure function to optimize Euclidean distance. Finally, in this paper, the spectral information of HSI is considered while the neighbourhood information of HSI is added to achieve the unity of space spectrum, which enhances the robustness of the algorithm and improves the clustering performance of the algorithm. Compared with existing HSI clustering algorithms, the proposed algorithm has higher clustering accuracy and efficiency.

TI  - Remote Detection of Hydrothermal Alteration Zones Using WorldView-3 VNIR-SWIR Reflectance Data: A Study from Lawa Gold Mines, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - WorldView-3 sensor with higher spectral and spatial resolution provides greater opportunity to map the hydrothermal alteration zones. Advancement of remote sensing techniques have been manifold in the field of mineral and alteration mapping enabling subpixel level mineral identification. However, remote mapping of alteration zone in vegetated terrain still remains challenging. The present work is aimed at mapping of hydrothermal alteration zones in a sparsely vegetated terrain using high resolution WorldView-3 data. Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF), Spectral Information Divergence classification (SID) and Selective Principal Component Analysis (SPCA) techniques are used collectively for mapping different alteration zones. The alteration minerals mapping has been further supported by laboratory spectroscopy methods, field observation and petrographic microscopic study. A comprehensive analysis on the ability of different techniques to detect the alteration zone in a sparsely vegetated terrain named Lawa mines, North Singhbhum Mobile Belt has been documented in this paper. Image-derived reflectance spectra corresponding to field locations have been used for SID classification and an accuracy of 78% is obtained for the current study. The vegetation covered areas have been classified as vegetated using both MNF and SID techniques. Besides, the SPCA results have better highlighted all the alteration zones present in the area by suppressing the vegetation effects. While MNF provides a broad overview of the spectrally different litho-units, SID classification gives more detailed pixel wise classification of various rock types present and furthermore SPCA method highlights various alteration types present in the area. Therefore, combined MNF, SID and SPCA can provide a detailed alteration map of the sparsely vegetated region. Ferruginisation, silicification, sericitization, and chloritization types of alterations primarily observed in both mesoscopic and microscopic scale. Ferruginisation and silicification alteration are predominant types among all. These alterations are also evident in hosting mineralization of Au, Ag, Cu and Rare Earth Elements. Mineralization is primarily associated with various rocks, such as quartz vein, quartzite and talc chlorite sericite schist.

T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - When publishing socioeconomic survey data, survey programs implement a variety of statistical methods designed to preserve privacy but which come at the cost of distorting the data. We explore the extent to which spatial anonymization methods to preserve privacy in the large-scale surveys supported by the World Bank Living Standards Measurement Study-Integrated Surveys on Agriculture (LSMS-ISA) introduce measurement error in econometric estimates when that survey data is integrated with remote sensing weather data. Guided by a pre-analysis plan, we produce 90 linked weather-household datasets that vary by the spatial anonymization method and the remote sensing weather product. By varying the data along with the econometric model we quantify the magnitude and significance of measurement error coming from the loss of accuracy that results from privacy protection measures. We find that spatial anonymization techniques currently in general use have, on average, limited to no impact on estimates of the relationship between weather and agricultural productivity. However, the degree to which spatial anonymization introduces mismeasurement is a function of which remote sensing weather product is used in the analysis. We conclude that care must be taken in choosing a remote sensing weather product when looking to integrate it with publicly available survey data.

TI  - Tilmanocept as a novel tracer for lymphatic mapping and sentinel lymph node biopsy in melanoma and oral cancer
T2  - ANZ JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has been pivotal for pathological assessment of nodal status in cutaneous melanoma (CM) and oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC) thus crucial for staging. An ideal agent for lymphatic mapping should have a standardized preparation, appropriate accumulation in first-echelon nodes and no side effects. Tilmanocept, a CD206-receptor targeted novel radiotracer fulfils these properties. This study investigated Tilmanocept for lymphoscintigraphy and intraoperative identification of sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) in CM and OCSCC. Methods This prospective cross sectional study examined patients who presented to Crown Princess Mary Cancer Centre, Westmead Hospital, Sydney. Patients had biopsy proven tumours with clinically and radiologically negative regional lymph nodes. Tilmanocept guided lymphoscintigraphy was followed by intraoperative SLNs identification via handheld gamma probe. Primary endpoints were detection and retrieval rate of SLNs while secondary endpoints included pathological status of SLNs. Results Thirty-five patients were included (26 with CM and 9 with OCSCC) with the most common primary tumour site for CM on the extremities (33.3%). Lymphoscintigraphy with Tilmanocept identified at least 1 SLN (sensitivity 100%) in all patients. SLNs were retrieved in all of patients intraoperatively (100% retrieval rate) with positive nodes found in 20% of patients. Tilmanocept also demonstrated 100% tissue specificity, with lymph nodal tissue confirmed histologically, with no false positives. Conclusion Tilmanocept is a reliable radiotracer for assessing the nodal status in patients with CM and OCSCC. Our group is the first to evaluate the use of Tilmanocept in the Australian setting, adding to the limited studies worldwide.

TI  - Challenging the link between functional and spectral diversity with radiative transfer modeling and data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In a context of accelerated human-induced biodiversity loss, remote sensing (RS) is emerging as a promising tool to map plant biodiversity from space. Proposed approaches often rely on the Spectral Variation Hypothesis (SVH), linking the heterogeneity of terrestrial vegetation to the variability of the spectroradiometric signals. Yet, due to observational limitations, the SVH has been insufficiently tested, remaining unclear which metrics, methods, and sensors could provide the most reliable estimates of plant biodiversity. Here we assessed the po-tential of RS to infer plant biodiversity using radiative transfer simulations and inversion. We focused specifically on "functional diversity," which represents the spatial variability in plant functional traits. First, we simulated vegetation communities and evaluated the information content of different functional diversity metrics (FDMs) derived from their optical reflectance factors (R) or the corresponding vegetation "optical traits," estimated via radiative transfer model inversion. Second, we assessed the effect of the spatial resolution, the spectral char-acteristics of the sensor, and signal noise on the relationships between FDMs derived from field and remote sensing datasets. Finally, we evaluated the plausibility of the simulations using Sentinel-2 (multispectral, 10 m pixel) and DESIS (hyperspectral, 30 m pixel) imagery acquired over sites of the Functional Significance of Forest Biodiversity in Europe (FunDivEUROPE) network. We demonstrate that functional diversity can be inferred both by reflectance and optical traits. However, not all the FDMs tested were suited for assessing plant functional diversity from RS. Rao's Q index, functional dispersion, and functional richness were the best-performing metrics. Furthermore, we demonstrated that spatial resolution is the most limiting RS feature. In agreement with simu-lations, Sentinel-2 imagery provided better estimates of plant diversity than DESIS, despite the coarser spectral resolution. However, Sentinel-2 offered inaccurate results at DESIS spatial resolution. Overall, our results identify the strengths and weaknesses of optical RS to monitor plant functional diversity. Future missions and biodiversity products should consider and benefit from the identified potentials and limitations of the SVH.

TI  - Atmospheric diffuse transmittance of the linear polarization component of water-leaving radiation
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The polarization characteristics of water-leaving radiation contain rich information on oceanic constituents. Determining the atmospheric diffuse transmittance is crucial for extracting the polarization information of water-leaving radiation from the radiation acquired by polarimetry satellites at the top of the atmosphere. However, there is still a lack of understanding of the atmospheric diffuse transmittance of the linear polarization component of water-leaving radiation. Here, we first evaluated the difference between the atmospheric diffuse transmittance of the linear polarization component (T-Q, T-U) and the intensity component (T-I) of the water-leaving radiation based on the Ocean Successive Orders with Atmosphere Advanced radiative transfer model. As a consequence, there were apparent differences between T-Q, T-U and T-I. In the case of a large solar zenith angle and a large viewing zenith angle, the difference between T-Q, T-U and T-I will exceed 1. Meanwhile, compared with T-I, the oceanic constituents had a prominent interference with T-Q and T-U, and the sediment concentration had little interference with T-Q and T-U in lowand medium-turbidity water with respect to the aerosol model, optical thickness, observation geometry, and phytoplankton. Moreover, T-Q and T-U lookup tables were generated for mediumand low-turbidity water, which laid the foundation for extracting the water-leaving radiation polarization information from the satellite observation polarization signal.

TI  - How Often Do Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Results Affect Adjuvant Therapy Decisions Among Postmenopausal Women with Early-Stage HR<SUP>+</SUP>/HER2<SUP>-</SUP> Breast Cancer in the Post-RxPONDER Era?
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The RxPONDER trial reported no benefit to chemotherapy among postmenopausal patients with HR+/HER2(-) tumors, one to three positive nodes, and low recurrence scores, questioning the role of axillary staging in this population. Here, we evaluate the impact of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) results on adjuvant therapy decisions in postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2(-) breast cancer. Patients and Methods Postmenopausal women with cT1-2N0, HR+/HER2(-) breast cancer treated with lumpectomy and SLNB from 2012 to 2018 were identified. Receipt of nodal irradiation, indication for axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) and chemotherapy, and partial breast irradiation (PBI) eligibility were reviewed with pre- and post-SLNB results. Results A total of 1786 women were identified: median age 62 years, 84% with pT1 tumors, and 16% with pT2-3 tumors. Of those, 85% (n = 1525) remained pN0, 14% (n = 244) were pN1, and 1% (n = 17) were pN2-3. A total of 20 (1%) patients had > 2 positive SLNs, necessitating ALND. Pre-SLNB, 1478 women were considered PBI eligible; post-SLNB, 227 (13%) converted to PBI ineligible. In total, 58 patients with positive nodes received nodal irradiation, representing 3% of the entire cohort and 22% of pN+ patients. Overall, 1401 patients had an Oncotype DX recurrence score available, including 1273 patients with pN0 stage and 128 with pN1, with 173 (14%) and 16 (13%), respectively, having a recurrence score > 25, warranting chemotherapy. Conclusions While few cN0 postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2(-) tumors had nodal pathology that warranted ALND, receipt of nodal irradiation, or indicated need for chemotherapy, in 13%, SLNB would have an impact on consideration for PBI. Among patients eligible for PBI, findings from SLNB may help refine selection among postmenopausal women with this tumor profile.

TI  - High-resolution spatio-temporal characteristics of urban evapotranspiration measured by unmanned aerial vehicle and infrared remote sensing
T2  - BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) cooling of urban spaces is an effective and economical way to improve the urban thermal environment. However, the distribution of urban ET rate is typically unknown owing to the high heterogeneity of urban land covers, which limits the application of many conventional techniques for measuring ET, such as ground-based observations and satellite remote sensing. In this study, an improved approach called "UAV + IRs + 3T", combining unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), thermal infrared remote sensing, and a threetemperature model (3T), was developed for estimating urban ET and validated by Bowen ratio method. Results showed that the proposed method could accurately measure urban LE with R2 = 0.95, MAE = 21.98 W m- 2, RMSE = 30.33 W m- 2, RRMSE =19.65%. The proposed method could obtain urban ET with an ultra-high spatial resolution (approximately 15.5 cm) and temporal resolution (once per hour). Furthermore, 9 plant species distributed across the 18 sample plots showed significant differences in mean intra-day ET rates. Even for the same plant species at different sites, such as Ficus concinna and Zoysia matrella, their average intra-day ET rates differed by 50% and 400%, respectively. These large differences could be attributed to artificial pavement and infrastructure, different artificial irrigation methods, and difference in artificial and natural shade. In conclusion, there is spatio-temporal variability in urban ET rates, which can be precisely revealed by the proposed method. Therefore, the "UAV + IRs + 3T" method has the potential for a wide range of applications in urban environmental planning.

TI  - A dual-stream high resolution network: Deep fusion of GF-2 and GF-3 data for land cover classification
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover classification (LCC) is an important application in remote sensing data interpretation and invariably faces big intra-class variance and sample imbalance in remote sensing images. The optical image is obtained by satellites capturing the spectral information of the Earth's surface, and the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image is produced by the satellite actively transmitting and receiving the electromagnetic wave signals reflected from land covers. Because of the limitations of the optical image, a single modality (optical image) might be disturbed by external conditions, especially complex weather. Using heterogeneous SAR and optical images for LCC can reduce the negative impact caused by single-modal data damage, and multi-modal data can also be used as supplementary information to enhance classification accuracy. However, general LCC methods mainly focus on remote sensing data of a single modality without fully considering the multi-modalities of land covers. Therefore, we propose a dual-stream deep high-resolution network (DDHRNet) to deeply integrate SAR and optical data at the feature level in every branch. The network can effectively exploit the complementary information in heterogeneous images. It improves classification performance and achieves significant improvements in the classification of clouded images. A multi-modal squeeze-and-excitation (MSE) module is also utilized to fuse the features. Compared with the ordinary methods, MSE modules can lead to an improvement of about 1% to 5% in overall accuracy (OA), Kappa coefficients, and mean intersection over union (mIoU). Besides, in order to evaluate our method, we describe in detail the preprocessing process of Gaofen-2 (GF2) and Gaofen-3 (GF3) data before they are used in the LCC task. The experiments show that the proposed method performs well compared with other excellent segmentation methods and obtains the best performance on heterogeneous images from GF2 and GF3. The code and datasets are available at: https://github.com/XD-MG/DDHRNet.

TI  - Effect of Conservation Agriculture on Aphid Biocontrol by Generalist (Carabid Beetle) and Specialist (Parasitoids Wasp) Natural Enemy Communities in Winter Wheat
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Adoption of practices that reduce the risk of pest outbreaks is one of the pillars of agroecology and is largely based on biological control. Multiple infield and landscape parameters affect biocontrol, but the effects of conservation soil management on biological control have been poorly investigated over crop season. By comparing winter wheat fields within the same landscape but with different soil management, the direct and indirect effects of soil management (conservation and conventional systems) on natural enemies' communities and their biological control on aphids was studied from the tillering stage to the harvest. In addition to aphid infestation, two families of the main natural enemies' guilds were monitored, as well as their associated services: aphid parasitoid, a specialist and flying natural enemy, with parasitism service, and carabid beetles, a generalist and ground-dwelling predator, with aphidophagy service. Soil conservation system hosted more abundant and diverse carabid beetles' assemblages, and received higher aphidophagy service in June than conventional system. However, neither parasitoid abundance, nor parasitism rates, were affected by soil management. Aphid infestation and its associated damage did not depend on soil management either. Our results suggest that ground-dwelling natural enemies are more impacted by soil management than foliage-dwelling natural enemies, which is partly reflected in aphid biocontrol. In agricultural systems with reduced soil perturbation, direct mortality on ground-dwelling communities due to tillage may be lower than in a conventional system, but habitat heterogeneity is also greater, increasing the number of ecological niches for natural enemies. Both factors are supposed to favor an early presence of natural enemies and a tendency toward a precocious aphidophagy service is indeed observed in conservation system.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Kanyakumari district lies on the southern tip of Tamil Nadu, India. Nowadays, the economically wealthy coast of this district is profoundly altered in its natural existence, which can be deliberated by using Remote Sensing techniques. In this present study, shoreline change inquiry has been attempted at Vilavancode and Kalkulam taluks using the multitemporal satellite data of Landsat 7 ETM + and the Sentinel for a decade from 2009 to 2019. The shoreline has been demarcated and the End Point Rate is estimated by using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System. The shoreline changes statistics have been categorized into seven classes based on the rate of changes: high erosion, medium erosion, low erosion, stable, low accretion, medium accretion, and high accretion. This investigation helps to sense regional fluctuations and reveals that the area subjected to landward shoreline shift is higher than the seaward shoreline shift during this period. The villages of Iraviputhanthurai (10.61 m/yr), Inaiyam (4.01 m/yr), Mandacaud (8.17 m/yr), and Kodimunai (4.12 m/yr) are subjected to high erosion, whereas high accretion is perceived at the Irayumanthurai village (4.13 m/yr). The impact of coastal erosion on site-specific shorelines is considered in this research. This finding will be helpful for coastal management to reduce the loss of economy and safeguard the future coastal environment.

TI  - Lack of Clinical Value for Immunohistochemistry for Sentinel Lymph Node Assessment in Invasive Lobular Carcinoma
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The distinct histologic appearance of invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) may pose diagnostic challenges for sentinel lymph node (SLN) analysis. We evaluated the impact of cytokeratin immunohistochemistry (IHC) on SLN assessment in ILC and its contribution to pathologic nodal upstaging. Methods We identified ILC patients treated with SLN surgery at our institution between September 2008 and August 2021. IHC for SLN assessment was employed at the discretion of the pathologist. Differences between groups evaluated with and without IHC were compared using Chi-square tests. Results Overall, 608 cases of ILC were identified in patients who underwent SLN surgery. IHC was used in 301 cases (49.5%) and was not associated with cT category, pT category, or tumor grade. Use of IHC increased detection of SLN+ disease when isolated tumor cells (ITCs) were included in the analysis (35.9% with IHC vs. 21.2% without IHC; p < 0.001). There was no effect on nodal upstaging to micrometastatic disease (pN1mi) or greater (21.9% with IHC vs. 21.2% without IHC; p = 0.82). IHC did not increase the number of positive SLNs detected (median 1 with and without IHC) nor did it increase axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) rates (11.6% with IHC vs. 15.3% without IHC; p = 0.18). Conclusion IHC improved detection of pN0(i+) disease among ILC patients undergoing SLN surgery. IHC did not increase upstaging to pN1mi or higher categories of nodal disease, detection of a greater number of positive SLNs, or ALND rates. Our data suggest routine use of IHC for SLN assessment in ILC patients does not add clinical utility.

TI  - Metallurgical evolution and interfacial interactions between 304L stainless steel and Zy-4 alloy dissimilar junction during isothermal holding at high temperature
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The present work aims to study evolutions of the metallurgical structure and the interfacial interactions in the SS-304L/Zy-4 dissimilar junction during isothermal holding at high temperature. The obtained interfaces were characterized by the combination of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), electron probe micro-analyzer techniques (EPMA), Vickers microhardness (HV), and nanoindentation tests. The isothermal treatment at high temperature allowed the formation of both two layers at the reaction zone and a diffusion zone, on the Zircaloy (Zy-4) and the SS-304L sides, respectively. The layers observed on the Zircaloy side consist epsilon-Zr(Fe, Cr)(2) and Zr-2(Fe, Ni) intermetallic compounds (IMCs). Those observed on the SS-304L side consist of the alpha-(Fe, Cr) single-phase and another gamma-(Fe, Cr, Ni) + alpha-(Fe, Cr) mixed part. According to values of microhardness (HV), nanoindentation hardness (H), and elastic modulus (E) obtained from the microhardness and nanoindentation tests, the epsilon-Zr(Fe, Cr)(2) is considered to be extremely hard and brittle; however, Zr-2(Fe, Ni) and alpha-(Fe, Cr) are moderately ductile.

TI  - Sentinel fall presenting to the emergency department (SeFaIIED) - protocol of a complex study including long-term observation of functional trajectories after a fall, exploration of specific fall risk factors, and patients' views on falls prevention
T2  - BMC GERIATRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Falls are a leading cause for emergency department (ED) visits in older adults. As a fall is associated with a high risk of functional decline and further falls and many falls do not receive medical attention, the ED is ideal to initiate secondary prevention, an opportunity generally not taken. Data on trajectories to identify patients, who would profit the most form early intervention and to examine the impact of a fall event, are lacking. To tailor interventions to the individual's needs and preferences, and to address the whole scope of fall risks, we developed this longitudinal study using an extensive assessment battery including dynamic balance and aerobic fitness, but also sensor-based data. Additionally, participative research will contribute valuable qualitative data, and machine learning will be used to identify trips, slips, and falls in sensor data during daily life.Methods: This is a mixed-methods study consisting of four parts: (1) an observational prospective study, (2) a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to explore whether a diagnostic to measure reactive dynamic balance influences fall risk, (3) machine learning approaches and (4) a qualitative study to explore patients' and their caregivers'views. We will target a sample size of 450 adults of 60 years and older, who presented to the ED of the Klinikum Oldenburg after a fall and are not hospitalized. The participants will be followed up over 24 months (within four weeks after the ED, after 6, 12 and 24 months). We will assess functional abilities, fall risk factors, participation, quality of life, falls incidence, and physical activity using validated instruments, including sensor-data. Additionally, two thirds of the patients will Undergo intensive testing in the gait laboratory and 72 participants will partake in focus group interviews.Discussion: The results of the SeFaIIED study will be used to identify risk factors with high predictive value for functional outcome after a sentinel fall. This will help to (1) establish a protocol adapted to the situation in the ED to identify patients at risk and (2) to initiate an appropriate care pathway, which will be developed based on the results of this study.

TI  - Assessing Thailand's 1-3-7 surveillance strategy in accelerating malaria elimination
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Thailand's strong malaria elimination programme relies on effective implementation of its 1-3-7 surveillance strategy, which was endorsed and implemented nationwide in 2016. For each confirmed malaria patient, the Ministry of Public Health's Division of Vector Borne Diseases (DVBD) ensures completion of case notification within 1 day, case investigation within 3 days, and foci investigation within 7 days. To date, there has not been a comprehensive assessment of the performance and achievements of the 1-3-7 surveillance strategy although such results could help Thailand's future malaria elimination strategic planning. Methods This study examined adherence to the 1-3-7 protocols, tracked progress against set targets, and examined geographic variations in implementation of the 1-3-7 strategy in the programme's initial 5 years. An auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) time series analysis with seasonal decomposition assessed the plausible implementation effect of the 1-3-7 strategy on malaria incidence in the programme's initial 5 years. The quantitative analysis included all confirmed malaria cases from public health and non-governmental community facilities from October 2014 to September 2021 (fiscal year [FY] 2015 to FY 2021) (n = 77,405). The spatial analysis included active foci with known geocoordinates that reported more than five cases from FY 2018 to FY 2021. Results From FY 2017 to FY 2021, on-time case notification improved from 24.4% to 89.3%, case investigations from 58.0% to 96.5%, and foci investigations from 37.9% to 87.2%. Adherence to timeliness protocols did not show statistically significant variation by area risk classification. However, adherence to 1-3-7 protocols showed a marked spatial heterogeneity among active foci, and the ARIMA model showed a statistically significant acceleration in the reduction of malaria incidence. The 1-3-7 strategy national indicators and targets in Thailand have shown progressive success, and most targets were achieved for FY 2021. Conclusion The results of Thailand's 1-3-7 surveillance strategy are associated with a decreased incidence in the period following the adoption of the strategy although there is notable geographic variation. The DVBD will continue to implement and adapt the 1-3-7 strategy to accelerate progress toward malaria elimination. This assessment may be useful for domestic strategic planning and to other countries considering more intensive case and foci investigation and response strategies.

TI  - Correction of inter-mission inconsistencies in merged ocean colour satellite data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Consistency in a time series of ocean colour satellite data is essential when determining long-term trends and statistics in Essential Climate Variables. For such a long time series, it is necessary to merge ocean colour data sets from different sensors due to the finite life span of the satellites. Although bias corrections have been performed on merged data set products, significant inconsistencies between missions remain. These inconsistencies appear as sudden steps in the time series of these products when a satellite mission is launched into- or removed from orbit. This inter-mission inconsistency is not caused by poor correction of sensor sensitivities but by differences in the ability of a sensor to observe certain waters. This study, based on a data set compiled by the 'Ocean Colour Climate Change Initiative' project (OC-CCI), shows that coastal waters, high latitudes, and areas subject to changing cloud cover are most affected by coverage variability between missions. The "Temporal Gap Detection Method" is introduced, which temporally homogenises the observations per-pixel of the time series and consequently minimises the magnitude of the inter-mission inconsistencies. The method presented is suitable to be transferred to other merged satellite-derived data sets that exhibit inconsistencies due to changes in coverage over time. The results provide insights into the correct interpretation of any merged ocean colour time series.

TI  - Lidar system with a fast scanning speed for sea fog detection
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea fog changes widely and rapidly, and existing Lidar scanning speeds are insufficient to detect such changes. Therefore, we developed a Lidar system with a fast scanning speed and long detection distance. Experimental results show that at high scanning speeds, the maximum correlation between the Lidar's visibility results and those from two forward scattering visibility meters reaches 0.9537, with a minimum relative error less than 15.31%. The results also show that the visibility of the proposed Lidar system has high accuracy when fast scanning. During the tests, the Lidar system successfully captured sea fog many times and closely tracked the changes of sea visibility, which verifies the feasibility and reliability of the developed Lidar system for obtaining visibility measurements and sea fog detection.

TI  - Multi-criteria evaluation of the shadow index performance of Landsat 8 OLI images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Shadow indexes can effectively and easily detect shadows in remote sensing images. Although various shadow indexes are used, there is no consensus regarding the optimal one. The evaluation criteria used to determine the performance of shadow indexes are relatively homogeneous. A multi-criteria evaluation of widely used shadow indexes is necessary to analyse the application performance of each index in different scenarios. The eight most common shadow indexes were selected for this study. In addition to the standard visual inspection and accuracy assessment criteria, the cosine of solar incidence (cosi) was introduced to evaluate the sensitivity of the indexes to illumination intensity. Furthermore, in order to evaluate the separability of shadows and confusable objects, the interquartile range (IQR) of shadows and confusable objects was used to calculate the 1.5IQR separation ratio (1.5IQRSR). The multi-scale evaluation included mountain and urban scenarios, with the sensitivity to illumination intensity used to assess mountain scenarios and the capacity to separate confusable objects used to assess urban scenarios. The results obtained for each evaluation criterion were aggregated to form the multi-criteria evaluation score of the shadow indexes. The results show that the combinational shadow index (CSI), shadow detector index (SDI), and shadow index (SI) perform relatively well for each evaluation criterion. SI and CSI had the highest shadow detection accuracy in mountain and urban areas, respectively. The shadow enhancement index (SEI) and CSI had relatively high sensitivity to illumination intensity, especially CSI. In addition, CSI has the highest water separability but low separability for blue and dark impervious surfaces. SDI and SI have high separability for confusable objects, but they are ineffective in separating water bodies and less sensitive to illumination intensity. In summary, CSI, SDI, and SI excel in many application contexts, whereas the performances of the remaining five indexes were similar in all respects.

TI  - Tracking annual dynamics of mangrove forests in mangrove National Nature Reserves of China based on time series Sentinel-2 imagery during 2016-2020
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove National Nature Reserves (MNNRs) play an extraordinarily significant role in conserving mangrove forests and their habitats. In China, one-fourth of the total mangrove forests were located in MNNRs. Under-standing annual spatial distributions and conversions of these mangrove forests are important for precision conservation and rehabilitation efforts. However, to date, annual land cover maps of China's MNNRs are still unavailable. Here, we proposed a rapid and robust approach to produce annual maps of each MNNRs for the time period of 2016-2020 based on 10-m resolution Sentinel-2 imagery. The proposed approach was developed using object-based image analysis, Otsu and Random Forest algorithm. Results showed that 1) during 2016-2020, areal extents of mangrove forest in all the MNNRs continuously increased from 5912 ha to 6128 ha; 2) obvious in-crease were found in Zhanjiang Mangrove National Nature Reserve where mangrove forest increased by 127 ha, accounted for 59% of national total increases; 3) newly grown mangrove forests were mainly converted from tidal flats and aquaculture ponds. Our annual maps of China's MNNRs could provide a basis for managing mangrove ecosystems and supporting the implementation of Sustainable Development Goals related to coastal development.

TI  - Edge-enhanced efficient network for remote sensing image super-resolution
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The super-resolution (SR) reconstruction is drawing increasing attention in remote-sensing image processing, owing to improving the spatial resolution and enriching the details of initially obtaining low-resolution (LR) images. Different from natural images, remote sensing images usually have more complex image distribution and degradation processes. Although current deep convolutional neural network (DCNN)-based approaches reach better performance by deepening the network and introducing attention mechanism, this is usually accompanied by more parameters, more computation, and more complex designs. To improve the performance and efficiency of SR reconstruction of remote sensing images, we proposed the edge-enhanced efficient network (EESR). Specifically, we design an inception-like multi-branch convolution block, named edge-enhanced convolution block (EEB), to enrich edge-aware capabilities of the network, which includes multi-order gradient extraction and other feature enhancement branches. Furthermore, re-parameterization is introduced into the inference stage of the network, aiming at boosting efficient inference. We re-parameterize the weights of EEB to the edge-enhanced convolution (EEC) via equivalent transformation to reduce the parameters and computational cost of the inference model. In addition, we construct a paired SR dataset named GF2-Port for remote sensing images with degradation simulation, based on the data of GaoFen-2 port and strait. Extensive experiments on both established and public datasets indicate that the proposed EESR outperforms other comparable approaches in terms of balancing restoration accuracy and inference efficiency.

TI  - Improving soil moisture assimilation efficiency via model calibration using SMAP surface soil moisture climatology information
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - To minimize systematic differences between soil moisture (SM) time series derived from remote sensing (RS) and land surface model (LSM), RS-based SM climatology information is typically discarded during land data assimilation (DA). However, recent studies have demonstrated that SM climatology estimates provided by L-band microwave RS retrievals can significantly outperform comparable estimates derived from LSMs. Consequently, neglecting a RS-based SM climatology may lead to degraded SM spatial patterns generated by land DA. Here, we propose a climatology-optimized SM DA framework, which first calibrates LSM parameters to leverage the RS SM climatology information. Next, multi-sensor RS SM retrievals are assimilated into the calibrated LSM using Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF). This framework is demonstrated using the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model and RS SM retrievals derived from the L-band Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) and C-band Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT) sensors. Here, both SMAP and ASCAT SM retrievals are assimilated into the VIC model after calibrating VIC to match spatial variations captured in the SMAP SM climatology. The DA SM results are validated using in-situ SM observations derived from 820 stations. Results show that SMAP-based SM clima-tology calibration directly improves the quality of SM spatial patterns estimated by VIC. In addition, the SMAP-based calibration also benefits our model-error representation and thereby yields better Kalman gains that improve temporal SM DA accuracy. Relative to typical DA approaches, this newly proposed DA framework improves both spatial (0.26 versus 0.51 (-)) and temporal correlations (0.48 versus 0.52 (-)) versus in-situ SM observations. In addition, SM improvements are effectively propagated into improved streamflow estimates - leading to an average increase of Nash and Sutcliffe coefficient from 0.74 to 0.76 (-). Overall, we demonstrate that RS SM climatology information is valuable for land DA and our climatology-optimized framework suc-cessfully retains such information to the benefit of land DA performance.

TI  - Seasonal development and radiative forcing of red snow algal blooms on two glaciers in British Columbia, Canada, summer 2020
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Red snow algal blooms reduce albedo and increase snowmelt, but little is known of their extent, duration, and radiative forcing. We calibrated an established index by comparing snow algal field spectroradiometer measurements with direct counts of algal cell abundance in British Columbia, Canada. We applied the field calibrated index to Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, and MODIS/Terra images to monitor snow algae on the Vowell and Catamount Glaciers (Purcells, British Columbia) in summer 2020. The maximum extent of snow algal bloom cover was 1.4 and 2.0 km2 respectively, about one third of the total surface area of the two glaciers, making these among the largest contiguous bloom areas yet reported. Blooms were first detected following the onset of above-freezing temperatures in early July and persisted for about two months. Algal abundance increased through July, after which the red snow algal bloom area decreased due to snow cover loss. At their peak in late July the blooms reduced albedo by 0.04 +/- 0.01 on average. Snow algae caused an additional 5.25 & PLUSMN; 1.0 x 10(7) J/m2 of solar energy to be absorbed by the snowpack in July-August, which is enough energy to melt 31.5 cm of snow. This is equivalent to an average snow algal radiative forcing of 8.25 +/- 1.6 W/m2 through July and August. Our results suggest that the extent, duration, and radiative forcing of snow algal blooms are sufficient to enhance glacial melt rates.

TI  - Observing tectonic-geomorphological changes along the Dawki Fault and adjoining areas of Sylhet, Bangladesh from 1980 to 2020 using remote sensing and GIS techniques
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we observed the tectono-geomorphological changes along the Dawki Fault and adjoining areas of Sylhet, Bangladesh using multitemporal Landsat satellite imageries from 1980 to 2020. The 40 years time lapse images were used to derive geomorphometric such as sinuosity index (SI), hydraulic sinuosity index (HSI), topographic sinuosity index (TSI), and lineament, directional and lineament density (LD) change analyses. To support these changes, other important parameters, i.e., Bouguer gravity anomaly (BGA) and digital elevation model (DEM) were considered based on their data availability. The present research observed spatiotemporal patterns in these parameters using remote sensing and GIS techniques, where multiple software platforms (i.e., ENVI 5.3, PCI Geomatica Banff 2020, Rockworks 16, ArcGIS 10.8 and MS Excel 2019) were utilized for mapping and data visualization. The study results from multiple parameters such as prominent lineament changes towards NE-SW directions matched well with the Dawki and nearby Disang faults, BGA data variations based on multiple transects, and elevation changes confirmed the increasing intensity of tectonic activity in the study area. Moreover, the lineament distributions, their concentrations, CV, and CSD have also confirmed the present tectonic movements which are especially observed in central, southern and northeastern directions.

T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing and GIS-based multi-criteria analysis are used to assess groundwater availability and potentiality of the fractured limestone aquifer of the Maknassy Basin, Central Tunisia. The integration of the multi-source data used (satellite images from Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM +), Digital Elevation Model (DEM), hydrology and borehole data) based on the multi-criteria analysis has led to the pro-duction of synthesis maps documents on the areas of hydraulic potentiality of the upper Cenomanian -lower Turonian aquifer in the Maknassy Basin. The distribution of major faults and lineaments was extracted from satellite images processed by several techniques. Lineaments analyses are widely included with geological and hydrogeological data in the selection of groundwater exploration sites. The combination of the four developed thematic maps (availability, accessibility, exploitability and productivity) gives a groundwater potential map of the studied aquifer. This map shows four classes of hydrogeological potential: (i) the poorly class occupies 22% of the total basin area and is concentrated at the West end of the basin; (ii) the moderate class (49%) is found in almost the entire basin; (iii) the good (15%) and (iv) the excellent class (14%) occupy the centre of the basin.

TI  - Monitoring and classification of high Arctic lakes in the Svalbard Islands using remote sensing
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Arctic lakes are an essential element of the environment. This study inventoried and classified lakes on three of the Svalbard Islands (Spitsbergen, Barentsoya, and Edgeoya) using Sentinel-2 images. The Forel-Ule color index (FUI) was employed to measure the lake's color, and a new equation to calculate the concentration of suspended sediment using satellite images was developed and tested using measurements from coastal waters. These two measures, plus the normalized difference vegetation index for vegetation on the lakeshore, and the lakes' location were used for clustering and classification. More than 1000 natural lakes were found on the three Svalbard islands. Nearly 80 % of these were smaller than 0.01 km2 (1 ha), with the largest a few km2 in area. Lake distribution analysis identified six zones of increased lake density, five of which were located along the western coast of Spitsbergen. The FUI was thus demonstrated to be useful for the monitoring of Arctic lakes. The K-means clustering results and analysis of the spectral signatures divided the lakes into seven classes: clear water, moderately clear water, tundra, coastal tundra, meltwater, extreme meltwater, and supraglacial lakes. Meltwater and clear water lakes were the two most common types, accounting for about 80 % of the total lake area.

TI  - Climatic legacy effects on the drought response of the Amazon rainforest
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Extreme precipitation and drought events are predicted to become more intense and more frequent over the Amazon rainforest. Because changes in forest dynamics could prompt strong feedback loops to the global climate, it is of crucial importance to gain insight into the response of tropical forests to these recurring extreme climatic events. Here, we evaluated the Amazon forest stability (resistance and resilience) to drought in the context of past dry and wet climatic events using MODIS EVI satellite imagery and cumulative water deficit anomalies. We observed large spatial differences in the occurrence of extreme climatic events from 1980 to 2019, with an increase in drought frequency in the central and northern Amazon and drought intensity in the southern Amazon basin. An increasing trend in the occurrence of wet events was found in the western, southern, and eastern Amazon. Furthermore, we found significant legacy effects of previous climatic events on the forest drought response. An extreme drought closely preceding another drought decreased forest resilience, whereas the occurrence of a recent drier-than-usual event also decreased the forest resistance to later droughts. Both wetter-than-usual and extreme wet events preceding an extreme drought increased the resistance of the forest, and with similar effects sizes as dry events, indicating that wet and dry events have similarly sized legacy effects on the drought response of tropical forests. Our results indicate that the predicted increase in drought frequency and intensity can have negative consequences for the functioning of the Amazon forest. However, more frequent wet periods in combination with these droughts could counteract their negative impact. Finally, we also found that more stable forests according to the alternative stable states theory are also more resistant and resilient to individual droughts, showing a positive relationship between the equilibrium and non-equilibrium stability dynamics.

T2  - PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation dynamic processes influenced by fires has represented a scientific topic of great importance because of the environmental impact of fires. The use of satellites to investigate vegetational trends has become quite common for the wide coverage and high spatial resolution of satellite images. In this paper, we study the temporal variability of MODIS Aqua and Terra Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data acquired from 2000 to 2020 and covering the area burned by Camp Fire (California) in 2018. In 2008 other two fires, the BTU Lightning Complex Fire and the Humboldt Fire burned a large part of the same area. The objective of our study, thus, is the characterization of the time dynamics of MODIS Aqua and Terra NDVI and EVI series of sites affected by one and two wildfires by using the Fisher-Shannon (FS) method that allows to have information about the organization/disorder of the time series in relationship with the vegetation post-fire recovery process. Our results suggest that multiple fires cause a decrease of organization and order of NDVI and EVI, indicating a loss a regularity of their time variation. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Identifying priorities for the joint conservation of maritime built heritage and marine biodiversity: An assessment of shoreline engineering on the Isles of Scilly, UK, using historical datasets
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Growing concern over the ecological impact of maritime structures has led to increasing attempts to quantify the extent of marine human development. However, maritime heritage assets (i.e., historic structures of cultural significance, such as decommissioned quays) are often missing in these assessments as many of these structures are not recorded in conventional datasets of maritime infrastructure, instead featuring exclusively in heritage registers. At the same time, heritage assets may provide unintentional ecological benefits to marine wildlife due to their age, traditional construction, and protected status, and as such, comprehensive assessments of marine human development cannot be achieved without the inclusion of historical data. Using the Isles of Scilly as a geographically confined case study, we present a novel methodology for quantifying the full extent of marine engineering structures (including heritage assets) at a regional scale, and for identifying priority structures for joint biodiversity and heritage conservation. Historical datasets were considered alongside remote sensing data and records of modern coastal defences in a rapid desk-based assessment to create a full inventory of marine structures along the entire coastline of the Isles of Scilly. In total, 68 structures were recorded, totalling 6180 m in length. By evaluating the ecological potential and heritage value of each structure using a novel scoring system that was verified in the field, priorities for conservation and other managed interventions are identified. This includes (1) listed buildings and scheduled monuments that due to their construction features and shore position are most likely to support diverse marine assemblages, and (2) modern structures where eco-enhancement adaptations may be favourable.As demonstrated here, combined ecological-heritage evaluations allow for the identification of structures with the greatest potential for the joint conservation of built heritage and marine wildlife. Research is now needed to develop this method further and test its application in other geographical locations and at varying spatial scales.

TI  - Assessment of radarsat-1, ALOS PALSAR and sentinel-1 SAR satellite images for geological lineament mapping
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Lineament mapping is a very important step in geological studies and mineral exploration, with the evolution of remote sensing, processing methods as well as the availability of several optical and radar satellite data, lineaments can be detected without using traditional methods. The objective of this work is to recommend the most suitable data for lineaments to be used in the field of geological science, by comparing the performance of three different RADAR data, namely ALOS PALSAR (The Advanced Land Observing Satellite Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar), Radarsat-1 and Sentinel-1 for automatic lineament extraction using a combination of edge detection and line linking algorithms. The methodology consists to link between the length, number, orientation and density of lineaments with surface characteristics such as the slope, faults, lithology, discontinuities and mineral veins. The results obtained show that the extracted lineaments from Sentinel-1 VH polarization have a better correlation with geological units, tectonic system direction, as well as shading and slope maps, which is due to the effectiveness of VH polarization, which is independent of soil properties compared to the other polarizations that have shown an overestimation of the lineaments.

TI  - Observational Constraint on the Contribution of Surface Albedo Feedback to the Amplified Tibetan Plateau Surface Warming
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface albedo feedback (SAF) is one of the main causes of amplified warming over the Tibetan Plateau (TP). Several recent studies have used the latest reanalysis datasets to evaluate the SAF induced warming, but without fully considering the fidelity of the surface albedo change and surface downward solar radiation in the reanalysis datasets, which directly affect the amplitude of SAF induced warming. This study finds that the state-of-the-art reanalysis datasets (ERA-Interim, ERA5, MERRA, MERRA-2, JRA-55 and CRA) and climate models that participated in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) exhibit varying biases compared with observations in both surface albedo change and surface downward solar radiation over the TP. The state-of-the-art reanalysis datasets present no obvious advantages over the lower resolution but less constrained CMIP6 multi-model ensemble in representing SAF related processes over the TP. The surface albedo change drives most of the spread in SAF induced warming. The reanalysis datasets and CMIP6 climate models reveal a significant linear relationship between surface albedo change and its contribution to surface temperature change over the TP. Using the observation constrained linear relationship and satellite surface albedo products, the spread of warming contribution due to SAF in reanalysis datasets and climate models is greatly reduced, the estimated TP warming due to SAF is in the range of 0.26-0.50 K in winter and 0.27-0.77 K in spring over recent decades.

TI  - Calibrating APSIM for forage sorghum using remote sensing and field data under sub-optimal growth conditions
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - CONTEXT: Mechanistic sorghum models have been mostly used to estimate sorghum yield for grain sorghum for a range of genotype, management, and environmental conditions. There is a lack of model testing for crop growth and development responses for forage genotypes and information for phenological parameterization under sub-optimal water and nitrogen stress conditions in forage systems. OBJETIVE: The aims of this study were to (i) use NDVI to parametrize APSIM model to estimate forage sorghum phenology, (ii) calibrate APSIM to simulate green cover, intercepted solar radiation and aboveground biomass, and (iii) quantify the variance of inter-annual aboveground biomass and the effect of water availability on forage sorghum biomass under sub-optimal environment x management combinations.METHODS: We used climate, soil, management records and sorghum crop observations collected from farm and field experiments in Argentina and Australia. NDVI values were gathered from Sentinel-2 and a handheld optical sensor and then related to fAPAR measurements. Phenological stages were derived from fAPAR seasonal dy-namics and implemented as input in the APSIM calibration. Finally, we assessed the temporal AGB variability through long-term simulations analysis.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: NDVI seasonal dynamics accurately represented the fraction of the absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (R2=0.92) and then, the remote-sensing parametrized APSIM model satis-factorily simulated crop phenology (CCC=0.75-0.92, NRMSE=9-22%). The model was also able to satisfactorily simulate crop growth (CCC=0.89 and NRMSE=24.8% for green cover; CCC=0.81 and NRMSE=34.6% for intercepted solar radiation; CCC=0.91 and NRMSE=37% for aboveground biomass). APSIM simulations during 22 years across 5 contrasting locations showed high inter-annual variability of aboveground biomass (CV=47%), mainly driven by inter-annual variation of soil water availability (CV=20%). Our study demonstrated that (i) remote sensing data was a reliable source for APSIM phenology parametrization, (ii) the model was able to satisfactorily simulate crop growth and development of forage sorghum under sub-optimal conditions across several genotype x environment x management combinations and (iii) water availability was the main driver of aboveground biomass inter-annual variance.SIGNIFICANCE: Given the pressure of the global human population to satisfy an increasing demand for food, our results provide a new path for the combined use of remote sensing and mechanistic modelling to improve forage sorghum biomass estimations in marginal environments.

TI  - Gravity-Wave-Driven Seasonal Variability of Temperature Differences Between ECMWF IFS and Rayleigh Lidar Measurements in the Lee of the Southern Andes
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term high-resolution temperature data of the Compact Rayleigh Autonomous Lidar (CORAL) is used to evaluate temperature and gravity wave (GW) activity in ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) over Rio Grande (53.79 degrees S, 67.75 degrees W), which is a hot spot of stratospheric GWs in winter. Seasonal and altitudinal variations of the temperature differences between the IFS and lidar are studied for 2018 with a uniform IFS version. Moreover, interannual variations are considered taking into account updated IFS versions. We find monthly mean temperature differences <2 K at 20-40 km altitude. At 45-55 km, the differences are smaller than 4 K during summer. The largest differences are found during winter (4 K in May 2018 and -10 K in August 2018, July 2019 and 2020). The width of the difference distribution (15th/85th percentiles), the root mean square error, and maximum differences between instantaneous individual profiles are also larger during winter (>+/- 10 K) and increase with altitude. We relate this seasonal variability to middle atmosphere GW activity. In the upper stratosphere and lower mesosphere, the observed temperature differences result from both GW amplitude and phase differences. The IFS captures the seasonal cycle of GW potential energy (E-p) well, but underestimates E-p in the middle atmosphere. Experimental IFS simulations without damping by the model sponge for May and August 2018 show an increase in the monthly mean E-p above 45 km from only approximate to 10% of the E-p derived from the lidar measurements to 26% and 42%, respectively. GWs not resolved in the IFS are likely explaining the remaining underestimation of the E-p.

TI  - Identifying and quantifying key pressures in a data poor region: Coastal Spatial Planning in Heraklion Prefecture, Greece
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal regions are among the most valuable ecosystems due to the socioeconomic and ecological benefits and services they provide. Pressures, leading to multiple adverse effects on coastal habitats, seriously threaten these benefits. Coastal Spatial Planning (CSP) aims to mitigate these pressures in parallel with the E.U. Marine Strategy Framework Directive. A key aspect of ecosystem-based CSP is mapping the spatial distribution of pertinent pressures, and identifying Key Environmental Indicators (KEIs). This objective however, is difficult to achieve in data-poor regions leading to variable sources of uncertainty. Furthermore, a conceptual framework to homogenize spatially explicit data of relevant pressures is lacking. This study proposes a methodology for developing and integrating spatial pressure datasets in a Geographical Information Systems (GIS) environment. This methodology was applied to a case study location in the northern and southern coastal area of Heraklion Prefecture, in Crete (Greece). The pressure datasets, used, were developed from a synthesis of proxy and satellite data, including abrasion, chlorophyll-a, commercial fish catches, invasive species, light pollution, microplastics, noise pollution, ocean acidification and organic load. These nine Potential Environmental Indicators (PEIs) were subjected to Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in order to reduce the number of parameters, and identify their relationships. The shortlisted 7 KEIs were organic load, chlorophyll-a, microplastics, commercial fish catches, and noise pollution, indicating that this methodology can be of management relevance in the initial steps of CSP implementation, especially in data poor areas. The proposed spatial integration of disparate pressure datasets as part of the flowchart presented constitutes a compositional approach to the spatial illustration of pressures in a coastal area. The patterns of KEI connectivity and disturbance highlighted herein through statistical analysis, could provide a feasible, economic and less biased procedure leading to effective marine resource management, also allowing for a regional and European implementation.

AB  - This research proposed novel technique in crop monitoring system using machine learning-based classification using UAV. To monitor and operate activities from remote locations, UAVs extended their freedom of operation. For smart farming, it's significant to use UAV prospects. On the other hand, the cost and convenience of using UAVs for smart-farming may be a major factor in farmers' decisions to use UAVs in farming. The IoT-based module is used to update the database with monitored data. Using this method, live data should be updated soon, and it can help in crop cultivation identification. Research also monitor climatic conditions using live satellite data. The data is collected as well as classified for detecting crop abnormality based on climatic conditions and pre-historic data based on cultivation for the field also this monitoring system will differ-entiate weeds and crops. Simulation results show accuracy, precision, specificity for trained data by detecting the crop abnormality.

TI  - Simulated response of St. Joseph Bay, Florida, seagrass meadows and their belowground carbon to anthropogenic and climate impacts
T2  - MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Seagrass meadows are degraded globally and continue to decline in areal extent due to human pressures and climate change. This study used the bio-optical model GrassLight to explore the impact of climate change and anthropogenic stressors on seagrass extent, leaf area index (LAI) and belowground organic carbon (BGC) in St. Joseph Bay, Florida, using water quality data and remotely-sensed sea surface temperature (SST) from 2002 to 2020. Model predictions were compared with satellite-derived measurements of seagrass extent and shoot density from the Landsat images for the same period. The GrassLight-derived area of potential seagrass habitat ranged from 36.2 km(2) to 39.2 km(2) , averaging 38.0 +/- 0.8 km(2) compared to an observed seagrass extent of 23.0 +/- 3.0 km(2) derived from Landsat (range = 17.9-27.4 km(2)). GrassLight predicted a mean seagrass LAI of 2.7 m(2) leaf m(-2 )seabed, compared to a mean LAI of 1.9 m(2) m(-2) estimated from Landsat, indicating that seagrass density in St. Joseph Bay may have been below its light-limited ecological potential. Climate and anthropogenic change simulations using GrassLight predicted the impact of changes in temperature, pH, chlorophyll a, chmmophoric dissolved organic matter and turbidity on seagrass meadows. Simulations predicted a 2-8% decline in seagrass extent with rising temperatures that was offset by a 3-11% expansion in seagrass extent in response to ocean acidification when compared to present conditions. Simulations of water quality impacts showed that a doubling of turbidity would reduce seagrass extent by 18% and total leaf area by 21%. Combining climate and water quality scenarios showed that ocean acidification may increase seagrass productivity to offset the negative effects of both thermal stress and declining water quality on the seagrasses growing in St. Joseph Bay. This research highlights the importance of considering multiple limiting factors in understanding the effects of environmental change on seagrass ecosystems.

TI  - Using satellite-based AOD and ground-based measurements to evaluate the impact of the DWH oil spill on coastal air quality
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2010 DWH disaster generated atmospheric pollutants of health concern which reached the Gulf Coast. This study evaluated whether changes in coastal air quality due to the disaster were captured by aerosol optical depth (AOD) estimated using satellite data and by ground-based monitoring of air pollution, including fine particulate matter <= 2.5 mu m in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5), benzene and naphthalene. Mean monthly AOD levels were higher in May 2010 [during oil spill time], (mean AOD = 0.355), than for the prior (mean AOD = 0.258) and following years (mean AOD = 0.252) (p < 0.05). PM2.5 concentrations and AOD were significantly correlated (R-2 = 0.59, p < 0.05), for one study area. Elevated PM2.5, benzene, and naphthalene concentrations coincided with downwind directions from the location of the oil slicks. A fully-coupled oil fate and transport atmospheric transport model of oil spill emissions, integrated with AOD and more extensive ground-based measurements, is recommended to predict coastal population exposures during oil spills.

TI  - Machine Learning-Based Epigenetic Classifiers for Axillary Staging of Patients with ER-Positive Early-Stage Breast Cancer
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background In the era of molecular stratification and effective multimodality therapies, surgical staging of the axilla is becoming less relevant for patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive early-stage breast cancer (EBC). Therefore, a nonsurgical method for accurately predicting lymph node disease is the next step in the de-escalation of axillary surgery. This study sought to identify epigenetic signatures in the primary tumor that accurately predict lymph node status. Patients and Methods We selected a cohort of patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) with ER-positive, HER2-negative invasive ductal carcinomas, and clinically-negative axillae (n = 127). Clinicopathological nomograms from the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) and the MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) were calculated. DNA methylation (DNAm) patterns from primary tumor specimens were compared between patients with pN0 and those with > pN0. The cohort was divided into training (n = 85) and validation (n = 42) sets. Random forest was employed to obtain the combinations of DNAm features with the highest accuracy for stratifying patients with > pN0. The most efficient combinations were selected according to the area under the curve (AUC). Results Clinicopathological models displayed a modest predictive potential for identifying > pN0 disease (MSKCC AUC 0.76, MDACC AUC 0.69, p = 0.15). Differentially methylated sites (DMS) between patients with pN0 and those with > pN0 were identified (n = 1656). DMS showed a similar performance to the MSKCC model (AUC = 0.76, p = 0.83). Machine learning approaches generated five epigenetic classifiers, which showed higher discriminative potential than the clinicopathological variables tested (AUC > 0.88, p < 0.05). Conclusions Epigenetic classifiers based on primary tumor characteristics can efficiently stratify patients with no lymph node involvement from those with axillary lymph node disease, thereby providing an accurate method of staging the axilla.

TI  - Land suitability assessment for second cropping in terms of low temperature stresses using landsat TIRS sensor
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The second cropping which is done in the autumn after the main cultivation is one of the ways to increase food security, farmers' income, and thus prevent migration of villagers. The main limiting factor in autumn cultivation is the reduction in ambient and soil temperatures, which causes a severe drop in crop yield if it reaches below the physiological base temperature and freezing temperature. In Gilan, one of the northern provinces of Iran more than 90 % of agricultural land is cultivated once a year and has no production in half of the year. Accordingly, the purpose of the present study is to evaluate the feasibility of autumn cultivation of rice and hull-less seed pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo L. var. pepo subsp. styriaca) in terms low temperature stresses. In the first step, the land use map was prepared using the fusion of images with panchromatic band of Landsat 8 Maximum Likeli-hood classification method and then agricultural lands were separated. The land surface temperature (LST) maps were extracted on two dates, October 30, 2018 and December 17, 2019 using the TIRS sensor. Comparison of the estimated data with the meteorological data showed that LST was 0.6 degrees C higher than the meteorological data on October and it was 1.1 degrees C lower on December. Then, the LST map was validated with meteorological data in the last 10 years and a modified map was obtained to measure the cultivation potential of rice and hull-less seed pumpkin. Comparison of LST maps obtained on the two dates showed that the temperature variation was greater in the colder date. Considering base temperatures of 12 and 10 degrees C for rice and pumpkin, respectively, as well as the freezing temperature of 5 degrees C for these two crops, land suitability was identified. Having the minimum temperature of 15 degrees C for almost all lands, there will be no temperature stress for the crops until October 30. But, if the crop calendar lasts until December 17, only 2.62 % of agricultural lands have the potential to cultivate rice without temperature restrictions. Meanwhile, lands with cultivation potential for pumpkin were estimated 6983.3 ha (83.5 %) on December. Therefore, pumpkin cultivation has a lower temperature risk compared to rice in Rezvanshahr. The results of this study, in addition to being the required source for any planning in the field of autumn cultivation of rice and pumpkin, is one of the main sources for selecting different crops of the second cropping and their crop calendar.

AB  - Background Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is a standard procedure in evaluating the status of node negative axilla. Numerous techniques have been described in literature. We hereby describe a new technique of intradermal injection of blue dye called the lymphatic flare technique.Methods The study was conducted in two phases over a year from August 2020 to May 2021 with an internal audit to validate and standardize the technique in January 2021.Results Between August 2020 and December 2020, 32 patients were evaluated for validation of this technique by two senior surgeons, which yielded a SLN identification rate of 93.75% (30 out of 32). After validating, standardizing, and educating the entire surgical team of the technique, another consecutive 27 patients were evaluated. The SLN identification rate increased to 100% (27 out of 27). Overall, SLN positivity for cancer was 16.6% (10 out of 60).Conclusion SLN identification by the lymphatic flare technique is feasible, accurate, and reproducible.

TI  - Can Column Formaldehyde Observations Inform Air Quality Monitoring Strategies for Ozone and Related Photochemical Oxidants?
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Formaldehyde column density (omega HCHO) showed a potentially useful correlation with surface ozone during the LISTOS campaign on Long Island Sound and the KORUS-AQ campaign in Seoul, South Korea. This builds on previous work that identified this relationship from in situ aircraft observations with similar findings for ground-based and airborne remote sensing of omega HCHO. In the Long Island Sound region, omega HCHO and surface ozone exhibited strong temporal (r(2) = 0.66) and spatial (r(2) = 0.73) correlation. The temporal variability in omega HCHO (similar to 1 Dobson units [DU]) was larger than the range in the spatial average (similar to 0.1 DU). The spatial average is most useful for informing ozone monitoring strategies, demonstrating the challenge in using omega HCHO satellite data sets for this purpose. In Seoul, high levels of NO2 resulted in O-x better correlating with omega HCHO than surface ozone due to titration effects. The omega HCHO-O-x relationship may therefore reflect the sum of surface ozone and related photochemical oxidants, relevant to air quality standards set to regulate this quantity such as the U.S. EPA National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). The relationship of omega HCHO to O-x shifted in Seoul during the campaign demonstrating the need to evaluate this relationship over longer time periods. With sufficient precision in future satellite retrievals, omega HCHO observations could be useful for evaluating the adequacy of surface air quality monitoring strategies.

TI  - Variability of Water Vapor in the Tropical Middle Atmosphere Observed From Satellites and Interpreted Using SD-WACCM Simulations
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Water vapor in the middle atmosphere plays an essential role in global warming, ozone depletion, and the formation of polar stratospheric and mesospheric clouds. We show that tropical middle atmospheric water vapor simulated with the specified-dynamics version of the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (SD-WACCM) is consistent with changes observed in a merged satellite data set, which encompasses the period 1993-2020. Consistent with previous work, we find no significant trend in the stratosphere in either the observations or the simulation; in the mesosphere, we find a long-term trend of 0.1 ppmv per decade, but only in the observations. We also analyze an SD-WACCM simulation for the longer period 1980-2019 to quantify the contribution of various factors to the decadal variation of middle atmospheric water vapor. Over 1980-1995, the simulated water vapor in the upper stratosphere and mesosphere, averaged zonally and over +/- 30 degrees latitude, increases by 0.30 ppmv per decade due to increasing methane emissions. After 1995, a significant abrupt decrease of water vapor of 0.37 ppmv per decade and then a gradual increase of 0.33 ppmv per decade result from changes in stratospheric cold point temperature. The cold-point temperature is strongly influenced by the strength of the Brewer-Dobson circulation. The acceleration of the Brewer-Dobson circulation before about 2003 leads to a cooler tropical tropopause and a decrease of water vapor, and the deceleration thereafter leads to corresponding warming of the tropopause and an increase in water vapor.

TI  - MutL homolog 1 germline mutation c.(453+1_454-1)_(545+1_546-1)del identified in lynch syndrome: A case report and review of literature
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF CLINICAL CASES
M3  - Review
AB  - BACKGROUND Lynch syndrome (LS) is an autosomal dominant hereditary disorder because of germline mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes, such as MutL homolog 1 (MLH1), PMS1 homolog 2, MutS homolog 2, and MutS homolog 6. Gene mutations could make individuals and their families more susceptible to experiencing various malignant tumors. In Chinese, MLH1 germline mutation c.(453+1_454-1)_(545+1_546-1)del-related LS has been infrequently reported. Therefore, we report a rare LS patient with colorectal and endometrioid adenocarcinoma and describe her pedigree characteristics. CASE SUMMARY A 57-year-old female patient complained of irregular postmenopausal vaginal bleeding for 6 mo. She was diagnosed with LS, colonic malignancy, endometrioid adenocarcinoma, secondary fallopian tube malignancy, and intermyometrial leiomyomas. Then, she was treated by abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral oviduct oophorectomy, and sentinel lymph node resection. Genetic testing was performed using next-generation sequencing technology to detect the causative genetic mutations. Moreover, all her family members were offered a free genetic test, but no one accepted it. CONCLUSION No tumor relapse or metastasis was found in the patient during the 30-mo follow-up period. The genetic panel sequencing showed a novel pathogenic germline mutation in MLH1, c.(453+1_454-1)_(545+1_546-1)del, for LS. Moreover, cancer genetic counseling and testing are still in the initial development state in China, and maybe face numerous challenges in the further.

TI  - Long-term detection and spatiotemporal variation analysis of open-surface water bodies in the Yellow River Basin from 1986 to 2020
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately investigating long-term information about open-surface water bodies can contribute to water resource protection and management. However, due to the limits of big-data calculations for remote sensing, there has been no specific study on the long-term changes in the water bodies in the Yellow River Basin. Thus, in this study, we developed a new combined extraction rule to build an entire annual-scale open-surface water body dataset for 1986-2020 with excellent effectiveness in eliminating the interference of shadows in the Yellow River Basin using all of the available Landsat images. For the first time, the spatial distribution, change trends, conversion processes, and the heterogeneity of the surface water bodies in the Yellow River Basin were analyzed comprehensively to the best of our knowledge. The extraction results had an overall accuracy of 99.70 % and a kappa coefficient of 0.90, which were validated using 34,073 verification points selected on high-resolution Google Earth images and random Landsat images. The total area of water bodies initially decreased (1986-2000) and then increased (2001-2020); however, only the size of the permanent water bodies increased in most areas, while the size of most of the seasonal water bodies decreased. In regions with human-made water bodies, the non-water areas were substantially converted to seasonal and permanent water bodies; however, in areas with natural water bodies, many permanent and seasonal water bodies were gradually converted to non-water areas. Thus, most of the increases in the water bodies occurred in the form of artificial lakes and reservoirs, while most of the decreases in the water body area occurred in natural wetlands and lakes. The areas of both the permanent and seasonal water bodies were positively correlated with precipitation, but only the area of the seasonal water bodies was negatively correlated with temperature.

TI  - Evapotranspiration and carbon exchange of the main agroecosystems and their responses to agricultural land use change in North China Plain
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The North China Plain (NCP) plays an important role in food production while there is serious groundwater overexploitation in this area. The quantified relationship between the variation in evapotranspiration (ET) and net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) and agricultural land use change in NCP remains unclear. In this study, based on the eddy covariance method, water balance method, and remote sensing data, ET and NEE variations were quantified and the impacts of agricultural land use change from 2002 to 2012 on regional ET and NEE variation were analyzed. The average ET and NEE of the winter wheat - summer maize cropland ecosystem were 714.2 mm yr-1 and -534.3 gC m-2 yr-1, respectively. Correspondingly, the above values were 786.2 mm yr-1 and 667.5 gC m-2 yr-1 for the pear orchard ecosystem, and 778.6 mm yr-1 and 814.8 gC m-2 yr-1 for the vegetable field ecosystem, which had relatively high ET and ecosystem productivity. The average annual ET and NEE of the cotton field ecosystem were only 592.0 mm and -351.3 gC m-2, respectively. Agricultural land area increased by 331.2 x 103 ha over 2002-2012, which was caused by the increasing land area of spring maize, forest/fruit trees, and vegetables. As a result, the ET and NEE of the agroecosystems in NCP increased by 25.6 x 108 m3 and -257.9 x 104 tonC from 2002 to 2012, which are beneficial for carbon sequestration. However, the increase in carbon sink was at the cost of greater groundwater overexploitation due to increased regional water consump-tion. The planting of crops with high water consumption should be reduced as the surpluses of these agricultural products compared to the food demand in this region. These results are meaningful for reasonable planting structure adjustment of water-adaptive sustainable agricultural development in the NCP.

TI  - Monitoring of water resources and vegetation in the Helmand Basin using satellite image time-series and border hydro-political challenges
T2  - WATER POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Helmand is the most important river in Afghanistan and an indispensable water resource for southeastern Iran. Recent water depletions in the river, however, have caused environmental issues in the region with further repercussions on long-term hydropolitical debates between the countries of Iran and Afghanistan. The primary reasons underlying depletions in the river's water levels remain, however, unclear, and are the main objective of this study.Therefore, this study proposes a hydro-political analysis of the Hemland Basin by analyzing precipitation through Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) data, Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) land data for groundwater analysis, and Landsat 5 and 8 Images from 1991 to 2020 to classify vegetation and waterbodies using a Support Vector Machine classifier and identify the prime cause of downstream water depletions. Despite severe droughts, the preliminary findings indicated increases in rainfall, groundwater sources, water bodies, and vegetation in the river upstream, which conveys the inconsequential share of droughts to the overall water shortage as opposed to human interventions and water usage which have also shown to increase in the river upstream. Further findings suggest that the severe downstream water depletions are primarily on account of upstream water consumptions that have triggered environmental degradations and are a threat to human habitations.

TI  - New independent component-based spectral index for precise extraction of impervious surfaces through Landsat-8 images
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Our Earth's surface is crowding continuously with built infrastructure, causing a significant role in climate change. Since urban areas combine many components, mainly consisting of four major biophysical components, i.e. vegetation, soil, water, and built-ups that provide the base for our livelihood. The increase in built-ups has become a significant ingredient behind all the changes on the Earth's surface, either degradation of natural resources or the evolution of artificial elements. Therefore, monitoring, tracking, and mapping the urban or built-up areas is important in both cases to derive the spatiotemporal dynamics that cause it and the after-effects. This research is focused on developing an approach for built-up extraction and mapping. The approach is a new spectral index for built-up extraction through Landsat OLI/TIRS imageries using the independent component as one of the thematic layers with a hypothesis of reduced spectral mixing while retrieving features. And the results are positive in minimizing spectral mixing when using this new built-up index to retrieve impervious surfaces while considering the biophysical components of the urban areas. The new index is authenticated and compared for seven different urban areas visually and statistically (with spectral discrimination index and error of commission and omission) to verify its performance and acceptance.

TI  - Distal radius fractures and risk of incident neurocognitive disorders in older adults: a retrospective cohort study
T2  - OSTEOPOROSIS INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Distal radius fractures (DRF) are associated with increased risk of subsequent fractures and physical decline in older adults. This study aims to evaluate the risk cognitive decline following DRF and potential for timely screening and intervention. Methods A cohort of 1046 individuals 50-75 years of age with DRF were identified between 1995 and 2015 (81.5% female; mean age 62.5 [+/- 7.1] years). A control group (N = 1044) without history of DRF was matched by age, sex, and fracture date (i.e., index). The incidence of neurocognitive disorders (NCD) in relation to DRF/index was determined. Group comparisons were adjusted by age and comorbidity measured by the Elixhauser index. Results The DRF group had a greater incidence of NCD compared to the control group (11.3% vs. 8.2%) with a 56% greater relative risk (HR = 1.56, 95% Cl: 1.18, 2.07; p = 0.002) after adjusting for age and comorbidity. For every 10-year age increase, the DRF group was over three times more likely to develop a NCD (HR = 3.23, 95% Cl: 2.57, 4.04; p < 0.001). Conclusion DRF in adults ages 50 to 75 are associated with increased risk of developing neurocognitive disorders. DRF may represent a sentinel opportunity for cognitive screening and early intervention. Distal radius fractures (DRF) have been associated with greater risk of future fractures and physical decline. This study reports that DRF are also associated with greater risk of developing neurocognitive disorders in older adults. Timely intervention may improve early recognition and long-term outcomes for older adults at risk of cognitive decline.

TI  - Structural lineament mapping of Central-Eastern high atlas, Morocco, using ASAR/Envisat and SAR/sentinel 1B data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Central-Eastern part of the High Atlas is dominated by carbonate of Mesozoic age which is affected by the Alpine Orogeny. The deformation manifest in area by different geological structures. The analysis of these later lead to their classification in different category for understanding the geodynamic of the area. This study focuses to map structural lineaments in the Central-Eastern High Atlas using two types of Radar data: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)/Sentinel 1B with polarization (VV + VH) and Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR)/Envisat with polarization (VV + HH). This research aims to demonstrate the utility of Radar data for extracting structural lineaments in carbonate deposits. In this work, two techniques of processing data are used: First, the automatic extraction technique, we are employing the Algorithm Line Module of PCI Geomatica program, after the enhancement of images by applying the mean Co-occurrence filter. Second, the manual extraction technique, it was accomplished by applying directional filters with four directions (N00 degrees, N45 degrees, N90 degrees and N135 degrees) in order to highlight linear structures, then trace the detected lineaments. The synthetic maps of structural lineaments are developed by the two techniques. They are validated by using the lithologic maps extracted from Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI), the previous researches in the study area, shaded relief extracted from ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM), and field investigation data. The results present a good correlation between the direction of structural lineaments extracted from the satellite images and the field measurements. Therefore, the directions of lineaments extracted are N-S and E-W, NE-SW and NW-SE, especially the abundance of the direction N-S. This last one is perpendicular with the major faults. The density of structural lineaments in the study area is controlled particularly by the lithological nature and dynamic evolution, where the concentration is high in the Liassic carbonates. The geostatistical and spatial distribution of the structural lineaments led us to conclude that different tectonic factors are responsible for the distribution of lineaments in the surface of the study area. The comparison of two types of radar data shows that Envisat data is more efficient in the manual extraction than Sentinel 1B data. However, Sentinel 1B data is more efficient in the automatic extraction than Envisat data. This work identifies several families of structural lineaments which can be determined the tectonic phases of the Alpine orogeny affected the intracontinental Atlas basin.

TI  - Accelerated mobilization of organic carbon from retrogressive thaw slumps on the northern Taymyr Peninsula
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - With climate change, Arctic hillslopes above ice-rich permafrost are vulnerable to enhanced mass wasting and organic carbon mobilization. In this study we use TanDEM-X-derived (TerraSAR-X add-on for Digital Elevation Measurement; synthetic-aperture radar) digital elevation models to document an approximately 43-fold increase in thaw slumping and concomitant 28-fold increase in carbon mobilization on the northern Taymyr Peninsula from 2010 to 2021. The available observations allowed us to compare two time periods, from 2010/11 to 2016/17 and from 2017/18 to 2020/21, and contrast retrogressive thaw slump (RTS) activity between these periods. We find that all quantities describing RTS activity increased in the observed period. The total volumetric change per year increased from about 0.17 x 10(6) to 7.4 x 10(6) m(3) yr(-1), a 43-fold increase. The observed surge in RTS activity is mainly driven by the initiation of new RTS, indicated by the 17-fold increase in active RTS numbers from 82 to 1404 and the relatively low average volumetric change rate per RTS increase of 2.3. In annual Sentinel-2 imagery, the number of detected RTSs in a subregion increased 10-fold in 2020. This coincides with a severe heatwave that occurred in northern Siberia in 2020. The area-to-volume scaling of the RTSs varied only slightly over time, despite the 2020 heatwave, indicating a robustness of the relationship to such an event. To estimate the slump-mobilized organic carbon, we intersected the elevation changes with a soil organic carbon (SOC) map, with contrasting assumptions about the deep carbon pool and massive-ice content. We estimated that the SOC mobilization rate increases 28-fold. The normalization of the SOC mobilization rate to our study region yields values of 11 gC yr(-1) m(-2) with a confidence interval of 5 to 38 gC yr(-1) m(-2). A comparison to an independent estimate of the net ecosystem exchange of 4.1 +/- 13.0 gC yr(-1)m(-2) illustrates the importance of RTS activity to the carbon cycle. These results underscore that mass wasting is an important but commonly neglected component of the Arctic carbon cycle and particularly sensitive to extreme events.

TI  - Remote Sensing Quantitative Research on Soil Erosion in the Upper Reaches of the Minjiang River
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The upper reaches of the Minjiang River are an important ecological barrier to the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and Chengdu Plain. They are also the water resources of Chengdu Plain. To protect the headwater ecosystems, it is necessary to carry out quantitative research on soil erosion in this area. This study mainly applies the USLE model to quantitatively evaluate the spatial distribution of ecosystem services on soil erosion and soil conservation. The evaluation is based on the following data: remote sensing image, meteorological radiation data, DEM, soil types, physical and chemical properties of the soil, vegetation types, and land use status. With advanced Earth observation technology, satellite remote sensing images about terrestrial vegetation and other evaluation parameters can be obtained in real time. The seasonal changes in vegetation coverage and the physical and chemical properties of soil have been fully considered. The results show that 1) the value of rainfall erosivity factor (R) is between 85.02 and 588.69 MJ.mm/(hm(2).h.a), and its spatial distribution is consistent with that of annual average precipitation. 2) Soil erodibility factor (K) is between 0.12 and 0.30 (t hm(2 )h).(hm(2) MJ mm), showing zonal distribution, and is related to soil types. 3) Slope length and gradient factor (LS) range from 0.03 to 46.16. It is positively correlated with topographic relief. 4) Soil conservation measure factor (P) ranges from 0 to 1 and is determined by the land use and coverage. 5) Rainfall has a dominant impact on soil erosion, and the study area with violent and intense erosion reaches 17,302.17 km(2) , accounting for 69.81% of the total area. The soil conservation amount (T) in the study area is 283.45 million tons, and the ecosystem services are worth 434.48 million yuan. 6) RS and GIS techniques enable quick estimation. However, this assessment contains considerable uncertainty. It is still hard to reveal the physical process of soil erosion with empirical models.

TI  - Combining refutations and social norms increases belief change
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Misinformed beliefs are difficult to change. Refutations that target false claims typically reduce false beliefs, but tend to be only partially effective. In this study, a social norming approach was explored to test whether provision of peer norms could provide an alternative or complementary approach to refutation. Three experiments investigated whether a descriptive norm-by itself or in combination with a refutation-could reduce the endorsement of worldview-congruent claims. Experiment 1 found that using a single-point estimate to communicate a norm affected belief but had less impact than a refutation. Experiment 2 used a verbally presented distribution of four values to communicate a norm, which was largely ineffective. Experiment 3 used a graphically presented social norm with 25 values, which was found to be as effective at reducing claim belief as a refutation, with the combination of both interventions being most impactful. These results provide a proof of concept that normative information can aid in the debunking of false or equivocal claims, and suggests that theories of misinformation processing should take social factors into account.

TI  - Detecting overmature forests with airborne laser scanning (ALS)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Building a network of interconnected overmature forests is crucial for the conservation of biodiversity. Indeed, a multitude of plant and animal species depend on forest structural maturity attributes such as very large living trees and deadwood. LiDAR technology has proved to be powerful when assessing forest structural parameters, and it may be a promising way to identify existing overmature forest patches over large areas. We first built an index (IMAT) combining several forest structural maturity attributes in order to characterize the structural maturity of 660 field plots in the French northern Pre-Alps. We then selected or developed LiDAR metrics and applied them in a random forest model designed to predict the IMAT. Model performance was evaluated with the root mean square error of prediction obtained from a bootstrap cross-validation and a Spearman correlation coefficient calculated between observed and predicted IMAT. Predictors were ranked by importance based on the average increase in the squared out-of-bag error when the variable was randomly permuted. Despite a non-negligible RMSEP (0.85 for calibration and validation data combined and 1.26 for validation data alone), we obtained a high correlation (0.89) between the observed and predicted IMAT values, indicating an accurate ranking of the field plots. LiDAR metrics for height (maximum height and height heterogeneity) were among the most important metrics for predicting forest maturity, together with elevation, slope and, to a lesser extent, with metrics describing the distribution of echoes' intensities. Our framework makes it possible to reconstruct a forest maturity gradient and isolate maturity hot spots. Nevertheless, our approach could be considerably strengthened by taking into consideration site fertility, collecting other maturity attributes in the field or developing adapted LiDAR metrics. Including additional spectral or textural metrics from optical imagery might also improve the predictive capacity of the model.

TI  - Spatio-temporal characterization of surface water dynamics with Landsat in endorheic Cuvelai-Etosha Basin (1990-2021)
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Socio-economic damages caused by extreme floods have been increasing rapidly in recent years, mainly driven by changes in the climate and modulated by increasing human population in deltic areas and floodplains. The Cuvelai-Etosha Basin (CEB) in southern Africa, covering southern Angola and northern Namibia, experiences socially and economically devastating extreme floods. Yet, accurate information on past and current surface water changes and dynamics is lacking. Here, we estimate and map the surface water extents in the CEB and its surroundings (CEB + S) for 32 years (1990-2021) from Landsat data using random forest models to provide long-term baseline information on surface water changes and dynamics. Based on the reference data, a total of 15,677 +/- 1080 km(2 )have been inundated by surface water in the CEB + S during 1990-2021. This extent was accurately mapped by our local water extent product (mapped area = 16,273 km(2), user's accuracy = 91.5 +/- 2.5%, producer's accuracy = 91.1 +/- 6%). With user's and producer's accuracy of 91%, our overall water extent provides the first most accurate long-term baseline information on surface water inundation in CEB + S necessary for local spatial planning processes to minimise future negative impacts of floods in the basin. Interannual variability of surface water extent is, however, high, with water extent ranging from 520.8 +/- 375.7 km(2) to 12372.3 +/- 1154.7 km(2) during the 1990-2021 period. The largest annual water extents (> 10,000 km(2)) were recorded in 2006, 2008, 2009, 2011, and 2017, whereas the smallest extents (< 1000 km(2)) were recorded in 1992 and 2019. We found that over 40% of the area inundated in the CEB + S during 1990-2021 was inundated less than 9 times. With human population increasing rapidly in the CEB + S, rarely inundated areas with short water residence could become a prime target for human settlements, which may lead to huge socio-economic damages during extreme floods if no preventive measures are put in place. Globally available surface water maps from the Global Land Analysis and Discovery (GLAD) and European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) did not provide realistic surface water extent for CEB + S, especially during years with extreme floods. Therefore, locally adopted product for operational monitoring of surface water in the CEB + S is needed to provide accurate information for informing spatial planning processes and surface water resource management strategies in this endorheic basin and help minimise future negative impacts of floods.

TI  - Estimating mangrove above-ground biomass at Maowei Sea, Beibu Gulf of China using machine learning algorithm with Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Blue carbon ecosystems such as mangroves are natural barriers to resisting and alleviating the impact of storm surges and extreme catastrophic weather. Accurate and efficient determination of the aboveground biomass of mangroves is of great importance for the protection and restoration of blue carbon ecosystems and their response to climate change. This study proposes a light gradient boosting model (LGBM) based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm for feature selection. We constructed and verified the proposed model using 227 quadrat datasets from a field survey and Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. The determination coefficient (R-2) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) were used to evaluate the performance of the model. Compared with random forest(RF), K-nearest neighbourhood regression(KNNR), extreme gradient boosting(XGBR), LGBM, and other machine learning algorithms, the LGBM-PSO model achieves better results (R-2 = 0.7807, RMSE = 24.6864 Mg center dot ha(-1)), The predicted range of mangrove biomass is 4.623-206.975 Mg center dot ha(-1). Therefore, the use of multisource remote sensing data combined with the LGBM-PSO model can provide better prediction results of aboveground biomass of mangroves, thereby providing a new method for estimating the aboveground biomass of large-scale mangroves.

TI  - A nomogram for predicting three or more axillary lymph node involvement before breast cancer surgery
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG)-Z0011, a useful nomogram has been constructed to identify patients who do not require intraoperative frozen sections to evaluate sentinel lymph nodes in the previous study. This study investigated the developed nomogram by ultrasonography (US) and positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) as a modality. In the training set, 89/1030 (8.6%) patients had three or more positive nodes. Larger tumor size, higher grade ultrasonographic ALN classification, and findings suspicious of positive ALN on PET/CT were associated in multivariate analysis. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the nomogram were 0.856 [95% CI 0.815-0.897] in the training set. The AUC in the validation set was 0.866 [95% CI 0.799-0.934]. Application of the nomogram to 1067 patients who met the inclusion criteria of ACOSOG-Z0011 showed that 90 (8.4%) patients had scores above the cut-off and a false-negative result was 37 (3.8%) patients. And the specificity was 93.8%, and the negative predictive value was 96.4%. The upgraded nomogram improved the predictive accuracy, using only US and PET/CT. This nomogram is useful for identifying patients who do not require intraoperative analysis of sentinel lymph nodes and considering candidates for identifying neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The patients consisted of clinical T1-2 and node-negative invasive breast cancer. The training and validation set consisted of 1030 and 781 patients, respectively. A nomogram was constructed by analyzing factors related to three or more axillary lymph node metastases. The patients who matched the ACOSOG-Z0011 criteria were selected and applied to the new nomogram.

TI  - An improved approach of dry snow density estimation using C-band synthetic aperture radar data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow density is one of the important indicators of snow cover hydrological potential. The application of existing algorithms for retrieving dry snow density using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data is limited by single scattering mechanism, small terrain fluctuation or narrow incidence angle range. In the study, an improved approach was proposed to retrieve dry snow density from C-band SAR data with a wide range of roughness and local incidence angles. Both the snow-ground interface scattering and volume scattering were considered in the approach. First, the relationship between the backscattering at the snow-ground interface and relative permittivity was obtained based on simulation using the Advanced Integral Equation Model (AIEM) and regression analysis. Then the classical relationship between the volume backscattering and relative permittivity obtained by the first-order volume scattering model was incorporated into the approach. For comparison, the coefficients of the Shi algorithm were redefined by the AIEM model and regression analysis, and the Shi algorithm initially developed for L-band was modified for C-band. In experiments, the RADARSAT-2 data obtained in the Manasi River Basin on December 12-17, 2013 and the C-band GaoFen-3 data obtained in the Kelan River Basin on January 17, 2018 were selected to validate the applicability of the proposed approach under different conditions. The inversion results in the Manasi River Basin using the proposed approach, Singh algorithm, and modified Shi algorithm were compared. The results in the Manasi River Basin show that the correlation coefficients (Rs) between the measured and estimated dry snow density are 0.868, 0.694, and 0.653 for the three methods, respectively. The root mean square errors (RMSEs) are 31.1 kg m(-3), 59.1 kg m(-3), and 64.7 kg m(-3), respectively, and the mean relative errors (MREs) are 12.9%, 21.9%, and 25.5%, respectively. The corresponding R, RMSE, and MRE in the Kelan River Basin using the proposed approach are 0.717, 57.2 kg m(-3), and 27.1%, respectively. The results prove that the dry snow density under different C-band SAR data and different areas can be effectively retrieved using the proposed approach superior to the other two algorithms.

TI  - Structural Characteristics of Micro-nano Particle Size Biochar and Its Adsorption Mechanism for Cd<SUP>2+</SUP>
T2  - Huanjing Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the structural characteristics of biochar with different micro/nano particle sizes and its effect on the adsorption performance of Cd2+. Corn stalk biochar with different particle sizes (180-250 mu m, 50-75 mu m, and <= 20 mu m, denoted as BC-1, BC-2, and BC-3, respectively) were prepared using the sieving and ball milling method. The structural properties of different particle sizes of biochar were analyzed via elemental analysis, laser particle size analysis, SEM, BET, FTIR, and XPS. Additionally, the adsorption mechanisms of Cd2+ by three particle sizes of biochar under initial Cd2+ concentrations, adsorption times, and pH conditions were comparatively studied using static adsorption experiments. The results showed that with the decrease in particle size, the pH and zeta potential of biochar were reduced; the aromaticity and polarity decreased; the specific surface area and pore volume increased; and the intensity of the characteristic peaks containing OH, C[FY=,1]C/C[FY=,1]O, and C-O groups increased. The adsorption kinetics of Cd2+ with different particle diameters of biochar were in accordance with the pseudo-secondary kinetic model, with chemisorption dominating. The equilibrium times were in the decreasing order of BC-1 (540 min)>BC-2 (360 min)>BC-3 (80 min). The Langmuir model could better fit the adsorption isotherm process of Cd2+ on biochar of different particle sizes (R-2>0.97), and the maximum adsorption capacity of Cd2+ increased with the decrease in particle size, which was expressed as BC-3 (74.43 mg.g(-1))>BC-2 (45.71 mg.g(-1))>BC-1 (44.59 mg.g(-1)). The main mechanisms of Cd(2+)adsorption by biochar were electrostatic attraction, surface complexation, and cation-pi interaction.

TI  - Web crippling design of channel beams: Carbon steel, stainless steel and aluminium
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTIONAL STEEL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent trends in the construction industry have sought to use cold-formed (CF) carbon steel, CF aluminium and CF stainless-steel as flexural members and in some instances as primary load-carrying members. Flexural members when subjected to concentrated loads undergo various failure modes, a major failure mode being web crippling. The large width-to-thickness ratios of these thin-walled beams makes them vulnerable to local buckling failure. Although there are four loading conditions to consider, this paper focuses on Interior-OneFlange (IOF) loading condition. Currently, individual design equations are available for determining the web crippling capacity of CF carbon steel, CF aluminium and CF stainless-steel under IOF loading. However, to-date there has been no attempt to produce a unified web crippling design equation. An all-encompassing numerical study focussed on the key web crippling parameters, both cross-sectional dimensions and mechanical properties and a unified grade, fy = 220 MPa, was achieved across the three structural materials to allow for a unified design equation. A total of 378 Finite Element (FE) models were obtained. It was found that AS/NZS 4600, AISI S100 and Eurocode 3 provided good agreement, but with a higher coefficient of variation (COV) values than recommended. Additionally, AS/NZS 1664.1 was found to be unsafe. CF carbon steel parametric study results validated existing equations, which were accurate and able to predict the web crippling capacity under IOF loading. However, unified web crippling design equation was modified which can improve the accuracy when predicting the web crippling capacity of CF aluminium and CF stainless-steel lipped channel sections (LCBs) under IOF loading conditions. The unified equation was supplemented by web crippling coefficients specific to each of the structural materials.

TI  - Accurate mapping of Chinese coastal aquaculture ponds using biophysical parameters based on Sentinel-2 time series images
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Aquaculture plays a crucial role in the global food security and nutrition supply, where China accounts for the largest market share. Although there are some studies that focus on large-scale extraction of coastal aquaculture ponds from satellite images, they have often variable accuracies and encounter misclassification due to the similar geometric characteristics of various vivid water bodies. This paper proposes an efficient and novel method that integrates the spatial characteristics and three biophysical parameters (Chlorophyll-a, Trophic State Index, and Floating Algae Index) to map coastal aquaculture ponds at a national scale. These parameters are derived from bio-optical models based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform and time series of high-resolution Sentinel-2 images. Our proposed method effectively addresses the misclassification issue between the aquaculture ponds and rivers, lakes, reservoirs, and salt pans and achieves an overall accuracy of 91 % and a Kappa coefficient of 0.83 in the Chinese coastal zone. Our results indicate that the total area of Chinese coastal aquaculture ponds was 1,039,214 ha in 2019, mainly distributed in the Shandong and Guangdong provinces. The highest aquaculture intensity occurs within the 1 km coastal buffer zone, accounting for 22.4 % of the total area. Furthermore, more than half of the Chinese coastal aquaculture ponds are concentrated in the 0-5 km buffer zone. Our method is of general applicability and thus is suitable for large-scale aquaculture ponds mapping projects. Moreover, the biophysical parameters we employ can be considered as new indicators for the classification of various water bodies even with different aquaculture species.

TI  - Projection of future numbers of mesothelioma cases in the US and the increasing prevalence of background cases: an update based on SEER data for 1975 through 2018
T2  - CRITICAL REVIEWS IN TOXICOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Historically, mesothelioma, which is almost exclusively a cancer of the pleura or peritoneum, has been referred to as a sentinel disease for asbestos exposure meaning that the disease is an epidemiologic marker for asbestos. This description of mesothelioma often has been misinterpreted to mean that the only risk factor for mesothelioma is asbestos. In addition to a few risk factors other than asbestos, in the US, background mesotheliomas, i.e. mesothelioma cases that are a consequence of spontaneous tumor formation, are the most prevalent number of cases after asbestos-associated cases.(1) My analysis of SEER data for 1973 through 2005 published in 2009 projected that around 2040 virtually all mesothelioma cases in the US will be background cases. The update here, which is based on the most current SEER data, 1975 through 2018, and the same methods used in 2009 shows that the pattern of mesothelioma incidence is unchanged. Further, in general agreement with the analysis published in 2009, after 2040 virtually all mesothelioma cases, currently estimated to be approximately 1600 per year, will be background cases.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy in pediatric Wilms tumor
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Although the sentinel lymph node Biopsy (SLNB) is well stablished in solid tumors among adults but the experience on SLNB in pediatrics is still limited. In this article we report our experience of sentinel lymph node detection that is applied on pediatric solid renal tumors.Material and methods: Twenty 1-16 year old children with non-metastatic primary Wilms tumor regarding the radiological studies were enrolled. Radio tracer injection was carried out after renal vein, artery and ureter ligation, at the time of radical nephrectomy. Sentinel node detection and sampling was performed in every location with radiotracer count of 3 times more than background. Finally lymph node sampling was completed following the standard current discipline in Wilms tumor surgery.Results: A single SLN was detected in 16 patients. 4 patients had more than one SLN. The most common site of SLN was inter aortocaval space. Histopathologic studies revealed tumor involvement in 3 sentinel nodes (15%). All other lymph node samples were also studied histologically and LN involvement was not detected in any of the cases with tumor free sentinel lymph node (no false negative case). Multiple LN involvement was reported in two patients with positive SLN in which, other involved lymph nodes were removed with the tumor during radical nephrectomy.Conclusion: Intraoperative SLNB is a safe and feasible tool to improve the accuracy of staging in pediatric Wilms' tumor. We suggest to ligate renal artery and vein prior to radiotracer injection to diminish the background confounding effect. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Spatial-temporal Distribution and Evolution Characteristics of Air Pollution in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region Based on Long-term "Ground-Satellite" Data
T2  - Huanjing Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to promote the coordinated development of regional social economy and ecological environment, build a better living environment, accurately prevent and control pollution, and carry out in-depth surveys and general surveys of air pollution in Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei. Based on 6 years (June 2014 to December 2019) of ground environmental observation data and satellite data from 2000 to 2019, the distribution characteristics and evolution trend of air pollution in different time and spatial scales were analyzed. The results showed that: (1) according to the daily average concentration of PM2.5 at the sites, the pollution in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region showed the characteristics of more days, heavy levels, and overall improvement. Pollution mainly occurred from October to April of the following year, accounting for nearly half a year. The pollution level of PM2.5 was the best at Zhangjiakou, followed by Qinhuangdao. (2) Based on the 20-year average PM2.5 annual average concentration data retrieved from satellites, the PM2.5 concentration presented a spatial distribution characteristic in which that in the plains was higher than that in mountain area, and PM2.5 concentration in the city was higher than that in the suburbs. PM2.5 concentration changed with time, showing a four-stage bimodal structure of "M"-type evolution characteristics, which gradually increased starting in 2000; the first peak appeared in 2006 and gradually decreased from 2007 to 2012. It rose sharply to the second peak in 2013 and then decreased yearly until 2017. (3) The monthly average AOT data based on satellites every 10 years indicated that the value of AOT in the first time period (2000-2009) was larger than that in the same month of the second time period (2010-2019). The maximum value was in July, and the minimum value was in December. The monthly average AOT in Zhangjiakou and Chengde changed slightly over the past 20 years, and the seasonal and spatial differences were significant in the plain area. (4) Judging from the daily average value of O-3-8h observed at the stations, good levels of O-3-8h concentrations in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area occurred frequently and widely from March to October. There were at least seven instances of light pollution levels, and the moderate pollution levels and above were not observed. (5) The daily average value of SO2 observed on the ground showed that there was no light pollution or above; the good pollution level occurred in winter, and most appeared in the form of pollution for several consecutive days. (6) The analysis of AQI data revealed that from 2015 to 2019, the proportion of AQI excellent grades in Beijing increased from 27% to 38%, and the proportion of Tianjin AQI good grades increased from 44% to 64%. The highest proportion of Handan AQI superior grades appeared in 2016, accounting for only 9%. (7) The 20-year monthly average concentration of SO2 data based on satellites showed that high-value areas were in Handan, Xingtai, and Shijiazhuang, and low-value areas were in Zhangjiakou and Chengde. The 20-year average NO2 data showed that the high-value centers were in Beijing, Tianjin, Tangshan, Handan, Xingtai, and Shijiazhuang.

TI  - Climate, hydrology, and human disturbance drive long-term (1988-2018) macrophyte patterns in water diversion lakes
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Macrophytes are affected by many natural and human stressors globally but their long-term responses to these multiple stressors are not often quantified. We employed remote sensing and statistical tools to analyze datasets from both short-term (2017-2018) field investigations to explore seasonal patterns, and long-term (1988-2018) Landsat remote-sensing images to detect annual patterns of macrophyte distributions and study their responses to changes in climate, hydrology, and anthropogenic activities in a chain of water diversion lakes in eastern China. We found: 1) biomass and species richness of macrophytes peaked in summer with dominant species of submerged macrophytes Ceratophyllum demersum, Potamogeton pectinatus, and Potamogeton maackianus and floating macrophytes Trapa bispinosa, and non-native species Cabomba caroliniana spread in midstream Luoma Lake and Nansi Lake in summer, while Potamogeton crispus was dominant in all the lakes in spring; 2) water physicochemical parameters (chloride and water depth), lake characteristics (area and water storage), climate factors (air temperature and precipitation), and anthropogenic activities (commercial fishery and urban development) were significantly correlated to the seasonal distribution of macrophytes; 3) long-term data showed a significantly negative correlation between coverage of floating macrophytes and precipitation where the wettest year of 2003 had the lowest coverage of floating macrophytes; and 4) climate (air temperature) and hydrology (water level) were positively correlated with total macrophyte coverage, but human disturbance indexed by the gross domestic product was negatively driving long-term coverage of macrophytes. Our study has important implications for understanding the long-term succession of macrophytes under both natural and human stressors, and for future environmental management and ecological restoration of freshwater lakes.

TI  - Damaged Building Detection with Improved Swin-Unet Model
T2  - WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Automatic detection of damaged buildings from satellite remote sensing data has become an urgent problem to rescue planners and military personnel. Unfortunately damaged buildings are in different dimensions and shapes with different roofs depending on the type of the material to be painted. In this study, we present an improved Swin-Unet approach that comprises three main operations. First, improved Swin-Unet as a Unet-like pure Transformer is used for multitemporal image segmentation. Second, different multitemporal features are extracted using hyperspectral image classification algorithm. Finally, a binary change map is generated, and evaluation results are obtained. This article takes AIST building change detection scene as the example, and compared with the conventional approaches tested, overall accuracy, mean intersection over union, and separated Kappa in the proposed method were improved by at least 23.36, 0.1725, and 0.202, respectively. Furthermore, different scenes, such as Gaofen-2/Jilin-1 multitemporal optical images and satellite imagery dataset (xBD), have also come to the same conclusion. Thus, it provides advantageous capabilities for monitoring damaged buildings along coastal areas.

In this study, on the basis of the MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), in situ climate data, digital elevation model, population density, nighttime lights using Theil-Sen Median analysis, Mann-Kendall significance test, stability analysis, and geographical detector model, the spatiotemporal variation and stability of vegetation cover in the context of multi-spatiotemporal scales were analyzed, and the dominant influencing factors that affect the spatial differentiation of vegetation cover were further detected. The results showed that the vegetation cover showed a fluctuant increasing trend, and the changing trend exhibited obvious spatial heterogeneity with the increasing rate being higher in the middle and lower in the east and west portion of the Yangtze River basin from 2000 to 2020. At the sub-basin scale, except for that in the Taihu Lake basin, the vegetation cover in all sub-basin units exhibited an increasing trend during the study period. The areas with an increasing trend accounted for 84.09% of the study area, in which the areas with extremely significant increases and significant increases accounted for 53.67%, which were mainly distributed in the Wujiang River basin, Yibin-yichang, Jialing River basin, Han River basin, and Dongting Lake basin. The vegetation cover showed lower stability in the upper reaches of the Jinsha-shigu River basin and Taihu Lake basin and higher stability in other sub-basin units of the study area. Elevation was an important factor affecting the vegetation variation in all sub-basin areas. Climatic factors presented the highest impact on vegetation variation in the upper reaches of the Jinsha-shigu River basin, and human activities exhibited the greatest impact on vegetation variation in the Wujiang River basin, lower reaches of Hukou basin, and Taihu Lake basin. The interaction of the two influencing factors on vegetation variation showed mutual and non-linear enhancement, and the interaction between elevation and wind speed presented the highest value, with an explanatory power of 68%. The ecological exploration results showed that human activities combined with topographic factors and climate factors, except for slope and relative humidity, significantly differed in the explanatory power of vegetation variation in the Yangtze River basin. These results can provide a basis for formulating comprehensive vegetation resource management in the Yangtze River basin that takes into account regional climate, topography, and human activities.

TI  - Mapping 20 years of irrigated croplands in China using MODIS and statistics and existing irrigation products
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - As a routine agricultural practice, irrigation is fundamental to protect crops from water scarcity and ensure food security in China. However, consistent and reliable maps about the spatial distribution and extent of irrigated croplands are still unavailable, impeding water resource management and agricultural planning. Here, we produced annual 500-m irrigated cropland maps across China for 2000-2019, using a two-step strategy that integrated statistics, remote sensing, and existing irrigation products into a hybrid irrigation dataset. First, we generated intermediate irrigation maps (MIrAD-GI) by fusing the MODIS-derived greenness index and statistical data. Second, we collected all existing available irrigation maps over China and integrated them with MIrAD-GI into an improved series of annual irrigation maps, using constrained statistics and a synergy mapping method. The resultant maps had moderate overall accuracies (0.732 similar to 0.819) based on nationwide reference ground samples and outperformed existing irrigation products by inter-comparison. As the first of this kind in China, the annual maps delineated the spatiotemporal pattern of irrigated croplands and could contribute to sustainable water use and agricultural development.

TI  - Fractional Fourier Image Transformer for Multimodal Remote Sensing Data Classification
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - With the recent development of the joint classification of hyperspectral image (HSI) and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data, deep learning methods have achieved promising performance owing to their locally sematic feature extracting ability. Nonetheless, the limited receptive field restricted the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to represent global contextual and sequential attributes, while visual image transformers (VITs) lose local semantic information. Focusing on these issues, we propose a fractional Fourier image transformer (FrIT) as a backbone network to extract both global and local contexts effectively. In the proposed FrIT framework, HSI and LiDAR data are first fused at the pixel level, and both multisource feature and HSI feature extractors are utilized to capture local contexts. Then, a plug-and-play image transformer FrIT is explored for global contextual and sequential feature extraction. Unlike the attention-based representations in classic VIT, FrIT is capable of speeding up the transformer architectures massively and learning valuable contextual information effectively and efficiently. More significantly, to reduce redundancy and loss of information from shallow to deep layers, FrIT is devised to connect contextual features in multiple fractional domains. Five HSI and LiDAR scenes including one newly labeled benchmark are utilized for extensive experiments, showing improvement over both CNNs and VITs.

TI  - Estimating NH<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> emissions from the Australia mega wildfires and the impact of plume transport on air quality in Australia and New Zealand
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the highly flammable biota and a shortfall of precipitation in Australia, wildfires (bushfires) are connected with Australia's ecology and culture. These wildfires affect air quality, emitting ammonia (NH3) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5), among other pollutants, into the atmosphere. Record breaking temperatures and drought contributed to the unprecedented 2019-2020 Australian wildfire season in Southeastern Australia. The objective of this study is to calculate emissions of PM2.5 and NH3 from wildfires from December 29, 2019, to January 4, 2020 and to analyze the air quality impact on Southeast Australia associated with these mega wildfires. Emissions of PM2.5 and NH3 were calculated using a combination of satellite data for burn area and land classification and emissions factors from the literature. The impact of PM2.5 in Southeast Australia, Southwest shore of New Zealand, and the inner part of Australia were estimated by performing a Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) analysis. The results of this work show that fire activity in the study region produced 526 569 125 kg of NH3 and 41 167 586 kg of PM2.5 during the period of interest. Between December 29, 2019, and January 4, 2020, hourly concentrations of PM2.5 reached 2496.1 mu g m(-3) in Australia and 48.8 mu g m(-3) in New Zealand, exceeding the national standard of 25 mu g m(-3) a total of 100 and 2 times, respectively, which suggests the influence the fires have on air quality in the region.

TI  - Epidemiological and microbiological investigation of a large increase in vibriosis, northern Europe, 2018
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Vibriosis cases in Northern European countries and countries bordering the Baltic Sea increased during heatwaves in 2014 and 2018. Aim: We describe the epidemiology of vibriosis and the genetic diversity of Vibrio spp. isolates from Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Poland and Estonia in 2018, a year with an exceptionally warm summer. Methods: In a retrospective study, we analysed demographics, geographical distribution, seasonality, causative species and severity of non-travel-related vibriosis cases in 2018. Data sources included surveillance systems, national laboratory notification databases and/or nationwide surveys to public health microbiology laboratories. Moreover, we performed whole genome sequencing and multilocus sequence typing of available isolates from 2014 to 2018 to map their genetic diversity. Results: In 2018, we identified 445 non-travel-related vibriosis cases in the study countries, considerably more than the median of 126 cases between 2014 and 2017 (range: 87-272). The main reported mode of transmission was exposure to seawater. We observed a species-specific geographical disparity of vibriosis cases across the Nordic-Baltic region. Severe vibriosis was associated with infections caused by Vibrio vulnificus (adjOR: 17.2; 95% CI: 3.3-90.5) or Vibrio parahaemolyticus (adjOR: 2.1; 95% CI: 1.0-4.5), age >= 65 years (65-79 years: adjOR: 3.9; 95% CI: 1.7-8.7; >= 80 years: adjOR: 15.5; 95% CI: 4.4-54.3) or acquiring infections during summer (adjOR: 5.1; 95% CI: 2.4-10.9). Although phylogenetic analysis revealed diversity between Vibrio spp. isolates, two V. vulnificus clusters were identified. Conclusion: Shared sentinel surveillance for vibriosis during summer may be valuable to monitor this emerging public health issue.

TI  - Genome-wide association for milk urea concentration in Dual-Purpose Belgian Blue cows
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANIMAL BREEDING AND GENETICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The objectives of this study were to estimate genetic parameters and identify genomic regions associated with milk urea concentration (MU) in Dual-Purpose Belgian Blue (DPBB) cows. The data were 29,693 test-day records of milk yield (MY), fat yield (FY), protein yield (PY), fat percentage (FP), protein percentage (PP) and MU collected between 2014 and 2020 on 2498 first parity cows (16,935 test-day records) and 1939 second-parity cows (12,758 test-day records) from 49 herds in the Walloon Region of Belgium. Data of 28,266 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), located on 29 Bos taurus autosomes (BTA), on 1699 animals (639 males and 1060 females) were used. Random regression test-day models were used to estimate genetic parameters through the Bayesian Gibbs sampling method using a single chain of 100,000 iterations after a burn-in period of 20,000. SNP solutions were estimated using a single-step genomic best linear unbiased prediction approach. The proportion of genetic variance explained by windows of 25 consecutive SNPs (with an average size of similar to 2 Mb) was calculated, and regions accounting for at least 1.0% of the total additive genetic variance were used to search for candidate genes. The mean (SD) of MU was 22.89 (10.07) and 22.35 (10.07) mg/dl for first and second parity, respectively. The mean (SD) heritability estimates for daily MU were 0.18 (0.01) and 0.22 (0.02), for first and second parity, respectively. The mean (SD) genetic correlations between daily MU and MY, FY, PY, FP and PP were -0.05 (0.09), -0.07 (0.11), -0.03 (0.13), -0.05 (0.08) and -0.03 (0.11) for first parity, respectively. The corresponding values estimated for second parity were 0.02 (0.10), -0.02 (0.09), 0.02 (0.08), -0.08 (0.06) and -0.05 (0.05). The genome-wide association analyses identified three genomic regions (BTA2, BTA3 and BTA13) associated with MU. The identified regions showed contrasting results between parities and among different stages within each parity. This suggests that different groups of candidate genes underlie the phenotypic expression of MU between parities and among different lactation stages within a parity. The results of this study can be used for future implementation and use of genomic evaluation to reduce MU in DPBB cows.

TI  - Incorporating InSAR kinematics into rock glacier inventories: insights from 11 regions worldwide
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rock glaciers are landforms related to permafrost creep that are sensitive to climate variability and change. Their spatial distribution and kinematic behaviour can be critical for managing water resources and geohazards in periglacial areas. Rock glaciers have been inventoried for decades worldwide, often without assessment of their kinematics. The availability of remote sensing data however makes the inclusion of kinematic information potentially feasible, but requires a common methodology in order to create homogeneous inventories. In this context, the International Permafrost Association (IPA) Action Group on rock glacier inventories and kinematics (2018-2023), with the support of the European Space Agency (ESA) Permafrost Climate Change Initiative (CCI) project, is defining standard guidelines for the inclusion of kinematic information within inventories. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of applying common rules proposed by the Action Group in 11 regions worldwide. Spaceborne interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) was used to characterise identifiable moving areas related to rock glaciers, applying a manual and a semi-automated approach. Subsequently, these areas were used to assign kinematic information to rock glaciers in existing or newly compiled inventories. More than 5000 moving areas and more than 3600 rock glaciers were classified according to their kinematics. The method and the preliminary results were analysed. We identified drawbacks related to the intrinsic limitations of InSAR and to various applied strategies regarding the integration of non-moving rock glaciers in some investigated regions. This is the first internationally coordinated work that incorporates kinematic attributes within rock glacier inventories at a global scale. The results show the value of designing standardised inventorying procedures for periglacial geomorphology.

TI  - Potential glacial lake outburst flood assessment in a changing environment, Chhombo Chhu Watershed, Sikkim Himalaya, India
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Chhombo Chhu Watershed of Tista basin in Sikkim Himalaya, located between the Greater Himalayan range and the Tethyan Sedimentary Sequence, is the storehouse of number of glacial lakes with large areas and volumes. In this study, we mapped the glacial lakes changes between 1975-2018 and assessed its dynamics based on manual analysis of optical satellite images using KeyHole-9 Hexagon (similar to 4 m), Landsat Series (similar to 15-30 m), and Sentinel 2 A-MSI (similar to 10-20 m) imagery and verified during field surveys. The results show that the number of lakes has increased from 62 to 98, and its total area expanded significantly by similar to 34.6 +/- 5.4%, i.e. from 8.5 +/- 0.2 km(2) in 1975 to 11.4 +/- 0.6 km(2) by 2018, at an expansion rate of 0.8 +/- 0.1% a(-1). Lake outburst susceptibility result reveals that a total of twenty-seven potentially dangerous glacial lakes exist in the watershed; 5 have a status of 'high' outburst probability, 17 'medium' and 5 'low'. The majority of the proglacial lakes in the watershed have significantly enlarged due to the faster melting and calving processes as a result of accelerating increasing long-term average annual trend of temperature (+0.283 degrees Ca-1; 95% confidence level) and homogeneous or slightly declining precipitation.

TI  - Management of cutaneous melanoma: radiologists challenging and risk assessment
T2  - RADIOLOGIA MEDICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Melanoma patient remains a challenging for the radiologist, due to the difficulty related to the management of a patient more often in an advanced stage of the disease. It is necessary to determine a stratification of risk, optimizing the means, with diagnostic tools that should be optimized in relation to the type of patient, and improving knowledge. Staging and risk assessment procedures are determined by disease presentation at diagnosis. Melanoma staging is a critical tool to assist clinical decision-making and prognostic assessment. It is used for clinical trial design, eligibility, stratification, and analysis. The current standard for regional lymph nodes staging is represented by the sentinel lymph node excision biopsy procedure. For staging of distant metastases, PET-CT has the highest sensitivity and diagnostic odds ratio. Similar trend is observed during melanoma surveillance. The advent of immunotherapy, which has improved patient outcome, however, has determined new issues for radiologists, partly due to atypical response patterns, partly due to adverse reactions that must be identified as soon as possible for the correct management of the patient. The main objectives of the new ir-criteria are to standardize the assessment between different trials. However, these ir-criteria do not take into account all cases of atypical response patterns, as hyperprogression or dissociated responses. None of these criteria has actually been uniformly adopted in routine. The immune-related adverse events (irAEs) can involve various organs from head to toe. It is crucial for radiologists to know the imaging appearances of this condition, to exclude recurrent or progressive disease and for pneumonitis, since it could be potentially life-threatening toxicity, resulting in pneumonitis-related deaths in early phase trials, to allow a proper patient management.

TI  - A Remote-Sensing Ecological Index Approach for Restoration Assessment of Rare-Earth Elements Mining
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to meet the requirements for comprehensive and multidimensional generalization of ecological management effectiveness evaluation indexes in the context of ecological restoration advocating comprehensive management by multiple means, this paper explores the rationality of using RSEI as an ecological management effectiveness evaluation index to adapt to the systematic transformation of the management goal of abandoned mine restoration from ecological restoration to regional socioeconomic sustainable development. Based on Landsat-8 image data, the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) was used to evaluate the dynamic changes and spatial and temporal differences of the ecological environment in the study area under the long-term multimeans comprehensive management. The RSEI is suitable for evaluating the effectiveness of comprehensive ecological management in mining areas with a large amount of bare soil. The regional RSEI mean value increased by 0.029 in the early stage and 0.051 in the later stage by fragmentation management, indicating a better effect of multimeans comprehensive management. The remote sensing ecological index can objectively reflect the difference of spatial distribution characteristics of ecological environment in the four "Ecological+" governance regions. It can both objectively reflect the ecological status of the study area and reflect the differentiated spatial distribution characteristics of the ecological environment in different treatment areas, which is of long-term practical significance to the ecological construction of the study area. This study provides a theoretical reference for ecological assessment of complex situation under difficult site conditions.

TI  - Developing and Evaluating Simplified Tools for Image Processing in a Problem-Based Learning Environment for Earth Observation
T2  - PFG-JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY REMOTE SENSING AND GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth observation is an interdisciplinary field of application. This makes it ideal for supporting natural science education in schools. Understanding satellite data can enable students to see more than just "beautiful images". They can gain insights into an exciting field of application of many natural- and computer science fundamentals. In recent years, interactive lessons have been produced by our working group. They address the prospects and challenges connected with the teaching of earth observation topics in schools. The principles upon which the lessons are built promote a problem-based style of learning combined with a low impact in extraneous cognitive load for the students. Advances in web technology have made it necessary for interactive lessons to be redesigned and rethought. Contemporary web technologies have been selected and combined into an application framework to fulfill the requirements of our design principles and put a greater emphasis on usability during the content creation process. To allow offline usage of the learning modules it was tested whether this can be achieved using strictly client-side image processing. This article shows that, based on the technology stack used, lessons can be created that enable pupils to analyze remote sensing data in a much-simplified way. Using those simplified methods, a classification with an overall accuracy of 78.66% was achieved. The comparison of another simplified classification using just threshold values resulted in up to 89% probability to predict the outcome of a professionally produced dataset, making the simplified methods applicable in real-world examples presented in problem-based teaching scenarios.

TI  - Assessment of Spatiotemporal Migration of River Ganga from Buxar to Azamabad Using Remote Sensing and GIS Technique
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The dynamics associated with the morphological changes of the Ganga River being the largest river in India is yet to be understood. Population living near the floodplain gets crucially affected by migrating channels. Spatiotemporal relocation of Ganga River from Buxar to Azamabad over a period of 45 years (1975-2020) was measured using Landsat images. Study area was divided into 7 reaches (A, B, C, D, E, F and G) based on availability of field data. Temporal changes (at 5-year interval) of river centerline, bank line positions, area within banks, channel migration rates and sinuosity ratios have been computed and analyzed. Analysis suggests that river has experienced considerable course change and readjustment in configuration over the last 45 years with centerline and bank lines shifting of about 11.5 km during this period in leftward direction and about 8.6 km in rightward direction. With an average sinuosity ratio of about 1.32 in the study region, Ganga River can be classified as sinuous river except for Reach F in which the river is meandering. The channel's fluctuating lateral movement appears to be affected by strong fluvial hydraulics and the reactivation of cross-bar channels inside river valleys.

China has the largest NH3 emissions globally, mainly associated with agricultural sources including nitrogen fertilizer and livestock. However, there is still a limited number of ground monitoring sites in China, hindering our understanding of both surface NH3 concentrations and emissions. In this study, using the polar-orbiting satellite (Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer - IASI) and Fengyun-4A Geostationary Interferometric Infrared Sounder (GIIRS), we analyzed the changes in hourly NH3 concentrations and estimated surface NH3 concentrations and NH3 emissions in China. GIIRS-derived NH3 concentrations in the daytime were generally higher than those at night, with high values during 10:00-16:00 local time. Satellite-derived surface NH3 concentrations were generally consistent with the ground observations, with R-square at 0.72 and slope equal to 1.03. Satellite-based NH3 emissions ranged from 12.17 to 17.77 Tg N yr(-1) during 2008-2019. Spatially, high values of NH3 emissions mainly occurred in the North China Plain, Northeast China and the Sichuan Basin, while low values were mainly distributed in West China (Qinghai-Tibet Plateau). Our study shows a high predictive power of using satellite data to estimate surface NH3 concentrations and NH3 emissions over multiple temporal and spatial scales, which provides an important reference for understanding NH3 changes over China.

TI  - The Sentiworld project: global mapping of sentinel surveillance networks in general practice
T2  - BMC PRIMARY CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sentinel networks composed of general practitioners (GPs) represent a powerful tool for epidemiologic surveillance and ad-hoc studies. Globalization necesitates greater international cooperation among sentinel networks. The aim of this study was to inventory GP sentinel networks involved in epidemiological surveillance on a global scale. Methods GP sentinel surveillance networks were inventoried globally between July 2016 and December 2019. Each identified network was required to fill out an electronic descriptive survey for inclusion. Results A total of 148 networks were identified as potential surveillance networks in general practice and were contacted. Among them, 48 were included in the study. Geographically, 33 networks (68.8%) were located in Europe and 38 (79.2%) had national coverage. The number of GPs registered in these networks represented between 0.1 and 100% of the total number of GPs in the network's country or region, with a median of 2.5%. All networks were involved in continuous epidemiologic surveillance and 47 (97.9%) monitored influenza-like illness. Data collection methods were paper-based forms (n = 26, 55.3%), electronic forms on a dedicated website (n = 18, 38.3%), electronic forms on a dedicated software program (n = 14, 29.8%), and direct extraction from electronic medical records (n = 14, 29.8%). Along with this study, a website has been created to share all data collected. Conclusions This study represents the first global geographic mapping of GP sentinel surveillance networks. By sharing this information, collaboration between networks will be easier, which can strengthen the quality of international epidemiologic surveillance. In the face of crises like that of COVID-19, this is more imperative than ever before.

TI  - Wetland spectral unmixing using multispectral satellite images
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are of great importance to the diversity of biota and ecology, thereby to humans. Monitoring such valuable areas is essential for sustainable development. When the sizes, geographic distribution, and total coverage of wetlands across the earth are taken into account, remote sensing shines out as the most economically and technically feasible method to realise the monitoring task. Concerning the utilisation of medium resolution satellite images as the input, the pixel-level approach falls short of understanding the wetland dynamics since vast amounts of pixels in such areas have mixed content. This study proposes a framework for determining the extent of wetlands and extracting their ground characteristics at the sub-pixel level. In the extent determination part, Tasselled Cap Water Index (TCWI) values are calculated on time series, and their variations throughout the year are modelled by fitting a double-sided sigmoid function. This information is coupled with Digital Terrain Model (DTM) thresholding to extract the final extent. A sub-pixel analysis is proposed for the latter part, which includes adopting a systematic approach using a three-element (soil, vegetation, water) scheme for establishing wetland ontology and implementing supervised spectral unmixing enhanced by band weight optimisation. Balikdami, one of the most impressive wetlands of Turkey, is chosen as the test area. Open-access optical satellite data acquired by the Sentinel-2 constellation are utilised as the primary data input. Since the abundance values of land cover classes in each Sentinel-2 pixel are estimated, reference abundance data with a 10 m ground sampling distance (GSD) are generated using four-band aerial images having a 30 cm GSD for the verification stage. A new method entitled 'Abundance Confusion Matrix' is introduced for comparison and detailed assessment of fractional land cover. Experimental results demonstrate that the extent determination is addressed with a precision of 99.21% and a miss rate of 5.75%. In addition, the abundance values of land cover classes are identified with an overall accuracy of 66.17% after the optimisation step. The proposed method proves to be a valuable tool for the detailed monitoring of wetlands.

TI  - A 3D geological model of the horn of Africa: New insights for hydrogeological simulations of deep groundwater systems
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Study Region: The area of interest comprises 1.6 million km(2) of the Horn of Africa, extending 60 km offshore the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean, and delimited by the Tana River in Kenya and the Rift Valley in Ethiopia.Study Focus: Deep (> 400 m) groundwater resources are virtually unexplored in the Horn of Africa. One of the main challenges in this vast and sparsely documented area, is producing solid geological models. This paper presents a first-order assessment of the deep structure and water resources in the region, based on the integration of data from hydrogeological and Oil & Gas exploration. Public domain cross-sections, geological maps, and satellite data are reinterpreted, defining the extent of formations in the subsurface. The data integration benefits from using a multi-source modelling platform, subsurface mapping software from the Oil & Gas and hydrogeology sectors, and proprietary scripts.New Hydrological Insights: The present study reveals new evidence of the presence of deep aquifer systems in the Horn of Africa. The model outputs include the extent, predicted thickness, salinity, and petrophysical properties of the potential aquifers. The results of this first extensive 3D subsurface model for the region provide new hydrogeological insights into potential transboundary aquifers and can be used as a baseline for further investigations and, ultimately, for quantifying the total water resources in the region.

TI  - Investigation of land use changes in rural areas using MCDM and CA-Markov chain and their effects on water quality and soil fertility in south of Iran
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the study is to predict drought changes in Dariun, Fars Province, and their impact on water and soil quality. To prepare drought, water, and soil quality zoning maps, Landsat satellite images and the kriging method were used. The fuzzy maps and weights for each parameter were then determined using fuzzy and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) methods. Additionally, cellular automata (CA)-Markov chains were used in order to predict the impact of drought changes on water and soil quality. Using the fuzzy-AHP method, water quality and soil fertility in 2020 were lower compared to previous years, mainly because of land use changes that increased pollution. Based on results of the Markov and CA-Markov chains, approximately 31% of the region will have very poor levels of soil fertility and water quality in 2050. Further, based on remote sensing indicators, it is determined that about 25% of the region will be at high risk of drought in 2050. Thus, if adequate management of the region is not done, the possibility of living in these areas may diminish in the coming years due to drought and deteriorated water and soil quality.

TI  - A Synthetic Aperture Radar Based Method for Long Term Monitoring of Seasonal Snowmelt and Wintertime Rain-On-Snow Events in Svalbard
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover characteristics are highly sensitive to variations in temperature and precipitation. In Svalbard, these parameters are undergoing significant change in response to a rapidly warming climate and its associated positive feedback processes. The occurrence of wintertime rain-on-snow (ROS) events are expected to increase in frequency and intensity across the Arctic as a result of climate change. ROS events can dramatically alter snow cover characteristics, by saturating the snowpack and enhancing surface runoff as well as causing widespread formation of ground ice, which can negatively impact many ecosystems as well as infrastructure. Knowledge of the spatial and temporal variations in ROS occurrence across Svalbard, both past and present is needed to understand which areas are most vulnerable to ROS impacts and how this may change in the future. Until now comparatively few studies have exploited remote sensing methods to detect and monitor ROS occurrence and even these have been limited to relatively coarse spatial resolutions. This work has utilized C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) observations to produce a 17-year dataset (2004-2020) of wet snow cover observations for Svalbard, from which a method for detecting and mapping both spring melt onset and ROS frequency has been developed. The mean spatial variations in melt onset and ROS occurrence reflect the geographical gradients in temperature and precipitation across the archipelago and are largely in agreement with current knowledge. The timing of ROS onset as detected using the SAR observations coincide well with in-situ measurements of rainfall, however in some cases the duration of a ROS event cannot be reliably estimated using SAR observations of wet snow, in particular after phase transitions from rain to snow. Linear trends derived from the limited time series of observations suggests that ROS frequency is increasing over most of the archipelago, but significant and large increases are confined to the south and west coast of the archipelago. However, low elevation areas in the central parts of the archipelago also exhibit a significant and decreasing trend in ROS occurrence over the time period studied.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy for early oral cancer-accuracy and considerations in patient selection
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF ORAL & MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for staging oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients presenting with early (T1 and T2 N0) disease in preference to elective neck dissection (END) remains controversial worldwide. A retrospective analysis of 145 patients who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy for a previously untreated early oral cancer between 2010 and 2020 was performed. The primary outcome measures were predictors of occult metastases, accuracy of SLNB and disease specific plus overall survival. The negative predictive value, the false negative rate, and sensitivity for SLNB were 97%, 7.8%, and 92%, respectively. Depth of invasion (DOI) was a significant predictor of N status, overall survival, and disease specific survival. There was a significant difference in the incidence of the neck node metastasis in patients with DOI 5mm compared to those with DOI 5mm. For tumours >5mm there was a moderate to good correlation between radiological depth on contrast enhanced computed tomography (CECT) and histopathological DOI. Preoperative estimation of DOI may be a useful tool in the counselling of patients in the selection of either SLNB or END for N staging purposes in early OSCC. ?? 2022 The British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.

TI  - Predicting daily concentrations of nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter and ozone at fine spatial scale in Great Britain
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Short-term exposure studies have often relied on time-series of air pollution measurements from monitoring sites. However, this approach does not capture short-term changes in spatial contrasts in air pollution. To address this, models representing both the spatial and temporal variability in air pollution have emerged in recent years. Here, we modelled daily average concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) and ozone (O3) on a 25 m grid for Great Britain from 2011 to 2015 using a generalised additive mixed model, with penalised spline smooth functions for covariates. The models included local-scale predictors derived using a Geographic Information System (GIS), daily estimates from a chemical transport model, and daily meteorological characteristics. The models performed well in explaining the variability in daily averaged measured concentrations at 48-85 sites: 63% for NO2, 77% for PM2.5, 80% for PM10 and 85% for O3. Outputs of the study include daily air pollution maps that can be applied in epidemiological studies across Great Britain. Daily concentration values can also be predicted for specific locations, such as residential addresses or schools, and aggregated to other exposure time periods (including weeks, months, or pregnancy trimesters) to facilitate the needs of different health analyses.

TI  - CGAN Based Improved ASI Retrieval Algorithm for Antarctic Sea Ice Concentration
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea ice change is closely related to the change of global atmosphere and ocean circulation, which plays an important role in the study of global climate change. Sea ice concentration is one of the important parameters to study the temporal and spatial change of sea ice. Accurately retrieving sea ice concentration is the innovation of this paper. At present, the high-resolution microwave-detected sea ice concentration product was provided by the University of Bremen, which was derived by the Arctic Radiation and Turbulence Interaction Study (ARTSIST) Sea Ice (ASI) algorithm based on the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) 89-GHz brightness temperature data. The AMSR-E/AMSR-2 89-GHz brightness temperature data has higher spatial resolution, but it is often affected by cloud and water vapor, which affects the recognition and subsequent use of ground feature. Although the weather filters can remove some errors in the edge regions of the sea water and the sea ice, the errors of the sea ice concentration in other regions cannot be removed. The generative model of Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) increases the utilization of image feature information through skip connection, which improves the removal of the influence of cloud and water vapor. The discriminative model can retain the image feature information and realize the nonlinear mapping from the image to the image. The loss function can reduce the pixellevel loss, which can remove the influence of cloud and water vapor. Therefore, this paper proposed an improved ASI algorithm based on CGAN. Firstly, the relatively stable relationship between the 89-GHz brightness temperature data which is not disturbed or less affected by the external environment and the 36-GHz brightness temperature data was determined, and the 89-GHz brightness temperature data with large interference was screened. Secondly, based on the 36-GHz brightness temperature data with high reliability, the 89-GHz brightness temperature data with large interference was corrected through CGAN. Finally, the ASI algorithm was used to retrieve sea ice concentration. Compared with sea ice concentration retrieved by the ASI algorithm, the results showed that the improved ASI algorithm based on CGAN was feasible. Compared with sea ice distribution obtained from the Landsat 8 OLI-L1T data, the improved ASI algorithm based on CGAN significantly improves the inversion accuracy of sea ice concentration. The improved ASI algorithm based on CGAN makes use of the reliable 36-GHz brightness temperature data, which greatly reduces the error caused by cloud and water vapor, and the method effectively corrects sea ice concentration of the pixels affected by the external environment. Therefore, the improved ASI algorithm based on CGAN realizes high spatial resolution and significantly improves the inversion accuracy of sea ice concentration.

TI  - Applications of the Three-cornered Hat Method to the Error Variance Estimations of FY-4A Atmospheric Temperature Profiles
T2  - ATMOSPHERE-OCEAN
M3  - Article
AB  - This study applied the three-cornered hat method to the error variance estimations of temperature profiles retrieved from the Geosynchronous Interferometric Infrared Sounder (GIIRS), the first hyperspectral infrared sounder onboard Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) geostationary satellite. An accurate observational error is a crucial input parameter for FY-4A temperature profile assimilation. Using multiple data sets from 2020, this study examined the error variances of FY-4A temperature profiles in clear-sky and cloudy-sky respectively. Because of the effects of clouds on GIIRS, the error variances in cloudy-sky are much larger than in clear-sky. Provided that error variances less than 4K(2) are significant for data assimilation, the FY-4A temperature profiles in clear-sky from 900 to 150 hPa are meaningful to be assimilated. Results reveal that the latitudinal dependency of error variances is strong at 100 hPa. Encouraged by the vertical distributions of the temperature profile differences between FY-4A and other data sets, the error variance of total potential energy is also examined in this study. Although the detailed structures of temperature profiles are removed, the vertical integration obtains a more minor percentage error. Further studies on data assimilation are worth discussing if total potential energy is more meaningful than the FY-4A temperature profiles.

TI  - Recent Recovery of the World's Rarest Primate Is Not Directly Linked to Increasing Habitat Quality
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to habitat loss and hunting, the Hainan gibbon (Nomascus hainanus), the world's rarest primate, was reduced to only two social groups and seven known individuals in 1978. Following the establishment of Bawangling National Natural Reserve (BNNR), gibbon forest habitat increased within this landscape from 56 km(2) in 1980 to 300 km(2), and the species had increased to five groups and 35 individuals by 2021. It is important to assess whether the large increase in habitat area was responsible for gibbon population increase, or whether gibbon recovery was associated with other factors. Here we use a 21-year longitudinal dataset of Hainan gibbon population change and habitat change, combined with vegetation survey plot data for 2021, to establish an accurate distribution baseline for natural tropical broadleaf forest across the BNNR landscape from 400 to 1300 m (the elevational range of gibbons at BNNR) and within the home range for each of the five Hainan gibbon social groups. We then utilized Landsat time-series images and analysis to compute non-linear causal relationships between forest dynamics and gibbon population growth from 2000 to 2021, both across BNNR and within each gibbon group home range. Metrics of forest dynamics include change in total forest area and forest fragmentation, and metrics of gibbon population dynamics include variation in total number of individuals for the entire population and within each social group, and variation in total number of groups. Our results demonstrate that overall gibbon population growth shows a positive relationship with improved habitat quality, with a one-year time lag of population response. However, changes in numbers of individuals within social groups do not show a similar relationship with improving habitat quality, suggesting that increasing forest cover and connectivity within the BNNR landscape are not direct determinants of Hainan gibbon recovery and that other environmental and/or anthropogenic factors are likely to be involved.

T2  - JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Time series study about the changes in Fractional Vegetation Cover (FVC) with its drivers is studied. From 2003 to 2013, FVC was calculated using remotely sensed data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (MODIS-NDVI), Landsat-7, Defense Meteorological Satellite Program/Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS), and Compound Night Light Index (CNLI). The mean value of FVC is 0.34 (34 %). The findings indicate that the highest annual mean values are between 34% and 37%, and 31% and 33%, that correspond to level of 70% and 40%, respectively. The trend analysis by MODIS and Landsat-7 has the low (10%) FVC in the northern parts due to increase in industrial development, urbanization, changes in landuse, landcover and other linked environmental fac-tors. The southwestern-southeastern and eastern areas showed medium (40 %) and high (70 %) FVC respectively. This is because of water availability and less human disturbance. (c) 2022 The Author(s).

TI  - Analyzing urbanization induced groundwater stress and land deformation using time-series Sentinel-1 datasets applying PSInSAR approach
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban intensification has taken a serious toll on the groundwater reserves which is one of the primary sources of fresh water on earth. Exploitation of groundwater has exponentially increased over time, especially in urban landscapes, with ever increasing demands to cater the growing population and development processes. This emphasizes on the importance of proper monitoring of the groundwater variations, which is a difficult process for not being directly accessible for physical measurements. Therefore, it is essential to develop advanced innovative indirect methods to help long-term monitoring of groundwater reserves at a relatively higher resolution, so that local level variations and their impact could be studied in case of excessively exploited zones, like cities. Recent studies have linked landsubsidence to over-exploitation of groundwater, which can be critical for urban scenario, which requires longer duration for replenishment. Thus, this study focuses on monitoring of the groundwater variations using time-series Sentinel-1 Interferometric SAR (InSAR) datasets by retrieving land deformation by PsInSAR (Persistent Scatterer Interferometric SAR) technique; applying phase information of permanent scattering candidates. 58 and 60 images were acquired during ascending and descending passes respectively between 9/10/2014 to 2/7/2020 for the study area i.e., Lucknow city (India) and its surroundings.

TI  - Building a small fire database for Sub-Saharan Africa from Sentinel-2 high-resolution images
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Coarse resolution sensors are not very sensitive at detecting small fire patches, making current estimations of global burned areas (BA) very conservative. Using medium or high-resolution sensors to generate BA products becomes then a priority, particularly in areas where fires tend to be small and frequent. Building on previous work that developed a small fire dataset (SFD) for Sub-Saharan Africa for 2016, this paper presents a new version of the dataset for 2019 using the two Sentinel-2 satellites (A and B) and VIIRS active fires. Total estimated BA was 4.8 Mkm(2). This value was much higher than estimations from two global, coarser-spatial resolution BA products based on MODIS data for the same area and period: 80 % greater than estimates from FireCCI51 (based on MODIS 250 m bands) and 120 % larger than MCD64A1 (based on MODIS 500 m bands). The main differences were observed in those months with higher fire occurrence (November to January for the Northern Hemisphere regions and June to September for the Southern Hemisphere ones). Accuracy assessment of the SFD product was based on a novel sampling strategy designed to obtain independent fire reference perimeters. Validation results showed remarkable high accuracy values comparing to existing global BA products. Overall omission errors (OE) were estimated as 8.5 %, commission errors (CE) as 15.0 %, with a Dice Coefficient of 87.7%. All of these estimations implied significant improvements over the global, coarser spatial resolution BA products (OE > 50 % and CE > 20 % for the same area and period), as well as over the previous SFD product for 2016 of the same area, generated from a single Sentinel-2 satellite and MODIS active fires (OE = 26.5 % and CE = 19.3 %). Temporal accuracies greatly increased as well with the new product, with 92.5 % of fires detected within the first 10 days of occurrence.

TI  - High-resolution offshore wind resource assessment at turbine hub height with Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data and machine learning
T2  - WIND ENERGY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a method for estimating offshore extractable wind power at hub height using Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data and machine learning. The method was tested in two areas off the Dutch coast, where measurements from Doppler wind lidars installed at the sea surface were available and could be used as a reference. A first machine learning algorithm improved the accuracy of SAR sea surface wind speeds by using geometrical characteristics of the sensor and metadata. This algorithm was trained with wind data measured by a large network of weather buoys at 4m above sea level. After correction, the bias in SAR wind speed at 4 m versus buoys was 0.02ms(-1), with a standard deviation of error of 0.74ms(-1). Corrected surface wind speeds were then extrapolated to hub height with a second machine learning algorithm, which used meteorological parameters extracted from a high-resolution numerical model. This algorithm was trained with lidar vertical wind profiles and was able to extrapolate sea surface wind speeds at various altitudes up to 200 m. Once wind speeds at hub height were obtained, the Weibull parameters of their distribution were estimated, taking into account the satellites' irregular temporal sampling. Finally, we assumed the presence of a 10MW turbine and obtained extractable wind power with a 1 km spatial resolution by multiplying the Weibull distribution point by point by its power curve. Accuracy for extractable wind power versus lidars was +/- 3 %. Wind power maps at hub height were presented and compared with the outputs of the numerical model. The maps based on SAR data had a much higher level of detail, especially regarding coastal wind gradient. We concluded that SAR data combined with machine learning can improve the estimation of extractable wind power at hub height and provide useful insights to optimize siting and risk management. The algorithms presented in this study are independent and can also be used in a more general context to correct SAR surface winds, extrapolate surface winds to higher altitudes, and produce instantaneous SAR wind fields at hub height.

TI  - Land use and land cover changes resulting from the urban El Molinito reservoir in the drying Sonoran River Basin
T2  - URBAN WATER JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Although the impacts of dams on the environment and human populations have been widely documented, many developing countries continue constructing large dams. In Mexico, impact studies have neglected to analyze downstream effects of dams. Thus, we analyzed land use and land cover (LULC) changes downstream of El Molinito dam, constructed on the Sonora River in northwest Mexico. We used Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) to generate classifications (for 1993, 2002 and 2011), from which an assessment is performed to identify the principal changes. In addition, we analyzed changes in photosynthetic activity using the simple but informative Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). We found a drastic decline between 1993 and 2011 in agricultural LULC because of water diversions from El Molinito. This study demonstrates the need for agencies responsible for water management to better assess the negative effects of dam construction and operation, especially on the livelihoods of downstream rural communities.

TI  - Mud volcano as a feature of emergence in Caspian Sea
T2  - OCEANOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - An eruption occurred on Dashli Island, 75 km from Baku, on 4th of July 2021, at 21:51 local time. The island is known as the mud volcano and has a history of eruption. We suspected that mud volcano eruption causes emergence on this island. Thus, the effect of this 2021 eruption is investigated using a remote sensing technique. Processed Sentinel-1 and 2 images are employed for this aim. We considered pre- and post-eruption scenarios to evaluate the effect of this eruption on the island. Satellite image classification is used to calculate shoreline changes. Results show that Dashli Island with an area of about 8.55 ha before eruption is now expanded to about 21.8 ha (about 155% increase). The DInSAR method is used to estimate the ground displacement of the island. According to the results, a two-year-displacement before the eruption was between 0.18 and 0.2 m, while a five-month-displacement after the eruption is estimated to be between 0.32 and 0.4 m. Considering ground displacement pre- and post-eruption we estimated 62000 m(3) land gaining, due to emergence. We concluded that mud volcano can be counted as a feature of emergence in Dashli Island.

TI  - Generation of the Forest Cover Map of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau Based on the Multisource Dataset and Random Forest
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) plays a significant role in global climate change and biodiversity conservation. As the third pole of the Earth, it has a wide range and complex terrain. QTP has a vertical distribution of vegetation, and its forest ecosystems play a key role in the region. Forest extraction in this region is still a comprehensive problem because of the phenological periods of different forest types in distinct regions of the QTP and the characteristics of frequent rain and cloudy weather in the south. Taking these factors into consideration, multiple features, including reflectance, spectral indices, statistical backscattering coefficients, topographic slope, and aspect, derived from a multisource dataset incorporating optical remote sensing data, synthetic radar, and digital elevation models, were applied to extract forest in the QTP based on the random forest (RF) classification method. As more than 30 features were involved, the 5-folded cross-validation method was used to determine the optimal parameters and features for the RF model. Using 14,919 forest samples and a multifeature optimized RF classification model, a 10-m resolution forest cover map of QTP in 2021 was generated based on the Sentinel series of satellite datasets and digital elevation model datasets on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. After verification, the overall accuracy of the forest cover map generated in this article is 98.3%, and the Kappa coefficient is 0.95, which is better than the European Space Agency (ESA) WorldCover forest layer.

TI  - Three Mitochondrial Markers Reveal Genetic Diversity and Structure of Rock Carp (<i>Procypris rabaudi</i>) Endemic to the Upper Yangtze: Implications for Pre-release Genetic Assessment
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rock carp, Procypris rabaudi, is a vulnerable carp endemic to the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and included in the National Key Protected Wildlife in 2021 as a second-class aquatic animal. Evaluating the genetic makeup of released individuals before a restocking activity is carried out is essential, and a molecular marker with simple, rapid, and universal characteristics will be helpful to the evaluation. In this study, the genetic diversity and structure of rock carp from two representative hatcheries [Yibin (YB) and Wanzhou (WZ)] and a section of the upper Yangtze [Zhuyang (ZY)] were investigated using three mtDNA markers to select one marker instead of genetic evaluation of release. The results of three mtDNA markers revealed basically the same, indicating that the level of genetic diversity in rock carp was low, and there was significant genetic differentiation between the ZY and YB. Except for Cyt b-labeled YZ (0.81) and D-loop-labeled WZ (0.59), most of the haplotypic diversity values (h) were below 0.5, the nucleotide diversity values (pi) of each group were lower than 0.5 x 10-2, and the haplotype number of rock carp is 1 to 4. Among the three mtDNA markers selected, D-loop marker detected higher diversity, more haplotypes, and private haplotypes, and significant differences between the YB and WZ. The results in this study pointed out the importance of pre-release genetic evaluation and the urgency of protecting the genetic diversity of rock carp, and the D-loop marker was preferentially selected in the pre-release genetic evaluation of fish. Hatchery release is the main strategy for the recovery of rock carp populations, similar to more than 20 endemic fish species in the upper Yangtze River. This study has guiding significance for the protection and restoration of other endemic fishes in the Yangtze River by hatchery release.

TI  - Tracing out the effect of transportation infrastructure on NO<sub>2</sub> concentration levels with Kernel Density Estimation by investigating successive COVID-19-induced lockdowns
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to investigate the effect of transportation infrastructure on the decrease of NO2 air pollution during three COVID-19-induced lockdowns in a vast region of France. For this purpose, using Sentinel-5P satellite data, the relative change in tropospheric NO2 air pollution during the three lockdowns was calculated. The estimation of regional infrastructure intensity was performed using Kernel Density Estimation, being the predictor variable. By performing hotspot-coldspot analysis on the relative change in NO2 air pollution, significant spatial clusters of decreased air pollution during the three lockdowns were identified. Based on the clusters, a novel spatial index, the Clustering Index (CI) was developed using its Coldspot Clustering Index (CCI) variant as a predicted variable in the regression model between infrastructure intensity and NO2 air pollution decline. The analysis revealed that during the three lockdowns there was a strong and statistically significant relationship between the transportation infrastructure and the decline index, CCI (r = 0.899, R-2 = 0.808). The results showed that the largest decrease in NO2 air pollution was recorded during the first lockdown, and in this case, there was the strongest inverse correlation with transportation infrastructure (r = -0.904, R-2 = 0.818). Economic and population predictors also explained with good fit the decrease in NO2 air pollution during the first lockdown: GDP (R-2 = 0.511), employees (R-2 = 0.513), population density (R-2 = 0.837). It is concluded that not only economic-population variables determined the reduction of near-surface air pollution but also the transportation infrastructure. Further studies are recommended to investigate other pollutant gases as predicted variables.

AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data handling, processing, and interpretation are barriers preventing a rapid uptake of SAR data by application specialists and non-expert domain users in the field of agricultural monitoring. To improve the accessibility of Sentinel-1 data, we have generated a reduced-volume, multi-year Sentinel-1 SAR database. It includes mean and standard deviation of VV, VH and VH/VV backscatter, pixel counts, geometry, crop type, local incidence angle and azimuth angle at parcel-level. The database uses around 3100 Sentinel-1 images (5 TB) to produce a 12 GB time series database for approximately 770,000 crop parcels over the Netherlands for a period of three years. The database can be queried by Sentinel-1 system parameters (e.g. relative orbit) or user application-specific parameters (e.g. crop type, spatial extent, time period) for parcel level assessment. The database can be used to accelerate the development of new tools, applications and methodologies for agricultural and water related applications, such as parcel-level crop bio-geophysical parameter estimation, inter-annual variability analysis, drought monitoring, grassland monitoring and agricultural management decision-support.

AB  - Background To prove feasibility of multimodal and temporal fusion of laparoscopic images with preoperative computed tomography scans for a real-time in vivo-targeted lymph node (TLN) detection during minimally invasive pelvic lymphadenectomy and to validate and enable such guidance for safe and accurate sentinel lymph node dissection, including anatomical landmarks in an experimental model.Methods A measurement campaign determined the most accurate tracking system (UR5-Cobot versus NDI Polaris). The subsequent interventions on two pigs consisted of an identification of artificial TLN and anatomical landmarks without and with augmented reality (AR) assistance. The AR overlay on target structures was quantitatively evaluated. The clinical relevance of our system was assessed via a questionnaire completed by experienced and trainee surgeons.Results An AR-based robotic assistance system that performed real-time multimodal and temporal fusion of laparoscopic images with preoperative medical images was developed and tested. It enabled the detection of TLN and their surrounding anatomical structures during pelvic lymphadenectomy. Accuracy of the CT overlay was > 90%, with overflow rates < 6%. When comparing AR to direct vision, we found that scores were significatively higher in AR for all target structures. AR aided both experienced surgeons and trainees, whether it was for TLN, ureter, or vessel identification.Conclusion This computer-assisted system was reliable, safe, and accurate, and the present achievements represent a first step toward a clinical study.[GRAPHICS].

TI  - Improvement of the feature tracking and patter matching algorithm for sea ice motion retrieval from SAR and optical imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents an improved, versatile, and efficient algorithm based on the Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) combined with the maximum cross-correlation (MCC) (ORB-MCC) for extracting sea ice motion (SIM) vectors. Quadtree ORB (Q-ORB) extracts more uniform feature points than ORB (uniformity is 3 times higher) and eliminates the concentration of ORB-extracted feature points on ice ridges, leads and coastlines, thereby providing excellent initial conditions for MCC calculations. In addition, a geographic grid-based matching (GGM) algorithm is developed to replace the brute-force matching algorithm (BFM). GGM is 8-10 times more efficient for matching feature points than BFM, thereby increasing the computational efficiency of extracting SIM vectors. Moreover, a locally consistent (LC) flow field filtering process is incorporated to facilitate the filtering of the SIM field. Combining cross-correlation-coefficient-threshold (CCCT)-based and LC filtering processes eliminates erroneous vectors more efficiently than using a CCCT-based filtering process alone. The improved algorithm, named Q-ORB-MCC, is used to extract SIM vectors from imagery acquired by the Sentinel-1 Synthetic-Aperture Radar (SAR), Envisat Advanced SAR (ASAR), Phased Array type L-band SAR-2 (PALSAR-2) onboard the Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2), and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). An analysis of the accuracy and effectiveness of the extracted SIM vectors shows that Q-ORB-MCC extracted SIM vectors from Sentinel-1, ASAR, and MODIS images with 4%, 253%, and 62% higher accuracy than ORB-MCC, respectively. Meanwhile Q-ORB-MCC could obtain more SIM vectors from Sentinel-1 and ASAR images.

TI  - Investigation of block shear strength of high strength steel bolted connections
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTIONAL STEEL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents an experimental and numerical investigation of block shear strength of high strength steel (HSS) bolted connections under double shear. A total of 16 HSS (grades Q690 and Q960) and eight mild steel (MS) (grade Q345) bolted connection specimens with various geometric configurations were tested and failed in block shear failure mode. The test and finite element (FE) analysis results confirmed that the block shear failure is a combination of fracture of the net tension plane and yielding of the effective shear plane, which is located between the net and gross shear planes. The effects of material properties (such as ductility and tensile-to-yield strengths ratio (f(u)/f(y))) of steel materials on the block shear strength were comprehensively investigated based on the validated FE models. It was found that the tensile stress across the net tension plane could be fully developed irrespective of the steel grade due to effective stress redistribution along the net tension plane and the beneficial effect of the biaxial tensile stress state. However, the shear stress magnitude along the shear plane is influenced by the ductility and f(u)/f(y) ratio of steel materials and the length of the shear plane. The low ductility and f(u)/f(y) ratio of HSS materials did not allow for effective stress redistribution along the long shear plane and the shear yielding could only partially develop along the shear plane at the ultimate state. For the HSS specimens with short shear planes, the shear stress could develop up to the shear yield strength in general. Finally, the accuracy of the existing design equations in various design codes (i.e., prEN 1993-1-8: 2021, ANSI/AISC 360-16, and CSA S16-19) and relevant literature for predicting the block shear strength of bolted connections was evaluated and design recommendations were provided.

TI  - A Low-Cost Approach for Lake Volume Estimation on the Tibetan Plateau: Coupling the Lake Hypsometric Curve and Bottom Elevation
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The widespread lakes on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) are key components of the water cycle, thus the knowledge of their spatial distribution and volume is crucial for understanding the hydrological processes under ongoing climate change. Many previous studies focus on investigating surface elevation, inundation area variations and water volume changes for these lakes. However, how much water is stored in lakes across the TP remains relatively unexplored. It is because of the incapacity of satellite remote sensing methods in lake depth measurements and the high cost of field bathymetric measurement. This study developed a low-cost approach by integrating remote sensing data and limited underwater surveys. The observed lake areas and surface elevations generated the elevation-area relationship. Underwater surveys were conducted to detect the potentially "maximum" lake depths using three optimized survey routes. With the constraint of lake-bottom elevation, the lake-bottom zone area could be estimated for calculating the lake volume. Experiments on nine TP lakes with different size and geometric characteristics demonstrate that the optimized survey line along the lake short axis is well balanced in efficiency and accuracy, with an overall volume bias of 15% approximately. The proposed hypsometric curve method coupled with the bottom elevation measurement is expected to provide a simplified but efficient solution for estimating the lake water volume on the TP, which could be applicable to ungauged lakes in other harsh environments.

TI  - Monitoring the impact of introduced emerald ash borer parasitoids: factors affecting <i>Oobius agrili</i> dispersal and parasitization of sentinel host eggs
T2  - BIOCONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - Emerald ash borer (EAB) Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) is an invasive, wood-boring pest of North American ash trees (Fraxinus spp.). Oobius agrili Zhang and Huang (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae), a solitary egg parasitoid, was one of the several parasitoids introduced from the pest's native Northeast Asian range to the USA for EAB classical biocontrol. Since its introduction, this agent has been released over 31 states against EAB, yet determination of the spread and impact of this parasitoid has proved difficult partly because of its small size and cryptic host eggs. The present study examines the dispersal distance and parasitism of O. agrili shortly after release, as well as the impact of host's food plants (trees), where the host eggs were deployed. Sentinel EAB eggs were deployed on pairs of green ash (Fraxinus pensylvanica) and white fringe (Chionanthus virginicus) trees in circles around the release point up to 45 m away. After 48 or 120 h, the eggs were retrieved and examined for parasitism. There was no significant difference in observed parasitism by distance or tree species. However, significantly more EAB eggs were parasitized in the longer deployment compared to the shorter deployment. These findings suggest that sentinel EAB eggs may be deployed on ash or white fringe trees to effectively monitor the establishment and spread of O. agrili. Future studies using sentinel host eggs in natural ash stands may yield further insights into the spread rate of O. agrili post-release and its effectiveness in suppressing the targeted pest populations over time.

TI  - Factors Influencing Non-sentinel Lymph Node Involvement in Patients with Positive Sentinel Lymph Node(s) After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy for Breast Cancer
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background When a positive sentinel lymph node (SLN) is identified after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), completion axillary lymph node dissection (cALND) is generally recommended. We sought to evaluate the rate of non-SLN positivity and factors influencing this in patients with a positive SLN following NAC. Methods We identified all patients at our hospital between 2006 and 2021 with a positive SLN (> 0.2 mm) following NAC who underwent cALND. Rates of positive non-SLN (NSLN) on cALND were compared by nodal status. Chi-square tests and multivariable logistic regression were used to assess factors predictive of positive NSLN and overall nodal burden. Results Overall, 229 cases (177 cN+, 52 cN0 prior to NAC) with positive SLN(s) after NAC underwent cALND. Additional NSLN involvement was found in 129/229 (56.3%) patients, including 24/52 (46.2%) cN0 and 105/177 (59.3%) cN+ patients (p = 0.09). There was a trend for patients with SLN micrometastases to be less likely to have positive NSLN(s) than those with SLN macrometastases (38.5% vs. 58.6%; p = 0.05). Subgroup analyses showed no clinicopathologic factors significantly associated with additional axillary involvement for initially cN0 patients. Factors found to significantly influence NSLN positivity in the initially cN+ subgroup were HER2 status, multicentricity/multifocality, number of positive SLNs, and size of SLN metastasis. SLN metastasis size > 5 mm and three or more positive SLNs exerted the greatest influence on NSLN positivity. Conclusion Rates of nodal positivity on cALND in the setting of positive SLN after NAC are high, supporting the current standard of routine cALND. In cN+ disease, NSLN positivity varies by tumor biology, multicentricity/multifocality, number of positive SLNs, and SLN metastasis size.

TI  - Flood vulnerability mapping and prediction for early warning in Jigawa State, Northern Nigeria, using geospatial techniques
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Flooding is the major environmental disaster in Jigawa State. It occurs annually, causing serious damages to lives and properties. This research identified areas vulnerable to flood using Geospatial techniques, especially, AHP model of MCE and suggests how to minimize its impacts. Questionnaires were administered to six experts from Hadejia Jama' are River Basin Development Authority on flood causative factors. The AHP model revealed that rainfall (22.49%) was the highest contributor to flood, followed by slope (22.22%), drainage density (21.894%), land use/ land cover (12.51%), distance from river (11.21%), and soil type (9.67%). Based on the flood frequency analysis using Gumbel distribution for return periods of 5yrs, 10yrs, 25yrs, 50yrs and 100yrs; the expected discharges obtained were: 523.5 m(3)/s, 523.8 m(3)/s, 524.0 m(3)/s, 524.1 m(3)/s, 524.2 1 m(3)/s, 524.3 m(3)/s and 524.7 m(3)/s respectively. There were no significant changes in the computation of the discharge at Challawa Dam for return period of 5-30 years, but there is a significant change from 50 to 100 years return period. Flood vulnerability map was generated based on flood causative factors. Parts of Ringim, Jahun, Taura, Miga, Auyo, Kiri-Kasamma, Hadejia, Kafin-Hausa and Kiyawa were highly vulnerable to floods, while Birniwa, MalamMadori, Maigatari Gumel, Kaugama, Gagarawa and Guri have very low vulnerability. The flood vulnerability map will help the state to understand the factors causing floods. It can also assist decision makers for flood assessments, prediction, adaptation and mitigation. The research recommends adequate flood control mechanisms; building temporary water ponds along the Hadejia Jama' are River to redirect excess water to the ponds; proper enlightenment campaigns in vulnerable areas; preventive and mitigation action in Ringim, Jahun, Taura, Miga, Auyo, Kiri Kasamma, Hadejia, Kafin Hausa and Kiyawa and establish Flood Early Warning System for the state.

TI  - Characterizing natural variability in complex hydrological systems using passive microwave-based climate data records: a case study for the Okavango Delta
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Okavango River system in southern Africa is known for its strong interannual variability of hydrological conditions. Here, we present how this is exposed in surface soil moisture, land surface temperature, and vegetation optical depth as derived from the Land Parameter Retrieval Model, using an inter-calibrated, long-term, multi-sensor passive microwave satellite data record (1998-2020). We also investigate how these interannual variations relate to state-of-the-art climate reanalysis data from ERA5-Land. We analysed both the upstream river catchment and the Okavango delta, supported by independent data records of discharge measurements, precipitation, and vegetation dynamics observed by optical satellites. The seasonal vegetation optical depth anomalies have a strong correspondence with the MODIS leaf area index (correlation catchment: 0.74, delta: 0.88). Land surface temperature anomalies derived from passive microwave observations match best with those of ERA5-Land (catchment: 0.88, delta: 0.81) as compared to MODIS nighttime land surface temperature (LST) (catchment: 0.70, delta: 0.65). Although surface soil moisture anomalies from passive microwave observations and ERA5-Land correlate reasonably well (catchment: 0.72, delta: 0.69), an in-depth evaluation over the delta uncovered situations where passive microwave satellites record strong fluctuations, while ERA5-Land does not. This is further analysed using information on inundated area, river discharge, and precipitation. The passive microwave soil moisture signal demonstrates a response to both the inundated area and precipitation. ERA5-Land however, which, by default, does not account for any lateral influx from rivers, only shows a response to the precipitation information that is used as forcing. This also causes the reanalysis model to miss record low land surface temperature values as it underestimates the latent heat flux in certain years. These findings demonstrate the complexity of this hydrological system and suggest that future land surface model generations should also include lateral land surface exchange. Also, our study highlights the importance of maintaining and improving climate data records of soil moisture, vegetation, and land surface temperature from passive microwave observations and other observation systems.

TI  - Ground-based measurements of atmospheric NH3 by Fourier transform infrared spectrometry at Hefei and comparisons with IASI data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric ammonia (NH3) plays an important role in the formation of fine particulate matter, leading to<br />severe environmental degradation and human health issues. In this work, ground-based Fourier transform<br />infrared spectrometry (FTIR) observations are used to obtain the total columns of atmospheric NH3 at Hefei,<br />China, from December 2016 to December 2020. After the presentation of the retrieval algorithm and uncertainty<br />budget, we perform a spatio-temporal analysis of the dataset. Over the four years, NH3 columns have been<br />increasing by 15.82% (2017-2018), 3.83% (2018-2019) and 3.68% (2019-2020). A clear seasonal cycle is<br />observed, with the largest surface concentrations (12.93 & PLUSMN; 6.40 ppb) observed in June to August, and the lowest<br />(4.08 & PLUSMN; 2.66 ppb) in November to January. The diurnal cycles of NH3 exhibit increased morning and afternoon<br />concentrations. Interpretation of the diurnal cycles is difficult, however, the absence of a peak during rush hours,<br />and the absence of correlation with CO and NO2 suggest that agriculture and not traffic is the main source of NH3<br />at Hefei. The polar plots of NH3 columns with wind and back trajectories of air masses calculated by the HYSPLIT model confirmed that agriculture was the dominant source of ammonia in four seasons, while urban anthro-pogenic emissions contributed to the high level of NH3 in summer over the Hefei site. We end this paper with a short validation exercise of NH3 columns retrieved from measurements of the IASI satellite data with the FTIR measurements over Hefei. Correlation coefficients (R) between the two datasets are 0.79 and 0.75 for IASI-A and IASI-B, with the slope of 0.96 and 1.10, respectively. The mean difference is-3.44 x 1015 and-3.96 x 1015 molec cm-2, with standard deviation of 7.16 x 1015 and 8.10 x 1015 molec cm-2, respectively. These results demonstrate the IASI and FTIR data, over Hefei, are in broad agreement.

TI  - Quantifying the impact of terrain-wind-governed close-effect on atmospheric polluted concentrations
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid global urbanization and industrial expansion have resulted in severe atmospheric pollution sceneries in the past decades. Apart from the direct influence of anthropogenic emissions, the coupling of terrain and meteorological parameters may be another critical natural factor that indirectly impacts the dynamic polluted levels by means of terrain, wind, and planetary boundary layer governed accumulation and dilution in the horizontal and vertical dimensions. The nature-governed influence from the coupling of terrain and wind on air polluted levels can be called Terrain-Wind Close Effect (TWCE). As a value to represent the height of a geographic location above or below a fixed reference point, elevation cannot directly reflect the influence of terrain closed effect on air pollution levels at the regional/national scale. Therefore, this study aims to propose a Terrain-Wind Close Index (TWCI), which is a quantified comprehensive parameter of Earth terrain and atmospheric conditions controlling synergistically the localized or inhomogeneous concentration of fine particulate matters, to represent the nature-governed ability of terrain coupled with wind and boundary layer to block the dilution of contaminants. Results show a positive correlation (about 0.65) between TWCI and air polluted levels monitored by ground sites from January 1 to December 31, 2020 in China, which quantitatively exhibits that most of the high polluted levels existed in high-TWCI regions. The performance of the comprehensive TWCI in terms of its descriptive power on spatial pattern of surface polluted levels is superior to the single elevation (about 0.30) that widely used in previous studies. Moreover, the TWCI makes the static terrain dynamical by considering the synergistic effects of terrain and variational meteorological parameters on surface polluted levels. The newly proposed TWCI model has a potential to be applied to the research involve regional pollution estimation, environmental capacity assessment, urban planning and development, and so on.

TI  - Time Series Multi-Sensors of Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar for Monitoring Ground Deformation
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - A stack of images is a prerequisite for the multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (MT-InSAR) due to the wrapped nature of the interferometric phase. Although the SBAS technique can relieve the requirement of the amount of SAR data, dozens of SAR acquisitions could be regarded as the minimum requirement. However, due to the limitation of the imaging capability of the spaceborne SAR system, the amount of available SAR data acquired from only one SAR sensor is often not enough to satisfy the requirement for phase unwrapping based on the Nyquist sampling assumption. Fortunately, there sometimes may be more than one SAR stack, that is, stacks of SAR data acquired from different SAR systems. In this study, we propose a methodology to detect ground deformation by combining multiple SAR images acquired from different satellite systems for MT-InSAR analysis. First, the low-pass deformation is estimated based on time series SAR acquisitions with low spatial resolution and long wavelengths such as ENVISAT ASAR (ASAR). This information is then incorporated into the processing of time series of SAR acquisitions with high spatial resolution and short wavelength, such as TerraSAR-X (TSX). Specifically, the low-pass deformation will be subtracted from each differential interferogram generated from short-wavelength SAR images, and the rest of the MT-InSAR analysis will be based on the double-differentiation interferograms. Then, the residual deformation will be calculated from these double-differentiation interferograms and together with the low-pass deformation forms the full deformation. As the principal component of deformation has already been subtracted, the phase gradient of those double-differentiated interferograms will be smooth enough to facilitate the phase unwrapping. Between January 2009 and September 2010, 14 ASAR images and 11 TSX images acquired from Tianjin, China are selected as the test data. A root means square error (RMSE) of 9.1 mm/year is achieved from 11 TSX images, while a root means square error of 3.7 mm/year is achieved from 14 ASAR images. However, an RMSE of 1.6 mm/year is achieved when integrating 11 TSX images and 14 ASAR images for MT-InSAR analysis. The experiments show that the proposed method can effectively detect ground deformation.

TI  - Land cover change across 45 years in the world's largest mangrove forest (Sundarbans): the contribution of remote sensing in forest monitoring
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This study explored the land use land cover (LULC) change over 45 years (1975 -2020) in the world's largest mangrove forest, Sundarbansusing Landsat imagery. LULC maps were created with same-season imagery with the lowest cloud cover at four intervals: 1975, 1990, 2005, and 2020. Maximum likelihood classification (MLC) was applied to assign five classes: dense forest, moderate forest, sparse forest, barren land, and water body. Accuracy assessment was carried out with 250 control points for each year resulting in overall accuracy and kappa coefficient ranging from 84.8% to 90.0% and 0.81 to 0.87, respectively. Results show dense forest at its highest cover in 1975 and then decreasing by an estimated annual rate of 1.3% from 1975 to 2020, but not consistently. Dense forest class mostly turned moderate and sparse; most of the sparse forest class turned to barren land. Most of the barren lands were located near the boundary between forest and human settlement, and these two classes were more frequent in the Indian part of Sundarbans than in the Bangladesh part. The conclusion is that the time-series of remote sensing data can validly support effective forest management by identifying space and time changes in the biodiversity of Sundarbans.

TI  - Reconciling regional water diversion and urban growth policies to protect groundwater across a large urban region in China
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The overexploitation of groundwater (GW) and the associated environmental consequences are a cause for concern worldwide. Despite widespread unease about replenishing GW through, for example, water diversion schemes, there have been few comprehensive impact assessments, particularly for large urban areas that are undergoing rapid development to achieve regional goals. Using gravity recovery and climate experiment (GRACE) satellite data, we quantified the changes in GW storage from 2002 to 2017 and the reasons for the changes across a large-scale urban agglomeration in China (Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, BTH) with a serious GW deficit. We found that, at the aggregate scale, from 2002 to 2017, the GW storage over the entire BTH declined at an average annual rate of 1.20 cm, but the rate of decline decreased markedly after 2010. At the city scale, the rates of decline in the GW storage between different cities varied but were strongly spatially correlated. The spatial correlation pattern was inverted from north to south and corresponded with the unbalanced diversion of water between cities from the South-to-North Water Transfer Project and was also affected by the policy of transferring industrial water from Beijing to the central and southern plains of BTH. Human-related factors were the most significant drivers of the changes in GW storage and, of these, agricultural water consumption had the most effect on the changes in GW storage. To protect GW supplies in large-scale urban agglomerations, regionally diverted water allocations should be coordinated with other development strategies, such as the regional in-dustry distribution and transfer policy and agricultural water use management.

TI  - Stigma and Relationship Quality: The Relevance of Racial-Ethnic Worldview in Interracial Relationships in the United States
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The current study explored the associations between relationship stigma, Racial-ethnic Worldview (REW; a construct developed as a comprehensive assessment of individual's perceptions of race and ethnicity), and relationship quality among those in interracial relationships (i. e., participants indicated their race was different than the race of their partner). One type of REW (Color-blind Achieved) was especially susceptible to the negative consequences of stigma from family members. Other significant differences in relationship quality and relationship stigma were found based on REW. Most notable is that individuals who acknowledge institutional racism, have positive intergroup attitudes, and a positive ethnic identity reported better relationship quality than those who denied institutional racism and/or had less positive attitudes toward their own ethnic group. These results demonstrate the utility of REW in contextualizing the experiences of individuals in interracial relationships as it relates to perceived stigma and relationship quality. The study offers a critical account of how individuals understanding of the racial and ethnic social context shapes relationship outcomes for those in interracial relationships in the United States.

T2  - SEXUALITY RESEARCH AND SOCIAL POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Historically, people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) have lacked supports when it comes to sexual health and parenting. The aim of this study was to examine if, and how, Medicaid Home- and Community-Based Services (HCBS) 1915(c) waivers provided sexual health and parenting supports to people with IDD. Methods We analyzed 107 fiscal year (FY) 2021 HCBS waivers for people with IDD from across the USA to examine trends in service provision. These data were collected between December 2021 and January 2022. Results Approximately 10% of HCBS waivers provided sexual health services to people with IDD and 8% provided parenting services for people with IDD. Most sexual health services took a reactive, sex-negative approach to people with IDD's sexuality, rather than a proactive sex-positive approach. In terms of spending, $282,492 was projected for stand-alone sexual health services and $475,213 for stand-alone parenting services. However, less than 0.05% of people with IDD who received HCBS in FY 2021 were projected to receive stand-alone sexual health or parenting services via the waiver. Conclusions HCBS are a useful vehicle to expand sexual health and parenting supports for people with IDD; however, most states have failed to utilize this funding mechanism to promote the sexual and reproductive rights of people with IDD. Policy Implications There should be an expansion of sexual health and parenting supports offered to people with IDD in HCBS.

TI  - Reliability of the IMERG product through reference rain gauges in Central Italy
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite precipitation observations represent the future of climatology, as they allow continuous assessment of climate parameters over the entire earth's surface. Today, climate detection methods are in a transitional period where satellite data are not yet perfectly calibrated, while ground-based weather stations are still the most reliable detection methods. Precipitation is one of the most important climatic parameters, but at the same time it is complex to measure accurately by satellite. In this context it is essential to evaluate the reliability of a very useful and universally recognised satellite product, the IMERG V06 Final Run with validated weather stations in Central Italy. This could allow, on the one hand, to assess the accuracy of this satellite product compared to rain gauges, and on the other hand a better calibration at local scale. The analysis involved as many as 154 rain gauges in an area of about 12,600 Km2, so as to cover the area in a punctual way; in this context, two different comparison procedures were tested, pixel-to-point and pixel-to-pixel at annual and monthly scale, in the period 2001-2021. The results showed an overestimation of rainfall by the IMERG product, compared to rain gauges of about 200 mm per year, while in the coastal and hilly areas, IMERG's performance is even worse, overestimating precipitation by almost 1000 mm. This study showed that the pixel-to-pixel procedure proved to be the most reliable, showing the existence of a linear relationship between altitude and the differences between rain gauges and IMERG data, with an annual linear regression explaining up to 82% of the overall variance, allowing a possible calibration of the satellite product in the area.

TI  - Gravitational dark matter: Free streaming and phase space distribution
T2  - PHYSICAL REVIEW D
M3  - Article
AB  - Gravitational dark matter (DM) is the simplest possible scenario that has recently gained interest in the early Universe cosmology. In this scenario, DM is assumed to be produced from the scattering of inflatons through the gravitational interaction during reheating. Gravitational production from the radiation bath will be ignored as our analysis shows it to be suppressed for a wide range of reheating temperatures (Tre). Ignoring any other internal parameters except the DM mass (mY) and spin, a particular inflation model such as ?? attractor, with a specific scalar spectral index (ns) has been shown to uniquely fix the DM mass of the present Universe. For fermion type DM, we found the mass mf should be within (104-1013) GeV, and for boson/vector type DM, the mass ms/mX turned out to be within (1.2 x 10(-14)/9.6 - 10-14(1013)) GeV. Interestingly, if the inflaton equation of state x??? 1/3, the DM mass also approaches towards unique value, mf ' 10(10) GeV and ms(mX) x 103(8 x 103) GeV. We further analyzed the phase space distribution fY and free streaming length fs of these gravitationally produced DM. fY, which is believed to encode important information about DM, contains a characteristic primary peak at the initial time where the gravitational production is maximum for both fermionic and bosonic DM. Apart from this fermionic phase space, the distribution function contains an additional peak near the inflaton and fermion mass equality (mY ' m??) arising for ???? > 5/9. Furthermore, the height of this additional peak turned out to be increasing with decreasing Tre and at some point, dominates over the primary one. Since reheating is a causal process and DM is produced during this phase, gravitational instability forming small-scale DM structures during this period will encode those phase space information and be observed at present. The crucial condition of forming such a small-scale DM structure during reheating suggests that the fs must be less than the length scale associated with the mode reentering the Hubble radius at the end of reheating there, which has been analyzed in detail. We further estimate in detail the range of scales within which the above condition will be satisfied for different masses of scalar, fermionic, and vector DM. Finally, we end by stating the fact that all our results are observed to be insensitive on the parameter a of the inflaton potential within the allowed range set by the latest Planck and BICEP/Keck results.

TI  - Recent changes in the MCMURDO ICE SHELF TRANSITION ZONE and Hut Point Peninsula, West Antarctica
T2  - COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - McMurdo Ice Shelf (MIS) and Ross Island act as both lateral margins and pinning points for the Ross Ice Shelf, as well as logistic hubs for the United States and New Zealand Antarctic Programs. Recent thinning and retreat of MIS has motivated an evaluation of the future stability of this critical region and potential adaptation. If MIS were to collapse, it could initiate sizeable teleconnections across West Antarctica, as well as stifle Antarctic research that relies on MIS/Ross Island-based logistics. One logistics component already experiencing change is the Transition Zone (TZ) road, which connects MIS with the research stations on Hut Point Peninsula (HPP), Ross Island. Here we assess the vulnerability of the TZ road and a proposed rerouting location (TZ Hillside), by using a combination of in situ, remote sensing, and numerical modeling approaches. We evaluate overall elevation change by differencing late summer, WorldView-derived, DEMs (2011-2015), and evaluate the practicality of both a stable ice surface and bare earth road using a numerical ice volume flux model, informed by GPR and GPS measurements of ice thickness and velocity (2015-2016). Results show overall ice elevation change of up to 3 m, and 204 +/- 24 m(3) a(-1) of ice flux across the TZ Hillside. Combined, these results indicate that the TZ Hillside is unsuitable for either type of road, and point to MIS terminus retreat and TZ Hillside melt as a continuing risk for TZ stability, which could prelude broader changes.

TI  - An Ultra-Broadband High Efficiency Polarization Beam Splitter for High Spectral Resolution Polarimetric Imaging in the Near Infrared
T2  - ADVANCED SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - A broadband, high efficiency polarized beam splitter (PBS) metagrating based on integrated resonant units (IRUs) to enable simultaneous polarization analysis, spectral dispersion, and spatial imaging in the near infrared (NIR) is developed. A PBS metagrating with a diameter of 60 mm is the key technology component of the high-resolution multiple-species atmospheric profiler in the NIR (HiMAP-NIR), which is a spaceborne instrument concept crafted to be a core payload of NASA's new generation Earth System Observatory. HiMAP-NIR will enable the aerosol profiling in Earth's planetary boundary layer (from surface to2 km altitude) by simultaneously measuring four spatial-spectral-polarimetric images from 680 to 780 nm. Through detailed optimization of hybridized resonant modes in IRUs, the PBS metagrating shows a diffraction efficiency of 70% (or better) for all four linear-polarized incident light, and polarization contrasts between orthogonal states are 0.996 (or better) from 680 to 780 nm. It meets the stringent performance required by the HiMAP-NIR exploiting a new paradigm for the broad applications of metasurfaces.

TI  - Short-term effects of burn severity on ecosystem multifunctionality in the northwest Iberian Peninsula
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Severe wildfires cause important changes in vegetation and soil properties in Mediterranean ecosystems. The aim of this work was to evaluate ecosystem multifunctionality through the study of burn severity short-term effects on differ-ent ecosystem functions and services. We selected the Cabrera wildfire (2017) in northwest Spain. Burn severity was quantified using CBI index, differentiating four categories: unburned, low, moderate, and high severity. We established a total of 126 field plots, where one year after fire the vegetation was evaluated and soil samples for the analysis of chemical, biochemical, and microbiological properties were collected. Sentinel-2 images were used to obtain vegeta-tion biophysical variables. Vegetation and soil variables were directly applied as indicators, or used to calculate other indicators, which were standardized and selected to define ecosystem functions and services: (1) photosynthetic activity, soil fertility, nutrient cycling, and soil quality (supporting ecosystem service); (2) grass production for livestock and wood production (provisioning ecosystem service); (3) climate regulation and erosion protection (regulating eco-system services), and (4) woody species diversity and aesthetic value (cultural ecosystem services). The combination of these functions and services defined ecosystem multifunctionality. The main results showed that burn severity nega-tively affected most ecosystem functions, as well as the ecosystem services of supporting, provisioning, and regulating, and hence, ecosystem multifunctionality. However, the soil fertility function significantly increased with high burn se-verity, while woody species diversity and aesthetic value functions and, consequently, the cultural ecosystem service, only decreased under the effect of moderate severity. These results provide a starting point to study burn severity effects from a multifunctional approach in Mediterranean ecosystems.

TI  - The streaming industry and the great disruption: how winning a Golden Globe helps Amazon sell more shoes
T2  - MEDIA CULTURE & SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper assesses the media industry in the US by analyzing Big Tech's entrance into film and television production and the rise of streaming distribution technology. Through a case study of Prime Video, Amazon's prize streaming platform, this study explores how streaming technology has disrupted film and television from multiple perspectives, subjecting the industry to new logics of internet distribution, rooted in platforms, artificial intelligence, digital delivery systems, and big data. In the Big Tech worldview, disruption is an inherently progressive development. However, an analysis of Prime Video reveals how disruption is only the latest manifestation of conglomeration and convergence in the film and television industries. By uncovering the industry logics that govern the era of streaming, this paper analyzes the streaming industry of the present while taking into consideration the cable period in the past to account for the rapid technological development in the future.

TI  - Modeling ocean surface chlorophyll-a concentration from ocean color remote sensing reflectance in global waters using machine learning
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial and temporal variations of Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) in clear and coastal waters are critical for assessing the health of the marine environment. Machine learning models have been proven to model complex relationships and provide better accuracy estimates of the derived parameters compared to traditional empirical models. The present study proposes a novel approach to derive Chl-a by using multi-layer perceptron Neural Network (MLPNN) with Resilient backpropagation method based on the four ocean color bands existent in most of the ocean color sensors. The NNs are trained on NASA's bio-optical Marine Algorithm Dataset (NOMAD) and tested on three different datasets (i) SeaWiFS and, (ii) MODIS Aqua matchup dataset, and (iii) simulated dataset for the Red Sea. These three datasets cover significant variations range in Chl-a levels under both oligotrophic and eutrophic conditions. The influence of different variations in inputs used in NN training is assessed and hyperparameter tuning of the NN is performed to obtain best NN configuration to derive Chl-a. Accuracy assessment of the present study with other global algorithms are performed by comparing the modeled and observed values of the Chl-a. The performance matrices computed from the developed model were promising. Therefore, this study provides a potential approach for the retrieval of improved Chl-a estimates in the global clear and coastal waters as compared to the traditional blue-green band ratio algorithms. Furthermore, the developed algorithm and existing algorithms are applied to SeaWiFS, MODIS, VIIRS, and Hawkeye satellite ocean color data to demonstrate how it may be utilized to accurately depict the spatial distribu-tion of ocean color features in global waters, phytoplankton blooms and some of the physical processes in the Arabian Sea and the Red Sea. The findings of this work have potential to advance the ocean color remote sensing and biogeo-chemical cycles and processes in coastal and open ocean waters.

TI  - S100A4-dependent glycolysis promotes lymphatic vessel sprouting in tumor
T2  - ANGIOGENESIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tumor-induced lymphangiogenesis promotes the formation of new lymphatic vessels, contributing to lymph nodes (LNs) metastasis of tumor cells in both mice and humans. Vessel sprouting appears to be a critical step in this process. However, how lymphatic vessels sprout during tumor lymphangiogenesis is not well-established. Here, we report that S100A4 expressed in lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) promotes lymphatic vessel sprouting in a growing tumor by regulating glycolysis. In mice, the loss of S100A4 in a whole body (S100A4(-/-)), or specifically in LECs (S100A4(Delta LYVE1)) leads to impaired tumor lymphangiogenesis and disrupted metastasis of tumor cells to sentinel LNs. Using a 3D spheroid sprouting assay, we found that S100A4 in LECs was required for the lymphatic vessel sprouting. Further investigations revealed that S100A4 was essential for the position and motility of tip cells, where it activated AMPK-dependent glycolysis during lymphatic sprouting. In addition, the expression of S100A4 in LECs was upregulated under hypoxic conditions. These results suggest that S100A4 is a novel regulator of tumor-induced lymphangiogenesis. Targeting S100A4 in LECs may be a potential therapeutic strategy for lymphatic tumor metastasis.

TI  - Heterogeneous reservoir prediction of ultra-deep strike-slip fault-damaged zone constrained with local seismic anomaly data
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The fractured-vuggy reservoirs (FVRs) wrapped in strike-slip fault-damaged zones (SSFDZs) are the main drilling targets for oil-gas exploration in the Tarim Basin. The seismic characteristics of the FVRs are strong wave crest, strong wave trough, chaotic waveform and the random combination of these three types of waveforms, which are distributed in strips. Constrained sparse pulse inversion (CSSI) results based on the traditional relatively homogeneous low frequency impedance model (LFIM) cannot characterize heterogeneous FVRs. To solve this bottleneck, this paper proposes the viewpoint that the SSFDZ-transformed reservoirs are geologically isochronous. A multi-iterative inversion method (MIIM) is proposed, including multi-iterative CSSI and poststack geostatistics inversion (PSGI). This method extracts the information implicit in seismic data by AI-assisted local heterogeneity and establishes an SSFDZ framework to form a heterogeneous LFIM (HLFIM). The process performs multiple iterative constrained inversion based on the HLFIM. Finally, by combining the relative impedance with the HLFIM, absolute impedance data consistent with drilling and geological understanding are obtained. The result of MIIM improves the ability to distinguish different scale FVRs features controlled by SSFDZs. The recovery rate of reservoirs with different scales in the SSFDZs of the forward geological model is 98.15%. In the FuMan area, the success rate of commercial oil and gas flow by drilling has increased from 75 to 95% in two years and has been maintained for three years. This method can be popularized and applied, and can be used as a reference for the extraction of heterogeneous information in remote sensing data.

TI  - Language ideologies and second language acquisition: the case of French long-term residents in Sweden
T2  - JOURNAL OF MULTILINGUAL AND MULTICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The present study investigates the possible impact of language ideologies on second language proficiency. Based on interviews and a thematic analysis, we explored language ideologies among French long-term residents in Stockholm, Sweden. The participants had contrasting proficiency levels in the host community language: five were categorised as low-performers of Swedish and five as high-performers of Swedish, based on two linguistic measures. Overall, low-performing and high-performing language users in this sample of French long-term residents in Sweden appear to hold different ideologies related to mobility and language learning. While the low-performers tend to adhere to efficiency-related ideologies and a universalist cosmopolitan worldview, where English as a lingua franca is the most significant capital, the high-performers adhere to ideologies that are more identity-based and closer to assimilationist or nationalist views, where the participants see themselves as joining a majority culture into which they should adapt. High host language proficiency is seen as necessary capital for this. All in all, the study makes a clear case for further studies exploring language ideologies in relation to second language acquisition.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Changes in Land Use and Ecosystem Service Values Under the Influence of Glacier Retreat in a High-Andean Environment
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers supply multiple ecosystem services that are threatened by climate change. The retreat and disappearance of tropical glaciers is an important dynamic that affects ecosystems and local communities. The knowledge of the impacts of this land-change dynamics on the supply of ecosystem services is lacking. In that sense, the assessment developed can provide evidence about the costs and benefits of promoting conservation and human well-being at the same time. Then, the main objective of this research is to determine the spatial-temporal changes and their effects on the economic value of ecosystem services in a glacial retreat environment. We selected the Marangani district as a study area. It comprises the La Raya Mountain range in the Andes. The assessments were carried out across two scales of observation: the municipality and the watershed level. Here, we process spectral information from Landsat Sensor using the Random Forest algorithm in the Google Earth Engine platform to classify 10 biomes. It was carried out over more than 30 years (from 1986 to 2019). After that, ecosystem services provided by the biomes were valued using the transfer method. This research shows that at the municipality level, almost all the LULCs faced variations over time, and the glaciers had the highest change, accumulating a ratio of -85.51%, whereas at the watershed level, a higher tendency of land changes is observed in the areas without glaciers, and those with glacier areas count on permanent larger bofedales. At the municipality level, the economic value of ecosystems shows that bofedales and water surfaces are the LULCs that supply the highest ecosystem services (similar to 33,000 USD ha(-1) yr(-1) each). In addition, without the inflation adjustment, the total ESV is on a trajectory of losing ESV (-$9.67 x 10(6)). In the watersheds with glacier retreat, significant quantity of bofedales and natural grasslands controls the fluctuations of ESV. These high-mountain watersheds play an essential role in providing benefits and value to local communities. In general, the municipality level indicates the trajectory of changes in the district, whereas the watershed scale shows the urgency for implementing spatial conservation actions.

AB  - Objective. The autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model has been widely used to predict the trend of infectious diseases. This paper is aimed at analyzing the application of the ARIMA model in the prediction of the incidence trend of influenza-like illness (ILI) in Wuhan and providing a scientific basis for the prediction and prevention of influenza. Methods. The weekly ILI data of two influenza surveillance sentinel hospitals in Wuhan City published on the website of the National Influenza Center of China were collected, and the ARIMA model was used to model the data from 2014 to 2020, to predict and verify the ILI data in 2021. Results. The optimal model for the incidence trend of ILI in Wuhan was ARIMA 1,1,1, the residuals were in line with the white noise sequence (0.0180.05), and the relative error between the predicted value and the actual value was small, which all proved the model was practical. Conclusion. ARIMA 1,1,1 can effectively simulate the short-term incidence trend of ILI in Wuhan.

TI  - Integrated Geophysical Assessment of Groundwater Potential in Southwestern Saudi Arabia
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Saudi Arabia is seeking fresh groundwater resources to face the increase in anthropogenic activities. The groundwater storage variations and occurrence were investigated and the surface and subsurface structures influencing the groundwater resources in the research area were defined using a combined study of Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment, aeromagnetic data, and electrical resistivity data with other relevant datasets. Results are: The groundwater storage fluctuation is calculated at -0.34 +/- 0.01 mm/yr during the period 04/2002-12/2021. The area is receiving an average annual rainfall rate of 117.6 mm during the period 2002 to 2019. Three structural trends, defined in the directions of NS, NNW, and NNE are cutting the sedimentary cover and the basement rocks. The sedimentary cover ranges from 0 to 1.2 km thick. Vertical electrical sounding results indicate three main geoelectric layers: the surface geoelectrical layer of higher resistivity values (428-9626 ohm. m) is made up of unconsolidated Quaternary sediments; the water-bearing layer of saturated sands with a resistivity range between 5.1 and 153 ohm. m and with depths vary from 1 to 94 m, and highly fractured basement rocks with resistivity values ranging from 813 to 6030 ohm. m. The integrated results are useful in providing a comprehensive image of the study area's surface and subsurface structures, as well as groundwater potential in the southwestern part of Saudi Arabia. Our integrated approach provides a reproducible model for assessing groundwater potential in arid and semiarid areas.

TI  - Tracking Spatio-Temporal Dynamics of Greenhouse-Led Cultivated Land and its Drivers in Shandong Province, China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization and economic development have led the diversified food production and consumption. In this context, as a highly efficient and intensive cultivated land use form, Greenhouse-led cultivated land (GCL) has continuously increased in recent decades worldwide. Previously works have documented the irrational expansion of GCL in challenging the ecological environment and sustainable agricultural development. However, these studies either have been short-term and point-based studies or have not revealed the long-term causes, process and patterns in a large-scale. In this study, long-term annual remote sensing-based and statistical data were used to investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of GCL and its drivers in Shandong province, China from 1989 to 2018. The results showed that: 1) GCL in Shandong was toward continuous clustering dominated by medium-low and medium densities, showing the same trend as the increase of its total area; 2) GCL with a cumulative duration of more than 15 years and a demolition frequency of less than 0.2 were mainly distributed in the industrial clustering regions and roughly formed a circular expansion pattern around the central mountainous area with the most expansion period appeared in the mid-2010's; 3) Budget expenditure for rural development, local retail sales and average earnings of local farmers were the most important local driving factors of the GCL expansion in Shandong. 4) The competition of external vegetable supply and the consumption demand from Beijing were the main external driving forces of the expansion of GCL in Shandong. These findings can enhance the comprehensive understanding of typical component of "Human-Nature" interaction and support the sustainable development of regional agriculture.

TI  - Multi-criteria ground water potentiality mapping utilizing remote sensing and geophysical data: A case study within Sinai Peninsula, Egypt
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater demand has dramatically increased due to the swift demographic explosion, especially in arid areas, where groundwater is considered the main source for all purposes. Thus, this research integrates climatological, lithological, structural, topographical, hydro-morphological, and geoelectrical data to explore groundwater potential zones in the central part of Sinai Peninsula, Egypt using the GIS-based Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Seven thematic layers of soil moisture, rainfall, normalized difference vegetation index, drainage density, lineament density, slope, and land use/land cover were built from different remote sensing data sets. The eighth layer represents a high-resolution lithological map of the study area, constructed utilizing the power of the support vector machine over Sentinel 2 data and accurately assessed with a previously published geological map. Ground Water Potentiality Map (GWPM) was constructed and highlighted four main areas as promising zones. Comprehensive geoelectrical analysis was executed through seventeen deep vertical electrical soundings (VESs) using Schlumberger configuration, isoresistivity mapping, and geoelectric cross-sections along five different profiles. 3D view of the studied area's subsurface geological and structural pattern with groundwater flow direction specification, and adequate aquifer characterization, revealed four main geoelectrical units. Geoelectrical data results reasonably coincided with remote sensing data findings in highlighting three freshwater potential zones. Furthermore, the study strongly recommends integrating low-cost remote sensing datasets in narrowing the zone to be intensively investigated using further costly geophysical approaches or drilling test boreholes.(c) 2022 National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science.

TI  - Interannual variability in the Australian carbon cycle over 2015-2019, based on assimilation of Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we employ a regional inverse modelling approach to estimate monthly carbon fluxes over the Australian continent for 2015-2019 using the assimilation of the total column-averaged mole fractions of carbon dioxide from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2, version 9) satellite. Subsequently, we study the carbon cycle variations and relate their fluctuations to anomalies in vegetation productivity and climate drivers. Our 5-year regional carbon flux inversion suggests that Australia was a carbon sink averaging -0.46 +/- 0.08 PgC yr(-1) (excluding fossil fuel emissions), largely influenced by a strong carbon uptake (-1.04 PgC yr(-1)) recorded in 2016. Australia's semi-arid ecosystems, such as sparsely vegetated regions (in central Australia) and savanna (in northern Australia), were the main contributors to the carbon uptake in 2016. These regions showed relatively high vegetation productivity, high rainfall, and low temperature in 2016. In contrast to the large carbon sink found in 2016, the large carbon outgassing recorded in 2019 coincides with an unprecedented rainfall deficit and higher-than-average temperatures across Australia. Comparison of the posterior column-averaged CO(2 )concentration with Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) stations and in situ measurements offers limited insight into the fluxes assimilated with OCO-2. However, the lack of these monitoring stations across Australia, mainly over ecosystems such as savanna and areas with sparse vegetation, impedes us from providing strong conclusions. To a certain extent, we found that the flux anomalies across Australia are consistent with the ensemble means of the OCO-2 Model Intercomparison Project (OCO-2 MIP) and FLUXCOM (2015-2018), which estimate an anomalous carbon sink for Australia in 2016 of -1.09 and -0.42 PgC yr(-1) respectively. More accurate estimates of OCO-2 retrievals, with the addition of ocean glint data into our system, and a better understanding of the error in the atmospheric transport modelling will yield further insights into the difference in the magnitude of our carbon flux estimates.

TI  - UAV-based remote sensing using visible and multispectral indices for the estimation of vegetation cover in an oasis of a desert
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural vegetation is an important indicator for the maintenance of symbiosis in an oasis in extremely arid zones. Unmanned aerial vehicles have advantages of high resolution and multiple wavebands to obtain details of sparse vegetation cover. So far, studies on the selection of machine learning methods are relatively limited and usually focus on only a few selected methods. In this study, the natural vegetation of the Dariyabui Oasis in the hinterland of the Taklamakan Desert in China was mapped using 2,550 samples of data and 14 visible and multispectral vegetation indices as model variables. Six machine learning methods were used to construct fractional vegetation cover (FVC) predictive regression models. Coefficient of determination (R2), root-mean-square error (RMSE), and mean-absolute error (MAE) were used to evaluate the models. The regression models were divided into four components: visible (RF: R2 = 0.65, RMSE = 0.59 %, MAE = 0.41 %), multispectral (RF: R2 = 0.71, RMSE = 0.54 %, MAE = 0.36 %), visible and multispectral (RF: R2 = 0.69, RMSE = 0.55 %, MAE = 0.37 %), and the product of visible and multispectral vegetation indices (RF: R2 = 0.68, RMSE = 0.57 %, MAE = 0.39 %). Besides, the visible vegetation index results were validated using different years and different aerial height data. The results show that these four regression models can effectively obtain the FVC of sparse vegetation of the desert. This study applied the Random Forest model, which was selected based on a comparison of other models, to predict the status of desert vegetation cover based on spectral data to provide information for its conservation and management.

TI  - The effect of UVB-blocking plastics on the efficacy of <i>Beauveria bassiana</i> and a conventional product against <i>Lygus lineolaris</i> on low tunnel strawberry
T2  - PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND Effective, safe and practical biocontrol options are greatly needed for combating Lygus lineolaris on protected culture strawberry. This study demonstrated how ultaviolet (UV)-selective plastics can improve the efficacy of the fungal biocontrol agent Beauveria bassiana (Mycotrol) compared to the conventional insecticide acetamiprid (Assail) against L. lineolaris on low tunnel strawberry. RESULTS We found that UVB-blocking treatments improved B. bassiana spore viability in both in vitro and in vivo laboratory experiments. In the field, survival of Mycotrol-treated sentinel L. lineolaris was lowest under UVB-blocking low tunnels, but this did not translate into significant differences among covering treatments in local L. lineolaris density or fruit damage. In contrast, applying the product Assail resulted in the lowest L. lineolaris density and highest quality yield compared to Mycotrol sprays. This was especially pronounced under low tunnels of any UV-limiting plastic. CONCLUSIONS This study indicates that growing under low tunnels is a useful tool to improve the efficacy of conventional products and biopesticides containing microbial biocontrol agents. The efficacy of both products was improved under low tunnels, and specifically under UVB-blocking plastics for Mycotrol containing B. bassiana. However, there was little evidence that UVB plastics resulted in lower L. lineolaris densities and proportion of damaged fruit for either product in the field. Therefore we conclude that growing under any plastic covering is likely to benefit growers, but the economic value of growing under UVB tunnels is unclear. (c) 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.

TI  - Towards SDG 15.3: The biome context as the appropriate degradation monitoring dimension
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and reliable estimation of terrestrial ecosystem degradation is critical to meeting the challenge of reversing land degradation. Remote sensing data (especially land productivity dynamics) is commonly used to estimate land degradation, and this study uses the TRENDS.EARTH toolbox for the period covering 2000-2018, demonstrating the benefit of tracking the degradation process (SDG 15.3.1) at a biophysical unit. Contributing to the country's SDG 15.3.1 monitoring, anthropogenic degradation was estimated based on RESTREND land productivity, biome-specific land cover trends, and soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks. Underlying degradation was evaluated by reclassifying a 28-year national land cover change dataset to match the UNCCD land cover legend. Analysis results indicate that land productivity changes (especially in stable grasslands, afforested, and cropland areas) mainly influenced the degradation status of the biome (19.9% degraded & 25.6% improvement). Global datasets also suggest that land cover and SOC had a minimal contribution (<2%) to anthropogenic degradation dynamics in the biome between 2000 and 2018. The GIS analysis showed that long-term, the major contributors to the biome's underlying 9% anthropogenic degradation were woody proliferation into the Grassland Biome, urban expansion, and wetland drainage. Contextualising the UNCCD matrix helped interpret the SDG 15.3.1 indicator results, showing significant contestations that need careful consideration to avoid misleading policy guidance. The study also outlines the accompanying implications for degradation assessments.

TI  - Spatio-temporal cross-validation to predict pluvial flood events in the Metropolitan City of Venice
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to a combination of climate change and urbanization, the instances of pluvial flooding are expected to in-crease in the next decades posing raising threats to properties, people and productive assets. Predicting and mapping pluvial flood-prone areas is becoming a crucial step in flood mitigation and early warnings, as well as climate change adaptation strategies, to be incorporate in urban planning. Most commonly applied machine learning (ML) procedures for pluvial flood risk assessment, neglect to account for spatio-temporal constraints, leading to overoptimistic models that underestimate the prediction error. In this paper, we propose a novel ML -based methodology for pluvial flood risk prediction in the Metropolitan City of Venice which, introducing a features selection process and spatio-temporal cross-validation, permits to reduce overfitting of the resulting ML models. Spatio-temporal characteristics of floods are derived from a dataset of 60 historical events occurred in the area between 1995 and 2020. Logistic Regression (LR), Neural Networks (NN) and Random Forest (RF) models are applied to identify and prioritize sub-areas that are more likely to be affected by pluvial flood risk, considering the daily precipitation amount and 12 different triggering factors. The models were validated using Random Cross-Validation (R-CV) and Leave Location and Time Out cross-validation (LLTO-CV), that split data in training and validation set considering both time and space. In addition, a forward features selection procedure was applied to identify the features, among the triggering factors, that better face spatio-temporal overfitting in pluvial flood prediction based on the Area Under the Curve (AUC) score. Results suggest that Logistic Regression and LLTO-CV represent the most reliable model to predict pluvial flood events in new spatio-temporal conditions, while, among the triggering factors, distance to river and distance to road resulted the prominent ones.

TI  - Crop-CASMA: A web geoprocessing and map service based architecture and implementation for serving soil moisture and crop vegetation condition data over US Cropland
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is an essential parameter to understand crop conditions throughout the growing season. Collecting soil moisture data by field observation is labor-intensive, especially when attempting to obtain Conterminous United States (CONUS) geographic coverage. In addition, using soil moisture for assessing current and future crop conditions is best realized by combining soil moisture estimates with concurrent observations of crop conditions. However, until recently, this capability has not been available to the public. In this paper, we present an interoperable data service application system, the Crop Condition and Soil Moisture Analytics (Crop-CASMA) system, that facilitates the retrieval, analysis, visualization, and sharing of soil moisture data for the CONUS. This system delivers a variety of satellite remote sensing based data products that are derived from Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Level-4 data and SMAP Thermal Hydraulic disaggregation of Soil Moisture (THySM) data, as well as vegetation index data derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) ob-servations. To make services interoperable and reusable, all data products are disseminated via Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Web Map Service (WMS) and Web Coverage Service (WCS) interface standards. Additionally, a suite of geoprocessing operations, such as geospatial statistics, time-series profile generation, PDF map pro-duction, and image composition, has been implemented in the OGC Web Processing Service (WPS) interface standard. The implementation shows the proposed web service system can significantly simplify the mapping and quantitative analysis of soil moisture and crop condition over U.S. cropland. In addition, it is interoperable with GIS software and has been successfully integrated with web-based applications.

TI  - Quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater treatment plants mirrors the pandemic trend in Hong Kong
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) for the SARS-CoV-2 virus in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) has emerged as a cost-effective and unbiased tool for population-level testing in the community. In the present study, we conducted a 6-month wastewater monitoring campaign from three WWTPs of different flow rates and catchment area characteristics, which serve 28 % (2.1 million people) of Hong Kong residents in total. Wastewater samples collected daily or every other day were concentrated using ultracentrifugation and the SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA in the supernatant was detected using the N1 and E primer sets. The results showed significant correlations between the virus concentration and the number of daily new cases in corresponding catchment areas of the three WWTPs when using 7-day moving average values (Kendall's tau-b value: 0.227-0.608, p < 0.001). SARS-CoV-2 virus concentration was normalized to a fecal indicator using PMMoV concentration and daily flow rates, but the normalization did not enhance the correlation. The key factors contributing to the correlation were also evaluated, including the sampling frequency, testing methods, and smoothing days. This study demonstrates the applicability of wastewater surveillance to monitor overall SARS-CoV-2 pandemic dynamics in a densely populated city like Hong Kong, and provides a largescale longitudinal reference for the establishment of the long-term sentinel surveillance in WWTPs for WBE of pathogens which could be combined into a city-wide public health observatory.

TI  - Global perspective on digital preservation policy: A systematic review
T2  - JOURNAL OF LIBRARIANSHIP AND INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Policy provides a roadmap for actions to be taken in any task. It plays an important role in successful implementation of any program. Similarly, the presence of policy also plays a key role in implementation of digital preservation program. The organizations having such policy hold an edge for carrying out their digital preservation activities in an organized manner. This paper provides an explicit overview regarding preparedness of libraries and other organizations across the world in terms of availability of policies for digital preservation. The paper also attempts to map the data geographically. The empirical studies were reviewed systematically, and the extracted data was synthesized for producing meaningful insight about this phenomenon. The meta-analysis affirms that libraries and other organizations seem to have realization about importance of policies for implementation of digital preservation program. Although some studies highlight the availability of digital preservation policies in a good number of organizations yet, as a whole, most of the studies point out passive organizational attitude toward the development of such policies. The data mapping affirms that the studies conducted worldwide and North American region show a satisfactory situation in terms of availability of digital preservation policies. However, the studies conducted in European countries, African region, China, and New Zealand identify a gap regarding presence of such policies.

TI  - Historical wheat yield mapping using time-series satellite data and district-wise yield statistics over Uttar Pradesh state, India
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop productivity has often been affected by undesirable climatic events such as heat stress, flood, unseasonal rainfall, drought, etc. Historical crop yield estimation and mapping shall provide a pivotal input for food security measures and planning purposes. The present study deployed various satellite (i.e., normalized difference vegetation index) and gridded (i.e., precipitation, temperature, evapotranspiration) products to portray the historical wheat yield at satellite pixellevel during 2001-2019 over the Uttar Pradesh state of India. Directorate of Economics and Statistics (DES) based district-wise wheat yield dataset was also used with satellite variables to develop the historical wheat yield model based on the multiple regression analysis. Spatially, higher, lower, and lower to moderate wheat yields are observed in the western and northwest parts, southern and southeast parts, and lower-middle to the lower right parts of the state respectively throughout the study years. Remarkably, the years 2017,2018, and 2019 witnessed higher yields, while 2004, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2015 witnessed lower yield. The developed wheat yield models performed well, as R2 values were observed between 0.3 and 0.76 between the satellite-derived and DES-based district-wise mean yield. The mean absolute error was found to be considerable and ranged between 0.22 and 1.7 t/ha during the study years. The adopted methodology can be used across the different parts of the globe at the local to country scale for a quantitative crop yield depiction and mapping at the satellite pixel level. Such historical crop yield mapping can assist in understanding the long-term crop yield pattern in response to the climate change activity, and hence food security measures can be formulated and implemented.

TI  - The Evolution of a Specialized, Highly Virulent Fish Pathogen through Gene Loss and Acquisition of Host-Specific Survival Mechanisms
T2  - APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Photobacterium damselae subsp. damselae is a ubiquitous marine bacterium and opportunistic pathogen of compromised hosts of diverse taxa. In contrast, its sister subspecies P. damselae subsp. piscicida (Pdp) is highly virulent in fish. Pdp has evolved from a single subclade of Pdd through gene loss and acquisition.Photobacterium damselae comprises two subspecies, P. damselae subsp. damselae and P. damselae subsp. piscicida, that contrast remarkably despite their taxonomic relationship. The former is opportunistic and free-living but can cause disease in compromised individuals from a broad diversity of taxa, while the latter is a highly specialized, primary fish pathogen. Here, we employ new closed curated genome assemblies from Australia to estimate the global phylogenetic structure of the species P. damselae. We identify genes responsible for the shift from an opportunist to a host-adapted fish pathogen, potentially via an arthropod vector as fish-to-fish transmission was not achieved in repeated cohabitation challenges despite high virulence for Seriola lalandi. Acquisition of ShdA adhesin and of thiol peroxidase may have allowed the environmental, generalist ancestor to colonize zooplankton and to occasionally enter in fish host sentinel cells. As dependence on the host has increased, P. damselae has lost nonessential genes, such as those related to nitrite and sulfite reduction, urea degradation, a type 6 secretion system (T6SS) and several toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems. Similar to the evolution of Yersinia pestis, the loss of urease may be the crucial event that allowed the pathogen to stably colonize zooplankton vectors. Acquisition of host-specific genes, such as those required to form a sialic acid capsule, was likely necessary for the emergent P. damselae subsp. piscicida to become a highly specialized, facultative intracellular fish pathogen. Processes that have shaped P. damselae subsp. piscicida from subsp. damselae are similar to those underlying evolution of Yersinia pestis from Y. pseudotuberculosis. IMPORTANCE Photobacterium damselae subsp. damselae is a ubiquitous marine bacterium and opportunistic pathogen of compromised hosts of diverse taxa. In contrast, its sister subspecies P. damselae subsp. piscicida (Pdp) is highly virulent in fish. Pdp has evolved from a single subclade of Pdd through gene loss and acquisition. We show that fish-to-fish transmission does not occur in repeated infection models in the primary host, Seriola lalandi, and present genomic evidence for vector-borne transmission, potentially via zooplankton. The broad genomic changes from generalist Pdd to specialist Pdp parallel those of the environmental opportunist Yersinia pseudotuberculosis to vector-borne plague bacterium Y. pestis and demonstrate that evolutionary processes in bacterial pathogens are universal between the terrestrial and marine biosphere.

TI  - Near-infrared fluorescent image-guided lymph node dissection compared with locoregional lymphadenectomies in dogs with mast cell tumours
T2  - JOURNAL OF SMALL ANIMAL PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives Near-infrared fluorescent imaging has been described for intraoperative mapping of the draining lymph nodes in human cancer and canine oral tumours. The aim of this study was to retrospectively describe the results of lymphadenectomies in dogs with mast cell tumours treated either by standard unguided locoregional lymph node dissection or near-infrared fluorescent image-guided lymph node dissection. Methods Medical records between 2012 and 2020 were reviewed for dogs that were presented for surgical resection of mast cell tumours with concurrent lymphadenectomy either with (near-infrared fluorescent image-guided lymph node dissection) or without near-infrared fluorescence image guidance (lymph node dissection). The number and location of lymph nodes planned for surgical dissection and actually dissected nodes, presence of metastases and perioperative complications were recorded. Results Thirty-five patients underwent near-infrared fluorescent image-guided lymph node dissection, and 43 lymph node dissections. The number of nodes preoperatively planned for resection were 70 and 68, respectively. Fifty-eight of those (83%) were identified during near-infrared fluorescent image-guided lymph node dissection procedures, compared with 50 (74%) during lymph node dissection. near-infrared fluorescent image-guided lymph node dissection resulted in resection of additional fluorescent nodes not corresponding to locoregional nodes in 15 of 35 dogs. Using near-infrared fluorescent image-guided lymph node dissection, we identified at least one metastatic node in 68% of dogs (24 of 35) compared with 33% (14 of 43) when lymph node dissection was used without imaging. No complications related to near-infrared fluorescent imaging were reported. Clinical Significance The present study suggests that near-infrared imaging is a promising technique for intraoperative detection of the draining lymph nodes in dogs with mast cell tumours. Further validation of the technique is required to assess if near-infrared fluorescent imaging can detect the true sentinel lymph node.

TI  - 3D point cloud density-based segmentation for vine rows detection and localisation
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The adoption of new sensors for crop monitoring is leading to the acquisition of large amounts of data, which usually are not directly usable for agricultural applications. The 3D point cloud maps of fields and parcels, generated from remotely sensed data, are examples of such big data, which require the development of specific algorithms for their processing and interpretation, with the final aim to obtain valuable information about crop status. This manuscript presents an innovative 3D point cloud processing algorithm for vine row detection and localisation within vineyard maps, based on the detection of key points and a density-based clustering approach. Vine row localisation is a crucial phase in the interpretation of the complex and huge 3D point clouds of agricultural environments, which makes it possible to move the focus from a macro level (parcel and plot scale) to a micro level (plants, fruits and branches). The algorithm outputs fully describe the spatial location of each vine row within the whole 3D model of the agricultural environment by a set of key points and an interpolating curve. The algorithm is specifically conceived to be robust and: (i) independent of the adopted airborne sensor used to acquire the in-field data (not requiring a model with colour or spectral information); (ii) able to manage vine-yards with any vine row layout or orientation (such as curvilinear) and (iii) not hindered by the occurrence of missing plants. The experimental results, obtained by processing the models of seven case study parcels, proved the algorithm's reliability and accuracy: the automatic vine row detection was found to be 100% in accordance with the manual one; and the obtained localisation indices showed an average error of 12 cm and standard deviation of 10 cm, which is fully compatible with the considered agricultural applications. In addition, the algorithm outputs can be profitably exploited for enhanced path planning of autonomous agricultural machines adopted for in-field operations.

TI  - Impact of ocean fronts on the reconstruction of vertical temperature profiles from sea surface measurements
T2  - DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Temperature structures in the ocean interior are fundamental to interpret ocean dynamics. Yet their measure-ments are still limited, despite the increasing effort to deploy in-situ instruments over the last decades. Recon-struction of the vertical temperature profiles from sea surface variables is thus widely adopted to bridge this gap. Most of the studies deal with the reconstruction in a uniform manner without taking the presence of ocean processes into account. In this study, we evaluate the effects of ocean fronts on the reconstruction performances of vertical temperature profiles over the Northwest Pacific Ocean. Four mapping models based on linear and second-order polynomial regressions are trained by inputting the sea surface temperature (SST) and sea level anomaly (SLA). Model validations in terms of the mean bias and standard deviation (STD) are conducted based on an independent dataset excluded from the training process. The model of best performance is with inputs of SST and SLA using the polynominal regression. The spatial distribution of the bias and STD is then linked with the SST gradient to assess the front impacts. We found that the regions of high bias and STD are geographically consistent with that of large SST gradient. Both biases and STDs exhibit a quasi-linear increase trend relative to the SST gradient with slopes varying for depths. The bias reaches its maximum at around 300 m depth and decreases towards both deeper and shallower levels. These results suggest the necessity to consider fronts in-fluence on the reconstruction of vertical temperature profiles, which shall improve the mapping accuracy.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Evolution of Sandy Land and its Impact on Soil Wind Erosion in the Kubuqi Desert in Recent 30 Years
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuous remote-sensing monitoring of sand in desert areas and the exploration of the spatio-temporal evolution characteristics of soil-wind erosion has an important scientific value for desertification prevention and ecological restoration. In this study, the Kubuqi Desert was selected as the study area, and the Landsat series satellite remote sensing data, supplemented by satellite remote sensing data such as GE images, SPOT-5, ZY-3, GF-1/2/6, etc., integrated object-oriented, decision tree, and auxiliary human-computer interaction interpretation methods, developed the Kubuqi Desert area dataset from 1990 to 2020, and established a soil erosion intensity database of the past 30 years based on the soil-wind erosion correction equation. The results show that the application of the training samples obtained by a high-score collaborative ground sampling to land use/cover classification in desert areas can effectively improve the efficiency of remote-sensing mapping of sand changes and the accuracy of change information identification, and the overall accuracy of the classification results is 95%. In general, the sandy area of the Kubuqi Desert area has decreased year by year, during which the mobile sand in the hinterland of the desert has expanded in a scattered distribution. The overall soil-wind erosion intensity showed a downward trend, especially since 2000; the ecological improvement trend after the implementation of desertification control projects is obvious. Changes in the sand type contributed the most to the reduction of soil-wind erosion intensity (contribution 81.14%), ecological restoration played a key role in reducing the soil-wind erosion intensity (contribution 14.42%), and the increase of forest and grass vegetation covers and agricultural oases played a positive role in solidifying the soil- and wind-proof sand fixation. The pattern of sandy land changes in desert areas is closely related to the national ecological civilization construction policy and the impact of climate change.

TI  - A multisource approach for tidal flat study. Example of the Baie des Veys, Normandy, France
T2  - ZEITSCHRIFT FUR GEOMORPHOLOGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Baie des Veys along the Channel in the north-west of France is a dynamic estuary, with intertidal sandbanks and subtidal channels undergoing constant migration. This relatively small tidal flat (37 km(2)) is easily accessible in the field and allow field observation to be done. This embankment lost about half its surface since two centuries, due to human activities, particularly land reclamation. The main objectives of this study were to map the morphological and geological units of the tidal flats, to evaluate the nature and the distribution of the sediments, to identify the causes of the variations, and then to estimate the long-term sediment balance in the bay and look at its link with the environmental changes. In the Baie des Veys the flood current is higher than the ebb current. The tidal flat is then characterized by tidal wedges linked to the flood, independent from the main channels mainly used during ebb tide. Remote sensing data such as aerial photographs or satellite images offer the advantage of showing aspects of the tidal flat that are not recorded on any standard map. More generally, the role of the tidal range is emphasized, along with the hour of acquisition. A 6 km-long cross-section of the tidal flat is surveyed from 2006 onward. Samples are regularly taken along the profile and their position controlled using a GPS receiver. Carbonates and organic matter content show recent increasing rates which can be related to the extent of the shell fishing. Spartina clumps develop and contribute to trap fine sediments (clays and silts) for more than one century. Since the last land reclamation program (1972), halophytic plants show a significant progression in the upper part of the tidal flat, the so-called schorre, but not in front of the main bank (Ravine Bank) in the central part of the bay. The sedimentary changes induce also deep biological changes, with a modification of the ecosystem. The Baie des Veys faces sea level rise with specific reaction such as the re-opening of a polder to the sea in 1991. This French tidal flat is a good model for studying the link between natural and human activities in a macrotidal bay located in temperate zone.

TI  - Systematic review of head and neck lymphedema assessment
T2  - HEAD AND NECK-JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENCES AND SPECIALTIES OF THE HEAD AND NECK
M3  - Review
AB  - Head and neck lymphedema (HNL) is an increasingly recognized complication of head and neck cancer and its treatment. However, no consensus exists on the "gold-standard" assessment tool for the purposes of diagnosis, classification, or monitoring of HNL. We conducted a systematic review of the literature regarding HNL assessment to determine the optimal method/s of assessment for patients with HNL. A review of publications between January 2000 and September 2021 was undertaken on four electronic databases. Studies were excluded if no clear assessment method of HNL was documented. Sixty-seven articles were included in the study. A wide range of assessment methods for HNL have been reported in the literature. For the purposes of diagnosis and classification of physical findings, computed tomography (CT) appears the most promising tool available for both external and internal HNL. In terms of monitoring, ultrasound appears optimal for external HNL, while a clinician-reported rating scale on laryngoscopy is the gold standard for internal HNL. Patient-reported assessment must be considered alongside objective methods to classify symptom burden and monitor improvement with treatment.

TI  - STAR NDSI collection: a cloud-free MODIS NDSI dataset (2001-2020) for China
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Snow dynamics are crucial in ecosystems, affecting radiation balance, hydrological cycles, biodiversity, and human activities. Snow areas with notably diverse characteristics are extensively distributed in China, mainly including Northern Xinjiang (NX), Northeast China (NC), and the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). Spatiotemporal continuous snow monitoring is indispensable for ecosystem maintenance. Nevertheless, the formidable challenge of cloud obscuration severely impedes data collection. In the past decades, abundant binary snow cover area (SCA) maps have been retrieved from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) datasets. However, the integrated normalized difference snow index (NDSI) maps containing additional details on snow cover extent are still extremely scarce. In this study, a recent 20-year stretch seamless Terra-Aqua MODIS NDSI collection in China is generated using a Spatio-Temporal Adaptive fusion method with erroR correction (STAR), which comprehensively considers spatial and temporal contextual information. Evaluation tests confirm that the cloud-free STAR NDSI collection is superior to the two baseline datasets. The omission error decreased by 10% in NX compared to the snow cover extent product, and the average correlation coefficient increased by 0.11 compared to the global cloud-gap-filled MODIS NDSI product. Consequently, this collection can serve as a basic dataset for hydrological and climatic modeling to explore various critical environmental issues in China. This collection is available from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5644386 (Jing et al., 2021).

TI  - Middle-out ecology: small carnivores as sentinels of global change
T2  - MAMMAL REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Species that respond to ecosystem change in a timely, measurable, and interpretable way can be used as sentinels of global change. Contrary to a pervasive view, we suggest that, among Carnivora, small carnivores are more appropriate sentinels than large carnivores. This reasoning is built around six key points: that, compared to large carnivores, small carnivores 1) are more species-rich and diverse, providing more potential sentinels in many systems; 2) occupy a wider range of ecological niches, exhibiting a greater variety of sensitivities to change; 3) hold an intermediate trophic position that is more directly affected by changes at the producer, primary consumer, and tertiary consumer levels; 4) have shorter life spans and higher reproductive rates, exhibiting more rapid responses to change; 5) have smaller home ranges and are more abundant, making it easier to investigate fine-scale management interventions; 6) are easier to monitor, manage, and manipulate. Therefore, we advocate for incorporating a middle-out approach, in addition to the established top-down and bottom-up approaches, to assessing the responses of ecosystems to global change.

TI  - Shoreline contour, water level elevation and volumetric dataset (1984-2020) for the Gallocanta Lake (NE Spain)
T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Gallocanta is the largest well-preserved saline lake in West-ern Europe, included in the Ramsar List. Associated with its shallow morphology, the lake undergoes strong variations in its water surface extent along time that condition the habitat distribution and the ecological functions. Data on the mor-phology of the lake and its hydrological variations along time may be of paramount ecological importance for the managers of this natural space. Even though its interest for research and management purposes, no accurate and robust dataset of this nature covering large periods of time is available.This dataset presents a multi-decadal mapping with a sub-weekly frequency (2-5 days) of the contour of the Gallocanta Lake (NE Iberian Peninsula) along the period 1984-2020 (1043 dates with information). The shoreline position ap-pears continuously defined with subpixel accuracy from the freely-available images acquired by the satellites Sentinel-2 (sensor MSI) and Landsat 5 (TM), 7 (EMT + ), and 8 (OLI) by applying the extraction system SHOREX. The satellite-derived shorelines allow the definition of the surface of the lake and are combined with a digital elevation model to assign ele-vation values to the points defining each shoreline. This al-lows deducing the mean elevation of the water level and the volumetric changes for those same dates. This data package constitutes a valuable source of information for carrying out robust analyses of the trends of the lake along decades, as well as its response to individual rainfall events.

TI  - The effectiveness of radiofrequency scanning technology in preventing retained surgical items: An integrative review
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Aims and Objectives To synthesise evidence on the effectiveness of radiofrequency (RF) scanning technology as an adjunct to manual counting protocols in preventing retained surgical items (RSIs) in the operating room. Background Despite the implementation of rigorous manual counting protocols, RSIs remain one of the most common reported sentinel events in operating theatres that lead to adverse patient outcomes. Design An integrative review. Methods This review was guided by the framework. A literature search using CINAHL, MEDLINE, ProQuest, PubMed, and Scopus with key search terms related to RSIs and RF was applied to select English articles from January 2011 till August 2021. The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist was utilised for study quality assessment while reporting of review was guided using the PRISMA checklist. Results A total of 15 peer-reviewed articles were included, enabling the knowledge on the RF scanning technology to be grouped into four themes, namely: detection accuracy of RF scanning technology, real-time detection of surgical items using RF identification, the impact of the RF scanning technology for detecting RSIs on patient safety, and cost-analysis of integrating the RF scanning technology in operating theatres. Conclusion Radiofrequency scanning technology is effective in preventing RSIs with significant cost-savings. Perioperative leaders should develop a multidisciplinary process to evaluate and select the most appropriate RF scanning technology as part of their patient safety programs. However, future studies with a larger sample size and robust research design, such as randomised controlled trial, should be considered to enhance the generalisability and rigour of evidence. Relevance to Clinical Practice This review contributes to perioperative personnel's education/training of staff on using RF scanning technology to prevent RSIs. The cost-effectiveness analysis enables the healthcare leaders to decide on the selection of appropriate RF technology.

TI  - THE IMPACT OF DIFFERENT IRRIGATION INTERVALS AND LEVELS ON YIELD AND QUALITY OF DRIP-IRRIGATED CORN SILAGE<i> (ZEA</i><i> MAYS</i> L.) UNDER ARID CLIMATE
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Soil moisture availability exerts significant impacts on the yield and productivity of crop plants. Moisture availability becomes more critical in arid climates, as irrigation is the single source to fulfill the moisture requirements of the plants. Therefore, the level of applied irrigation water and time interval between two irrigations significantly alter the yield and quality of produce. This two-year study determined the effects of different irrigation levels and intervals on yield, quality and water use efficiency of silage maize. The experiment was laid out according to randomized complete block design with split plot arrangements. The main plots consisted of irrigation intervals (3 and 6 days), whereas sub-plots included four irrigation levels (125%, 100%, 75% and 50% of Class-A pan evaporation) based on class A pan evaporation. Drip irrigation method was used to supply the required amount of the water according to the treatments. The annual water consumption rate (ETc) varied between 397 and 725 mm, and between 402 and 759 mm in different study years. The silage yield (FY) during the first year ranged between 36.44 and 81.69 t ha-1, and between 38.31 and 78.96 t ha-1 during the second year. The FY was significantly altered by different irrigation intervals (p < 0.05) and irrigation levels (p < 0.01). The dry matter ratio (DMR) (a yield component) was not altered by irrigation intervals and irrigation levels. However, the other yield components such as amount of dry matter yield (DMY) and plant height were significantly (p < 0.01) affected by irrigation levels. Crude protein (CP) content significantly differed (p < 0.05) among irrigation intervals and irrigation levels (p < 0.01). However, the remaining quality parameters, i.e., acid detergent fiber (ADF), neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and crude fiber were only affected by irrigation levels. The pH remained unaffected by irrigation levels and intervals. Leaf area index (LAI) gradually increased after sowing and reached to the highest values at 70-80 days after sowing. Water productivity (WP) and irrigation water productivity (IWP) did not differ among applied irrigation levels and irrigation intervals. It is concluded that frequent irrigations increased silage yield of corn with drip irrigation under arid climatic conditions. However, low water application during the whole growing season caused significant decreases in silage yield.

TI  - Study on the influencing factors and the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of Urban Heat Island effect in Nanchang City of China
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN ARCHITECTURE AND BUILDING ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although some researchers have explored spatiotemporal characteristics of the land surface temperature (LST) and analyzed how the influencing factors impact the LST, the comprehensive influencing factors and specific spatial relationships that explore the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect from long time scale have rarely received widespread attention. Taking Nanchang as an example, this paper first uses Landsat data to retrieve the LST in years 2000, 2010, and 2019. Then, the Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) model is utilized to investigate the various influencing factors. The results showed as follows: (1) The UHI effect was intensified in the past 20 years in Nanchang City. From 2000 to 2019, the "heat island" increased from 63.06% to 64.07%, while the "green island" decreased from 36.94% to 35.93%. (2) The spatiotemporal anisotropy of the UHI effect was significant. (3) The GWR model could better reveal the spatial heterogeneity of the factors affecting the UHI effects. The relationship between Soil Brightness Index (NDSI), Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), and Night-lighting (NL) and the relative UHI effect intensity had significant spatial non-stationarity. This study can provide some references from reasonable urban planning to alleviate the urban heat island.

TI  - Multi-dimensional and long-term time series monitoring and early warning of landslide hazard with improved cross-platform SAR offset tracking method
T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-TECHNOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-dimensional, long-term time series displacement monitoring is crucial for generating early warnings for active landslides and for mitigating geohazards. The synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry method has been widely applied to achieve small-gradient landslide displacement monitoring; however, measuring the landslide displacement with a steep gradient has posed certain challenges. In comparison, the SAR offset tracking method is a powerful tool for mapping large-gradient landslide displacement in both the slant-range and azimuth directions. Nevertheless, there are some limitations in the existing SAR offset tracking approaches: (i) the measurement accuracy is greatly reduced by the extreme topography relief in high mountain areas, (ii) a fixed matching window from expert experience is usually adopted in the calculation of cross-correlation, (iii) estimating the long-term displacements between the SAR images from cross-platforms and with longer spatiotemporal baselines is a challenging task, and (iv) it is difficult to calculate the three-dimensional (3D) landslide displacements using a single SAR dataset. Additionally, only a few studies have focused on how to realize early warning of landslide deformation using SAR measurements. To address these issues, this paper presents an improved cross-platform SAR offset tracking method, which can not only estimate high-precision landslide displacements in two and three dimensions but also calculate long-term time series displacements over a decade using cross-platform SAR offset tracking measurements. Initially, we optimize the traditional SAR offset tracking workflow to estimate high-precision ground displacements, in which three improvements are highlighted: (i) an "ortho-rectification" operation is applied to restrain the effect of topography relief, (ii) an "adaptive matching window" is adopted in the cross-correlation computation, and (iii) a new strategy is proposed to combine all the possible offset pairs and optimally design the displacement inversion network based on the "optimization theory" of geodetic inversion. Next, robust mathematical equations are built to estimate the two-dimensional (2D) and 3D long-term time series landslide displacements using cross-platform SAR observations. The M-estimator is introduced into the 2D displacement inversion equation to restrain the outliers, and the total least squares criterion is adopted to estimate the 3D displacements considering the random errors in both the design matrix and observations. We take the Laojingbian landslide, Wudongde Reservoir Area (China), as an example to demonstrate the proposed method using ALOS/PALSAR-1 and ALOS/PALSAR-2 images. The results reveal that the proposed method significantly outperforms traditional methods. We also retrieve the movement direction of each pixel of the Laojingbian landslide using the proposed method, thus allowing us to understand the fine-scale landslide kinematics. Finally, we capture and analyze the acceleration characteristics of the landslide, perform an early warning of hazard, and forecast the future displacement evolution based on the 3D displacement time series coupled with the physical models of the rocks.

TI  - Structural-optimized sequential deep learning methods for surface soil moisture forecasting, case study Quebec, Canada
T2  - NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface soil moisture (M-SS) is a key factor governing environmental interactions in any catchment. Energy flux between soil and atmosphere, soil temperature, and heat diffusion in soil are examples of impressible interactions. Consequently, the agriculture sector and its many dependent industries are influenced by this element. Hence, investigating new optimized preprocessing and input selection methods for processing, interpretation, modeling, and prediction of M-SS is necessary to ensure sustainable agriculture. To this end, satellite products were studied for the province of Quebec, Canada. Two overall deep learning (DL) approaches are proposed in this study. The first and most efficient one is extracting meaningful modeling parameters by the time-series structural-analysis-based method, and the second one is using the combination of optimization algorithms and the DL method. The structure of the extracted time series from satellite data was assessed by several tests and an intense periodic pattern was detected. Therefore, additive Holt-Winter's (S-HW), seasonal standardization (S-std), and spectral analysis (S-A) were chosen as preprocessing methods for the structural analysis preprocessing. The long short-term memory (LSTM) model was utilized for short-term forecasting of un-preprocessed and preprocessed M-SS datasets. Along with structural-analysis-based methodology, genetic and teacher-learner-based algorithms (GA and T(L)A) were coupled with LSTM to assess the coupled models' performance for M-SS forecasting for the first time. Based on the structural analysis of data, limited hidden states (h(t)) were selected for modeling {1, 2, 7, 9, 52}: network training and forecasts were undertaken according to these hidden states. Since the long-term characteristics of the time series like trend and level are not significant in short-term modeling, the LSTM (S-std, 9), correlation coefficient (R) = 0.970, root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 1.339 outperformed other models, followed closely by LSTM (S-HW, 1), R = 0.922, RMSE = 1.958. Conversely, for long-term forecast, as these attributes impact the structure, LSTM (S-HW, 2), R = 0.922, RMSE = 0.1961 was more successful in the prediction of patterns and fluctuations, followed by LSTM (S-std, 52), R = 0.920, RMSE = 2.064, which was more complicated than the model developed for short-term modeling. GA-LSTM (h(t) = 32, R = 0.930, RMSE = 1.852) and T(L)A-LSTM (h(t) = 37, R = 0.934, RMSE = 1.781) also enhanced the long-term forecasting results. Integration of these two optimization methods had two benefits. First, due to the stochastic nature of optimization algorithms and DL methods, the search space for the optimized parameter (h(t)) was greatly increased and many possibilities were investigated. Second, the LSTM could perform a long-term forecast of the M-SS without preprocessing, which was not possible by structural analysis. On the other hand, these methods were much computationally expensive and the combination of their controlling parameters with other controlling parameters of LSTM created numerous possibilities. However, as TLA is parameter free and much less sophisticated than GA, it is a more computational-effective method, and subsequently a better option than GA.

TI  - Quantitative valuation of green roofs? cooling effects under different urban spatial forms in high-density urban areas
T2  - BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of global climate change, the increasing urban heat island (UHI) effect is a serious challenge to sustainable urban development. The construction of green roofs is an important means to optimize the urban thermal environment, especially in high-density urban areas. However, the cooling effect of green roofs in different urban spatial forms varies. Thus, the quantitative evaluation of the cooling effect of green roofs is significant for the scientific and effective mitigation of the UHI effect. This study took the central district of Chengdu City as a typical area, clearly classified urban spatial form types based on the LCZ theory, and quantified the relative land surface temperature (RLST) difference between before (2014) and after (2018) the implementation of green roofs based on Landsat 8 remote sensing image retrieval. Numerical analysis methods were used to statistically evaluate the cooling effect of green roofs under different urban spatial form types by GIS. The results showed that (1) the cooling effect of green roofs varied significantly among different urban spatial form types; (2) the best performance of the cooling effect of green roofs was in Compact Highrise (LCZ1), which could reduce RLST by 0.94 degrees C, while the worst was in Lightweight Lowrise (LCZ7). Based on the above performance of the cooling effect of green roofs, the construction of green roofs can be prioritized and zoned, and the design strategies of green roofs under different urban spatial form types can be proposed. Our study will provide a basis for developing design guidance for green roofs and scientific support for mitigating the urban thermal environment.

TI  - To spray or target mosquitoes another way: focused entomological intelligence guides the implementation of indoor residual spraying in southern Mozambique
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: To eliminate malaria in southern Mozambique, the National Malaria Control Programme and its partners are scaling up indoor residual spraying (IRS) activities in two provinces, Gaza and Inhambane. An entomological surveillance planning tool (ESPT) was used to answer the programmatic question of whether IRS would be effective in target geographies, given limited information on local vector bionomics.Methods: Entomological intelligence was collected in six sentinel sites at the end of the rainy season (April-May 2018) and the beginning of the dry season (June-July 2018). The primary objective was to provide an 'entomological snapshot' by collecting question-based, timely and high-quality data within one single week in each location. Host-seeking behaviour (both indoors and outdoors) was monitored by human-baited tent traps. Indoor resting behaviour was quantified by pyrethrum spray catches and window exit traps.Results: Five different species or species groups were identified: Anopheles funestus sensu lato (s.l.) (66.0%), Anopheles gambiae s.l. (14.0%), Anopheles pharoensis (1.4%), Anopheles tenebrosus (14.1%) and Anopheles ziemanni (4.5%). Anopheles funestus sensu stricto (s.s.) was the major vector among its sibling species, and 1.9% were positive for Plasmodium falciparum infections. Anopheles arabiensis was the most abundant vector species within the An. gambiae complex, but none tested positive for P. falciparum infections. Some An. tenebrosus were positive for P. falciparum (1.3%). When evaluating behaviours that impact IRS efficacy, i.e. endophily, the known primary vector An. funestus s.s., was found to rest indoors-demonstrating at least part of its population will be impacted by the intervention if insecticides are selected to which this vector is susceptible. However, other vector species, including An. gambiae s.l., An. tenebrosus, An. pharoensis and An. ziemanni, showed exophilic and exophagic behaviours in several of the districts surveilled.Conclusion: The targeted approach to entomological surveillance was successful in collecting question-based entomological intelligence to inform decision-making about the use of IRS in specific districts. Endophilic An. funestus s.s. was documented as being the most prevalent and primary malaria vector suggesting that IRS can reduce malaria transmission, but the presence of other vector species both indoors and outdoors suggests that alternative vector control interventions that target these gaps in protection may increase the impact of vector control in southern Mozambique.

TI  - Monitoring deforestation in Jordan using deep semantic segmentation with satellite imagery
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Jordan is witnessing major transformations in its environmental and topographic features, where the desert dominates a large part of the territory, with very limited forest areas. Over the last three decades, Jordan has lost about a third of its natural forests at an annual rate of 1.6%. In this study, we develop a deep learning model to automatically monitor deforestation in Jordan based on the semantic segmentation of multitemporal Landsat-8 satellite images. Very few studies and datasets are devoted to monitoring forest cover changes using semantic image segmentation with deep neural networks. Therefore, we have collected a new benchmarking dataset of Jordanian forests between 2010 and 2020. The proposed model includes an efficient encoder-decoder archi-tecture, with which we can extract a set of discriminating features that semantically assign every key image pixel into either forest or non-forest classes. The deep architecture is first initialised by a CNN-based pre-trained model and then it is fine-tuned on the forest images through an effective transfer learning procedure to improve its generalisation ability. Then, a set of key features are extracted by encoding each forest image into low -dimensional semantic maps to formulate the generic descriptors used in image segmentation. Finally, the output of the segmentation process is used to detect any dissimilarity in the forest area or boundaries using an absolute pixel-pixel similarity check over many years. The experimental results proved the effectiveness of the proposed model in segmenting the forest images and predicting any loss (deforestation) or gain (reforestation), and the model achieved an accuracy of 94.8% and MIoU of 82.1%. Moreover, the deep semantic features are discriminative enough to efficiently identify and estimate the amount of deforestation change in terms of ac-curacy and computational resources.

TI  - Retrieval of Turbidity and TDS of Deepor Beel Lake from Landsat 8 OLI Data by Regression and Artificial Neural Network
T2  - WATER CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) surface reflectance data corrected for sun angle was used to construct regression and artificial neural network (ANN) models of three parameters of pH, turbidity, and total dissolved solids (TDS) in Deepor Beel, Guwahati, India, where the water quality of the lake had shown a decline in recent past. The dates of collection of the field data and the satellite overpass were very near so as to preserve the temporal association between the two datasets. In the process, data collected from forty-five points were used as a training dataset to build the models. Another twenty points in the lake were used for testing the models. Regression models for turbidity and TDS showed a good R-2 fit while the same for pH behaved poorly. The results were also checked for mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) for the predicted dataset and found to exhibit errors within an acceptable range. Furthermore, ANN models showed better performance than the regression models. Thus, it was concluded that Landsat 8 OLI was useful in retrieving turbidity and TDS in the lake's condition. The method had the scope to be used for continuous monitoring of the lake's waters in the near future.

TI  - Distinctive roles of two- and three-dimensional urban structures in surface urban heat islands over the conterminous United States
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we investigated how seasonal and diurnal surface urban heat islands (SUHIs) vary with two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) urban structure parameters (USPs) and climate settings. Additionally, whether and how 2D and 3D USPs influenced the seasonal hysteresis between SUHIs and background temperatures were explored using remote sensing for 203 cities over the conterminous US. Results show that urban areas with high impervious surface coverage (70%) were "colder" in summer than surrounding rural areas in dry climates. Moreover, the cooling efficiency of vegetation in dry climates was about two times higher than that in wet climates. A hump-shaped relation between sky view factor (SVF) and SUHIs was observed; in regions with low SVF (e.g., SVF < 0.4), the increasing trends of summer diurnal SUHIs with increasing SVF in dry climates attained higher values than those in wet climates. Seasonal hysteresis between background temperatures and SUHIs was largely controlled by 2D and 3D USPs. Urban USPs and climate settings can regulate the timing of peaks and nadirs of annual SUHIs, suggesting that their regulation would benefit SUHI mitigation. Future studies are required to test USP-LST relationships further by using the local climate zone approach under different climatic conditions.

TI  - Properties of aerosol and surface derived from OLCI/Sentinel-3A using GRASP approach: Retrieval development and preliminary validation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) onboard the Copernicus Sentinel-3A satellite is a medium-resolution and multi-spectral push-broom imager acquiring radiance in 21 spectral bands covering from the visible to the far near-infrared. These measurements are primary dedicated to land & ocean color applications, but actually include also reliable information for atmospheric aerosol and surface brightness characterization. In the framework of the EUMETSAT funded study to support the Copernicus Program, we describe the retrieval of aerosol and surface properties from OLCI single-viewing multi-spectral Top-Of-Atmosphere (TOA) radiances based on the Generalized Retrieval of Atmosphere and Surface Properties (GRASP) algorithm. The high potential of the OLCI/GRASP configuration stems from the attempt to retrieve both aerosol load and surface reflectance simultaneously using a globally consistent high-level approach. For example, both over land and ocean surfaces OLCI/GRASP uses 9 spectral channels (albeit with different weights), strictly the same prescribed aerosol models and globally the same a priori constraints (though with some differences for observations over land and ocean). Due to the lack of angular multi-viewing information, the directional properties of underlying surface are strongly constrained in the retrieval: over ocean the Fresnel reflection together with foam/whitecap albedo are exclusively computed using a priori wind speed; over land, the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) is slightly adjusted from a priori values of climatological Ross-Li volumetric and geometric terms. Meanwhile, the isotropic reflectance is retrieved globally under mild spectral smoothness constraints. It should be noticed that OLCI/GRASP configuration employs innovative multi-pixel concept (Dubovik et al., 2011) that enhance retrieval by simultaneously inverting large group of pixels. The concept allows for benefiting from knowledge about natural variability of the retrieved parameters. The obtained OLCI/GRASP products were validated with the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) and Maritime Aerosol Network (MAN) and intercompared with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol and surface products. The overall performance is quite comparable to the community -referenced MODIS. Over ocean the OLCI/GRASP results are encouraging with 67% of the AOD (550 nm) satisfying the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) requirement using AERONET coastal sites and 74% using MAN deep ocean measurements, and an AOD (550 nm) bias 0.01 with AERONET and nearly zero bias with MAN. Over land, 48% of OLCI/GRASP AOD (550 nm) satisfy the GCOS requirement and a bias within +/- 0.01 for total and AOD < 0.2. Key challenges are identified and discussed: adequate screening of cloud contaminations, retrieval of aerosol over bright surfaces and in the regions containing complex mixtures of aerosol.

TI  - Influence of drought duration and severity on drought recovery period for different land cover types: evaluation using MODIS-based indices
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a slow-onset phenomenon driven by the lack of precipitation, affecting the performance of plants and functionality of terrestrial ecosystems. In addition to the length and severity of drought, the period it takes for the plants to return to normal conditions is critical. Remote sensing data with appropriate spatial and temporal coverage facilitates monitoring drought and its consequences on local and global scales. This study investigated the influence of drought duration and severity on the drought recovery period (DRP) for different land use and land cover (LULC) types in Iran. The moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based vegetation health index (VHI) was used to monitor drought in the period 2000-2020. The results identified 2000, 2001, and 2008 as drought years. DRP was estimated using gross primary productivity (GPP). The findings revealed that shrubland and cropland experienced more prolonged droughts than forests, which experienced the shortest drought duration. Similarly, shrublands and croplands had the most prolonged recovery, and forests had the shortest recovery time. A direct relationship was observed between drought severity and DRP in all LULC types, however the local correlation between drought duration and recovery time better revealed the heterogeneity of relationships. This study provides valuable information on the drought resilience of different LULC types for use in achieving better management and a deeper understanding of drought.

TI  - Tropical cyclones moving into boreal forests: Relationships between disturbance areas and environmental drivers
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical cyclones (TCs) are common disturbance agents in tropical and subtropical latitudes. With global warming, TCs began to move to northern latitudes, with devastating effects on boreal forests. However, it remains unclear where and when these extraordinary events occur and how they affect forest structure and ecosystem functioning. Hence knowing which geomorphological features, landforms, and forest types are most susceptible to severe wind dis-turbance is vital to better predict the future impacts of intensifying tropical cyclones on boreal forests. In October 2015, catastrophic TC Dujuan hit the island of Sakhalin in the Russian Far East. With a wind speed of 63 mmiddots(-1), it became the strongest wind recorded in Sakhalin, damaging > 42,000 ha of native forests with different levels of severity. We used high-resolution RGB satellite images, DEM-derived geomorphological patterns, and the U-Net-like convolutional neural network to quantify the damaged area in specific landform, forest type, and windthrow patch size categories. We found that large gaps (> 1 ha) represent > 40 % of the damaged area while small gaps (< 0.1 ha) only 20 %. The re-corded canopy gaps are very large for the southern boreal forest. We found that the aspect (slope exposure) is the most important in explaining the damaged area, followed by canopy closure and landform type. Closed-canopy coniferous forests on steep, west-facing slopes (typical of convex reliefs such as ridges, spurs, and peaks) are at a much higher risk of being disturbed by TCs than open-canopy mountain birch forests or coniferous forests and broadleaved riparian forests in concave reliefs such as valley bottoms. We suggest that the projected ongoing poleward migration of TCs will lead to an unprecedentedly large area of disturbed forest, which results in complex changes in forest dynamics and ecosystem functioning. Our findings are crucial for the development of mitigation and adaptation strategies under future changes in TC activity.

TI  - Snow depth and snow cover over the Tibetan Plateau observed from space in against ERA5: matters of scale
T2  - CLIMATE DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - There has been a statement that the satellite and reanalyses significantly overestimate snow depths (SDs) as compared with in-situ observations over the Tibetan Plateau (TP). The inconsistency may be partly due to representations related to different spatial resolutions. To further clarify matters of scale, this work estimates and compares the fractional snow cover (FSC) from MODIS (500 m), SDs from Sentinel-1 C-band SAR (1 km), ERA5-Land (9 km) and ERA5 (31 km), together with ground observations from GHCN-D and at 6 newly-established stations in the Namco watershed. SD and FSC from MERRA-2 (50 km) are also discussed in comparison with ERA5s. Results indicate that SD from fine resolution reanalysis has better consistency to in-situ observations over the TP. SD of ERA5-Land matches in-situ measurements better than ERA5 and MERRA-2. Overestimates of SDs in reanalyses are likely for shallow snowpack. However, underestimates are found for deep snow particularly late in the snow season. Improvements are displayed in ERA5-Land, while increased SD is attributed by altitude in fine resolution. Overall SDs of ERA5 and ERA5-Land have similar spatial distributions and annual cycle patterns over the TP, consistent with satellite-based datasets. A notable defect of ERA5s is related to delayed ablation of deep snowpack during spring and early summer. It causes cold temperature biases at surface that may impact on the land-atmosphere interaction. Snow analysis that combines the information of FSC into SD has been demonstrated in MERRA-2 data. Snow analysis has the potential to improve SDs of ERA5s over the TP.

T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite progress in the last decade on periglacial geomorphology and permafrost research in Antarctica, many areas in Maritime Antarctica remain unsurveyed. This study aimed to identify and describe the main periglacial landforms of President Head Peninsula, at Snow Island, Maritime Antarctica, with emphasis on the relationships between soils, landforms and lithology. We identified and mapped landforms and their physiographic aspects at 1:15,000 scale using Sentinel-2 satellite image (10 m spatial resolution) and georeferenced using portable GPS. Morphological, physical, chemical, micromorphological and mineralogical properties of selected soils were also analyzed. Seventeen types of landforms were mapped (glacial, glaciofluvial, tectonics and structural, periglacial, and marine landforms), whose complexity of geomorphic features is explained by the diversity of morphogenetic processes and lithological diversity. Three distinct geomorphological domains were identified (proglacial, par-aglacial, and periglacial). The paraglacial domain is more dynamic and presents immature or poorly developed soils. The periglacial domain has many rocky outcrops, interspersed with Holocene beaches and vegetated marine terraces. Landforms associated with gelifluction, patterned ground and permafrost were only observed on the upper plateaus of the periglacial domain. No soil formation were observed in the proglacial domain.

TI  - Evaluation of Axillary Lymph Node Marking with Magseed® before and after Neoadjuvant Systemic Therapy in Breast Cancer Patients: MAGNET Study
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Due to the high false negative rate (FNR) associated with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) after neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NAST), the standard surgical treatment for patients with an initially positive axilla and indicated for NAST is axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). To avoid unnecessary ALND, this multicenter, prospective, observational study aimed to determine the effectiveness and ease of using magnetic seeds (Magseed (R)) for targeted axillary dissection (TAD) when the seeds are placed before or after NAST. Materials and Methods. We recruited 81 patients diagnosed with T1-T3 breast cancer, with clinically/radiologically positive nodal involvement (cN1, 75 patients with 1-3 nodes suspected nodes and 6 patients with up to 4 suspected nodes) prior to NAST. Positive nodes detected by fine-needle aspiration biopsy or core needle biopsy were marked with a stainless steel marker coil and after NAST with Magseed (R) prior to surgery (Post-NAST group), or directly with Magseed (R) before NAST (Pre-NAST group). The correlation between lymph nodes marked with Magseed (R) (MLNs) and sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) was calculated based on pathologic assessment with the OSNA assay (Sysmex Corporation, Kobe) or conventional sectioning and staining techniques according to the standard protocols of each center. Results. All magnetic seeds were successfully identified and retrieved in just over 10 minutes of surgery, guided by the Sentimag (R) magnetometer system. The overall concordance rate between MLNs and SLNs was 81.5%, and the concordance between MLNs and SLNs with metastasis was 93.8%. Metastasis was detected in 54.3% of the MLNs compared with 48.1% of SLNs. In cases that presented negative MLN and negative SLN (negative TAD), the FNR was 0%. No significant differences were found between the Post-NAST and Pre-NAST groups. Conclusions. Our results validate the use of Magseed (R) for long-term marking of axillary lymph nodes and show that when used in combination with SLNB for TAD, a FNR of 0% can be achieved, avoiding unnecessary ALND.

TI  - The utility of forest attribute maps for automated Avalanche Terrain Exposure Scale (ATES) modelling
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The number of people affected by snow avalanches during recreational activities has increased over the recent years. An instrument to reduce these numbers are improved terrain classification systems. One such system is the Avalanche Terrain Exposure Scale (ATES). Forests can provide some protection from avalanches, and information on forest attributes can be incorporated into avalanche hazard models such as the automated ATES model (AutoATES). The objectives of this study were to (i) map forest stem density and canopy-cover based on National Forest Inventory and remote sensing data and, (ii) use these forest attributes as input to the AutoATES model. We predicted stem density and directly calculated canopy-cover in a 20 Mha study area in Norway. The forest attributes were mapped for 16 m x 16 m pixels, which were used as input for the AutoATES model. The uncertainties of the stem number and canopy-cover maps were 30% and 31%, respectively. The overall classification accuracy of 52 ski-touring routes in Western Norway with a total length of 282 km increased from 55% in the model without forest information to 67% when utilizing canopy cover. The F1 score for the three predicted ATES classes improved by 31%, 9%, and 6%.

TI  - Exploring the potential of multispectral satellite images for estimating the contents of cadmium and lead in cropland: The effect of the dimidiate pixel model and random forest
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid and accurate predictions of heavy metal contents in farmland are of great significance to ensure the safety of agricultural products and maintain ecosystem balance. Combining multispectral images and chemometric modeling provides a feasible means of estimating cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) contents in farmland. We collected 640 samples from the surface soils of farmland in Xiangzhou District, Hubei Province, China. The Cd, Pb, soil organic matter (SOM), pH, and Fe of the soil samples were measured in a laboratory. In this study, the dimidiate pixel model was used to process remote sensing images. In particular, we used random forest (RF) to screen the best spectral indices for use as input variables. Partial least squares regression (PLSR), backward propagation neural network (BPNN), and RF were used to calibrate the spectral data with Cd and Pb contents, and the optimal model was used for the regional mapping of soil Cd and Pb contents. Additionally, we explored the potential of using spectral estimation mechanisms to estimate Cd and Pb contents. The mechanism for estimating Cd and Pb contents with multispectral images depended mainly on the covariance of Cd and Pb contents with that of SOM. For both Cd and Pb estimations, the double-date image estimation model performed better than the single-date image estimation model, and the unmixed image estimation model was more accurate than the original image estimation model. Overall, the estimation model using the best spectral indices as input variables performed better than the model using full-band data as input variables. The RF model outperformed the PLSR and BPNN models in all cases. Relatively satisfactory estimates of Cd and Pb contents in farmland of the study area (maximum R-val(2) (determination coefficient of the validation set) = 0.60 for Cd and R-val(2) = 0.63 for Pb) were obtained. Our results show that areas of farmland contaminated by Cd and Pb throughout the study area have increased and that contamination levels have worsened since 1990. In addition, the spatial patterns of Cd and Pb contents in farmland throughout the study area were analyzed and validated using field survey results. The results of the study provide a theoretical basis and methodological reference for the rapid prediction of Cd and Pb contents in regional farmland.

TI  - Pattern performance of active phased array antenna for Gaofen-3 satellite
T2  - ALEXANDRIA ENGINEERING JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The phased array antenna is one of the critical components of the space-borne SAR sys-tem and plays a key role in the quality of images. This paper focuses on the design of active phased array antenna for Gaofen-3 satellite, including its architecture, system design methods, key hard-ware, and the performance for the design implementation. The proposed phased array antenna have capabilities of beam broadening and scanning, left and right side look, polarization switching, in -orbit calibration, uploading beam-steering correction data, collecting self-checking information, and self-protection caused by over pulse width or duty cycle. The phased array antenna is mainly consisted of dual-polarized slotted waveguide antennas, TR modules, time-delay and amplifier modules and power distribution networks. Moreover, the solutions of the direct problem and inverse problem for accurately predicting the pattern and determining the states of TR modules for the required beam have been proposed. The obtained results can confirm that the cross -polarization level of both polarizations for the phased antenna array is below-35 dB. By employ-ing the proposed antenna model, the beam steering error and dispersion error between the predicted and the measured beams in the range plane are less than 4% (100% probability) and less than 2% (95% probability). For beam steering in the azimuth plane, the beam steering error is less than 2% (90% probability), and less than 4% (100% probability). The ground and on-orbit test results have indicated that the functions and performance of the antenna meet the requirements of the SAR system.(c) 2022 THE AUTHORS.

TI  - Long-term water clarity patterns of lakes across China using Landsat series imagery from 1985 to 2020
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the water clarity of lakes is essential for the sustainable development of human society. However, existing water clarity assessments in China have mostly focused on lakes with areas > 1 km(2), and the monitoring periods were mainly in the 21st century. In order to improve the understanding of spatiotemporal variations in lake clarity across China, based on the Google Earth Engine cloud platform, a 30 m long-term LAke Water Secchi depth (SD) dataset (LAWSD30) of China (1985-2020) was first developed using Landsat series imagery and a robust water-color parameter-based SD model. The LAWSD30 dataset exhibited a good performance compared to concurrent in situ SD datasets, with an R-2 of 0.86 and a root mean square error of 0.225 m. Then, based on our LAWSD30 dataset, long-term spatiotemporal variations in SD for lakes > 0.01 km(2) (N = 40 973) across China were evaluated. The results show that the SD of lakes with areas <= 1 km(2) exhibited a significant downward trend in the period of 1985-2020, but the decline rate began to slow down and stabilized after 2001. In addition, the SD of lakes with an area > 1 km(2) showed a significant downward trend before 2001, and began to increase significantly afterwards. Moreover, in terms of the spatial patterns, the proportion of small lakes (area <= 1 km(2)) showing a decreasing SD trend was the largest in the Mongolian-Xinjiang Plateau Region (MXR) (about 30.0 %), and the smallest in the Eastern Plain Region (EPR) (2.6 %). In contrast, for lakes > 1 km(2) , this proportion was the highest in MXR (about 23.0 %), and the lowest in the Northeast Mountain Plain Region (NER) (16.1 %). The LAWSD30 dataset and the spatiotemporal patterns of lake water clarity in our research can provide effective guidance for the protection and management of lake environment in China.

TI  - Stability in time and consistency between atmospheric corrections: Assessing the reliability of Sentinel-2 products for biodiversity monitoring in tropical forests
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth observation satellite imagery is increasingly accessible, and has become a key component for vegetation mapping and monitoring. Sentinel-2 satellites acquire optical images with five days' revisit frequency, which is an important feature to increase the probability of acquisition with reasonable cloud cover in tropical regions. Regular and reliable satellite observations open perspectives for the monitoring of vegetation properties and biodiversity. Atmospheric correction methods (ACMs) producing bottom-of-atmosphere (BOA) reflectance are critical to ensure temporal consistency of higher-level products and optimal sensitivity to changes in vegetation properties. Still their application in tropical regions remains challenging due to complex atmospheric issues. This study aims at performing ACM inter-comparison in the context of tropical forest monitoring. We produced BOA reflectance for a set of Sentinel-2 acquisitions corresponding to a forested area in Cameroon, using four atmo-spheric correction methods: Sen2cor, MAJA, Overland and LaSRC. We selected five successive acquisitions with moderate to no cloud cover, and computed a set of spectral indices and spectral diversity metrics in order to compare the consistency of these products through time, under the hypothesis that they should remain stable over a short period. We also assessed the agreement between atmospheric correction methods. Two spatial ex-tents were used for the computation of spectral diversity metrics to assess the robustness of the data-driven processes applied to compute spectral diversity. We found that the choice of an ACM did have a significant impact on BOA reflectance and higher-level products. In the visible domain, Overland and LaSRC produced consistent BOA reflectance values, while MAJA and Sen2Cor showed strong variability which could not be explained by changes in surface properties. This directly influenced the temporal consistency of NDVI. Yet, the influence on the temporal consistency for EVI and NDWI was moderate. Spectral diversity metrics were consistent through time for all methods, but to a lesser degree than vegetation indices. When comparing the mean values over the period considered, vegetation indices were stable across methods, but not diversity metrics. Spatial context changes had an impact on the Shannon index, but not on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity. These results suggest that the choice of ACM has major potential implications for tropical forest monitoring.

TI  - Plastic hinge regions of prefabricated concrete columns with grouted sleeves and simplified calculation method for plastic hinge length
T2  - STRUCTURES
M3  - Article
AB  - To design prefabricated concrete columns with grouted sleeves (PCC-GSs), the development and damage process of the plastic hinge (PH) regions for the PCC-GSs need to be clarified. In this study, a finite element analysis (FEA) method for the PCC-GSs was verified through experimental results, including the failure modes, load-displacement responses, and physical plastic hinge lengths (PHLs). Consequently, a series of finite element models (FEMs) were constructed. The effects of parameters such as grouted sleeve (GS) height, axial force ratio, and shear span ratio on the PHL for the PCC-GSs were systematically analysed under cyclic loading. Finally, with the discussion of the existing empirical models for the equivalent PHL (Lp), a simplified calculation model of Lp for PCC-GSs was proposed and evaluated. The results indicate the following. (1) The PH of PCC-GSs may move up or down, and its PH development mode is significantly different from that of the CIP RC column. (2) The axial force ratio n, shear span ratio z/d, longitudinal reinforcement ratio rho s, rebar yield strength fy, and GS height LGS all have a significant influence on the PH region of PCC-GSs, especially LGS. (3) The proposed model is more suitable to calculate the PHL for PCC-GSs with considering the effects of LGS, n, z/d, rho s, fy.

TI  - Monitoring landscape fragmentation and aboveground biomass estimation in Can Gio Mangrove Biosphere Reserve over the past 20 years
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past 20 years, the mangrove landscape of Can Gio Mangrove Biosphere Reserve (MBR) has undergone drastic changes in space and time. However, we know very little about changes in mangrove landscape model characteristics from analysis of different aspects based on landscape fragmentation. In the present study, the temporal and spatial changes of landscape pattern of land use/land cover (LULC) over the past 20 years in Can Gio Mangrove Biosphere Reserve (MBR), southern Vietnam were analyzed based on remote sensing data, with high classification accuracy (overall accuracy >85%, Kappa >0.8). The present study selected representative landscape indexes and built an integrated landscape index to examine the spatial-temporal changes of landscape patterns. Overall, over the past 20 years, the degree of fragmentation has gradually increased, mainly occurring in the transition zone of MBR. These changes are intended to reflect the significant temporal variation of the MBR, where the ecosystem is strongly disturbed by the intensity of human activities. We then investigate the effectiveness of principal component analysis (PCA)-based machine learning techniques in estimating the mangrove AGB, and applying landscape indices to assess impacts in Can Gio MBR. It reveals that the ANN model obtained the highest prediction accuracy (R2train = 0.785), followed by GPR (R2train = 0.703), and SVM (R2train = 0.671). As a result of applying the ANN model, the predicted mangrove AGB in 2000 and 2020 in the study site ranged from 6.531 to 368.163 Mg ha- 1, and 13.749 to 320.295 Mg ha- 1, respectively. These results support the application of the model as a tool to support LULC management and protection in the study site, and to contribute insights into the future mangrove research in other regions of the world.

TI  - An assessment of China's industrial emission characteristics using satellite observations of XCO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, and NO<sub>2</sub>
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - An effective assessment of industrial emission characteristics is necessary to formulate appropriate emission reduction measures. However, regular and complete emission reports are not always available. Therefore, this study aims to use satellite observations of atmospheric pollutants to evaluate the intensity, efficiency, industrial composition, and energy composition of industrial carbon emissions. Taking China as the study area, first, the XCO2 enhancement (Delta XCO2) and co-located SO2 and NO2 corresponding to the industrial land area were extracted based on the satellite data of OCO-2 (Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2) and Aura OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument). Then, the relationship between atmospheric pollutant composition and industrial emission characteristics in different regions is analyzed. Finally, an estimation model based on atmospheric pollution characteristics is constructed, and the characteristics of China's industrial emissions in 2015 are evaluated. Results show that evaluating the specific emission characteristics is possible by using the comprehensive satellite observations of atmospheric pollutants, and the estimation results are in good agreement with the sectoral emission inventory. High NO2 and high emission intensity are mainly distributed in eastern China, while high SO2 and low emission efficiency are mainly distributed in the north. Furthermore, Delta XCO2 and NO2 are positively correlated with emission intensity and the proportion of emissions from the machinery industry, SO2 is negatively correlated with the proportion of chemical industry emissions, and SO2/NO2 is negatively correlated with emission efficiency and the proportion of light industry emissions. Results of the study show that the comprehensive satellite observation characteristics of atmospheric pollutants can be a reliable reference in evaluating industrial emission characteristics.

TI  - On the influence of underlying elevation data on Sentinel-5 Precursor TROPOMI satellite methane retrievals over Greenland
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) mission was launched on October 2017 and has since provided data with high spatio-temporal resolution using its remote sensing instrument, the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI). The latter is a nadir viewing passive grating imaging spectrometer. The mathematical inversion of the TROPOMI data yields retrievals of different trace gas and aerosol data products. The column-averaged dry-air mole fraction of methane (XCH4) is the product of interest to this study. The daily global coverage of the atmospheric methane mole fraction data enables the analysis of the methane distribution and variation on large scales and also to estimate surface emissions. The spatio-temporal high-resolution satellite data are potentially particularly valuable in remote regions, such as the Arctic, where few ground stations and in situ measurements are available. In addition to the operational Copernicus S5P total-column-averaged dry-air mole fraction methane data product developed by SRON, the scientific TROPOMI/WFMD algorithm data product v1.5 (WFMD product) was generated at the Institute of Environmental Physics at the University of Bremen. In this study we focus on the assessment of both S5P XCH4 data products over Greenland and find that spatial maps of both products show distinct features along the coastlines. Anomalies up to and exceeding 100 ppb are observed and stand out in comparison to the otherwise smooth changes in the methane distribution. These features are more pronounced for the operational product compared to the WFMD product. The spatial patterns correlate with the difference between the GMTED2010 digital elevation model (DEM) used in the retrievals and a more recent topography dataset, indicating that inaccuracies in the assumed surface elevation are the origin of the observed features. These correlations are stronger for the WFMD product. In order to evaluate the impact of the topography dataset on the retrieval we reprocess the WFMD product with updated elevation data. We find that a significant reduction of the localized features when GMTED2010 is replaced by recent topography data over Greenland based on ICESat-2 data. This study shows the importance of the chosen topography data for retrieved dry-air mole fractions. The use of a DEM that is as accurate and as up to date as possible is advised for all S5P data products as well as for future missions which rely on a DEM as input data. A modification based on this study is planned to be introduced in the next version of the WFMD data product.

T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Daily mean land surface temperatures (LSTs) acquired from polar orbiters are crucial for various applications such as global and regional climate change analysis. However, thermal sensors from polar orbiters can only sample the surface effectively with very limited times per day under cloud-free conditions. These limitations have produced a systematic sampling bias (Delta T-sb) on the daily mean LST (T-dm) estimated with the traditional method, which uses the averages of clear-sky LST observations directly as the T-dm. Several methods have been proposed for the estimation of the T-dm, yet they are becoming less capable of generating spatiotemporally seamless T-dm across the globe. Based on MODIS and reanalysis data, here we propose an improved annual and diurnal temperature cycle-based framework (termed the IADTC framework) to generate global spatiotemporally seamless T-dm products ranging from 2003 to 2019 (named the GADTC products). The validations show that the IADTC framework reduces the systematic Delta T-sb significantly. When validated only with in situ data, the assessments show that the mean absolute errors (MAEs) of the IADTC framework are 1.4 and 1.1 K for SURFRAD and FLUXNET data, respectively, and the mean biases are both close to zero. Direct comparisons between the GADTC products and in situ measurements indicate that the MAEs are 2.2 and 3.1 K for the SURFRAD and FLUXNET datasets, respectively, and the mean biases are -1.6 and -1.5 K for these two datasets, respectively. By taking the GADTC products as references, further analysis reveals that the T-dm estimated with the traditional averaging method yields a positive systematic Delta T-sb of greater than 2.0 K in low-latitude and midlatitude regions while of a relatively small value in high-latitude regions. Although the global-mean LST trend (2003 to 2019) calculated with the traditional method and the IADTC framework is relatively close (both between 0.025 to 0.029 K yr(-1)), regional discrepancies in LST trend do occur - the pixel-based MAE in LST trend between these two methods reaches 0.012 K yr(-1). We consider the IADTC framework can guide the further optimization of T-dm estimation across the globe, and the generated GADTC products should be valuable in various applications such as global and regional warming analysis. The GADTC products are freely available at (Hong et al., 2022).

TI  - Deciphering the role of damage-associated molecular patterns and inflammatory responses in acute lung injury
T2  - LIFE SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Acute lung injury (ALI) is characterized by diffuse pulmonary infiltrates and causes great mortality. ALI presents with overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines, cell death, destruction of alveoli-endothelial barriers, and neutrophil infiltration in lung tissues. Damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are molecules released from damaged cells due to infection, trauma, etc. DAMPs activate innate and adaptive immunity, trigger inflammatory responses, and are important in the initiation and development of ALI. We reviewed the literatures on DAMPs in ALI. Alveolar macrophages (AMs), neutrophils, and epithelial cells (AECs) are important in the pathogenesis of ALI. We comprehensively analyzed the interaction between DAMPs and AMs, alveolar neutrophils, and AECs. During the initial stage of ALI, ruptured cell membranes or destroyed mitochondria release DAMPs. DAMPs activate the inflammasome in nearby sentinel immune cells, such as AMs. AMs produce IL-1 beta and other cytokines. These mediators upregulate adhesion molecules of the capillary endothelium that facilitate neutrophil recruitment. The recruited neutrophils detect DAMPs using formyl peptide receptors on the membrane, guiding their migration to the injured site. The accumulation of immune cells, cytokines, chemokines, proteases, etc., results in diffuse alveolar damage and pulmonary hyperpermeability with protein-rich fluid retention. Some clinical studies have shown that patients with ALI with higher circulating DAMPs have higher mortality rates. In conclusion, DAMPs are important in the initiation and progression of ALI. The interactions between DAMPs and AMs, neutrophils, and AECs are important in ALI. This review comprehensively addresses the mechanisms of DAMPs and their interactions in ALI.

TI  - Assessment of hydrological water balance in Lower Nzoia Sub-catchment using SWAT-model: towards improved water governace in Kenya
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Kenya's catchments has both natural and disturbed environments. Within these environments, there has been interaction between hydrological, physical and ecological characteristics. Therefore, impacts of Land Use Land Cover (LULC) change on surface and sub - surface hydrology needs to be well understood due to the increasing population competing for scarce natural resources such as water, trees and forest land. The water balance com-ponents' spatial and temporal dynamics in relationship to the LULC change between 2003 and 2018 in the Lower Nzoia Sub - Catchment (LNSC) in Kenya was therefore assessed. Landsat data with 30 m (m) spatial resolution was used in understanding LULC dynamics of the study area using Supervised Classification Approach (Interactive Classification Method) in ArcGIS 10.5. After landsat image classification, key water balance components including; surface runoff (SURFQ), lateral flow (LATQ), groundwater recharge (BASEQ), deep acquifer recharge (DEEPQ), evapotranspiration (ET) and groundwater revap (REVAP) for years 2003 and 2018 were estimated using SWAT model in ArcSWAT. The overall accuracies for 2003 and 2018 classified images were 75.9% and 98.9% respectively which are showing good values. The results of the study showed that agricultural land coverage reduced from 83.1% in 2003 to 78.6% in 2018. Rangeland on the hand increased from 6.3% to 9.8% while urban/built - up area increasing from 10.6% to 11.6%. The annual water balance components from the LULC distribution of the two time periods shows that ET reduced, SURFQ increased, BASEQ reduced, DEEPQ reduced, LATQ reduced and REVAP reduced. At catchment level, results show that 2018 had a higher water balance than 2003 which can partly be explained by land cover decrease. The relationship between rainfall distribution, Land Surface Temperature (LST) and LULC change were further compared. At the same time, the study found out that there is limited focus to date on rural communities climate adaptive capacity. Hence, water institutions in the sub - catchment such as Water Resources Authority (WRA) are yet to fully mainstream adaptive capacity into their organizational structure and policies.

TI  - Widespread increasing vegetation sensitivity to soil moisture
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Water availability is a major control of vegetation dynamics and terrestrial carbon cycling. Here, the authors show that vegetation sensitivity to soil moisture has been increasing in the last 36 years, especially in (semi)arid areas, and that state-of-the-art land surface models fail to capture this trend.Global vegetation and associated ecosystem services critically depend on soil moisture availability which has decreased in many regions during the last three decades. While spatial patterns of vegetation sensitivity to global soil water have been recently investigated, long-term changes in vegetation sensitivity to soil water availability are still unclear. Here we assess global vegetation sensitivity to soil moisture during 1982-2017 by applying explainable machine learning with observation-based leaf area index (LAI) and hydro-climate anomaly data. We show that LAI sensitivity to soil moisture significantly increases in many semi-arid and arid regions. LAI sensitivity trends are associated with multiple hydro-climate and ecological variables, and strongest increasing trends occur in the most water-sensitive regions which additionally experience declining precipitation. State-of-the-art land surface models do not reproduce this increasing sensitivity as they misrepresent water-sensitive regions and sensitivity strength. Our sensitivity results imply an increasing ecosystem vulnerability to water availability which can lead to exacerbated reductions in vegetation carbon uptake under future intensified drought, consequently amplifying climate change.

TI  - Urban poverty maps- From characterising deprivation using geo-spatial data to capturing deprivation from space
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Most earth observation (EO) approaches only yield a binary delineation of deprived/non-deprived areas - an oversimplified characterisation with little information inferred regarding the diversity of intra-urban depriva-tion. In this study, we attempt to explore the potential of using VHR EO-based data to predict the degrees of intra-urban deprivation in Nairobi, Kenya. This involves a two-step workflow of characterising and predicting a continuous index of deprivation degrees. First, a principal component analysis (PCA) is conducted to characterise the multi-dimensionality of deprivation using open geospatial datasets as a set of continuous indices. Next, a convolution neural network (CNN) based regression model is trained to directly predict the deprivation indices using SPOT-7 images. The best prediction of the proposed CNN regression model is obtained in the morphology-based domain, with an R2 of 0.6543. We demonstrate the potential of an EO-based method to directly capture the degrees of morphological deprivation with relatively high accuracy, while also acknowledging its limitations in predicting the complexity of deprivation.

T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim is to identify and assessment of the shear strength parameters (phi and c) of the geological formation in the Roudbar quadrangle at a regional scale, to be used in seismic landslide hazard or susceptibility zonation. In this study, the earthquake-induced landslide inventory map following Roudbar-Manjil Earthquake was prepared. The geotechnical data of these studies, as well as findings from local consultants and construction projects, were collected as well. The shear strength parameters of each formation were then assessed by employing the geotechnical strength index classification system introduced. We illustrate the use of Newmark's sliding block and Gibson's applicable definition to evaluate strength parameter data. Newmark's displacement method and Jibson's applicable definition were employed to validate strength parameter data for slope static stability analysis. Slope stability analysis was modeled in a GIS environment using a digital elevation map and the normalized difference moisture index. The normalized difference moisture index was used to assess moisture content derived from Landsat spectral bands 4 and 5. Finally, the pseudo-static back-analysis of one sample landslide was performed to validate the strength parameters. The study provides necessary data for rapidly creating a map of earthquake-triggered landslides.

TI  - Effects of Anthropic Pollutants Identified in Pampas Lakes on the Development and Reproduction of Pejerrey Fish <i>Odontesthes bonariensis</i>
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Anthropic activities can seriously affect the health of the organisms inhabiting them, and the observation of any alteration in the reproduction of fish could be associated with the presence of endocrine disruptors. In this manuscript we have collected information on the adverse effects of pollutants (heavy metals, environmental steroids, and agrochemicals), present in Chascomus lake, Argentina, either at environmentally relevant and pharmacological concentrations on reproduction, embryonic development, and larval survival of pejerrey fish Odontesthes bonariensis. During development, it has been reported that 17 beta-estradiol (E-2) feminized and reduced larval survival, while 17 alpha-ethinyl-estradiol (EE2) not only feminized but also affected both embryo and larval survival. In adult male fish, treatments with EE2 and E-2 + EE2 were able to increase mRNA abundance of gnrh3 and cyp19a1b and decreased those of gonadotropin receptors (fshr and lhcgr). Heavy metals such as cadmium, chromium, and copper negatively affected sperm quality, diminishing the motility. Also, a decrease in the percentage of hatching rate and larval survival was also observed with the same metals, highlighting zinc as the most detrimental metal. Furthermore, all these metals altered the expression of hypothalamic and pituitary genes related to reproduction in male pejerrey (gnrh1,2,3; cyp19a1b; fshb; lhb; fshr and, lhcgr). Moreover, in all cases pyknotic cells, corresponding to the degeneration of the germ cells, were observed in the testes of exposed fish. For agrochemicals, exposure of male pejerrey to environmental concentrations of glyphosate did not cause alterations on the endocrine reproductive axis. However, male pejerrey with gonadal abnormalities such as the presence of intersex (testis-ova) gonads were found in other Pampa ' s lakes with high concentrations of atrazine and glyphosate associated with soybean and corn crops near their coasts. These types of studies demonstrate that pejerrey, an endemic species with economic importance inhabiting the Pampas shallow lakes, can be used as a sentinel species. It should be noted that increased pollution of aquatic ecosystems and the effects on the reproduction of organisms can lead to a decline in fish populations worldwide. Which, added to overfishing and other external factors such as global warming, could cause an eventual extinction of an emblematic species.

TI  - Are measured InSAR displacements a function of the chosen processing method?
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND HYDROGEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The benefits of InSAR to the civil engineering industry have been demonstrated on many occasions, however there is still a limited uptake by end-users, due to perceived differences between data providers and uncertainty around how to interpret results. This paper critically compares three datasets for London: Radarsat-2 (RS2) from 2011 to 2015, TenaSAR-X (TSX) from 2011 to 2017, and Sentinel-1 (STL1) from 2015 to 2017. Two of the datasets (TSX & RS2) were processed by commercial data providers, while the STL1 data were processed using ENVI (R) SARscape (R) by the authors. The results show an inverse relationship between the Pearson Con elation Coefficient and absolute total displacement of Persistent Scatterers (PS). There is a strong con elation between datasets for total displacement greater than 5 mm, but a weak or no con elation in the 0-3 mm range. Consequently, standard commercial InSAR datasets, processed with no a priori knowledge of the area of interest, have error margins below 3-5 mm but correctly detect all deformation phenomena exceeding this threshold. RS2-TSX both capture the spatial extent of the investigated area of dewatering induced subsidence, however STL1 measures a much broader, less pronounced zone of heave than TSX.

TI  - Evaluation of a Patient With Non-Myoinvasive Uterine Serous Carcinoma Confined to a Polyp and Positive Peritoneal Washings With Somatic ARHGAP35 and KRAS Mutations
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, the application of peritoneal washings as a diagnostic tool for endometrial cancer staging is not well defined. The case described aims to highlight the current ambiguity surrounding the use of peritoneal washings in clinical practice. A 69-year-old G3P3003 presented to her gynecologist with complaints of new-onset heavy vaginal bleeding. The patient sought an endometrial biopsy, which suggested serous endometrial intraepithelial carcinoma (EIC) focally suspicious for invasive carcinoma, with the involvement of polyps. Based on these results, a robotic-assisted total laparoscopic hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, bilateral sentinel lymph node dissection, and omentectomy were performed. Results from her final pathology exhibited a stage IA uterine serous carcinoma (USC) involving a polyp (4.2 cm in greatest dimension) with no myometrial or lymphovascular invasion, but washings were positive for adenocarcinoma. Based on her family history of malignancy, the patient underwent germline panel testing. The patient's somatic tumor testing demonstrated proficient DNA mismatch repair status, microsatellite stability, low tumor mutational burden (4 mut/Mb), low loss of heterozygosity (9%), amplification of the ERBB2 (HER2/neu) gene by both immunohistochemistry (3+, 20% positive) and fluorescence in-situ hybridization. Her tumor also had weakly positive estrogen receptor expression (1+, 10% positive); furthermore, some pathogenic variants in KRAS (c.37G>T), PIK3CA (c.263G>A), and TP53 (c.743G>A) were identified. Given the incongruent findings found with the positive peritoneal washing and negative lymph node involvement in addition to molecular testing, management for this patient was unclear. Ultimately, this case highlights a number of advances within the field of gynecological oncology but also emphasizes the persistent ambiguity and incongruency in the management of patients with early-stage high-risk histologies. Moving forward it will become increasingly important to be able to develop a more standardized process to assess how these diagnostic tools should inform prognosis and treatment plans.

TI  - Impacts of dropsonde and satellite observations on the forecasts of two atmospheric-river-related heavy rainfall events
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study focuses on two intensive observing periods (IOPs) that cause heavy rainfall over California during the atmospheric river (AR) Reconnaissance Program in 2019. The impacts of dropsonde and satellite observations on the forecasts of the two AR-related heavy rainfall are investigated through both forecast sensitivity to obser-vations (FSO) and observing system experiments (OSEs). In the first case (IOP3), satellite and dropsonde data coverage were relatively independent, whereas in the second case (IOP5), the satellite coverage was more extensive and substantially overlapped with dropsonde coverage. The FSO experiments indicate that the drop -sondes improve the atmospheric forecast by a greater contribution per observation than that of an individual satellite instrument. In the OSEs, the heavy rainfall forecast presents a higher improvement when assimilating both dropsondes and satellite radiances. In IOP3, the dropsonde data slightly amplify the improvement achieved from the satellite data in terms of structure and location of the AR and attendant precipitation. In IOP5, the improvement from dropsonde data is more evident in the forecast of heavy precipitation. The influence of the dropsonde data in each case is broadly consistent with the relative coverage of dropsonde and satellite data. The best forecast performance acquired from the assimilation of both dropsonde and satellite data indicates the complementarity between the two data sources. Based on circulation analyses and further experiments assimi-lating satellite radiances from temperature channels and humidity channels separately, the improved rainfall forecasts are found to be related to the improvements in the three-dimensional circulation structure impacted by temperature characteristics.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Here, we investigated whether the widely distributed snail Cepaea nemoralis could be used as a suitable sentinel animal for assessing the effects of soil contaminants-petroleum oil derivatives-after years of soil ageing and treatment with a bacterial formulation. Oxidative stress was assessed in the foot and hepatopancreas of C. nemoralis L. exposed to soil contaminated with unleaded petrol, spent engine oil or diesel oil and bioremediated with a bacterial formulation (soil was used 2 years after contamination and bioremediation process). We measured total antioxidant capacity, catalase and glutathione transferase activity and concentrations of superoxide anions, hydrogen peroxide and protein carbonyls in the foot and hepatopancreas of snails after 2 and 4 weeks of treatment. The studied antioxidant responses appeared largely to be tissue and remediation process specific, while the concentrations of superoxide anions, hydrogen peroxide and protein carbonyls depended on time of exposure, tissue type and the type of contaminants, but mostly not on the remediation process. Generally, changes in the concentrations of superoxide anions, hydrogen peroxide and protein carbonyls in the hepatopancreas of snails seemed to be a suitable measure to assess the risk of animals exposed to soil contaminated with petroleum substances and used after many years of ageing and treatment with a microbial formulation.

TI  - Application of Indocyanine Green Enhanced Fluorescence in Esophageal Surgery: A Mini Review
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Despite recent technological innovations and the development of minimally invasive surgery, esophagectomy remains an operation burdened with severe postoperative complications. Fluorescence imaging, particularly using indocyanine green (ICG), offers the ability to address a number of issues faced during esophagectomy. The three main indications for the intraoperative use of ICG during esophagectomy are visualization of conduit vascular supply, allow identification of sentinel nodes and visualization of the thoracic duct. The purpose of this mini review is to present an overview of current practice in fluorescence imaging utilizing ICG during esophagectomy, as well as to demonstrate how this technology can guide lymphadenectomy and reduce surgical morbidity such as anastomotic leaking and chylothorax.

TI  - Young Greeks' Social Representation of Protest: Dialogical Structure and Ideological Function
T2  - INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Public protest has been a controversial form of political participation which aims to intervene in the socio-political status quo by promoting or preventing social change. The political and social life in Greece has been greatly influenced by public protests which, in several cases, acted as regulators and drivers of change. The main interest of this study is to examine public protest as an object of social representation of young Greeks in the current socio-political and historical context. Obtaining data from focus groups, we use recent dialogical approaches to Social Representation Theory to examine the content, the emerging identities, as well as the structure and the ideological function of protest representation amongst young Greeks. Our findings indicate that protests??? representation is conceptualized on the basis of dialectical antitheses and contradictory identities; the idealistic perception of public protest is based on the conceptualization of the identity of active citizen and purposeful protesters, while the violent side of protests emerges from the identity of rioters and protest armies. We argue that these main elements of protest representation also determine its internal structure. In addition, they have an implicit ideological function as they express the way in which young Greeks discuss, negotiate, assimilate and redefine public protest under their set of beliefs and their worldview concerning social reality.

M3  - Article
AB  - How to combine GIS spatial statistics technology to realize the intelligent and efficient classification of tourists' landscape preferences is a hot spot in the direction of rural cultural tourism. Based on this, this paper studies the emotion analysis strategy based on GIS spatial statistical method in the field of landscape preference of rural cultural tourism tourists. Firstly, an intelligent and efficient classification model based on remote sensing discrete expansion algorithm is proposed. Combined with the observation strategy of common emotional rules in the landscape preference analysis of rural cultural tourism tourists, the landscape preference of rural cultural tourism tourists is processed with high quantitative emotional information, so as to realize the intelligent separation of preference, and then the error of discrete remote sensing data expansion model is corrected. Secondly, the judgment function of emotional rules is constructed, and the commonly used data layer-driven decentralized method is used in preference classification to eliminate the secondary factors in the landscape preference analysis of rural cultural tourism tourists. At the same time, the remote sensing discrete expansion algorithm is used to optimize and improve the emotional rules of high-volume emotional information based on GIS spatial statistical method. Finally, through the design of confirmatory experiments, the results show that the landscape preference analysis model based on GIS spatial statistics method and remote sensing discrete expansion algorithm is more efficient than the conventional preference classification method.

TI  - Direct and indirect impacts of urbanization on vegetation growth across the world's cities
T2  - SCIENCE ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban environments, regarded as "harbingers" of future global change, may exert positive or negative impacts on urban vegetation growth. Because of limited ground-based experiments, the responses of vegetation to urbanization and its associated controlling factors at the global scale remain poorly understood. Here, we use satellite observations from 2001 to 2018 to quantify direct and indirect impacts of urbanization on vegetation growth in 672 worldwide cities. After controlling for the negative direct impact of urbanization on vegetation growth, we find a widespread positive indirect effect that has been increasing over time. These indirect effects depend on urban development intensity, population density, and background climate, with more pronounced positive effects in cities with cold and arid environments. We further show that vegetation responses to urbanization are modulated by a cities' developmental status. Our findings have important implications for understanding urbanization-induced impacts on vegetation and future sustainable urban development.

TI  - Software for Mapping and Extraction of Building Land Remote Sensing Data Based on BIM and Sensor Technology
T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to solve the problem of complex extraction caused by large feature dimension of remote sensing data, this paper proposes a dimension compression extraction method of urban building land remote sensing data under BIM Technology. Firstly, the remote sensing data is imported into the BIM model for lightweight processing to obtain the element information required for urban construction land and then analyze the urban construction land data, extract the key elements of BIM Technology through semantic filtering, and use the triangulation method to transform the remote sensing data into the triangulation model that can be processed by GIS model. Finally, the random projection method is used to reduce the dimension and compress the remote sensing data, and the remote sensing data extraction of urban construction land is realized through dictionary learning, vocabulary coding, and feature extraction. The experimental results show that the accuracy of extracting different land use types by this method is more than 99%, while the accuracy of extracting different land use types by depth learning method and PLS method is less than 98.5%. In addition, the signal-to-noise ratio of the image extracted by this method is significantly higher than that by depth learning method and PLS method. Conclusion. This method can effectively compress and extract the urban construction land in the remote sensing data, and the extraction accuracy of remote sensing data is high. It provides a technical basis for the approval of urban construction planning. It has the advantages of simple feature extraction and effective differentiation of ground objects.

TI  - N distribution characterization based on organ-level biomass and N concentration using a hyperspectral lidar
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimates of the N concentration and biomass (W) in plant organs provide information regarding the mechanisms of N distribution, which is critical for improving N use efficiency (NUE) and optimizing N management. Dimensionless passive remotely sensed data may lead to the asymptotic saturation problem when extracting W, whereas commercial lidar systems employing only one wavelength band have limited capacity in N retrieval. Combining the advantages of passive remote sensing and traditional lidar, hyperspectral lidar (HSL) has the ability to simultaneously extract structural and spectral information for plants. The objectives of this research were to evaluate the ability of HSL to estimate maize N concentration and W at the organ level, and to test whether HSL can characterize maize N distribution at different growth stages and under different N fertilizer conditions. A wide range of HSL performance for leaf and stem N extraction (R-2 = 0.71 - 0.91) was observed based on the partial least squares regression (PLSR) method with spectral indices as inputs. Close relationships (R-2 >= 0.75) were established between extracted height metrics (stem height and plant height) and organ-level W. The W portioning, dynamics of N concentration, and the variations in N with W accumulation were successfully monitored based on the estimated N concentration and W, thus demonstrating the capacity of HSL to characterize the N distribution pattern within maize plants. Our results show that the novel HSL system holds much potential for monitoring plant N distribution and serving precision agriculture.

TI  - Using routine emergency department data for syndromic surveillance of acute respiratory illness, week 10 2017 until week 10 2021
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic expanded the need for timely information on acute respiratory illness at population level. Aim: We explored the potential of routine emergency department data for syndromic surveillance of acute respiratory illness in Germany. Methods: We used routine attendance data from emer-gency departments, which continuously transferred data between week 10 2017 and 10 2021, with ICD-10 codes available for > 75% of attendances. Case defini-tions for acute respiratory infection (ARI), severe acute respiratory infection (SARI), influenza-like illness (ILI), respiratory syncytial virus infection (RSV) and COVID-19 were based on a combination of ICD-10 codes, and/or chief complaints, sometimes combined with information on hospitalisation and age. Results: We included 1,372,958 attendances from eight emergency departments. The number of attendances dropped in March 2020 during the first COVID-19 pandemic wave, increased during summer, and declined again during the resurge of COVID-19 cases in autumn and winter of 2020/21. A pattern of seasonality of respira-tory infections could be observed. By using different case definitions (i.e. for ARI, SARI, ILI, RSV) both the annual influenza seasons in the years 2017-2020 and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020/21 were apparent. The absence of the 2020/21 influenza season was visible, parallel to the resurge of COVID-19 cases. SARI among ARI cases peaked in April-May 2020 (17%) and November 2020-January 2021 (14%). Conclusion: Syndromic surveillance using routine emergency department data can potentially be used to monitor the trends, timing, duration, magnitude and severity of illness caused by respiratory viruses, including both influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2.

TI  - Keap1 moderates the transcription of virus induced genes through G9a-GLP and NFκB p50 recruitment
T2  - IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Cells must control genes that are induced by virus infection to mitigate deleterious consequences of inflammation. We investigated the mechanisms whereby Keap1 moderates the transcription of genes that are induced by Sendai virus infection in mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). Keap1-/- deletions increased the transcription of virus induced genes independently of Nrf2. Keap1 moderated early virus induced gene transcription. Virus infection induced Keap1 to bind Ifnb1, Tnf and Il6, and reduced Keap1 binding at Cdkn1a and Ccng1. Virus infection induced G9a-GLP and NF kappa B p50 recruitment, and H3K9me2 deposition. Keap1-/- deletions eliminated G9a-GLP and NF kappa B p50 recruitment, and H3K9me2 deposition, but they did not affect NF kappa B p65, IRF3 or cJun recruitment. G9a-GLP inhibitors (BIX01294, MS012, BRD4770) enhanced virus induced gene transcription in MEFs with intact Keap1, but not in MEFs with Keap1-/- deletions. G9a-GLP inhibitors augmented Keap1 binding to virus induced genes in infected MEFs, and to cell cycle genes in uninfected MEFs. G9a-GLP inhibitors augmented NF kappa B subunit recruitment in MEFs with intact Keap1. G9a-GLP inhibitors stabilized Keap1 retention in permeabilized MEFs. G9a-GLP lysine methyltransferase activity was required for Keap1 to moderate transcription, and it moderated Keap1 binding to chromatin. The interdependent effects of Keap1 and G9a-GLP on the recruitment of each other and on the moderation of virus induced gene transcription constitute a feedback circuit. Keap1 and the electrophile tBHQ reduced virus induced gene transcription through different mechanisms, and they regulated the recruitment of different NF kappa B subunits. Characterization of the mechanisms whereby Keap1, G9a-GLP and NF kappa B p50 moderate virus induced gene transcription can facilitate the development of immunomodulatory agents.

TI  - Reading Literary Fiction Is Associated With a More Complex Worldview
T2  - PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - What are the effects of reading fiction? We propose that literary fiction alters views of the world through its presentation of difference-different minds, different contexts, and different situations-grounding a belief that the social world is complex. Across four studies, two nationally representative and one preregistered (total n = 5,176), we find that the reading of literary fiction in early life is associated with a more complex worldview in Americans: increased attributional complexity, increased psychological richness, decreased belief that contemporary inequalities are legitimate, and decreased belief that people are essentially only one way. By contrast, early-life reading of narrative fiction that presents more standardized plots and characters, such as romance novels, predict holding a less complex worldview.

TI  - Adaptive response of Dongzhaigang mangrove in China to future sea level rise
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests are valuable intertidal ecosystems that provide coastline protection, biodiversity maintenance, and carbon sequestration. However, their survival is under severe threat from rapidly rising sea levels. In this study, we aimed to investigate the changes in the area of the Dongzhaigang mangrove in China since the 1950s and causes of these changes using literature and remote sensing data. The impact of historical and future sea level rise (SLR) on the mangroves was analyzed using remote sensing data and climate model data under the low, intermediate, and very high greenhouse gas emission scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5). The area of the mangrove forests decreased from 3416 to 1711 hm(2) during 1956-1988 and remained constant at 1711 hm(2) after the 1990s, owing to anthropogenic disturbances such as reclamation and aquaculture before the 1980s and the protection of nature reserve establishment after the 1990s, respectively. Under RCPs 4.5 and 8.5, SLR is expected to cause > 26% of the mangroves to disappear by 2100, whereas under RCP 2.6, only 17% of the mangroves will likely be lost. Biological measures such as reestablishment of ponds as mangrove forests, afforestation, and biological embankment for sediment trapping in coastal wetlands are recommended to enhance the resilience of mangroves to SLR.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Background: Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) continue to place a burden on patient health and safety as well as on the healthcare system. In Canada, national surveillance of HAIs at sentinel acute care hospitals is conducted by the Canadian Nosocomial Infection Surveillance Program. This article describes ten years of device and surgical procedure-related HAI epidemiology in Canada from 2011 to 2020.Methods: Data were collected from over 40 Canadian sentinel acute care hospitals between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2020, for central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs), hip and knee surgical site infections (SSIs), cerebrospinal fluid shunt SSIs and paediatric cardiac SSIs. Case counts, rates, patient and hospital characteristics, pathogen distributions, and antimicrobial resistance are presented.Results: Between 2011 and 2020, 4,751 device and surgical procedure-related infections were reported, with CLABSIs in intensive care units (ICUs) representing 67% (n=3,185) of all reported infections. Over the surveillance period, significant rate increases were observed in adult mixed ICU CLABSIs (0.8 to 1.6 per 1,000 line days, p=0.004) while decreases were observed in neonatal ICU CLABSIs (4.0 to 1.6 per 1,000 line days, p=0.002) and SSIs following knee arthroplasty (0.69 to 0.29 infections per 100 surgeries, p=0.002). No trends were observed in the other reported HAIs.Of the 5,071 pathogens identified, the majority were gram-positive (68%), followed by gram-negative (23%) and fungi (9%). Coagulase-negative staphylococci (27%) and Staphylococcus aureus (16%) were the most frequently isolated pathogens.Conclusion: This report describes epidemiological and microbiological trends among select device and surgical procedure-related HAIs, essential for benchmarking infection rates nationally and internationally, to identify any changes in infection rates or antimicrobial resistance patterns and to help inform hospital infection prevention and control and antimicrobial stewardship policies and programs.

TI  - Multitemporal dual-pol Sentinel-1 data to support monitoring of forest post-fire dynamics
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Approaches based on multitemporal analysis of optical-retrieved vegetation index time series were successfully applied to describe forest disturbances like forest fires; conversely, only few works make use of multitemporal Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. In this work, a multi-temporal approach based on Sentinel-1 data (S1) is proposed based on CR polarimetric index to monitor forest canopy along the considered period (2016-2019) preceding and following an important fire event occurred in the Piemonte Region (NW Italy) in November 2017. The Pettitt test, applied to the polarimetric index time series, was used for testing fire occurrence date and map burned areas (795 ha) resulting in user's accuracy of burned area equal to 88%. A trend analysis was also conducted, on 'burned' pixels only, to describe tree canopy damage and strength of the consequent recovery process at pixel level using linear trend slope values of cross ratio polarimetric index time series. Finally, a k-means cluster analysis was applied to define classes having the same ecological behaviour with respect to two different criteria: one aimed at mapping type and intensity of damage and a second one aimed at describing the ecological behaviour in terms of resistance and resilience of burned patches. In the study area, the cluster layer called forest damage map classifies about the 22% of burned area as characterized by an early high severity whiled the residual by moderate-low severity levels. The second cluster layer called ecological response map defined the 61% of the burned area as resistant forests, the 20% as resilient forests and the 19% as increasing forest zones. All maps were generated with the aim of supporting post-fire assessment and management with free satellite SAR data.

TI  - Kinematic Analysis of the 2020 Elliot Creek Landslide, British Columbia, Using Remote Sensing Data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2020 Elliot Creek landslide-tsunami-flood cascade originated from an 18.3 Mm(3) rock slope failure in quartz diorite bedrock in a valley undergoing rapid glacial retreat. We used airborne LiDAR and optical imagery to characterize the slope and its surroundings. Using the LiDAR, we determined that two rockslides (2020 and an older undated one) occurred on this slope and shared a common basal rupture surface. We mapped two main sets of lineaments that represent structures that controlled the orientation of the lateral and rear release surfaces. Analysis of the topographic profile indicates a wedge-shaped failure block and a stepped rupture surface. Further topographic profile analysis indicates the possibility of a structurally controlled geomorphic step in the valley that corresponds with a change in the orientation of the valley. The rapid retreat of the West Grenville Glacier and the positions of the rupture surfaces suggest glacial retreat played a role in the landslides.

TI  - Global Tracking and Quantification of Oil and Gas Methane Emissions from Recurrent <i>Sentinel-2</i> Imagery
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Methane (CH4) emission estimates from top-down studies over oil and gas basins have revealed systematic underestimation of CH4 emissions in current national inventories. Sparse but extremely large amounts of CH4 from oil and gas production activities have been detected across the globe, resulting in a significant increase of the overall oil and gas contribution. However, attribution to specific facilities remains a major challenge unless high-spatial-resolution images provide sufficient granularity within the oil and gas basin. In this paper, we monitor known oil and gas infrastructures across the globe using recurrent Sentinel-2 imagery to detect and quantify more than 1200 CH4 emissions. In combination with emission estimates from airborne and Sentinel-5P measurements, we demonstrate the robustness of the fit to a power law from 0.1 t(CH4)/h to 600 t(CH4)/h. We conclude here that the prevalence of ultraemitters (> 25t(CH4)/h) detected globally by Sentinel-5P directly relates to emission occurrences below its detection threshold in the range > 2t(CH4)/h, which correspond to large emitters covered by Sentinel-2. We also verified that this relation is also valid at a more local scale for two specific countries, namely, Algeria and Turkmenistan, and the Permian basin in the United States.

TI  - Risk Factors for Mortality Among Children Younger Than Age 5 Years With Severe Diarrhea in Low- and Middle-income Countries: Findings From the World Health Organization-coordinated Global Rotavirus and Pediatric Diarrhea Surveillance Networks
T2  - CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Diarrhea is the second leading cause of death in children younger than 5 years of age globally. The burden of diarrheal mortality is concentrated in low-resource settings. Little is known about the risk factors for childhood death from diarrheal disease in low- and middle-income countries. Methods Data from the World Health Organization (WHO)-coordinated Global Rotavirus and Pediatric Diarrhea Surveillance Networks, which are composed of active, sentinel, hospital-based surveillance sites, were analyzed to assess mortality in children <5 years of age who were hospitalized with diarrhea between 2008 and 2018. Case fatality risks were calculated, and multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify risk factors for mortality. Results This analysis comprises 234 781 cases, including 1219 deaths, across 57 countries. The overall case fatality risk was found to be 0.5%. Risk factors for death in the multivariable analysis included younger age (for <6 months compared with older ages, odds ratio [OR] = 3.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.81-4.50), female sex (OR = 1.18; 95% CI, 1.06-1.81), presenting with persistent diarrhea (OR = 1.91; 95% CI, 1.01-3.25), no vomiting (OR = 1.13; 95% CI, .98-1.30), severe dehydration (OR = 3.79; 95% CI, 3.01-4.83), and being negative for rotavirus on an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test (OR = 2.29; 95% CI, 1.92-2.74). Cases from the African Region had the highest odds of death compared with other WHO regions (OR = 130.62 comparing the African Region with the European Region; 95% CI, 55.72-422.73), whereas cases from the European Region had the lowest odds of death. Conclusions Our findings support known risk factors for childhood diarrheal mortality and highlight the need for interventions to address dehydration and rotavirus-negative diarrheal infections.

TI  - Policing the Sublime: The Metaphysical Harms of Irreligious Clinical Ethics
T2  - CHRISTIAN BIOETHICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Janet Malek has recently argued that the religious worldview of the clinical ethics consultant should play no normative role in clinical ethics consultation. What are the theological implications of a normatively secular clinical ethics? I argue that Malek's proposal constitutes an irreligious clinical ethics, which commits multiple metaphysical harms. First, I summarize Malek's key claims for a secular clinical ethics. Second, I explicate both John Milbank's notion of ontological violence and Timothy Murphy's irreligious bioethics to show how they apply to Malek's secular clinical ethics, resulting in an irreligious clinical ethics. Third, I then show how an irreligious clinical ethics commits metaphysical harms to patients, clinical ethics consultants, and the institution of clinical ethics consultation. I conclude that Malek's proposal for an irreligious clinical ethics must be rejected to maintain the metaphysical integrity of clinical ethics consultants, patients, and the institution of clinical ethics consultation.

TI  - Remote sensing provides new insights on phytoplankton biomass dynamics and black pearl oyster life-history traits in a Pacific Ocean deep atoll
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Thus far, no long-term in situ observation of planktonic biomass have been undertaken to optimize the black-lip pearl oyster aquaculture in the remote Tuamotu atolls. The feasibility of using data from the OLI sensor onboard Landsat-8 satellite to determine chlorophyll a concentrations (Chla) in a deep atoll, Ahe, was then assessed over the 2013-2021 period using 153 images. Validations with in situ observations were satisfactory, while seasonal and spatial patterns in Chla were evidenced within the lagoon. Then, a bioenergetic modelling exercise was undertaken to estimate oyster life-history traits when exposed to the retrieved Chla. The outputs provide spatio-temporal variations in pelagic larval duration (11.1 to 30.6 days), time to reach commercial size (18.8 to 45.3 months) and reproductive outputs (0.5 to 1.7 event year(-1)). This first study shows the potential of using remote sensing to monitor the trophic status of deep pearl farming lagoons and help aquaculture management.

TI  - Monitoring Dryland Trees With Remote Sensing. Part A: Beyond CORONA-Historical HEXAGON Satellite Imagery as a New Data Source for Mapping Open-Canopy Woodlands on the Tree Level
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring woody cover by remote sensing is considered a key methodology towards sustainable management of trees in dryland forests. However, while modern very high resolution satellite (VHRS) sensors allow woodland mapping at the individual tree level, the historical perspective is often hindered by lack of appropriate image data. In this first study employing the newly accessible historical HEXAGON KH-9 stereo-panoramic camera images for environmental research, we propose their use for mapping trees in open-canopy conditions. The 2-4 feet resolution panchromatic HEXAGON satellite photographs were taken 1971-1986 within the American reconnaissance programs that are better known to the scientific community for their lower-resolution CORONA images. Our aim is to evaluate the potential of combining historical CORONA and HEXAGON with recent WorldView VHRS imagery for retrospective woodland change mapping on the tree level. We mapped all trees on 30 1-ha test sites in open-canopy argan woodlands in Morocco in the field and from the VHRS imagery for estimating changes of tree density and size between 1967/1972 and 2018. Prior to image interpretation, we used simulations based on unmanned aerial system (UAS) imagery for exemplarily examining the role of illumination, viewing geometry and image resolution on the appearance of trees and their shadows in the historical panchromatic images. We show that understanding these parameters is imperative for correct detection and size-estimation of tree crowns. Our results confirm that tree maps derived solely from VHRS image analysis generally underestimate the number of small trees and trees in clumped-canopy groups. Nevertheless, HEXAGON images compare remarkably well with WorldView images and have much higher tree-mapping potential than CORONA. By classifying the trees in three sizes, we were able to measure tree-cover changes on an ordinal scale. Although we found no clear trend of forest degradation or recovery, our argan forest sites show varying patterns of change, which are further analysed in Part B of our study. We conclude that the HEXAGON stereo-panoramic camera images, of which 670,000 worldwide will soon be available, open exciting opportunities for retrospective monitoring of trees in open-canopy conditions and other woody vegetation patterns back into the 1980s and 1970s.

TI  - Understanding Growth-Induced Trends in Local Climate Zones, Land Surface Temperature, and Extreme Temperature Events in a Rapidly Growing City: A Case of Bulawayo Metropolitan City in Zimbabwe
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessment of the responses of the urban thermal environment to climate is important, especially because of their possible influence on low- and high-temperature extreme events. This study assessed the combination of remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST) and local climate zones (LCZs) with in situ air temperature-retrieved extreme temperature indices. It aimed to assess the effect of urban growth on the three-dimensional thermal environment in the Bulawayo metropolitan area, Zimbabwe. LST and LCZ were derived from the Landsat data for 1990, 2005, and 2020, while extreme temperature indices and trends were derived from daily minimum and maximum temperature data from a local weather station. Results showed that the built LCZ expanded at the expense of vegetation-based LCZ. Average LST for each LCZ increased from 1990 to 2020, which was attributed to background warming, while the expansion of high LST areas was associated with LCZ transitions. Although average minimum temperature decreased, cool nights increased, warmest nights remained unchanged, and the lowest minimum increased, the highest minimum temperatures decreased, but the trends were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Indices of daytime warming showed significant changes, which includes an increase in average maximum temperature (p = 0.002), increase in lowest maximum temperature (p = 0), increase in the number of very warm days (p = 0.004), and decrease in the number of cool days (p = 0). The significant increase in daytime extremes was attributed to an increase in highly absorbing LCZ and daytime pollution due to industrial activities. The study also concluded that development in water areas or siltation of water bodies has a greater warming effect than other LCZ changes. The findings show that development needs to consider potential effects on the thermal environment and temperature extremes.

TI  - The influence of the environment and indoor residual spraying on malaria risk in a cohort of children in Uganda
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies have estimated the impact of the environment on malaria incidence although few have explored the differential impact due to malaria control interventions. Therefore, the objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of indoor residual spraying (IRS) on the relationship between malaria and environment (i.e. rainfall, temperatures, humidity, and vegetation) using data from a dynamic cohort of children from three sub-counties in Uganda. Environmental variables were extracted from remote sensing sources and averaged over different time periods. General linear mixed models were constructed for each sub-counties based on a log-binomial distribution. The influence of IRS was analysed by comparing marginal effects of environment in models adjusted and unadjusted for IRS. Great regional variability in the shape (linear and non-linear), direction, and magnitude of environmental associations with malaria risk were observed between sub-counties. IRS was significantly associated with malaria risk reduction (risk ratios vary from RR = 0.03, CI 95% [0.03-0.08] to RR = 0.35, CI95% [0.28-0.42]). Model adjustment for this intervention changed the magnitude and/or direction of environment-malaria associations, suggesting an interaction effect. This study evaluated the potential influence of IRS in the malaria-environment association and highlighted the necessity to control for interventions when they are performed to properly estimate the environmental influence on malaria. Local models are more informative to guide intervention program compared to national models.

TI  - A Quick Detection of Lake Area Changes and Hazard Assessment in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau Based on GEE: A Case Study of Tuosu Lake
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Under the background of global warming, lake changes in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and their impacts have been widely concerned. To avoid downloading and preprocessing numerous remote sensing images, we used JavaScript to preprocess the Landsat OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI images based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform and extract the water area of Tuosu Lake by combining NDWI, MNDWI, and SVM methods. The area changes of Tuosu Lake in 2000-2021, and their impact on the surrounding infrastructure were further analyzed. The results show that 1) in different methods of surface water extraction, the segmentation based on NDWI is the most efficient for delineating the Tuosu Lake, and the optimal threshold is 0.15 +/- 0.03. 2) During 2000-2021, the area of Tuosu Lake increased by about 45.79 km(2), which can be roughly divided into a slow growth period (2000-2013, 1.20 km(2)/a), a stable period (2013-2016, 0.49 km(2)/a), slow expansion period (2016-2017, 1.97 km(2)/a), and rapid expansion period (2017-2021, 7.43 km(2)/a). In particular, in 2019-2020, the lake area increased sharply by 9.22 km(2). 3) Affected by the expansion of Tuosu Lake, the highway along the northern lake had been seriously threatened, and about 19.17 km (83.28%) of it was submerged by 2021. In addition, the distance between Tuosu Lake and the Qinghai-Tibet Railway has been shortened year by year, with the shortest distance of 0.85 km in 2021.

TI  - Millimeter slope ratcheting from multitemporal SAR interferometry with a correction of coastal tropospheric delay: A case study in Hong Kong
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropospheric delays (TDs) limit the accurate detection of slow slope motion using interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), especially in subtropical coastal regions prone to frequent changes in humidity. Although TDs can be estimated through external weather data, their spatiotemporal resolution and data availability are greatly limited, which is not applicable for individual slopes. This paper presents new TD correction methods for slopes with both small dimensions and small elevation changes. We simultaneously estimated and eliminated the TD signal from a line-of-sight (LOS) time series through a blind source separation (i.e., independent component analysis). The stratified TD sources were isolated according to a spatially elevation-linked and temporally pe-riodic independent-component (IC), which was determined via a correlation test and power spectrum analysis. Hence, the TD was corrected without the use of any external weather products/meteorological data and had unprecedented spatiotemporal details equivalent to the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. The proposed method was verified using CosmoSkyMed (CSK) and Sentinel-1 (SNT-1) images covering a slope in Tai O, Lantau Island, Hong Kong, and validated using a series of geodetic, meteorological, and hydrological data. Up to 3-4-cm relative TDs were measured in the LOS directions of CSK and SNT-1. The relative TD exhibited a slower incre-ment rate than the slope elevation and was largely affected by specific air conditions (e.g., temperature and humidity) on the SAR image-acquisition days. The analysis of InSAR data yielded reasonably good estimates of millimeter-scale downslope slips (due to increases in pore-water pressure in the wet season) and upslope rebound (due to soil shrinkage in the dry season). It was found that soil swelling and shrinkage of the slope (also known as seasonal ratcheting) and the reclamation were likely regulated by rainfall and sea levels, respectively. Although the slope motion in Tai O was determined to be small (i.e., seasonal variations of 10 mm), the TD correction reduced the root-mean-square error by 42.3%, such that InSAR time-series measurements with millimeter-level accuracy (potentially 1-3 mm) were obtained.

TI  - Development of the TOA-Related Models for PM<sub>2.5</sub> Prediction Pre- and Post-COVID-19 Outbreak over Yangtze River Delta Region of China
T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The lockdown and the strict regulation measures implemented by Chinese government due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic not only decelerated the spread of the virus but also brought a positive effect on the nationwide atmospheric quality. In this study, we extended our previous research on remotely sensed estimation of PM2.5 concentrations in Yangtze River Delta region (i.e., YRD) of China from 2019 to the strict regulation period of 2020 (i.e., 24 Jan, 2020-31 Aug, 2020). Unlike the method using aerosol optical depth (AOD) developed in previous studies, we validated the possibility of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance (i.e., MODIS TOA) at 21 bands in estimating the PM2.5 concentrations in YRD region. Two random forests (i.e., TOA-sig RF and TOA-all RF) incorporated with different MODIS TOA datasets were developed, and the results showed that the TOA-sig RF model performed better with R2 of 0.81 (RMSE=8.07 mu g/m(3)) than TOA-all RF model with R2 of 0.79 (RMSE=9.13 mu g/m(3)). The monthly averaged PM2.5 exhibited the highest value of 50.81 mu g/m(3) in YRD region in January 2020 and sharply decreased from February to August 2020. The annual mean PM2.5 concentrations derived by TOA-sig RF model were 47.74, 32.14, and 21.04 mu g/m(3) in winter, spring, and summer in YRD during the strict regulation period of 2020, respectively, showing much lower values than those in 2019. Our research demonstrated that the PM2.5 concentrations could be effectively estimated by using MODIS TOA reflectance at 21 bands and the random forest.

TI  - Promoting the Development of <i>Astragalus mongholicus</i> Bunge Industry in Guyang County (China) Based on MaxEnt and Remote Sensing
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - To provide high-quality Astragalus mongholicus Bunge to domestic and foreign markets and maintain sustainable development of the A. mongholicus industry, Firstly, we evaluated the impact of environmental factors and planting areas on the A. mongholicus industry. The maximum entropy method (MaxEnt) was utilized to simulate the suitability distribution of A. mongholicus and establish the relationship between the active component contents of A. mongholicus and ecological factors through linear regression analysis. The random forest algorithm was subsequently used to perform feature selection and classification extraction on Sentinel-2 imagery covering the study area. Furthermore, the planting, processing, and sales of A. mongholicus in Guyang County were investigated, and the roles of stakeholders in the value chains were analyzed. The results demonstrated that precipitation of the warmest quarter, minimum temperature of the coldest month, standard deviation of seasonal temperature changes, range of mean annual temperature, and mean diurnal range [mean of monthly (max temp - min temp)] were the five environmental variables that contributed the most to the growth of A. mongholicus. The most influential factor on the distribution of high-quality A. mongholicus was the mean temperature of the coldest quarter. The classification results of image features showed that the planting areas of A. mongholicus was consistent with the suitable planting areas predicted by MaxEnt, which can provide data support to the relevant departments for the macro development of the A. mongholicus industry. In the production of A. mongholicus, 10 value chains were constructed, and the study demonstrated that the behavior of stakeholders, target markets, and the selected planting area had a significant impact on the quality of A. mongholicus.

TI  - Research on remote sensing classification of fruit trees based on Sentinel-2 multi-temporal imageries
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately obtaining the spatial distribution information of fruit tree planting is of great significance to the development of fruit tree growth monitoring, disease and pest control, and yield estimation. In this study, the Sentenel-2 multispectral remote sensing imageries of different months during the growth period of the fruit trees were used as the data source, and single month vegetation indices, accumulated monthly vegetation indices ( n-ary sumation VIs), and difference vegetation indices between adjacent months ( increment VIs) were constructed as input variables. Four conventional vegetation indices of NDVI, PSRI, GNDVI, and RVI and four improved vegetation indices of NDVIre1, NDVIre2, NDVIre3, and NDVIre4 based on the red-edge band were selected to construct a decision tree classification model combined with machine learning technology. Through the analysis of vegetation indices under different treatments and different months, combined with the attribute of Feature_importances_, the vegetation indices of different periods with high contribution were selected as input features, and the Max_depth values of the decision tree model were determined by the hyperparameter learning curve. The results have shown that when the Max_depth value of the decision tree model of the vegetation indices under the three treatments was 6, 8, and 8, the model classification was the best. The accuracy of the three vegetation index processing models on the training set were 0.8936, 0.9153, and 0.8887, and the accuracy on the test set were 0.8355, 0.7611, and 0.7940, respectively. This method could be applied to remote sensing classification of fruit trees in a large area, and could provide effective technical means for monitoring fruit tree planting areas with medium and high resolution remote sensing imageries.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Efforts to combine satellite images from different sources are particularly needed in Land Surface Temperaturebased (LST) studies. This research proposes for the first time, to our knowledge, a Google Earth Engine-based (GEE) 10-m LST system, named Ten-ST-GEE. It is based on both Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 bands. Ten-ST-GEE has the ability to automatically transform 30-m to 10-m LST at Landsat-8 overpass time. Machine learning and regression methods (i.e., OLS, RLS, DisTrad, RF, and SVM) are embedded within this system. Ten-ST-GEE was applied over two agricultural lands and two urban regions in the United States of America and in Lebanon. OLS and RLS showed an RMSE of -1.1 degrees C compared to -2.4 degrees C for DisTrad and -2.5 degrees C for RF and SVM. The open-source and automated Ten-ST-GEE can generate information at the building-level and within the agricultural parcels. It has the potential to be portable to any region across the Globe, aiming at better management of environmental resources.

TI  - Accounting for Lambertian reflection in the assimilation of microwave sounding radiances over snow and sea-ice
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article investigates two aspects aimed at an increased use of surface-sensitive microwave sounding radiances for numerical weather prediction (NWP), namely the assimilation of humidity-sounding radiances from the Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS) over snow, as well as the use of Lambertian reflection in radiative-transfer modelling over snow and sea-ice surfaces for temperature- and humidity-sounding radiances. The Lambertian characteristics are modelled through a parameterisation of the effective zenith angle used to calculate the downwelling radiation in the radiative-transfer model. Using Lambertian rather than specular reflection improves the forward modelling significantly for 183-GHz humidity-sounding channels over snow and sea-ice in comparisons with observations, including a reduction of significant zenith-angle-dependent biases. For temperature-sounding channels in the 50-GHz band, comparisons between observations and background equivalents also suggest improvements from treating snow and sea-ice surfaces as Lambertian or semi-Lambertian, but the characteristics appear more variable and there are indications of other sources of error, such as biases in the skin temperature. For both spectral regions, the improvement from using nonspecular reflection is clearest for snow-covered land surfaces. Assimilation experiments show that the addition of 183-GHz humidity-sounding channels from ATMS over snow-covered land leads to a slight positive impact over higher latitudes in winter. On top of this, replacing the specular surface assumption over snow and sea-ice with a fully Lambertian one for 183-GHz channels on ATMS and semi-Lambertian one for 50-GHz channels on ATMS and the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-A (AMSU-A) means that more observations pass quality control, giving a neutral to slightly positive impact at higher latitudes in winter. Combining the two changes leads to small forecast benefits that are statistically significant up to day 3 at higher latitudes.

AB  - The large number of remote-sensing datasets available necessitates the development of efficient methods when assessing change between such data. A series of techniques, optimizing the analysis of change detection, specifically on large remote-sensing dataset collections, is demonstrated. Iterative (online) statistical measures for mean and standard deviation give the ability to gain a measure of change over potentially hundreds of datasets without excessive computing power being needed. From this, the coefficient of variation can be used to provide further insight. Using such measures, seasonal change can be detected on outcrop (as opposed to vegetation), illustrating that change detection can be used to further extend a spectral signature for rocks. Twelve Sentinel-2 scenes over a 3 year period were used in this study.

AB  - Wetlands in semi-arid regions are highly productive and biologically diverse ecosystems that contribute significantly to livelihood and economic development and play a substantial role in sustaining rural livelihoods. These ecosystems are not only rich in biodiversity, but also predominantly valuable in terms of the services they provide to people, including water security, hydrological regulation, and other services. Chlorophyll-a concentrations and associated dynamics in two tropical wetland systems were estimated in the Makuleke and Nylsvlei wetlands. The Makuleke and Nylsvlei wetlands are in the Limpopo Transboundary River Basin, South Africa. Moderate-resolution Landsat 8 images for September 2018 and June 2019 and in situ field measurements were used to estimate and map chlorophyll-a concentration from the two wetlands. Landsat-derived chlorophyll-a concentrations were validated using field-derived chlorophyll-a measurements. Validation was implemented to assess the consistency of the remotely sensed chlorophyll-a estimates. The relationship between field-measured chlorophyll estimates and Landsat-derived chlorophyll estimates was determined using the coefficient of determination (r-square: R2) and the root mean square error (RMSE). The results showed that the Makuleke wetland had low estimates of Chl-a during September 2018. The variation of Chl-a concentration in Makuleke ranged from 0 to 1.15 mu g/L, whereas for Nylsvlei the wetland range varied between 0 and 1.42 mu g/L, for the period under study. The spatial characterization of Chl-a concentration varied significantly between the two wetlands, with much of it concentrated along the wetland shorelines. The finding of this study underscores the relevance of remotely detected data in the evaluation and routine monitoring of wetland water quality, a previously challenging task within situ measurements.

TI  - Exploring the use of synthetic aperture radar data for irrigation management in super high-density olive orchards
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the plant water-uptake dynamics and behavior in olive orchards is an area of much interest, particularly for efforts to optimize the use and application of water resources. However, plant water-uptake information is rarely available or consistently monitored for large agricultural areas, especially in developing countries. Here we evaluate the potential of using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images to monitor the wateruptake rate in super high-density olive orchards located in the hot and arid desert climate of Saudi Arabia. The experiment was performed using Sentinel-1 data acquired between 2019 and 2020 in concert with in situ sap flow measurements. To date, no study has explored the potential of Sentinel-1 SAR data to assess the wateruptake rate in olive orchards. The results demonstrate that the SAR backscatter increased between January and July/August, and then decreased during the remainder of the year, following a broadly Gaussian distribution. Of key interest is the strength of the relationship between the increasing and decreasing trends of SAR backscatter and the variation in the coincident water-uptake rate measured in situ, producing a coefficient of determination of 0.81 in the VV polarization. As the relationship between the SAR backscatter and water-uptake rate was established for plots with similar tree type and planting density, further exploration of orchards with different characteristics and planting densities is needed to fully understand the potential of SAR data to estimate plant water-uptake. Overall, the study demonstrates that SAR data can track variation in locally measured wateruptake and illustrates the potential to assist with enhancing irrigation management.

TI  - Climatology of cyclones in western and northwestern Iran using reanalysis and remote sensing data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Agriculture and hydrological management in western and northwestern Iran is highly sensitive to precipitation associated with Mediterranean and Sudanese cyclones particularly during spring and winter. Although many studies have focused on the theoretical basis of these cyclones, statistical analyses, especially with satellite observations, have not been undertaken. In this study, 40 cyclones during all months of 2015-2021 are characterized using data collected by Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) dual-frequency precipitation radar (DPR), Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) and ERA5 reanalysis within each cyclone quadrant. The results show that about 45% of cyclones have a lifetime between 1 and 2 days, and approximately 25% occur during April with a secondary peak in March (22.5%). Accordingly, cyclonic rainy days and rainfall amounts peak in April with values of 76.1% and 64.1%, respectively. The lowest (most negative) low- and mid-tropospheric vertical velocity in the southeast and northeast quadrants indicates upward motion, which leads to the most intense latent heat release within the cyclone. Accordingly, the highest rainfall rates occur in the southeast and northeast quadrants, located within and ahead of the highest specific humidity quadrant (southeast) where the warm conveyor belt plays a significant role for rainfall formation. Maximum stratiform and convective rainfall rates are observed in the southwest and southeast quadrants, respectively. The distribution of rainfall rate is consistent with that of the storm-top height pattern in all quadrants. The maximum percentage of warm rain to the total rain (34.6% on average) for both stratiform and convective precipitation falls in the southeast quadrant. The structure of these analysed cyclones is largely similar to that shown previously in the literature. According to the analysed rainfall in different life cycles, it is expected that the cyclones have the greatest impact (i.e., extreme rainfall) during the developing stage in the northeast and southeast quadrants, and during the mature stage in the southwest quadrant. The lowest influence is during the dissipating stage. The results from this study can help decision makers within the hydrological and risk management industries.

TI  - The post-fire stability index; a new approach to monitoring post-fire recovery by satellite imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological resilience is the capacity of a system to maintain function following disturbance. With the frequency and severity of wildfire activity increasing due to warmer and drier global climate conditions, there are increasing reports of declines in ecological resilience and ecosystems at risk of collapse due to post-fire recovery failure. Observational monitoring of post-fire recovery at the landscape scale is important to understand drivers, identify vulnerable ecosystems and prioritize management intervention to support resilience. Defining a suitably representative baseline condition to compare post-fire recovery states against can be challenging, particularly in broad-scale remote sensing approaches. Here, we introduce a new approach to monitoring post-fire recovery by satellite imagery, the post-fire stability index. The method is based on the concept that a disturbed system state will be reflected by increasing or decreasing rates of system change, while undisturbed or recovered system states are characterised by near-zero rates of change. This reflects the typical pattern of diminishing rate of change in post-fire recovery trajectories. We demonstrate strong performance and suitability of the post-fire stability index in comparison to alternative approaches through time series analyses, and independent validation from post-fire vegetation surveys taken at one-year post-fire. The post-fire stability index was consistently the best performing model across all field measures of vegetative response following the fire event. In ecosystems which exhibit post -fire resprouting, higher values in the post-fire stability index were associated with higher levels of field-based measures of foliage projective cover and canopy cover (+/-resprouting), and with lower levels of basal and no resprouting. The post-fire stability index provides a relatively simple and practical solution for consistent broad-scale monitoring post-fire recovery with satellite imagery, which together with standardised fire severity mapping, provide extensive opportunities for further fire and landscape ecology research.

TI  - Effect of Spectral Variability of Aerosol Optical Properties on Direct Aerosol Radiative Effect
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol optical properties depend on wavelength as well as both mixing ratios and size distributions of components that make up a particular type of aerosol. This study examines impacts on direct aerosol radiative effect (DARE) for desert, clean maritime, and polluted maritime aerosol types over the ocean when their optical properties are determined by various combinations of observations made by active (i.e., lidar) and passive (e.g., shortwave spectrometer) satellite sensors. Spectral optical properties are perturbed by altering mixing ratios of components that define aerosol types with assumptions that components within an aerosol type are fixed and only one aerosol type is present in the atmosphere. When 532 nm depolarization ratio from the lidar is used to identify desert aerosol, the uncertainty in the mean DARE due to spectral optical property variabilities is 10%. When the 532 nm depolarization and lidar ratios are used to identify clean and polluted maritime aerosols, uncertainties in mean DARE are, respectively, 4 and 18%. When scattering optical thicknesses are also known to within & PLUSMN; 3% at four passive imager wavelengths (340 nm, 546 nm, 966 nm, and 1,657 nm), uncertainty in the polluted maritime DARE decreases to 8%. Uncertainties in the instantaneous top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflected irradiances derived from observed broadband radiances and angular distribution models are also estimated. When TOA irradiances are derived solely from the nadir view, their uncertainties can be reduced if aerosol type can be identified and aerosol type dependence is considered in the radiance to irradiance conversion. This is especially so for aerosols with a large fraction of nonspherical particles, such as desert aerosols.

TI  - New land tenure fences are still cropping up in the Greater Mara
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Expanding and intensifying anthropogenic land use is one of the greatest drivers of changes of biodiversity loss and political inequality worldwide. In the Greater Mara, Kenya, a trend of private land enclosure is currently happening, led by smallholders wishing to protect and uphold their land titles. Here we expand on previous work by Lovschal et al. quantifying the rapid, large-scale development of fencing infrastructure that began in 1985 but has increased by 170% from 2010 onwards. We provide fine-scale analysis of the spatial and temporal trends in fencing using high-resolution Sentinel-2 imagery. The formally unprotected regions have distinctly more fences than the rest of the Mara, one experiencing a 740% increase in fenced land in four years. Conservancies have an effect in stemming fencing but fences crop up within and along conservancy boundaries. We estimate the actual geographical coverage of the fences in the Mara to be 130,277 ha (19% of the total region) using an error margin of 8%, derived by calibrating our satellite mapping with ground-truth data. The study suggests the need for revising community-based eco-conservation efforts and pursuing a richer understanding of the socio-political and historical dynamics underlying this phenomenon.

TI  - Remote sensing based mapping of Tillandsia fields-A semi-automatic detection approach in the hyperarid coastal Atacama Desert, northern Chile
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Unique fog ecosystems that occur inland along the Chilean coastal desert are dominated by Tillandsia landbeckii. The average annual precipitation in this hyperarid area lies below 1 mm per year. Tillandsia are specialized in the foliar uptake of fog as a main source of water. The detailed mapping of the distribution of Tillandsia is lacking, making it difficult to understand their geo-ecological niche and to determine the impacts that climate change may have on this species. The objective of this study is to create a detailed spatial distribution of Tillandsia in the Atacama Desert in northern Chile based on remote sensing semi-automatic detection process. For this purpose, high-resolution WorldView-3 optical satellite data has been acquired. The extraction of Tillandsia was done with ENVI Deep Learning tools. As a result, a map of Tillandsia has been created. Several fields were found between Cerro Huantajaya in the north and Cerro Soronal in the south in the study area between 800 and 1300 m a.s.l. For validation purposes ground truth data has been used. The overall accuracy of this classification is 92.02%. The results can be used as a basis for geo-ecological niche modeling, further monitoring and for the development of conservation strategies.

TI  - Exploring different indicators for quantifying surface urban heat and cool island together: A case study over two metropolitan cities of India
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The rise of urbanization has led to many critical issues like increased air pollution, emission of more greenhouse gases, sudden climate change, and a rise in temperature of an urban area compared to surrounding rural regions known as urban heat islands (UHI). It becomes crucial to understand the effect of climatic conditions in those areas. In this present research, we have chosen two different cities: Bhopal and Guwahati, situated over different climatic conditions. The study examines the diurnal, seasonal and inter annual variability of surface UHI (SUHI), using MODIS LST (MOD11A2 and MYD11A2) product of 1 km spatial resolution from 2003 to 2018. The temporal trend of LST is estimated using Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope estimator test. This study also evaluates the land use land cover (LULC) change over the two cities using the LULC data. The present research also incorporates the determination of six different driving factors of SUHI starting from built-up area, urban-rural difference in evapotranspiration, black sky albedo, enhanced vegetation index, thermal inertia, and population. Pearson's correlation criteria are used to determine the correlation of SUHI with each of the determinant parameters. The results reveal the presence of a cool urban island during the summer daytime in Bhopal, while Guwahati shows a positive SUHI. The nighttime shows clear evidence and higher SUHI magnitude than the daytime for Bhopal city. Contrary, a reverse phenomenon is evident in Guwahati with higher SUHI magnitude during the daytime compared to nighttime. The negative SUHI variation can be ascribed to rural area dynamics with the majority of cropland cover. The evapotranspiration shows reasonable control of SUHI's daytime variation. Thermal inertia was found to be an influential parameter in explaining the diurnal variation of SUHI.

TI  - Exiting the Anthropocene: Achieving personal and planetary health in the 21st century
T2  - ALLERGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Planetary health provides a perspective of ecological interdependence that connects the health and vitality of individuals, communities, and Earth's natural systems. It includes the social, political, and economic ecosystems that influence both individuals and whole societies. In an era of interconnected grand challenges threatening health of all systems at all scales, planetary health provides a framework for cross-sectoral collaboration and unified systems approaches to solutions. The field of allergy is at the forefront of these efforts. Allergic conditions are a sentinel measure of environmental impact on human health in early life-illuminating how ecological changes affect immune development and predispose to a wider range of inflammatory noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). This shows how adverse macroscale ecology in the Anthropocene penetrates to the molecular level of personal and microscale ecology, including the microbial systems at the foundations of all ecosystems. It provides the basis for more integrated efforts to address widespread environmental degradation and adverse effects of maladaptive urbanization, food systems, lifestyle behaviors, and socioeconomic disadvantage. Nature-based solutions and efforts to improve nature-relatedness are crucial for restoring symbiosis, balance, and mutualism in every sense, recognizing that both personal lifestyle choices and collective structural actions are needed in tandem. Ultimately, meaningful ecological approaches will depend on placing greater emphasis on psychological and cultural dimensions such as mindfulness, values, and moral wisdom to ensure a sustainable and resilient future.

TI  - Does the Reader Fear God for Nothing? A Theological Reflection on the Divine Speeches in Job
T2  - JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - God's speeches in Job 38-41 have been criticized by some for their arrogant tone and celebrated by others for their non-anthropocentric worldview. While these interpretations address important features of the text, they are too simple. Rather than having a non-anthropocentric perspective, God hides his fascination with Job in order to raise him to a new level of selflessness. Similarly, rather than simply being arrogant, God hides his care for Job, which also serves a pedagogical purpose. God wants Job to experience a completely unselfish fear of his maker that does not expect anything in exchange, not even God's loving attention. While readers reflect on Job's response, they also reflect on their own: are they willing to fear God for nothing in return?

TI  - Aboveground biomass and carbon stock assessment in the Eastern Himalaya foothills along the Indo-Bhutan border
T2  - AUSTRALIAN GEOGRAPHER
M3  - Article
AB  - Aboveground biomass (AGB) and the distribution of carbon stock was assessed in a swath of territory along the Indo-Bhutan border. This tract between Brahmaputra river's floodplain and foothills of Eastern Himalayas, is a part of the Indo-Bhutan biodiversity hotspot. Using Landsat satellite data, the analysis assessed spatio-temporal landuse/landcover changes during 1989 and 2019. AGB and carbon stock were estimated using a forest inventory. Total AGB losses were 21.44 and 7.24 Mt in India and Bhutan respectively. Tree density ranged between 107-350 and 253-853 trees ha(-1) in India and Bhutan respectively and tended to decrease with increasing tree diameter. Anthocephalus Chinensis (76 trees ha(-1)), Aphanamixis Polystachya (64), Syzygium Formosum (62) were the most dominant species in India while Quercus Spp (249 trees ha(-1), Abies densa (190), Rhodendron (155) dominated in Bhutan. AGB and carbon losses were more marked in India than Bhutan. Land cover changes were not uniformly spatially distributed throughout the study area and dense forests in India decreased at a rate seven times that of Bhutan's. Consequently, AGB losses in India were three fold those of Bhutan's.

TI  - A new digital elevation model (DEM) dataset of the entire Antarctic continent derived from ICESat-2
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Antarctic digital elevation models (DEMs) are essential for fieldwork, ice motion tracking and the numerical modelling of the ice sheet. In the past 30 years, several Antarctic DEMs derived from satellite data have been published. However, these DEMs either have coarse spatial resolution or aggregate observations spanning several years, which limit their further scientific applications. In this study, the new generation satellite laser altimeter Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) is used to generate a new Antarctic DEM for both the ice sheet and ice shelves. Approximately 4.69 x 10(9) ICESat-2 measurement points from November 2018 to November 2019 are used to estimate surface elevations at resolutions of 500 m and 1 km based on a spatiotemporal fitting method. Approximately 74 % of Antarctica is observed and the remaining observation gaps are interpolated using the normal kriging method. The DEM is formed from the estimated elevations in 500 m and 1 km grid cells, and is finally posted at the resolution of 500 m. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Operation IceBridge (OIB) airborne data are used to evaluate the generated Antarctic DEM (hereafter called the ICESat-2 DEM) in individual Antarctic regions and surface types. Overall, a median bias of -0.19 m and a root-mean-square deviation of 10.83 m result from approximately 5.2 x 10(6) OIB measurement points. The accuracy and uncertainty of the ICESat-2 DEM vary in relation to the surface slope and roughness, and more reliable estimates are found in the flat ice sheet interior. The ICESat-2 DEM is comparable to other DEMs derived from altimetry, stereophotogrammetry and interferometry. Similar results are found when comparing to elevation measurements from kinematic Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) (GPS and the Russian GLONASS) transects. The elevations of high accuracy and ability of annual updates make the ICESat-2 DEM an addition to the existing Antarctic DEM groups, and it can be further used for other scientific applications. The generated ICESat-2 DEM (including the map of uncertainty) can be downloaded from National Tibetan Plateau Data Center, Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences at https://data.tpdc.ac.cn/en/disallow/9427069c-117e-4ff8-96e0-4b18eb7782cb/ (last access: 27 June 2022) (Shen et al., 2021a, https://doi.org/10.11888/Geogra.tpdc.271448).

AB  - Background In 2021, there is an increased global trend for sending sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) specimens for permanent section (PS) without intraoperative frozen sections (FS). This pilot study conducted in Thailand determines the re-operation rate for SLNB without FS. Method We retrospectively reviewed 239 SLNB cases without FS at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital from April 2016 to April 2021. The patients were diagnosed with primary invasive breast cancer with clinically negative nodes. The clinical nodal status was assessed from physical examination. The re-operation rate was determined by the number of positive SLNs; where 3 more nodal metastases were subjected to a second surgical procedure. Result Between April 2016 and April 2021, 239 patients who had undergone SLNB in accordance with ACOSOG Z0011 criteria with PS alone was enrolled. A total of 975 SLNs were removed from these 239 patients, with an average of 4.15 nodes per patient. Out of 239 patients, 21 (8.8%) and 6 (2.5%) had metastatic disease in 1 and 2 nodes, respectively. The remaining 212 (88.7%) patients had no nodal metastasis. None of the patients were subjected to a second surgical procedure. Conclusion We conclude that the implementation of SLNB with PS analysis alone in patients who satisfy the ACOSOG Z0011 criteria, with a re-operation rate of 0%, does not have outcomes that would be altered by the standard of care additional FS analysis. With ommision of FS analysis, operation cost, operative time and anesthetic side effects are projected to decrease.

TI  - Mangrove distribution and afforestation potential in the Red Sea
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove ecosystems represent one of the most effective natural environments for fixing and storing carbon (C). Man-groves also offer significant co-benefits, serving as nurseries for marine species, providing nutrients and food to support marine ecosystems, and stabilizing coastlines from erosion and extreme events. Given these considerations, mangrove afforestation and associated C sequestration has gained considerable attention as a nature-based solution to climate adaptation (e.g., protect against more frequent storm surges) and mitigation (e.g. offsetting other C-producing activi-ties). To advance our understanding and description of these important ecosystems, we leverage Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 satellite data to provide a current assessment of mangrove extent within the Red Sea region and also explore the effect of spatial resolution on mapping accuracy. We establish that Sentinel-2 provides a more precise spatial record of extent and subsequently use these data together with a maximum entropy (MaxEnt) modeling approach to: i) map the distribution of Red Sea mangrove systems, and ii) identify potential areas for future afforestation. From these cur-rent and potential mangrove distribution maps, we then estimate the carbon sequestration rate for the Red Sea (as well as for each bordering country) using a meta-analysis of sequestration values surveyed from the available literature. For the mangrove classification, we obtained mapping accuracies of 98 %, with a total Red Sea mangrove extent estimated at approximately 175 km(2). Based on the MaxEnt approach, which used soil physical and environmental variables to identify the key factors limiting mangrove growth and distribution, an area of nearly 410 km(2) was identified for potential mangrove afforestation expansion. The factors constraining the potential distribution of mangroves were re-lated to soil physical properties, likely reflecting the low sediment load and limited nutrient input of the Red Sea. The current rate of carbon sequestration was calculated as 1034.09 +/- 180.53 Mg C yr(-1), and the potential sequestration rate as 2424.49 +/- 423.26 Mg C yr(-1). While our results confirm the maintenance of a positive trend in mangrove growth over the last few decades, they also provide the upper bounds on above ground carbon sequestration potential for the Red Sea mangroves.

TI  - Zika Virus Replication in a Mast Cell Model is Augmented by Dengue Virus Antibody-Dependent Enhancement and Features a Selective Immune Mediator Secretory Profile
T2  - MICROBIOLOGY SPECTRUM
M3  - Article
AB  - Zika virus and dengue virus are evolutionarily related and structurally similar mosquito-borne Flaviviruses. These congruencies can lead to cross-reactive antibody binding, whereby antibodies generated from previous dengue virus immunity can augment Zika virus replication in vitro. This phenomenon, termed antibody-dependent enhancement, may participate in the clinical manifestations detected in areas with Flavivirus cocirculations where Zika virus is endemic; however, a causal relationship has yet to be determined. The KU812 mast cell/basophil line was integral in identifying the first Flavivirus infection in mast cells and serves as an effective in vitro model to study dengue virus antibody-dependent enhancement. Mast cells, sentinel white blood cells intrinsic in coordinating early immune defenses, are characteristically situated in the intradermal space and are therefore among the first immune cells interfaced with blood-feeding mosquitoes. Here, we tested whether KU812 cells were permissive to Zika virus, how previous dengue virus immunity might augment Zika virus infection, and whether either condition induces an immunological response. We report an antibody-dependent enhancement effect of Zika virus infection in KU812 cells across multiple time points (48, 72, and 96 hours postinfection [hpi]) and a range of multiplicities of infection (4.0 x 10(-3) to 4) using various concentrations of cross-reactive dengue virus monoclonal antibodies (D11C and 1.6D). This antigen-specific antibody-mediated infection was selectively coupled to chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta), and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) secretion and a reduction in granzyme B (GrB) release. Therefore, mast cells and/or basophils may significantly augment Zika virus infection in the context of preexisting dengue virus immunity.IMPORTANCE Antibodies generated against one dengue serotype can enhance infection of another by a phenomenon called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Additionally, antigenic similarities between Zika and dengue viruses can promote Zika virus infection by way of ADE in vitro using these very same anti-dengue antibodies. We used the KU812 cell line to demonstrate for the first time that anti-dengue antibodies enhanced infectious Zika virus replication in a mast cell model and specifically increased CCL5, CXCL10, and IL-1 beta, while also impairing granzyme B secretion. Furthermore, enhanced Zika virus infection and selective mediator release were mechanistically dependent on fragment crystallizable gamma receptor II (Fc gamma RII). These findings establish a new model for Zika virus research and a new subcategory of immune cells previously unexplored in the context of Zika virus enhancement while being some of the very first immune cells likely to meet a blood-feeding infected mosquito.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node mapping in endometrial cancer: A comparison of main national and international guidelines
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGY & OBSTETRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives To compare national and international guidelines regarding sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping in endometrial cancer. Methods A descriptive comparative study of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), the Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO), the European Society of Gynecological Oncology (ESGO), the British Gynecological Cancer Society (BGCS), and the Japan Society of Gynecologic Oncology (JSGO) guidelines. Results There is a broad consensus that SLN mapping is an appropriate alternative to pelvic lymphadenectomy for uterine-confined endometrioid endometrial cancer (five of five guidelines). It is broadly accepted that a full lymphadenectomy should be performed in case of failed SLN mapping (four of five guidelines), and that mapping with the fluorescent dye indocyanine green is superior to other methods (four of five guidelines). It is agreed that the cervix is the preferable site for dye injection (four of five guidelines), and pathology ultrastaging is advocated by most guidelines (three of five guidelines). Regarding high-risk patients (i.e., high-grade histology and non-endometroid carcinomas), some guidelines accept (three of five), but others currently do not advocate (one of five guidelines), SLN mapping as a sole method for lymph node evaluation. There is no consensus regarding para-aortic lymph node evaluation in pelvic SLN-positive patients. Conclusion Guidelines for SLN mapping are comparable with regards to surgical technique, ultrastaging, and management in case of failed mapping. Nevertheless, some variations exist regarding the management of high-grade histology and positive pelvic lymph nodes.

TI  - Pattern and prognostic value of lymph node metastasis in sinonasal mucosal melanoma
T2  - ENT-EAR NOSE & THROAT JOURNAL
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Objective To analyze the pattern of lymph node (LN) metastasis and its effect on prognosis in sinonasal mucosal melanoma (SNMM). Methods This retrospective study was conducted based on the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program data. Survival outcomes were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Factors were compared between groups using log-rank test and Fisher's exact test, and prognostic factors were screened using the Cox proportional hazards model. Propensity score matching (PSM) was conducted to examine the treatment differences after accounting for sex, age, race, T stage, N stage, and M stage. Results Level I (57.1%) and level II (53.6%) nodes were the most common sites of lymph node metastasis, followed by level III (17.9%) and IV (17.9%) nodes. T stage, M stage, and tumor size were associated with LN metastasis. The 5-year overall survival rates for patients without and with LN metastasis were 35.2% and 5.3%, respectively. Conclusions Level I and II lymph nodes may be the sentinel nodes of SNMM, Advanced T stage and increasing tumor size could promote LN metastasis. LN metastasis may promote distant metastasis and remains an important prognostic factor for patients with SNMM.

TI  - Applying landscape fragmentation analysis to icescape environments: potential impacts for the Pacific walrus (Odobenus rosmarus divergens)
T2  - POLAR RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea-ice cover across the Arctic has declined rapidly over the past several decades owing to amplified climate warming. The Pacific walrus (Odobenus rosmarus divergens) relies on sea-ice floes in the St. Lawrence Island (SLI) and Wainwright regions of the Bering and Chukchi seas surrounding Alaska as a platform for rest, feeding and reproduction. Lower concentrations of thick ice floes are gen-erally associated with earlier seasonal fragmentation and shorter annual per-sistence of sea-ice cover, potentially affecting the life history of the Pacific walrus. In this study, 24 Landsat satellite images were classified into thick ice, thin ice or open water to assess sea-ice fragmentation over the spring-summer breakup period. Geospatial fragmentation analyses traditionally used in terres-trial landscapes were newly implemented in this study to characterize the ices -cape environment. Fragmentation of sea ice was assessed based on the Percent of Landscape, Number of Patches, Mean Area, Shape Index, Euclidean Nearest Neighbor and Edge Density. Results show that lower sea-ice concentrations in both the SLI and Wainwright regions were associated with smaller sea-ice floes. In the Bering Sea, lower sea-ice concentrations were also associated with increases in the number of ice floes, floe isolation and edge density. By contrast, lower sea-ice concentrations in the Chukchi Sea were associated with ice floes that were more circular in shape. The continuation of sea-ice decline with shift-ing icescape characteristics may result in walruses having to swim longer dis-tances in the northern Bering Sea and adapt to use less-preferred, rounder ice floes in the Chukchi Sea.

TI  - Data Integration for Lithological Mapping Using Machine Learning Algorithms
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study is to compare and evaluate the performances of different classification algorithms (Maximum Likelihood Classification [MLC], Random Forest [RF], Support Vector Machine [SVM], and Neural Network [NN]) with data integration for lithological classification in partly vegetated areas. The optical (ASTER), SAR (Sentinel-1) images and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data were used as classification inputs. The study area used in this work is located in the western part of Antalya Province of Turkey and is characterized by relatively high relief and good exposure of numerous lithological classes. Five data sets were used for input to the classifiers: (1) Sentinel-1 image with its polarimetric bands (i.e. VV, HH, VH, HV), (2) ASTER image, (3) ASTER image with DEM, (4) the integration of ASTER and Sentinel-1 images, and (5) the integration of ASTER, DEM and Sentinel-1 data. Classification of the five input data sets by each of the four classifiers generated a total of 20 output images. The SVM algorithm produced the best overall classification accuracies (averaging 94.18% of three models for all data integrated) and the MLC algorithm produced the worst classification accuracy (averaging 35.75% of three models when using the Sentinel-1 polarimetric images as input). Regardless of the classifier algorithms, the accuracy values obtained in the classification using only ASTER data were found to be between 81.34% and 88.09% for averaging all models. On the other hand, when Sentinel-1 and DEM data were added to the optical data sets, the classification accuracies for the average of all models increased to values between 90.18% and 94.18%.

TI  - A vegetation carbon isoscape for Australia built by combining continental-scale field surveys with remote sensing
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context Maps of C-3 and C-4 plant abundance and stable carbon isotope values (delta C-13) across terrestrial landscapes are valuable tools in ecology to investigate species distribution and carbon exchange. Australia has a predominance of C-4-plants, thus monitoring change in C-3:C-4 cover and delta C-13 is essential to national management priorities. Objectives We applied a novel combination of field surveys and remote sensing data to create maps of C-3 and C-4 abundance in Australia, and a vegetation delta C-13 isoscape for the continent. Methods We used vegetation and land-use rasters to categorize grid-cells (1 ha) into woody (C-3), native herbaceous, and herbaceous cropland (C-3 and C-4) cover. Field surveys and environmental factors were regressed to predict native C-4 herbaceous cover. These layers were combined and a delta C-13 mixing model was used to calculate site-averaged delta C-13 values. Results Seasonal rainfall, maximum summer temperature, and soil pH were the best predictors of C-4 herbaceous cover. Comparisons between predicted and observed values at field sites indicated our approach reliably predicted generalised C-3:C-4 abundance. Southern Australia, which has cooler temperatures and winter rainfall, was dominated by C-3 vegetation and low delta C-13 values. C-4-dominated areas included northern savannahs and grasslands. Conclusions Our isoscape approach is distinct because it incorporates remote sensing products that calculate cover beneath the canopy, the influence of local factors, and extensive validation, all of which are critical to accurate predictions. Our models can be used to predict C-3:C-4 abundance under climate change, which is expected to substantially alter current C-3:C-4 abundance patterns.

TI  - Rapid loss in landscape connectivity after the peace agreement in the Andes-Amazon region
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a complex interplay of criminal groups' control over land, illicit activities, and forest cover change in the Colombian Andes-Amazon region. This area is dealing with diverse forms of conflict and peace, directly impacting landscape connectivity. While many studies have docu-mented rapid deforestation after the peace agreement in 2016, we know little about the effect of these socio-political changes on the state of landscape connectivity. We disentangle habitat from connected habitat in forest ecosystems using the Landsat archive and landscape connectivity indices. We find that in the Andes-Amazon region during 2000-2020, connected habitat loss reached 18%, while habitat loss was 13%. This result is worrisome because it indicates that well-connected patches are more fragmented and isolated, affecting the natural connections between the Andes and Amazon biogeographical regions and the movement ability of species. The Colombian government should conduct a strategic peacebuilding process incorporating structural changes that prevent the increase of large-scale extractive activities that are often illegal in the region. While finding a balance between extractive activities and conservation remains a big challenge, legal land tenure, census/taxation, and specific agreements with local actors can initially prevent deforestation. We discourage localized military actions and the return of aerial fumigation of coca fields, which rather than stop deforestation might exacerbate land cover change deeper into pristine forests.

TI  - Overuse of Axillary Surgery in Patients with Ductal Carcinoma In Situ: Opportunity for De-escalation
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is noninvasive breast cancer and therefore nodal staging is not routinely recommended. We evaluated the use of and factors associated with axillary surgery in DCIS in the National Cancer Database (NCDB). Methods DCIS cases were identified from the NCDB 2012-2018. Use of axillary surgery was evaluated over time, and factors associated with axillary surgery were assessed for breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and mastectomy groups. Results We identified 178,762 patients, median age of 60 years. Majority of DCIS (87%) was ER-positive, and 14% low, 43% intermediate, and 44% high grade. Median DCIS size was 1.1 cm. BCS was performed in 72%, whereas 28% had mastectomy. Overall axillary surgery was performed in 38% and was higher in patients undergoing mastectomy compared with patients undergoing BCS (88% vs. 19%, p < 0.001). At axillary surgery, the vast majority (92%) had 1-5 nodes examined, whereas 8% had >5 nodes examined. Over time, axillary surgery decreased in BCS patients (21% in 2012 to 17% in 2018, p < 0.001) but increased slightly in mastectomy patients (86% in 2012 to 90% in 2018, p < 0.001). On multivariable analysis, factors significantly associated with axillary surgery were younger patient age, larger tumor size, higher grade, and ER-negative status. Conclusions Factors associated with axillary surgery reflect higher risk disease for upstage to invasive cancer, indicating surgeon judgment. However, despite axillary surgery being overtreatment of DCIS, it is common in mastectomy and is performed for one in five patients undergoing BCS. This provides opportunity for improvement in breast cancer care delivery.

TI  - Monitoring trends in global vegetation fire hot spots using MODIS data
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - We identified hot spots trends in global vegetation fires based on 10-year long MODIS fire products. Additionally, we analyzed the occurrence of fire hot spots across climate zones, global land cover and global biodiversity hot spots. Fire hot spot zones were delineated by combining annual fire data with spatial statistics and space-time pattern mining. Spatial analysis shows no statistically significant trends of increase or decrease of vegetation fires from 2011 to 2020. Within the global vegetation fire hot spots, intensifying hot spots (38.1%) dominate followed by consecutive hot spots (30.5%), persistent hot spots (14.2%), sporadic hot spots (6.2%), oscillating hot spots (4.6%) and new hot spots (3.5%). The results shows that Africa has the highest fire hot spot area in the world which was dominated by a tropical savanna and hot semi-arid (steppe) climates. Future efforts should be focused towards the standardization of the techniques to enable identification of near real time vulnerable zones, predict fire risk areas, and evaluation of the management effectiveness for climate change mitigation and conservation policies.

TI  - Amyloid deposition with a granulomatous reaction in a resection specimen: A clue for a pre-existing Merkel cell carcinoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF CUTANEOUS PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is an aggressive, highly metastatic, cutaneous neuroendocrine malignancy with poor prognosis. Here, we describe a MCC excision specimen with a rare case of tumor-associated amyloid deposition in the absence of residual tumor cells. A 72-year-old man presented with a lesion of 5-6 months' duration on his left elbow, clinically thought to be a ganglion cyst. The biopsy specimen revealed a Stage IIA MCC with classic histomorphologic and immunophenotypic findings, with tumor extending to the tissue edges. The patient underwent wide local excision with negative margins and a negative sentinel lymph node biopsy. Although the patient did not receive any presurgical chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or targeted therapy, the re-excision specimen showed only amphophilic, feathery deposits that were salmon-pink with Congo red stain and further confirmed as amyloid by electron microscopy; there were no residual carcinoma cells. Amyloid deposition in MCC has been described in rare case reports. Our case was extraordinary in that there was only amyloid deposition and an associated granulomatous reaction, without identifiable MCC cells. This case demonstrates that amyloid deposition may be evidence of a prior MCC at the site of a prior procedure and may warrant careful evaluation for residual MCC.

TI  - The implementation of a noninvasive lymph node staging (NILS) preoperative prediction model is cost effective in primary breast cancer
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The need for sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in clinically node-negative (cN0) patients is currently questioned. Our objective was to investigate the cost-effectiveness of a preoperative noninvasive lymph node staging (NILS) model (an artificial neural network model) for predicting pathological nodal status in patients with cN0 breast cancer (BC). Methods A health-economic decision-analytic model was developed to evaluate the utility of the NILS model in reducing the proportion of cN0 patients with low predicted risk undergoing SLNB. The model used information from a national registry and published studies, and three sensitivity/specificity scenarios of the NILS model were evaluated. Subgroup analysis explored the outcomes of breast-conserving surgery (BCS) or mastectomy. The results are presented as cost (euro) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per 1000 patients. Results All three scenarios of the NILS model reduced total costs (-euro93,244 to -euro398,941 per 1000 patients). The overall health benefit allowing for the impact of SLNB complications was a net health gain (7.0-26.9 QALYs per 1000 patients). Sensitivity analyses disregarding reduced quality of life from lymphedema showed a small loss in total health benefits (0.4-4.0 QALYs per 1000 patients) because of the reduction in total life years (0.6-6.5 life years per 1000 patients) after reduced adjuvant treatment. Subgroup analyses showed greater cost reductions and QALY gains in patients undergoing BCS. Conclusion Implementing the NILS model to identify patients with low risk for nodal metastases was associated with substantial cost reductions and likely overall health gains, especially in patients undergoing BCS.

TI  - Investigating the Role of Normative Support in Atheists' Perceptions of Meaning Following Reminders of Death
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - According to terror management theory, humans rely on meaningful and permanence-promising cultural worldviews, like religion, to manage mortality concerns. Prior research indicates that, compared to religious individuals, atheists experience lower levels of meaning in life following reminders of death. The present study investigated whether reminders of death would change atheists' meaning in life after exposure to normative support for atheism. Atheists (N = 222) were either reminded of death or a control topic (dental pain) and exposed to information portraying atheism as either common or rare, and then asked to rate their perceived meaning in life. Results showed that reminders of death reduced meaning in life among atheists who were told that atheism is common. Results were consistent with the view that atheism reflects the rejection of religious faith rather than a meaningful secular terror managing worldview. Discussion considers implications for maintaining healthy existential wellbeing, identifies limitations, and highlights future research directions.

TI  - How decolonizing/indigenizing schooling can build community: A fictional case study on bringing ?spirituality? back to learning*
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on various true anecdotes from several educators, including the author, this fictional story tells about the journey of a fictional non-Indigenous person named Larry Oliver. As a public school teacher, professor, and school principal, he commits himself to decolonize and Indigenize education. His motivation stems from a life-changing experience that brought him to understand how our Indigenous worldview offers a way for schools to help re-balance our out-of-balance world. Larry's adventures bring him to realize four main barriers to bringing worldview reflection into the classroom. They include (1) Authoritarianism, (2) Fearfulness, (3) Loss of placebased knowledge, and (4) Absence of nature-based spirituality. Larry's story reveals how replacing or modifying our dominant worldview with the one that guided humanity relatively effectively for most of our history is a vital goal on behalf of future generations. This article can help educators see decolonizing as an urgent and immediate goal and reimagine critical pedagogy by partnering it with a sense of spiritual oneness.

TI  - A novel approach for characterization of multibeam communication payloads
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING
M3  - Article
AB  - Communication payload architecture has changed from a conventional single broad beam to a large number of spot beam forms to meet the ever-increasing data rate demand. Owing to the large telecommunication requirements of the user, current generation satellites are equipped with a large number of transponders/beams. Due to the increased number of payload beams, performance evaluation and validation time increases during all stages of the satellite integration process. Also, satellite testing in thermal-vacuum (TVAC) conditions is hugely cost-intensive. Under such circumstances, the conventional test setup established for multibeam payload characterization presents limitations and increases overall measurement time. The paper proposes a novel switch matrix (SWM) based architecture for integrated multibeam payload characterization at payload input and output to significantly reduce effective uplink and downlink transmission line chains required for RF characterization without compromising overall measurement accuracy. We have developed a Telecommand and Telemetry (TCTM) simulator system for closed-loop automated switching of switches in SWM to reduce human intervention and ensure safety aspects of payload. We present the SWM approach for two classes of high throughput satellites (HTS), namely, symmetrical and asymmetrical architectures. The results show that the proposed approach is robust and advantageous in overall RF performance, reduction in the number of interfaces, electromagnetic interference and electromagnetic susceptibility (EMI/EMC) considerations, electrical integrity, and ground test setup complexity compared with conventional characterization philosophy.

TI  - Potential effects of Land Use Land Cover Change on streamflow over the Sokoto Rima River Basin
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - This research investigated the effects of Land Use Land Cover Change (LULCC) over the Sokoto Rima River Basin (SRRB) using a setup of Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) atmospheric model to generate the parameters to force WRF hydrological (WRF-Hydro) model which comprises of a parent domain at 12km horizontal reso-lution with an updated MODIS Land Use (LU) data and the nested domain at 4km resolution which focuses on the SRRB. The calibration of the model was done by modifying the infiltration and the Manning's roughness pa-rameters. WRF-Hydro model was used to run simulations with the control LU and five different LU scenarios generated for Urban (Ur), Grassland (Gr), Savanna (Sa), Forest (Fr) and Barren (Ba). For the period analysed, simulation with Gr scenario increased streamflow in all the forecast points, while the Sa decreases it. A strong correlation was noted between the input precipitation and streamflow for all LU scenarios, and a significant Specific Discharge to Rainfall (SDR) for Ur, Fr and Ba scenarios. There was an increase in streamflow in the dry period due to afforestation and a decrease due to deforestation. Areas where grasslands were converted into savanna showed a little increase in evapotranspiration ET. There was more ET for the Sa scenario than the Gr scenario in the wet period, while there was more ET in the dry period for Gr scenario than it is for the Sa scenario. The study has shown that ET is a major factor to changes in streamflow due to LU changes over the basin. The sensitivity of the model to LULCC is reasonable, but more research is recommended to compare results with different hydrological model popularly used for LULCC impact studies.

TI  - Safety and Immunogenicity of an mRNA-Based Human Metapneumovirus and Parainfluenza Virus Type 3 Combined Vaccine in Healthy Adults
T2  - OPEN FORUM INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV3) cause respiratory tract illness in children and the elderly. No licensed vaccines are available. Methods In this phase 1, randomized, dose-ranging, first-in-human study, the safety, reactogenicity, and humoral immunogenicity of an investigational mRNA-based hMPV and PIV3 combination vaccine, mRNA-1653, were evaluated in healthy adults aged 18-49 years. Sentinel participants (n = 20) received 2 doses of mRNA-1653 (25, 75, 150, or 300 mu g) in the dose escalation phase, and participants (n = 104) received 2 doses of mRNA-1653 (75, 150, or 300 mu g) or placebo in the dose selection phase; injections were 28 days apart. Results The most common solicited reactogenicity events were injection site pain, headache, fatigue, and myalgia, the majority of which were grade 1 or 2. A single mRNA-1653 dose increased neutralization titers against hMPV and PIV3 1 month after vaccination compared with baseline. No notable increases in neutralizing antibody titers were observed with escalating dose levels after mRNA-1653, although no statistical inferences were made; a second mRNA-1653 dose had little observable impact on antibody titers. Neutralizing titers through 1 year remained above baseline for hMPV and returned to baseline for PIV3. Conclusions mRNA-1653 was well tolerated, with an acceptable safety profile and increased hMPV and PIV3 neutralization titers in healthy adults.

TI  - Establishing a Guide for Developing Organizational Support in Healthcare Following a Critical or Sentinel Event
T2  - QUALITATIVE HEALTH RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Health professionals require support and recognition to help manage the well-known impact of critical or sentinel events relating to patient care. The potential distress can be magnified or mitigated by the response of the organization and colleagues. However, strategies that are accessible, relevant, and effective in the aftermath of a poor outcome are not well established. Using an action research methodology, a support tool was collaboratively designed, developed, and evaluated in a maternity service of one organization and adapted to the mental health and addiction service in another. Four principles that are intrinsic to the establishment of support tools became apparent across the two settings. Through applying these criteria to the customization of the support tool, it became relevant within the new service setting, and an implementation guide for other organizations was created. Although undertaken pre-pandemic, insights derived from this study may benefit post-pandemic situations where the need for health professional support is even greater.

TI  - Polymetallic mineralization prospectivity modelling using multi-geospatial data in logistic regression: The Diapiric Zone, Northeastern Algeria
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Prospecting and exploring minerals present major challenges in tectonically complex regions for sustainable development as in Northeastern Algeria. This area is promising for its mineral potential, especially the metallogenic province 'The Diapiric Zone'. This study concerns mapping and predicting potential polymetallic mineralization locations by integration of remote sensing, gravity, and magnetic datasets. Several enhancement and processing methods have been applied on Landsat8_OLI and ASTER_1T remote sensed data to reduce uncertainty for achieving the best detection of hydrothermal alteration zones and lithological mapping. Furthermore, the Centre for Exploration Targeting grid analysis technique, the contact occurrence density and entropy orientation tools were employed on ground-gravity and aeromagnetic data to understand and visualize the pathways for hydrothermal fluids circulation of mineral deposits. The polymetallic mineralization prospective areas were produced using a logistic regression model on the resulting multifactor. High zones of lead-zinc cover most the area that has been confirmed by field investigation.

TI  - Short-term temporal and spatial analysis for post-fire vegetation regrowth characterization and mapping in a Mediterranean ecosystem using optical and SAR image time-series
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study, the temporal and spatial dynamics of the post-fire recovery of different Mediterranean vegetation types during the three years after the fire event were analyzed, according to different fire severity categories, integrating the use of Synthetic Aperture Satellite Radar (SAR) (Sentinel-1) and optical (Sentinel-2) image time series. The results showed that Mediterranean forest species and shrub/herbaceous species are adapted to fire, with high efficiency in restoring the vegetation cover. Differently, the ecological vulnerability of non-native eucalyptus plantations was found in a lower recovery trend during the observation period. The use of optical short-wave infrared (SWIR) and SAR C-band-based data revealed that some ecological characteristics, such as the woody biomass and structure, recovered at slower rates, comparing to those suggested by using near-infrared (NIR) and red-edge data. An optimized burn recovery ratio (BRR) was proposed to estimate and map the spatial distribution of the degree of vegetation recovery.

TI  - The short term safety of COVID-19 vaccines in Australia: AusVaxSafety active surveillance, February - August 2021
T2  - MEDICAL JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To assess the short term safety of the COVID-19 vaccines Comirnaty (Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2) and Vaxzevria (AstraZeneca ChAdOx1) in Australia. Design: Prospective observational cohort study; online surveys by AusVaxSafety, a national active vaccine safety surveillance system, three and eight days after vaccination. Setting, participants: People aged 16 years or more who received COVID-19 vaccines at sentinel vaccination hubs, general practices, or Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation clinics, 22 February - 30 August 2021. Main outcome measures: Primary outcome: proportion of respondents who reported any adverse event following immunisation (AEFI) 0-3 days after vaccination. Secondary outcomes: proportions of respondents who reported specific adverse events or medical review for AEFI within seven days of vaccination; impact on usual daily activities; recovery. Results: 4 851 480 people received COVID-19 vaccines at participating sentinel sites during the study period (25% of all COVID-19 vaccine doses administered in Australia to 30 August 2021). 3 035 983 people responded to both surveys (response rate, 62.6%); 35.9% of respondents reported one or more AEFI 0-3 days after Comirnaty dose 1, 54.7% after Comirnaty dose 2, 52.8% after Vaxzevria dose 1, and 22.0% after Vaxzevria dose 2. Local pain, fatigue, headache, and myalgia were the most frequently reported symptoms. After adjusting for demographic characteristics, vaccination site type, jurisdiction, and self-reported medical conditions, the odds of reporting any AEFI were higher for women than men (range of adjusted odd ratios [aORs], by vaccine and dose, 1.53-1.84), for people with a history of anaphylaxis (aOR range, 1.28-1.45), and for people reporting certain underlying conditions, including obesity (aOR range, 1.15-1.75), immunodeficiency (aOR range, 1.04-2.24), or chronic inflammatory disease (aOR range, 1.05-1.75). 0.9% of respondents sought medical advice in the three days following vaccination, most frequently after Comirnaty dose 2 (1.4%) and Vaxzevria dose 1 (1.2%). Conclusion: AusVaxSafety active surveillance affirms the short term safety profile of Comirnaty and Vaxzevria vaccines in a large population sample during the first six months of the Australian COVID-19 vaccination program.

TI  - Impact of rainfall variability and land-use changes on river discharge in Sanaga catchment (forest-savannah transition zone in Central Africa)
T2  - HYDROLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change/variability and land-use changes are the main forcings of river discharges variability. However, an understanding of their simultaneous impacts on river discharges remains limited in some parts of the world like in Central Africa. To shed light on this issue, the objective of this article was to investigate the effects of rainfall variability and land-use changes on river discharges in the Sanaga watershed (at Song Mbengue and Nachtigal gauging stations) and some of its sub-watersheds (Mbakaou, Lom Pangar, Magba and Bamendjing) over the 5 or 7 recent decades (depending on the data availability). To achieve this goal, hydrometeorological data of the Sanaga watershed and sub-watersheds were analyzed using the Pettitt and Mann-Kendall tests. Likewise, land-use changes in the watershed and sub-watersheds were also analyzed using supervised classifications of Landsat satellite images of the watersheds at two periods (1984 and 2020). The results show that annual rainfall decreased throughout the Sanaga watershed. This decrease is only statistically significant for the Sanaga watershed at Nachtigal (-5%), for which the study focused on relatively longer hydropluviometric series, including the 1950 and 1960 s (wet decades). However, although the rainfall decreased in this watershed, the flows increased insignificantly according to the tests used in most cases. The 2010 s seems particularly concerned by this increase, including in the Sanaga watershed at Nachtigal, where the general trend is downward. The flows increase in the Sanaga watershed would be the consequence of the increase in impervious areas in the latter (between +181.3 and +1,300% for built and roads and between +4.1 and +11.9% for bare soils), which would compensate for the drop in precipitation by increasing runoff. These results could be used for long-term planning of water demand and use in this watershed, as well as for improving future simulations of flows.

TI  - Wildfires in the Arctic and tropical biomes: what is the relative role of climate?
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study seeks to use machine learning to investigate the role of meteorological and climate variables on wildfire occurrence in the Arctic and the global tropical forests biomes. Using monthly fire counts observed by the MODIS satellites in combination with temperature and precipitation data, indices of large-scale atmospheric and oceanic anomalies (teleconnections), and global temperature anomalies (GT), a combined wavelet-machine learning approach is developed to identify drivers of variability in global wildfire counts on a monthly scale. Precipitation and temperature are found to be the most important predictors of wildfire count in all regions. In addition, the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and GT are identified as the two major drivers of wildfire occurrence. Results indicate that the record-breaking 2019 wildfires in the Asian Arctic can be attributed to unusually warm and dry weather, while the recent increase in wildfires in Amazonia rather can be attributed to regional human activities.

TI  - Glacier mass change on the Kamchatka Peninsula, Russia, from 2000 to 2016
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - On the Kamchatka Peninsula in the Russian Far East, 405 glaciers with an estimated total mass of 49 Gt were reported in the 1970s. These have been retreating at an accelerated rate since the start of the 21st century. Because glacier studies in this region are scarce, ice loss and its influence on sea level rise and regional environments is poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed satellite data to quantify glacier mass change from 2000 to 2016 in six major glacier-covered regions on the peninsula. The mean rate of the glacier mass change over the study period was -0.46 +/- 0.01 m w.e. a(-1) (total mass change was -4.9 +/- 0.1 Gt, -304.2 +/- 9.1 Mt a(-1)), which is slightly lower than other regions in mid-latitude and subarctic zones. The mass loss accelerated from >-0.33 +/- 0.02 m w.e. a(-1) in the period 2000-2006/2010 to <-1.65 +/- 0.12 m w.e. a(-1) in 2006/2010-2015/16. The increase in mass loss is attributed to a rise in average decadal summer temperatures observed in the region (+0.68 degrees C from 1987-99 to 2000-13). Moreover, a recent trend in Pacific decadal oscillation suggests future acceleration of mass loss due to a decline in winter precipitation.

TI  - Impact of Holuhraun volcano aerosols on clouds in cloud-system-resolving simulations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Increased anthropogenic aerosols result in an enhancement in cloud droplet number concentration (N-d), which consequently modifies the cloud and precipitation process. It is unclear how exactly the cloud liquid water path (LWP) and cloud fraction respond to aerosol perturbations. A volcanic eruption may help to better understand and quantify the cloud response to external perturbations, with a focus on the short-term cloud adjustments. The goal of the present study is to understand and quantify the response of clouds to a selected volcanic eruption and to thereby advance the fundamental understanding of the cloud response to external forcing. In this study we used the ICON (ICOsahedral Non-hydrostatic) model in its numerical weather prediction setup at a cloud-system-resolving resolution of 2.5 km horizontally, to simulate the region around the Holuhraun volcano for 1 week (1-7 September 2014). A pair of simulations, with and without the volcanic aerosol plume, allowed us to assess the simulated effective radiative forcing and its mechanisms, as well as its impact on adjustments of LWP and cloud fraction to the perturbations of N-d. In comparison to MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite retrievals, a clear enhancement of N-d due to the volcanic aerosol is detected and attributed. In contrast, no changes in either LWP or cloud fraction could be attributed. The on average almost unchanged LWP is a result of some LWP enhancement for thick clouds and a decrease for thin clouds.

TI  - Lymphatic Mapping and Sentinel Node Biopsy in High-Grade Uterine Cancers
T2  - CURRENT ONCOLOGY REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of Review Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping has been adopted as an acceptable method of lymph node evaluation in the surgical staging for low-grade endometrial cancer. In this review, we analyze the literature on the utility of SLN mapping in high-grade endometrial cancer. Recent Findings SLN mapping in high-grade endometrial cancer demonstrates similar high detection rates and diagnostic accuracy as seen in low-grade endometrial cancers. However, obtaining sufficient operator experience (at least 30 cases) and following SLN mapping algorithm continues to be essential to preserving diagnostic accuracy. Although limited in retrospective study design and short-term follow-up, current studies have not demonstrated inferior survival outcomes of SLN mapping compared to traditional lymphadenectomy. SLN mapping is an acceptable and accurate method of lymph node evaluation in high-grade endometrial cancer. Future prospective studies are needed to evaluate long-term oncologic outcomes between SLN mapping and systematic lymphadenectomy in this patient population.

TI  - Mapping Forest Degradation and Contributing Factors in a Tropical Dry Forest
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest degradation reduces biomass density, contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, and affects biodiversity and natural resources available for local communities. Previous studies have reported that gross emissions from forest degradation might be higher than from deforestation, due to the larger area affected by the first process. The quantification of forest degradation with remote sensing has large uncertainty, mainly because the subtle and gradual changes in forest are challenging to detect, and sometimes these changes happen below the canopy cover which the optical sensors cannot see. The objective of this work is to map the degraded forests and the most relevant biophysical and socio-economic factors contributing to such degradation in the dry tropics. We mapped the degraded forests by modeling forest biophysical parameters with multi-temporal optical data of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 and identified the most relevant biophysical and socio-economic factors that can be associated with forest degradation. We included three biophysical variables and 11 socio-economic variables including parceled land and land in ejido property and used multiple linear regression to relate those variables with identified degraded forests. We identified 62,878 ha of tropical dry forest in a degraded state, cover 49.91% of the forest area. The most relevant biophysical factor was distance to settlements and the most relevant socio-economic factor was percentage of parceled land property (private land). Both factors were negatively associated with the mapped degraded forests. Since parceled land and land in ejido property are strongly and positively correlated (Pearson's r = 0.82, p < 0.001), it suggests that ejido property, as a form of land tenure, plays an important role in preventing forest degradation. This experiment presents a possible way to measure and understand degradation which may help finding solutions to slow down forest degradation and promote forest restoration.

TI  - Object based classification of a riparian environment using ultra-high resolution imagery, hierarchical landcover structures, and image texture
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover mapping is an important part of resource management, planning, and economic predictions. Improvements in remote sensing, machine learning, image processing, and object based image analysis (OBIA) has made the process of identifying land cover types increasingly faster and reliable but these advances have not been able to utilize all of the information encompassed within ultra-high (sub-meter) resolution imagery. There have been few known attempts to try and maximize this detailed information in high resolution imagery using advanced textural components. Hierarchical land classes are also rarely used as an attribute within the machine learning step of object-based image analysis. In this study we try to circumnavigate the inherent problems associated with high resolution imagery by combining well researched data transformations that aid the OBIA process with a seldom used texture transformation in Geographic Object Based Image Analyses (GEOBIA/OBIA) known as the Gabor Transform and the hierarchal organization of landscapes. We will observe the difference made in segmentation and classification accuracy of a random forest classifier when we fuse a Gabor transformed image to a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), high resolution multi-spectral imagery (RGB and NIR) and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) derived canopy height model (CHM) within a riparian area in Southeast Iowa, United States. Additionally, we will observe the effects on classification accuracy when adding multi-scale land cover data to objects. Both, the addition of hierarchical information and Gabor textural information, could aid the GEOBIA process in delineating and classifying the same objects that human experts would delineate within this riparian landscape.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Evolution of Urban Green Space Pattern Based on GIS Sensors and Remote Sensing Information: Taking Xi'an as an Example
T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to solve the practical application of the continuously developing remote sensing technology in urban planning, this paper proposes a method of temporal and spatial evolution of urban green spatial pattern based on GIS remote sensing information. Based on the Landsat Image data of the main urban area of Xi'an from 2000 to 2012, different classification methods are used to extract the urban green space information and compare the accuracy. The classification results with high accuracy are selected to analyze the temporal and spatial evolution law of urban green space and the change of landscape pattern in the study area. In this paper, the change of vegetation coverage can be divided into five levels: significant degradation: 0.006. The results of this paper prove that this method can be used to understand and evaluate the ecological consequences of urbanization and improve our quality of life. At the same time, it can provide basic information for decision-making.

TI  - Emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds from urban green spaces in the six core districts of Beijing based on a new satellite dataset
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban green spaces (UGSs) are often positively associated with the health of urban residents. However, UGSs may also have adverse health effects by releasing biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) and increasing the ambient concentrations of ozone (O-3) and secondary organic aerosols in urban areas. BVOC emissions from UGSs might be underestimated because of the lack of consideration of the UGS land-use type in urban areas. As such, in this study, we used a newly released satellite dataset, Sentinel-2, with a resolution of 10 m, to derive the classification distribution of UGSs and predict the UGS emissions of BVOCs in Beijing in 2019. The results showed that the annual emissions of BVOCs from UGSs were approximately 2.9 Gg C (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.4-3.3) in the six core districts, accounting for approximately 39% of the total UGS emissions in Beijing. Compared with the results based on Sentinel-2, the BVOC emissions might be underestimated by approximately 37% (95% CI: 11-63) using the commonly used satellite dataset. UGSs produced the highest BVOC emissions in summer (from June to August), accounting for 75.2% of the annual emissions. UGSs contributed the most to the O-3 formation potential in summer, accounting for 41.5% of the total. We could attribute a considerable amount of the O-3 concentration (27.0 mu g m(-3), 95% CI: 21.4-32.6) to the UGS BVOCs produced in the core districts of Beijing in July. The new BVOC emissions dataset based on Sentinel-2 vegetation information facilitates modeling studies on the formation of surface O-3 in urban areas and assessments of the impact of UGSs on public health.

T2  - JAC-ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives To (i) describe the nationwide antimicrobial susceptibility of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) isolates cultured across Brazil in 2018-20 and compare it with NG antimicrobial resistance data from 2015-16, and (ii) present epidemiological data of the corresponding gonorrhoea patients in 2018-20. Methods Twelve representative sentinel sites cultured NG isolates from men with urethral discharge. Susceptibility to eight antimicrobials was examined using agar dilution method, according to WHO standards. The consenting participants were invited to provide epidemiological data. Results In total, 633 NG isolates (one isolate per participant) were analysed, and 449 (70.9%) questionnaires were answered. Heterosexual (68.2%) and homosexual (23.1%) sexual orientations were common, and most prevalent types of unprotected sexual intercourse were vaginal insertive (69.9%), oral giving (56.6%) and anal insertive (47.4%). The levels of in vitro NG resistance to ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, benzylpenicillin, azithromycin, cefixime, gentamicin, spectinomycin and ceftriaxone were 67.3%, 40.0%, 25.7%, 10.6%, 0.3%, 0%, 0% and 0%, respectively. Compliance with the recommended first-line ceftriaxone 500 mg plus azithromycin 1 g therapy was high (90.9%). Conclusions Compared with 2015-16, ciprofloxacin resistance has remained high and azithromycin and cefixime resistance rates have increased in Brazil. Resistance remained lacking to ceftriaxone, gentamicin and spectinomycin, which all are gonorrhoea treatment options. The increasing azithromycin resistance in Brazil and internationally may threaten the future use of azithromycin in dual regimens for treatment of gonorrhoea. Consequently, continued and enhanced quality-assured surveillance of gonococcal AMR, and ideally also treatment failures and including WGS, is imperative in Brazil and worldwide.

TI  - Exploring the combined use of SMAP and Sentinel-1 data for downscaling soil moisture beyond the 1 km scale
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture estimates at high spatial and temporal resolution are of great value for optimizing water and agricultural management. To fill the gap between local ground observations and coarse spatial resolution remote sensing products, we use Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) and Sentinel-1 data together with a unique data set of ground-based soil moisture estimates by cosmic ray neutron sensors (CRNS) and capacitance probes to test the possibility of downscaling soil moisture to the sub-kilometre resolution. For a high-latitude study area within a highly heterogeneous landscape and diverse land use in Denmark, we first show that SMAP soil moisture and Sentinel-1 backscatter time series correlate well with in situ CRNS observations. Sentinel-1 backscatter in both VV and VH polarizations shows a strong correlation with CRNS soil moisture at higher spatial resolutions (20-400 m) and exhibits distinct and meaningful signals at different land cover types. Satisfactory statistical correlations with CRNS soil moisture time series and capacitance probes are obtained using the SMAP Sentinel-1 downscaling algorithm. Accounting for different land use in the downscaling algorithm additionally improved the spatial distribution. However, the downscaling algorithm investigated here does not fully account for the vegetation dependency at sub-kilometre resolution. The study suggests that future research focussing on further modifying the downscaling algorithm could improve representative soil moisture patterns at a fine scale since backscatter signals are clearly informative.

TI  - Geometric and radiometric evaluation of remote sensing information in virtual platforms
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, metadata lack information regarding processing in virtual platforms leading to data quality concerns. Assuming that a search for the same information in different platforms does not present the same result, our objective was to investigate the geometric and radiometric difference between Google Earth Engine (GEE), Sample Extraction Analysis Application (AppEEARS), and Temporal Vegetation Analysis System (SATVeg). Three scenes (H11V09, H12V10 and H13V11) were evaluated for the EVI image of the product MOD13Q1, in which samples were extracted for the SATVeg, GEE and AppEEARS platforms, and the reference image was obtained in original HDF files. The comparison was conducted if the images obtained on the platforms contained the same spatial resolution and radiometric value in relation to the reference image. To determine if the divergences persisted, even if another image projection was adopted, the same methods were used for the geographical projection (EPSG: 4326) and the sinusoidal projection (EPSG: 100,000). Duplicate radiometric value pixels and geometric and radiometric divergence were identified in all platforms when using the geographical projection in the data. The sinusoidal projection was not used to find such divergences. The differences found may have an impact on point evaluations if evaluated in different platforms a divergence in point searches where there may be a change in interpretation depending on the consulted platform. The effective application of these tools is necessary to determine the reliability of this information and to guide the users.

TI  - Landslide susceptibility modelling in Nyahode and Buzi sub catchments of Zimbabwe
T2  - WATER PRACTICE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Landslides are natural hazards that have different susceptibility across landsurface terrains and are mostly triggered by high rainfall intensity. Cyclone Idai which affected the Eastern Highlands of Zimbabwe in 2019 resulted in at least 634 deaths, and over 300 missing people due to landslides and floods necessitating investigations to understand hydrometeorological hazards in the area. This study aimed at modeling landslides susceptibility using field and remote sensing data in Nyahode and Buzi sub catchments. The mapped landslide inventory was used in the building and validation of the landslide susceptibility model. A geostatistical approach was used for landslide susceptibility model building with eleven landslide conditioning factors: slope degree, slope aspect, altitude, lithology, landuse/landcover, distance from the river, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Topographic Wetness Index, and soil clay content, soil sand content and soil silt content. The landslide susceptibility map was categorized into four classes namely low, moderate, high, and very high. The Receiver Operating Characteristic curve used to validate obtained landslide susceptibility. Results show a Frequency Success Rate of 0.85 and a Frequency Predictive Rate of 0.82 indicating a very good accuracy in the identification of landslide susceptibility areas. The utilized method provides affordable, faster, practical and more reliable results useful in landuse planning, water resources and disaster risk management as well as catchment protection actions to reduce the impact of landslide hazards.

TI  - LDP-Net: An Unsupervised Pansharpening Network Based on Learnable Degradation Processes
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pansharpening in remote sensing image aims at acquiring a high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) image directly by fusing a low-resolution multispectral (LRMS) image with a panchromatic (PAN) image. The main concern is how to effectively combine the rich spectral information of LRMS image with the abundant spatial information of PAN image. Recently, many methods based on deep learning have been proposed for the pansharpening task. However, these methods usually have two main drawbacks: 1) requiring HRMS for supervised learning; and 2) simply ignoring the latent relation between the MS and PAN image and fusing them directly. To solve these problems, we propose a novel unsupervised network based on learnable degradation processes, dubbed as LDP-Net. A reblurring block and a graying block are designed to learn the corresponding degradation processes, respectively. In addition, a novel hybrid loss function is proposed to constrain both spatial and spectral consistency between the pansharpened image and the PAN and LRMS images at different resolutions. Experiments on GaoFen-2, Worldview-2, and Worldview-3 images demonstrate that our proposed LDP-Net can fuse PAN and LRMS images effectively without the help of HRMS samples, achieving promising performance in terms of both qualitative visual effects and quantitative metrics.

TI  - A reappraisal of active faults in central-east Iran (Kerman province)
T2  - EARTHQUAKE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Fault lineaments are the main input data in earthquake engineering and seismology studies. This study presents a digitally-based active fault map of the Kerman region in central-east Iran which experienced several devastating earthquakes on poorly exposed and/or not identified active faults. Using Landsat 8 data, we have carried out the image-based procedures of fault mapping, which include applying the contrast stretching technique, the principal component analysis, the color composite technique, the spectral rationing, and creating the false-color composite images. Besides, we have cross-checked the resulting map with the geological maps provided by the Geological Survey of Iran to decrease the associated uncertainties. The resulting map includes 123 fault segments, still, a part of which has been expressed in the previously compiled active-fault maps of Iran. Indeed, the new one is mapping the poorly exposed active faults, so-called secondary faults, which are able to produce strong events. These faults are primarily associated with poorly defined areas that accommodate low levels of seismicity; however, sporadic strong events are likely to occur. It has also been investigated that these kinds of faults are seismogenic and are able to produce destructive events. In total, the outcome of this study can also be jointed with seismic studies for investigating parts of the earthquake activity in central-east Iran, in particular for the fault-based approaches in impending earthquake-resistant buildings.

TI  - An assessment model for mapping the susceptibility of deposits accumulation on insulators driven by remotely sensed data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Insulators deposits can cause flashovers when the right conditions are met, threatening the normal operation of power grids. Grid staffs performed massive in situ measurements to obtain the ESDD observations and then produced susceptibility level maps, helping guiding cleaning the insulators deposits. Such works are time-consuming and costly, and relies on a limited number of discrete point measurements to infer the susceptibility distribution in the spatial domain. In this work, we proposed a novel assessment model for mapping deposits accumulation on insulators using remotely sensed products, emission inventories and other text data. We have spatialized the text data first and then performed the spatial registration to unify the spatial coordinate systems of multi-sources data. On that basis, we utilized a scoring method to quantitatively evaluate the susceptibility of deposits accumulation on insulators after determining the weights and scoring rule for different attributes using the rough set theory. Results showed that the susceptibility map can very well indicate the major risky regions via comparisons with the present susceptibility level map. Further classification experiments yielded results with an accuracy of 83.6%. We believed that such a novel method can provide great helps for the grid maintenance by reducing costs and improving performances of the insulator deposits susceptibility maps.

TI  - Quantifying the spatial pattern of urban heat islands and the associated cooling effect of blue-green landscapes using multisource remote sensing data
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface urban heat islands (SUHIs) are a global concern. Although their spatial pattern and the cooling effect of bluegreen landscapes have been documented, exploring more accurate and quantitative results is still necessary. For Hangzhou, we combined nighttime light (NTL) data with LST images to investigate the spatial morphology of SUHIs and analyze the cooling effect of blue-green landscapes. The radiative transfer equation (RTE) method was used to derive the land surface temperature (LST). Then, based on the unique feature of Luojia1-01 NTL data, the concentric zone model (CZM) was proposed to depict the urban spatial structure. The CZM was applied to construct a number of equal-area concentric belts along the urban-rural gradient to determine the SUHI range and the corresponding blue- green landscape cooling effects. Finally, local Moran's I indices were adopted to identify the cold-hot spots of the SUHI and the relationship with land use. The minimum, average and maximum LSTs were 21.81 degrees C, 32.79 degrees C and 44.79 degrees C, respectively. Additionally, 59.16 % of the study area was affected by the SUHI, and the mean LST inside the SUHI was 36.4 degrees C, clearly higher than that of the rural area. The SUHI hotpots were clustered in regions with intensive human activities, forming archipelagos. Due to the different blue-green landscape densities, the cooling capacity had spatial heterogeneity in different urban rural belts (URBs), and the cooling capacity of URB16 was approximately 71 times that of URB1. The cooling efficiency increased with blue-green landscape density in general; hence, blue-green landscape density thresholds of 40 % and 70 % were recommended in the urban planning of different

T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) is a multi-epoch InSAR method for measuring displacements of Earth's surface over time by exploring the interferometric phase of constantly coherent points, named Persistent Scatterer (PS). PSI has shown its superior capability to monitor linear features with long-distance and large-span characteristics. Nevertheless, the interpretation of estimated displacements over PS is a challenge to overcome. Here, we propose a target characterization approach for multi-epoch InSAR post-processing to efficiently correlate the target's possible deformation types and corresponding deformation characteristics. The PS targets were categorized into elevated (ELV) and ground (GRD) groups. The deformation signals are assigned into four types: Defo-Type I stable, Defo-Type II shallow, Defo-Type III structural, and Defo-Type IV mixed deformation based on the ELV versus GRD differential motion estimation. Our approach is demonstrated over the metro network of Shanghai city, China using High-resolution TerraSAR-X data. The seven-year displacements map along Shanghai metro lines estimated by PSI shows that 85% of the points are relatively stable, while only 0.07% exhibits a significant deformation trend. We performed the stability evaluation along the subway by incorporating velocity, cumulative and relative deformation. It was found that the lines that have been operated for a long time are relatively stable, and obvious deformations were observed on the newly built lines and the extension sections of existing lines. By interpreting deformation types, We inferred that the displacements along metro lines mainly corresponded to Defo-Type II, and the areas with obvious deformation involve the superposition of multiple deformation types.

TI  - Remote sensing evaluation of ecological restoration engineering effect: A case study of the Yongding River Watershed, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological restoration has been risen to a national strategic project for China and become an significant way to realize ecological civilization construction. As an important way to measure the effectiveness of ecological restoration engineering, the corresponding evaluation provides a reliable basis for ecological restoration decision-making and ecosystem management. Based on remote sensing technology with the advantages of short revisit time, large monitoring range, high spatial resolution, this paper proposes a remote sensing evaluation method of watershed ecological restoration effect, so as to monitor the implementation effect of ecological restoration engineering in the watershed and technically check whether the expected goals set before the restoration are achieved. The comprehensive ecological restoration engineering of Yongding River has been implemented since 2016, and it was the first focus of the coordinated development of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region to make advances in ecology. In this paper, year 2015 and 2020 were selected as the before and the after the ecological restoration engineering of Yongding River. The research object was the riparian zone from Luopoling Reservoir to Daning Reservoir in Yongding River Watershed. After obtaining and processing remote sensing images, ZY-3 images were used to obtain land cover data by means of human-computer interactive interpretation, and Landsat images were used to retrieve NDVI data. Based on these data, the changes of the eight indicators of water resources, water ecology and ecological function in the study area were calculated to evaluate the ecological restoration engineering effect. The results showed that the study area has basically realized the maintenance of ecological water quantity, formed the ecological corridor of Yongding River, and effectively enhanced the ecological function and improved the water environment. By verifying the feasibility of remote sensing evaluation method, this paper could provide relevant decision makers and planners with an effective evaluation method for the ecological restoration engineering effect based on remote sensing data and technology.

TI  - SBAS-InSAR-Based Landslide Susceptibility Mapping Along the North Lancang River, Tibetan Plateau
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides pose huge challenges to the economic activities in mountainous areas at present, while large numbers of landslide disasters have developed in the Hengduan Mountains area in the eastern part of the Tibetan Plateau. Accurate landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) serves as a critical measure to predict the serious risks that may be encountered in engineering activities. However, previous landslide susceptibility assessment can only play a limited role in the real-time analysis of current activities of slopes. In this study, the deformation rates of the slopes along the Lancang River were determined using the SBAS-InSAR technique. Meanwhile, the landslide susceptibility along the north Lancang River was assessed using the frequency ratio (FR), random forest and FR-RF models, and the precision of the assessment results was verified according to receiver operating characteristic curves (ROCs). Finally, a refined landslide susceptibility map was developed by integrating the deformation rates and landslide susceptibility indexes (LSIs) using a contingency matrix. As indicated by the deformation rates calculated using the SBAS-InSAR technique according to ascending and descending data show that the RADARSAT-2 descending data yielded more precise deformation results. The area-under-the-curve (AUC) values of the three assessment models were 0.866, 0.897, and 0.916, respectively, indicating that the assessment results obtained with the FR-RF model are the most precise. In the upgraded landslide susceptibility map, the areas with high and very high landslide susceptibility increased by 2.97%. Meanwhile, a total of 563,430 grid cells showed an increase in landslide susceptibility, accounting for 11.15% of all the grid cells. Most especially, the Xueru and Ritong areas exhibited a significant increase in landslide susceptibility, and it has been verified by remote sensing images and field surveys that both areas are subject to landslide risks. Therefore, the upgraded landslide susceptibility map has a better prediction performance and can provide valuable support for the decision making in the construction of major engineering facilities and the prevention and remediation of landslides.

TI  - Creating synthetic night-time visible-light meteorological satellite images using the GAN method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Meteorology satellite visible-light images are critical for meteorologists. However, there are no satellite visible-light channels data at night, so we propose a method based on deep learning to create synthetic satellite visible-light images during night. Specifically, to produce realistic-looking products, we trained a generative adversarial network (GAN) model. The model can generate satellite visible-light images from corresponding satellite infrared (IR) channels data and numerical weather prediction (NWP) products. Considering to explicitly evaluating the contributions of different satellite IR channels and NWP products elements, we suggest using a channel-wise attention mechanic, e.g. a 'Squeeze and Extraction Block' (SEBlock) to quantitatively weigh the importance of different input data channels. The experiments based on the NWP products and the meteorology satellite data show that the proposed method is effective to create realistic synthetic satellite visible-light images during night.

TI  - Wildfire detection through deep learning based on Himawari-8 satellites platform
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate identification of the location, intensity, and spread of wildfires is an essential early-stage precaution for reducing wildfire damage. Satellite imaging platforms, particularly those with high revisiting frequencies and fine spatial resolutions, represent the most efficient possible means of monitoring wildfires dynamically. However, the extraction of accurate fire-related information from satellite images remains challenging, and few studies have investigated the use of remote sensing data from satellites with geostationary orbits. The present work addresses these issues by applying over 5,000 images obtained from the geostationary Himawari-8 satellite of a severe Australian wildfire occurring from November 2019 to February 2020 to train and test a fully connected convolutional neural network (CNN) for identifying the location and intensity of wildfires. The proposed CNN model obtains a detection accuracy greater than 80%, which greatly exceeds that of other machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machine and k-means clustering. Moreover, the CNN model can be trained in a relatively short period, even when employing large training datasets, and predictions can be made in just one or two minutes. The proposed model provides insight into the application of deep learning methodologies for wildfire monitoring based on the imagery provided by geostationary satellites, and support for developing similar satellite missions.

TI  - Satellite remote sensing of coastal water quality in New Zealand
T2  - NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Water quality in estuarine and coastal waters of Aotearoa New Zealand is of concern yet currently under-monitored, reflecting challenges of sampling at regular intervals across large areas. Satellite products are currently underutilised (globally) by management agencies but could be part of a holistic approach. NIWA-SCENZ (Seas, Coasts and Estuaries New Zealand) is a website providing access to MODIS-Aqua products at moderate spatial resolution (500 m) across relatively clear coastal waters (Case 1) to turbid coastal waters (Case 2). It also provides advanced analytical tools on an extracted area of interest for trend assessment (Shiny-SCENZ). For Case 1 areas product accuracy will be comparable to data from other websites using the same algorithms. For Case 2 and transition (blended) areas, although tuned to New Zealand conditions, accuracy of products requires validation. Data availability is mainly impacted by cloud cover, but also adjacency to land and bottom reflection. On average <5% within similar to 1 km from coastlines, compared to similar to 10%-30% outside 2 km. Extrapolation and blending from offshore into shorelines on month averaged maps extend estimates into many bays and estuaries. Active research efforts will deliver iterative improvements in data quality, new products, and analysis methods (e.g. variability and long-term trend maps).

T2  - JOURNAL OF WAR & CULTURE STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper examines how artists create the past. It analyses the aeronautic works of art by Captain Exequiel Martinez as portrayed and used by the painter, the Argentine Air Force and the Argentine officers who took part of the air battle for the Malvinas/Falklands in 1982. Unlike the dominant views condemning the armed initiative of the last Argentine dictatorship (1976-83), this paper delves into the military worldview and reconstructs the premises through which the Argentine Air Force and a pilot-painter have managed to pay homage, acknowledge, and make visible the feats of the Argentine pilots against the British Task Force. Taking advantage of an anthropology of the production of history, the author unravels the process undergone by painter Martinez and the pilots portrayed in his paintings to turn Argentine defeat into visual evidence, solid experience and historical plausibility.

TI  - Availability of Sentinel-2-based time-series observations: which vegetation phenology-based metrics perform best for mapping farming systems in complex landscapes?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The characterization of intra- and interannual variations in optical satellite observations has proven to be effective to differentiate between land use classes. However, there is relatively little knowledge of the accuracy and usefulness of various satellite-basedphenology variables and metrics. This letter provides quick insights into the processing of vegetation seasonality and phenology data, applied to the European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel-2 satellite observations. The following time-seriesdata methods were compared for their potential to enhance land use mapping in two study areas in Kenya and Tanzania: a) monthly maximum Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) composites, b) NDVI-basedtime-seriesstatistics, c) NDVI-basedharmonic regressions, and d) threshold-basedNDVI-basedphenological metrics. When using the maximum NDVI composites, as classification inputs, the overall accuracies were found to be 7-18% higher than when using the other methods (predictors). Overall, the Muranga site (Kenya) showed a higher classification accuracy for the best performing predictor set (overall accuracy = 86.5%) than the Kilimanjaro site (Tanzania) (overall accuracy = 80.9%). These findings confirm the potential of phenology-basedcompositing methods for large-scalemapping of agro-ecologicalfarming systems.

TI  - Towards a novel high-spatial-resolution satellite rainfall product from C-band SAR Sentinel-1 over Central South Korea based on a bottom-up approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Finer spatial resolution (roughly 1 km) of terrestrial rainfall is necessary for urban hydrology and microscale agriculture demands but still limited in various 'top-down' satellite rainfall products (SRPs). This study aims to evaluate the potential application of an emerged 'bottom-up' approach, the parameterized SM2RAIN model, to the C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar Sentinel-1 (S1) satellites for a high-spatial-resolution SRP (SM2RAIN-S1, 0.01o/6-day) over Central South Korea. By comparing its performance with the Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrieval for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG) Early Run product at a similar resolution against a common reanalysis rainfall product and rain gauges network during a 1-year period, we explore whether this novel bottom-up SRP can add improvements to the conventional top-down SRP regarding differences in climate areas (coast and inland), vegetation covers (cropland and mixed forest), and seasonality (rainy and non-rainy seasons). The SM2RAIN-S1 demonstrates its feasibility in capturing general spatiotemporal rainfall patterns in the study area compared to other rainfall products; however, noises associated with the S1 images still occurred. For the comparison over climate-vegetation areas, the extended triple collocation revealed that the SM2RAIN-S1 is relatively superior to the IMERG mainly over inland and forest regions, suggesting the suitability of 6-day SM2RAIN-S1 data to the stable and lower temporal rainfall variation in such regions, where the IMERG data are limited. The comparison against rain gauge data over rainfall seasons indicated that the SM2RAIN-S1 generally outperformed IMERG for bias and Root-Mean-Square Error, particularly during the rainy season. Moreover, the SM2RAIN-S1 shows its feasibility for moderate and heavy rain detection, while it is less effective in detecting light rain events compared to the IMERG. This study encourages the potential use of the bottom-up SM2RAIN-S1 rainfall product to complement, downscale, and correct the biases in top-down SRPs; together with supporting their integration for improving high spatio-temporal resolution rainfall products.

TI  - Crusader Hirelings or Loyal Subjects? Evolving Jihadist Perspectives on Christian Minorities in the Middle East
T2  - ISLAM AND CHRISTIAN-MUSLIM RELATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - In contrast to common assumptions, jihadist movements' view of Christian minorities in the Middle East has been neither unambiguous nor static. It changes according to the overall political conflict in the region and is characterized by specific, unpredictable struggles that arise locally. By studying the official statements of al-Qaeda and ISIS, their ideological and strategic writings and their conduct vis-a-vis indigenous Christians in the Middle East, this article seeks to paint a more complex picture of how jihadists perceive this minority. One key finding is that the Christians of the Middle East and the foreign Christian 'Crusaders' are not a single phenomenon or foe in the conceptual worldview of jihadists. Second, rather than seeking to eradicate Christians completely, jihadist movements wish primarily to demonstrate the dominance of Muslims and their role as legitimate rulers over Christian minorities. Third, terrorist attacks on Christians and churches have been devastating and deadly, especially in Egypt and Iraq, but local Christian minorities are not a top priority target for most jihadist groups.

TI  - Prospectivity mapping of carbonatite-associated iron oxide deposits using an integration process of ASTER and Sentinel-2A multispectral data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbonatites and associated rocks are commonly known to host precious commodities, including rare earth elements (REE), niobium, and phosphates. They form ring-shaped complexes frequently found as small occurrences in hard-to-reach areas, making their exploration a challenging task using conventional methods. Remote sensing has been increasingly regarded as a time- and cost-saving method to map and identify new potential zones, meeting the growing need for mineral resources. In this study, we use multispectral data by combining information from ASTER and Sentinel 2A sources to delineate and map carbonatite-associated REE- and Nb-enriched iron oxide deposits. The Moroccan Oulad Dlim massif, at the NW margin of the west African craton, where carbonatite occurrences are reported, was selected as a study area. A fuzzy gamma approach was adopted to combine information from several image processing techniques, including mineral indices, principal component analysis (PCA) and minimum noise fraction (MNF). A concentration-area (C-A) fractal model is applied together with the prediction-area (P-A) plot for objective anomalies classification and prediction ability assessment for each fuzzy integrated map. Subsequently, a prospective map that predicts and defines potential areas was produced through the integration of Sentinel- and ASTER-derived evidential maps. Validation was carried out via field surveys coupled with in-situ portable X-Ray Fluorescence analysis and laboratory mineralogical characterization. The Results were consistent with field data, reaching a prediction rate of 90%. They reveal the importance of the investigated structures as potential sites for REE, Nb, and phosphates. These outcomes are encouraging and provide evidence that data fusion (ASTER-Sentinel 2A) is an effective and helpful approach for geological exploration programmes.

TI  - Landsat 8Bands' 1 to 7 spectral vectors plus machine learning to improve land use/cover classification using Google Earth Engine
T2  - ANNALS OF GIS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper explores a spectral vector-based methodology on Landsat 8 bands of the visible wavelengths, that is deep-blue (1) to shortwave infrared (7), to improve the urban land features classification. Using two different ratio models, based on two and three bands' combinations in the cloud environment of Google Earth Engine, the Uncertainty reducing Spectral Vector (USVr), the Onward Continuous Spectral Vector (OSVc) and the Onward Discontinuous Spectral Vector (OSVd) are proposed as new entries for the land use land cover (LULC) classification. Two different sizes of arrays are built, i.e. 42 vectors and 15 vectors corresponding to the same number of derivative bands and new pixels ' values. A decision tree is built in J.48 and applied to select the most suitable derivative bands for the analysis. Hereafter, the selected ones are stacked and submitted to five machine learning classifiers using a supervised process, namely, Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Random Forest (RF) Gradient Boosting (GBR), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Minimum Distance (MD). This method was tested in the two cities of Bamenda and Foumban in west-Cameroon highlands, due to their good representativeness of tropical hilly urban areas' spatial heterogeneity. The results are satisfying for 4/5 classifiers, up to 87% Overall Accuracy, OA, for 0.82 kappa coefficient, KC, in Bamenda, while combining SVM/OSVd. Whereas, in Foumban, the classifiers perform up to 85%OA and 0.78 KC for the combination SVM/USVr. Only the MD classifier has always performed below 80%OA. The process has been found better than performing classifiers directly on the multispectral (MS) image, by providing more possibilities of hidden spectral indices not yet explored, as far as we know, to detect and discriminate between LULC features, plus an accurate extraction of human settlements.

TI  - Using a trait-based approach to asses fire resistance in forest landscapes of the Inland Northwest, USA
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context Several plant traits are associated with resistance to fire, thus fire-resistant species may give rise to more fire-resistant landscapes. However, up-scaling from plant traits to landscape- and regional-scale fire effects remains a challenge. Objectives We test two hypotheses: (1) forests composed of fire-resistant species experience lower fire severity than forests composed of less fire-resistant species; and (2) wildfires affecting forests with greater fire resistance experience smaller patches of high-severity fire. Methods We used a predictive map of existing forest types (major tree species dominating forest composition) and a trait-based map of fire resistance. We examined large-scale spatial patterns of fire severity derived from Landsat imagery in 611 wildfires across the range of western larch in the Inland Northwest USA (1985-2014). We then applied structural equation modeling to study complex relationships between fire resistance and high-severity fire in each wildfire. Results Forest types dominated by fire-resister species (e.g., ponderosa pine) experienced lower fire severity than forest types dominated by non-resister species such as lodgepole pine (fire-embracer) and subalpine fir (fire-avoider). We found a strong negative correlation between the fire resistance index and average values of the relative differenced normalized burn ratio, as well as an indirect relationship between fire resistance and high-severity patch size. Conclusions The large-scale differences in fire severity among forest types generally reflect the degree of fire resistance that fire-related traits confer to individual trees species, providing evidence that incorporating plant traits has the potential to assist in assessing fire resistance at large spatial scales.

However, in the shadow of recent sociopolitical movements such as Black Lives Matter and Me Too, raised awareness of mental health concerns and an ongoing global pandemic, there are calls for a reimagined perspective of PYD through a social justice worldview. The purpose of the current article is to posit how coach education programs and coach development systems can inclusively meet the diverse needs of coaches, youth athletes, and society alike. Specifically, two questions guided the development of this article: 1) Why should coach education and coach development integrate social justice life skills? and 2) How may social justice life skills be integrated into coach education and coach development? Ultimately, as researchers and coach developers, we must not only be advocates for social justice in youth sports, but critically engaged activists who progress youth - and societal - development forward.

TI  - Taura kuku: prioritising Maori knowledge and resources to create biodegradable mussel spat settlement lines for shellfish restoration in Ohiwa harbour
T2  - NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Matauranga Maori (Maori knowledge) is grounded in place-based, multi-generational knowledge and the connection of that knowledge with the environments from which it is derived. It takes for granted that all elements of the natural world are related, and it is upon those relationships that survival depends. A Maori worldview advocates for the responsibility of each generation to pass onto their descendants at least as good a supply of resources as they, themselves, had inherited. For Maori, the wellness of the environment is a direct reflection on the wellness of the people. This article provides an overview of a practical matauranga Maori-led marine restoration project in Ohiwa harbour. The transdisciplinary project worked with a traditional Maori master weaver and kaumatua (tribal elders) to develop biodegradable taura kuku (green-lipped mussel spat settlement lines, hereafter taura kuku) made from traditional Maori plant biowaste and other natural materials. The taura kuku proved a successful tool for the recruitment and settlement of wild mussel spat assisting shellfish restoration and increasing marine biodiversity in the culturally and ecologically important mahinga kai (traditional food basket) of Ohiwa harbour.

TI  - Study on the LAI and FPAR inversion of maize from airborne LiDAR and hyperspectral data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Maize is an important cereal crop and plays an important role in agriculture. The leaf area index (LAI) and the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) are important vegetation canopy structure parameters that are closely related to crop photosynthesis, transpiration and respiration and are of great significance for crop yield estimation. Hyperspectral data can obtain the spectral characteristic parameters of crops, and LiDAR data can obtain the vertical structure index. The former focuses on horizontal characteristic information, and the latter focuses on vertical characteristic information. In this paper, random forest method is used to carry out the inversion modelling of maize LAI and FPAR, and the effects of hyperspectral data resolution, LiDAR data density and scanning angle on the inversion accuracy are tested and analysed. The results show that there is good accuracy and stability of the random forest inversion model (LAI: 0.53 <R-2 < 0.78, 0.094 < RMSE < 0.158, 0.009 < MSE < 0.025, 0.074 < MAE < 0.136; FPAR: 0.323 < R-2 < 0.594, 0.09 < RMSE < 0.261, 0.008 < MSE < 0.068, 0.068 < MAE < 0.212). When using Hyperspectral data to invert LAI, the accuracy is the highest when the resolution is 1 metre (R-2 = 0.742, RMSE = 0.141, MSE = 0.02, MAE = 0.119). When using LiDAR data to invert LAI, the accuracy is the highest when the density is 30% (R-2 = 0.78, RMSE = 0.115, MSE = 0.013, MAE = 0.094). When using Hyperspectral data to invert FPAR, the accuracy is the highest when the resolution is 0.128 metre(R-2 = 0.594, RMSE = 0.09, MSE = 0.008, MAE = 0.068). When using LiDAR data to invert FPAR, the accuracy is the highest when the density is 20% (R-2 = 0.525, RMSE = 0.141, MSE = 0.02, MAE = 0.113).

TI  - Uniaxial compressive properties of human lumbar 1 vertebrae loaded beyond compaction and their relationship to cortical and cancellous microstructure, size and density properties
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Lumbar 1 vertebrae are among those most commonly fracture due to osteoporosis. The strength of human vertebrae and its structural, microstructural and material determinants have been the subject of numerous studies. However, a comprehensive evaluation of properties beyond maximum load to fracture has not been available for the L1 vertebrae. The objective of this study was to document these properties in association with each other and with the geometric, density and cancellous and cortical structure properties for human L1 vertebrae. Bone volume fraction (BV/TV), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), trabecular number (Tb.N), trabecular separation (Tb.Sp), connectivity density (Conn.Dn), degree of anisotropy (DA), structure model index (SMI) and fractal dimension (FD) of the cancellous microstructure, tissue mineral density (TMD), and thickness of the cortical shell (Sh.Th) and superior and inferior endplates thicknesses (EP.Th.S and EP.Th.I) were measured using microcomputed tomography for 27 cadaveric L1 vertebrae. Volumetric cancellous, shell and integral bone mineral densities (vBMD, shBMD and iBMD) as well as vertebral volume (V), height and width were measured using high resolution CT. Areal whole vertebral body and regional BMDs were measured using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in coronal and lateral views. Specimens were then uniaxially compressed to 15% of their height to obtain vertebral stiffness (K) and strength (F-max) as well as displacement (D), force (F) and energy (W) properties at characteristic points of the load-displacement curve including yield (y), fracture (f), compaction (c), final displacement (t) and residual after unload (r). Correlation and principal component analyses suggested displacements to failure (D-f), collapse (D-c) and recovery (Dr) contain information distinct from strength and stiffness. Bone size (V) was present, independently, in multiple regression models of K, F-y, W-y, F-max, D-f, W-t, W-fc and Dr (p < 0.05 to p < 0.0001), areal BMD in models of D-y, W-y, Fmax, W-f, F-c,F- W-t, W-yf and Wct (p < 0.04 to p < 0.0001), Sh.Th in models of Df, F-c and epsilon(r) (p < 0.02 to p < 0.002), EP.Th.S in models of Fc and Wct (p < 0.004 to p < 0.0006), EP.Th.I in the model of Wct (p < 0.02), FD in models of Fy, Dy and Fmax (p < 0.03 to p < 0.004), Tb.Sp in models of K and Dy (p < 0.002 to p < 0.0004), Conn.Dn in the model of Df (p < 0.0009), and SMI in the model of Wt (p < 0.02). R-adj(2) varied from 0.12 (Dr) to 0.80 (Wt) for the multiple regression models for all significant variables. In conclusion, there is distinct information in forces and displacements associated with characteristic events occurring during uniaxial compression and recovery, specifically in displacements associated with compaction and recovery. Though there are common factors such as bone mass for some, distinct cancellous and cortical features likely contribute to these events in L1. The descriptive data reported here are expected to provide reference values for comparative and model building efforts, and the relationships found are expected to provide insight into mechanical functions of an L1 vertebra.

TI  - Cloud detection for satellite cloud images based on fused FCN features
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud detection for satellite cloud images is a challenging image processing task owing to the blurring of cloud boundaries, multiplicity, and complexity of cloud types. Currently, the commonly used cloud detection methods include original full convolutional neural network (original FCN), FCN with an 8-pixel stride (FCN- 8s), FCN with a 2-pixel stride (FCN-2s), and so on. However, the aforementioned methods exclusively rely on a single network layer - the final layer feature map; thus, shallow cloud image information, such as cloud profile information may not be captured. In this letter, a cloud detection method for satellite cloud images based on fused FCN features is proposed. The proposed method effectively fuses spatial and high-level semantic information, and a voting ensemble strategy is used to improve the accuracy and robustness of cloud detection. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that the average overall accuracy (OA), average producer accuracy (PA), and average user' accuracy (UA) of the proposed method for multiple training sample sizes and image sizes of the collected Fengyun satellite (FY-2 G) cloud image database increased by 7.15%, 9.04%, and 8.46%, respectively, relative to the average accuracies of the original FCN, FCN-8s, FCN-2s, SegNet, and DeepLabV3 methods.

TI  - Attention-based dual residual network-based for multi-spectral pan-sharpening
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pansharpening belongs to an important part in the field of remote sensing image fusion, which refers to the fusion of low spatial resolution multispectral (MS) images with high spatial resolution (PAN) images to finally obtain high resolution multispectral (HRMS) images. The existing deep learning-based pan-sharpening methods have achieved better results compared with the traditional methods, but there are still two problems: spectral distortion and loss of spatial detail information. We propose an end-to-end attention-based dual-residual multi-stage remote sensing image fusion network (ADRPN) for MS image and PAN image pan-sharpening based on an in-depth study of spectral information of MS images and spatial information fusion of PAN images, which consists of three main stages, each resembling an encoder-decoder, and cross-stage fusion to achieve channel domain feature stitching. The first two stages are the feature extraction stage, where the features of MS images and PAN images are extracted using the residual module, and the different features learned are used to guide the training of individual networks using CRFB (Cross residual feature block). In the third stage (image reconstruction), we use the CA (Coordinate attention) and SE (Squeeze-and-Excitation) attention mechanism to enable the network to more precisely locate the region of interest by the precise location information obtained, which allows the features extracted in the first two stages to be better fused with the original image, thus reducing the occurrence of spectral distortion and loss of spatial detail information. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of real and simulated data from the benchmark datasets QuickBird (QB), GF-2, and WorldView-2 (WV2) show that the method can better preserve the spectral and spatial detail information and obtain high-quality HRMS images.

TI  - Predictive Factors for Unnecessary Axillary Dissection According to SLN Metastasis in T1, T2 Stage Breast Cancer
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The axillary nodes' status is essential in determining the treatment algorithm according to complete clinical staging. Unnecessary axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) has been prevented after sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has occurred in current practice. However, approximately half of patients with positive SLNB do not have axillary metastatic lymph nodes. Our study aims to predict unnecessary ALND in patients with SLN metastases by evaluating the patients' clinicopathological data. In total, 221 patients with macrometastasis in SLNB who underwent completion ALND were evaluated retrospectively. Patients were divided into two groups: patients with metastases only in the sentinel lymph node and additional axillary lymph nodes. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to analyze the correlation between SLN metastasis and axillary lymph node metastasis; clinicopathological characteristics, including patient age, menopause status, tumor size and grade, receptor status proliferative marker status, and molecular subtypes of the tumor. In the evaluation of T1-2, cN0 breast cancer patients with SLNB in the form of macrometastasis, only SLNB metastasis was found in 118 (53.4%) patients. In 103 (46.6%) patients, additional axillary node metastasis was observed. The risk of additional nodal spread correlated with patient age older than fertility age (age of 49) (p = 0.015, OR: 1.96, 95% CI: 1.14-3.39) and the number of increased metastatic sentinel nodes (p < 0.001). In line with the data shown by our study, the rate of axillary metastases increases in patients over the age of fertility and as the number of metastatic SLNs increases.

TI  - Revising precipitation - water storages - vegetation signatures with GRACE-based data assimilation
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The availability of freshwater is highly influenced by climate change, extreme climate events and by anthro-pogenic use. Countries where a large part of the population depends on the agricultural sector, such as South Africa, are strongly affected by changes in climate, which emphasizes that water is an essential source for food production and drinking water. To analyze changes in surface and subsurface water, model simulations and in situ data are commonly used. However, both have limitations, for example, the models rely on potentially erroneous forcing data and insufficient process representations and the in situ data do not represent the larger -scale weather and climate due to spatial and temporal heterogeneity. This can be mitigated by assimilating remote-sensed satellite data into models.In this research, we build a realistic picture of the water and its propagation (measured between peak times) from fluxes as precipitation, to its way through the storages and its impact on vegetation at the 50 km scale by using observation-based data. The observations are derived from MODIS remote-sensing and integrating GRACE total water storage anomaly (TWSA) observations into a hydrological model via data assimilation. Our objective is to identify shortcomings in model simulations by confronting them with the (synthesized) observations. Moreover, we demonstrate the importance of integrating observations into the models. We base these compar-isons on signatures or sub-signals (e.g., temporal lags and annual amplitudes) that we derive via regression analysis, principal component analysis, sensitivity analysis and correlation analysis from the synthetic data and the model output. Our main results show that correlations and signatures in real observations are found weaker as compared to what is simulated in the model, e.g. for the contribution of precipitation to groundwater. Lag times between precipitation and surface and groundwater storage peaks are observed to be longer than in the model. The observed propagation of soil water from storages to vegetation is often shorter than in the model, while for groundwater it is longer. We believe our findings will be highly relevant for modelers; the gained knowledge can be used to improve models. In addition, we feel our study underlines the potential of GRACE assimilation into hydrological models.

TI  - Prevalence estimates as priors: Juror characteristics, perceived base rates, and verdicts in cases reliant on complainant and defendant testimony
T2  - APPLIED COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Jurors often have to make decisions about whether they believe a complainant's or defendant's account of an event. However, the relative ambiguity of cues in testimony creates a situation where juror evaluations can vary significantly. As a result, in cases heavily reliant on testimony there is a particular likelihood that juror characteristics will be associated with verdicts, and it is important to understand these associations. This research investigates the relationships between two juror characteristics-gender and cultural worldviews-and verdicts in two such cases, and the potential for those relationships to be explained by differences in perceived prevalence of alleged events acting as prior probability judgements. As predicted, results show significant relationships between gender and cultural worldview and verdicts and show that these relationships are mediated by differences in underlying prevalence estimates. These findings have important implications for understanding associations between juror characteristics and verdicts, and related policy.

T2  - MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The problem of hypothesis testing for the independence of two-dimensional random variables in the analysis of variables of multi-valued functions is considered. To solve it, we used a technique based on a nonparametric kernel-type pattern recognition algorithm corresponding to the maximum likelihood criterion. The technique made it possible to bypass the problem of decomposing the random variable domain of values into intervals. Based on the results of computational experiments, the effectiveness of the applied technique was estimated depending on the type of multi-valued functions, the level of random noise and the amount of initial statistical data. The results obtained are relevant for solving the problem of detecting natural and technical objects from remote sensing data.

TI  - Effect of aggregation and disaggregation of land surface temperature imagery on evapotranspiration estimation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the spatial distribution of evapotranspiration (ET) and other surface energy fluxes in tree crops is vital for optimizing precision irrigation management practices. The land surface temperature (LST) is the primary input to estimate ET at field scale, but currently, available satellite data have a coarse resolution, which is not suitable for estimating ET at the required spatiotemporal scale at the field level. The development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or airborne platforms during the last two decades has enabled the acquisition of LST and subsequent derivation of ET at the finer spatial resolution of up to a few centimeters due to the advances in low-weight thermal cameras onboard these platforms. In this study, the disaggregation meth-odology was applied to Landsat imagery based on aerial imagery collected at 0.5 m resolution over almond orchards in the Sacramento Valley of California, USA, to estimate ET at the orchard scale. The TsHARP algorithm was applied to sharpen the Landsat LST images (30 m spatial res-olution) to target resolutions of 0.5, 10, 20 m. Also, the simple average aggregation technique was used to aggregate the aerial imagery (0.5 resolution) to 10, 20, and 30 m scales. Two Source Energy Balance (TSEB) model was used to estimate spatially distributed ET fluxes by combining the ground-based meteorological data for aggregated and disaggregated LST images. The esti-mated ET fluxes were compared to the measured eddy covariance fluxes, and then the aggrega-tion and disaggregation processes were evaluated at 0.5, 10, 20, and 30 m spatial scales. At four spatial scales (0.5, 10, 20, and 30 m) aggregation and disaggregation derived ET values were highly correlated with the measured eddy covariance fluxes within the source footprint area. Furthermore, both aggregation and disaggregation approaches demonstrated similar ET spatial patterns within the study area, with slight variations observed under the Landsat 30 m resolution. The results indicated that TsHARP downscaled high-resolution imagery provides optimal spatial resolution for mapping and analyzing ET at the plant to orchard scale, with a 95% confidence interval and an RMSE of 0.43 mm/day. Overall, the results suggest that high spatial resolution imagery disaggregated from Landsat was the best alternative for estimating ET fluxes from the plant to the orchard scale, which is beneficial for precision irrigation management in orchards, but the framework can also be applied to other precision agriculture applications.

TI  - Characterization of vegetation dynamics using MODIS satellite products over stone-mining dominated Rajmahal Hills in Jharkhand, India
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuous and comprehensive vegetation monitoring, assessment, and reporting are pivotal for formulating sustainable vegetation management practices while protecting changes in the vegetation ecosystem. The present case study employed various Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite products (i.e., land cover, leaf area index (LAI), and gross primary productivity (GPP)) for a comprehensive study of vegetation dynamics (i.e., spatiotemporal change, growth, and productivity analysis) over the Rajmahal Hills (RH) in the state of Jharkhand (India) during 2001-2019. Study findings revealed that the RH has a fragile vegetation ecosystem, and is predominantly covered with deciduous broadleaf forest (DBF) followed by savannas (SV), natural vegetation (NV), woody savannas (WSV), and mixed forest (MF). A significant loss in DBF, WSV, and SV coverage was observed during the study periods (2001-2019). The anthropogenic activities (especially stone mining activities) over the Rajmahal Hills are observed as the key drivers behind vegetation cover loss. The study of LAI of different vegetation types exhibited an overall structural development during 2001-2019. Furthermore, the gross primary productivity (GPP) analysis showed that the vegetation ecosystem over the RH has excellent potential for removing the carbon from the atmosphere via photosynthesis. GPP of the entire RH was significantly increased to ~2859 and 5189 gC/m2/day over a span of 2001-2010 and 2010-2019, respectively. The findings of the present case study shall be crucial inputs for the policy-makers and planners for informed and evidence-based decision-making at the local spatial level to reduce the harsh conditions associated with it.

TI  - Analyzing land use and land cover change patterns and population dynamics of fast-growing US cities: Evidence from Collin County, Texas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) change is a critical component in the global environment change process. The southern and western areas of the United States have experienced rapid population growth in the past decades. This paper analyzed the LULC change patterns and population dy-namics in Collin County, Texas from 2000 to 2019. Landsat images and population data from US Census were analyzed in this study. Supervised maximum likelihood classifier was used to obtain the pre-classified land cover maps. We interpreted the land cover classes for three sets of samples from multiple sources and used them as the input sample for post-classification. A CoMCRF based post-classification was further performed on each of the pre-classified land cover maps. The post -classification improved the overall accuracy (OA) from the pre-classification maps by 2.9%, 5.7%, and 6.6% for 2000, 2010, and 2019, respectively. The Kappa coefficients also increased by 0.044, 0.089, and 0.101 for the three study years. Based on the post-classified land cover maps, we found that the LULC change in Collin County, Texas is primarily in the form of converting field lands to human built land covers. Ordinary least squares (OLS) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) were further employed to investigate the tract-level relationships between built-up area change ratio and population change ratio during the period from 2010 to 2019. The results from GWR analysis showed that population change can explain 75.15% of the change in built-up area. This case study for Collin County, Texas provides insights on the most recent LULC change pat-terns and their relations with population dynamics in fast-growing US cities.

TI  - Fusion of Remote Sensing Data Using GIS-Based AHP-Weighted Overlay Techniques for Groundwater Sustainability in Arid Regions
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing and GIS approaches have provided valuable information on modeling water resources, particularly in arid regions. The Sahara of North Africa, which is one of the driest regions on Earth, experienced several pluvial conditions in the past that could have stored significant amounts of groundwater. Thus, harvesting the stored water by revealing the groundwater prospective zones (GWPZs) is highly important to water security and the management of water resources which are necessary for sustainable development in such regions. The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM), Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS)/Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR), Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), and Landsat-8 OLI data have all successfully revealed the geologic, geomorphic, climatic, and hydrologic features of Wadi El-Tarfa east of Egypt's Nile River. The fusion of eleven predictive GIS maps including lithology, radar intensity, lineament density, altitude, slope, depressions, curvature, topographic wetness index (TWI), drainage density, runoff, and rainfall data, after being ranked and normalized through the GIS-based analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and weighted overlay methods, allowed the GWPZs to be demarcated. The resulting GWPZs map was divided into five classes: very high, high, moderate, low, and very low potentiality, which cover about 10.32, 24.98, 30.47, 24.02, and 10.20% of the entire basin area, respectively. Landsat-8 and its derived NDVI that was acquired on 15 March 2014, after the storm of 8-9 March 2014, along with existing well locations validated the GWPZs map. The overall results showed that an integrated approach of multi-criteria through a GIS-based AHP has the capability of modeling groundwater resources in arid regions. Additionally, probing areas of GWPZs is helpful to planners and decision-makers dealing with the development of arid regions.

TI  - SPACIO-TEMPORAL DYNAMIC OF THE VEGETATION AND DEGRADATION FACTORS OF THE VEGETATION COVER AROUND LAGDO LAKE, NORTH CAMEROON
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOSYSTEMS AND ECOLOGY SCIENCE-IJEES
M3  - Article
AB  - Lagdo lake with an area of 586 km2 is a dam lake located in the North Region of Cameroon. It is under the influence of silting and siltation. These phenomena are becoming more and more widespread to the point where the hydroelectric dam is now threatened for the production of electrical energy. The objective of this study is to map the dynamics of land use between 1973, 2000 and 2020 and to determine the factors that affect the vegetation cover around Lagdo Lake. The methodology adopted consisted of identifying land cover units and determining the factors that are responsible for land cover degradation. Landsat images from 1973, 2000 and 2020 and survey data from 416 farmers in the area were used. The results show that the study area has undergone an advanced spatial and temporal change over the period 1973-2020. This change reveals that the average annual regression rates for vegetation formations are -3.21% and respectively -0.88% and -2.33% for tree and shrub savannahs. On the other hand, an increase was observed in anthropogenic formations such as mosaics of bare soil and farms (43.41%), and buildings (0.52%). From 1973 to 2020, anthropogenic formations (buildings and mosaics of bare soil and farms) have progressed to the detriment of natural formations (shrubby savannahs and tree savannahs). These natural formation paned from -37040.5 ha between 1973-2000 to -439284.5 ha between 2000-2020 to the benefit of built-up areas and mosaics of bare soil and farms. The mutation of this vegetation is due to anthropic pressures linked to agricultural activities (20 +/- 11.24%), fishing (9.5 +/- 3.29%), pastoral activities (8.65 +/- 9.51%), vegetation slash and burn (17 +/- 8.8%), poorly controlled urbanisation (5.1 +/- 5.78%) and demographic pressure (17 +/- 8.23%). However, agriculture remains the main factor for the degradation of vegetation cover. Considering the accelerated rate of the degradation of the vegetation cover of the said lake, the energy production of the Lagdo dam would cease in the future years.

TI  - Detection of Irrigated Permanent Grasslands with Sentinel-2 Based on Temporal Patterns of the Leaf Area Index (LAI)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Conventional methods of crop mapping need ground truth information to train the classifier. Thanks to the frequent acquisition allowed by recent satellite missions (Sentinel 2), we can identify temporal patterns that depend on both phenology and crop management. Some of these patterns are specific to a given crop and thus can be used to map it. Thus, we can substitute ground truth information used in conventional methods with agronomic knowledge. This approach was applied to identify irrigated permanent grasslands (IPG) in the Crau area (Southern France), which play a crucial role in groundwater recharge. The grassland is managed by making three mows during the May-October period, which leads to a specific temporal pattern of leaf area index (LAI). The mowing detection algorithm was designed using the temporal LAI signal derived from Sentinel 2 observations. The algorithm includes some filtering to remove noise in the signal that might lead to false mowing detection. A pixel is considered a grassland if the number of detected mows is greater than 1. A data set covering five years (2016-2020) was used. The detection mowing number was conducted at the pixel level, and then the results were aggregated at the plot level. An evaluation data set including 780 plots was used to assess the performances of the classification. We obtained a Kappa index ranging between 0.94 and 0.99 according to the year. These results were better than other supervised classification methods that include training data sets. The analysis of land-use changes shows that misclassified plots concern grasslands managed less intensively with strong intra-parcel heterogeneity due to irrigation defects or year-round grazing. Time series analysis, therefore, allows us to understand different management practices. Real land-use change in use can be observed, but long time series are needed to confirm the change and remove ambiguities with heterogeneous grasslands.

TI  - SEBU: A novel fully automated Google Earth Engine surface energy balance model for urban areas
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the diverse energy exchange within the city's boundaries would enable better design of future urban planning and environmental policies and update current ones. More importantly, it would facilitate the establishment of smart cities, where human health and wellbeing is a top priority. In this regard, several energy balance models have been proposed for urban areas. Only recently, remote sensing images have been extensively used in these areas, but are still difficult to implement due to the large inputs' sources and types required as well as their complexity. Their accuracy can also be improved. Thus, in this paper, the Surface Energy Balance Model for Urban areas (SEBU) is proposed based on the 100-m Landsat images. It uses other sources as well such as Sentinel-1, MODIS and ERA5. SEBU is based on the innovative hot/cold pixels approach widely known in the agricultural-based models, but also includes several dynamic internal calibrations. It generates monthly turbulent sensible (Qh) and latent (Qe) heat values over a 100-m spatial resolution. When applied over seven different regions (i.e., Denver, New Hampshire, Basel, Heraklion, Singapore, Phoenix and Vancouver) in four contrasting climates (i.e., cold, arid, warm and equatorial) and when compared to local flux tower measurements, absolute mean error varied between 6.13 W m(-2) month-1 for Qe and 14.46 W m(-2) month(-1) for Qh. More importantly, the novelty of SEBU does not lie only in providing reliable accuracy and full reliance on the remote sensing database, but also on its open-source nature and easy-accessibility over the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Thus, SEBU has the potential to be scalable using the massive power and huge database found in GEE, where users need to specify the required date only. This would certainly assist researchers to access urban cilmate information in a timely manner. Policy makers and even local dwellers would then benefit from their findings. Furthermore, SEBU can be improved to accommodate current and future needs of its users, while ultimately, enhancing the urban surface energy models and related science.

TI  - Improving Deforestation Detection on Tropical Rainforests Using Sentinel-1 Data and Convolutional Neural Networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detecting early deforestation is a fundamental process in reducing forest degradation and carbon emissions. With this procedure, it is possible to monitor and control illegal activities associated with deforestation. Most regular monitoring projects have been recently proposed, but most of them rely on optical imagery. In addition, these data are seriously restricted by cloud coverage, especially in tropical environments. In this regard, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is an attractive alternative that can fill this observational gap. This work evaluated and compared a conventional method based on time series and a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) with bi-temporal SAR images. These approaches were assessed in two regions of the Brazilian Amazon to detect deforestation between 2019 and 2020. Different pre-processing techniques, including filtering and stabilization stages, were applied to the C-band Sentinel-1 images. Furthermore, this study proposes to provide the network with the distance map to past-deforestation as additional information to the pair of images being compared. In our experiments, this proposal brought up to 4% improvement in average precision. The experimental results further indicated a clear superiority of the DL approach over a time series-based deforestation detection method used as a baseline in all experiments. Finally, the study proved the benefits of pre-processing techniques when using detection methods based on time series. On the contrary, the analysis revealed that the neural network could eliminate noise from the input images, making filtering innocuous and, therefore, unnecessary. On the other hand, the stabilization of the input images brought non-negligible accuracy gains to the DL approach.

TI  - Genus-Level Mapping of Invasive Floating Aquatic Vegetation Using Sentinel-2 Satellite Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasive floating aquatic vegetation negatively impacts wetland ecosystems and mapping this vegetation through space and time can aid in designing and assessing effective control strategies. Current remote sensing methods for mapping floating aquatic vegetation at the genus level relies on airborne imaging spectroscopy, resulting in temporal gaps because routine hyperspectral satellite coverage is not yet available. Here we achieved genus level and species level discrimination between two invasive aquatic vegetation species using Sentinel 2 multispectral satellite data and machine-learning classifiers in summer and fall. The species of concern were water hyacinth (Eichornia crassipes) and water primrose (Ludwigia spp.). Our classifiers also identified submerged and emergent aquatic vegetation at the community level. Random forest models using Sentinel-2 data achieved an average overall accuracy of 90%, and class accuracies of 79-91% and 85-95% for water hyacinth and water primrose, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first study that has mapped water primrose to the genus level using satellite remote sensing. Sentinel-2 derived maps compared well to those derived from airborne imaging spectroscopy and we also identified misclassifications that can be attributed to the coarser Sentinel-2 spectral and spatial resolutions. Our results demonstrate that the intra-annual temporal gaps between airborne imaging spectroscopy observations can be supplemented with Sentinel-2 satellite data and thus, rapidly growing/expanding vegetation can be tracked in real time. Such improvements have potential management benefits by improving the understanding of the phenology, spread, competitive advantages, and vulnerabilities of these aquatic plants.

TI  - CHLOROPHYLL-A ESTIMATION AND RELATIONSHIP ANALYSIS WITH SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE AND FISH DIVERSITY.
T2  - Journal of Sustainability Science and Management
M3  - Article
AB  - Phytoplanktons are sensitive to temperature changes and can only thrive in certain sea surface temperatures (SST). To determine the relationship between the two variables, the Chlorophyll (Chl-a) in phytoplanktons around the Bidong Island, Terengganu was estimated using the Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) running two algorithms -C2RCC and OC3M -between 2015 and 2016. The OC3M algorithm resulted in better Chl-a estimation values with RMSE of 0.05 and MAE of 0.049. The relationship analysis was done using linear regression between OC3M Chl-a and MODIS SST. The regression analysis found that the Chl-a variation in the area was only weakly affected by the SST, with highest negative correlation of-0.2867 in September 2016. Fish sampling in the study area showed that there was significant difference in the diversity of fish species between the years 2015 and 2016. Comparison with Chl-a distribution showed that high species diversity and abundance of fish reduces the amount of Chl-a = in the water. Thus, this research can be further explored for sustainable fish production in the future.

TI  - Can Satellite-Based Thermal Anomalies Be Indicative of Heatwaves? An Investigation for MODIS Land Surface Temperatures in the Mediterranean Region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, an exceptional number of record-shattering temperature extremes have been observed, resulting in significant societal and environmental impacts. The Mediterranean region is particularly thermally vulnerable, frequently suffering from intense and severe heatwaves. Using daily temperature observations from 58 weather stations (NOAA Global Historical Climatology Network daily database) in the Mediterranean area, past heatwave episodes were initially detected. A daily LST time series was developed using Land Surface Temperature (LST) products from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (Terra & Aqua satellites) for a 19-year period (2002-2020) at the station locations. LST anomalies were identified using percentile-based indices. It was found that remotely sensed-based LST presents the potential for understanding and monitoring heatwave events, as surface thermal anomalies were generally indicative of heatwaves. Approximately 42% (39%) of heatwave days during daytime (nighttime) coincided with LST anomalies; conversely, 51% of daytime LST anomalies overlapped with the exact days of a heatwave (38% at night). Importantly, the degree of association was significantly higher for extremely hot days (up to an 80% match) and long-lasting heatwaves (up to an 85% match). Rising trends in frequency and duration were observed for both heatwaves and LST anomalies. The results advance the understanding of surface-atmosphere coupling during extreme temperature days and reflect the suitability of thermal remote sensing in heatwave preparedness strategies.

TI  - Synergistic Use of the SRAL/MWR and SLSTR Sensors on Board Sentinel-3 for the Wet Tropospheric Correction Retrieval
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-3 satellites are equipped with dual-band Microwave Radiometers (MWR) to derive the wet tropospheric correction (WTC) for satellite altimetry. The deployed MWR lack the 18 GHz channel, which mainly provides information on the surface emissivity. Currently, this information is considered using additional parameters, one of which is the sea surface temperature (SST) extracted from static seasonal tables. Recent studies show that the use of a dynamic SST extracted from Numerical Weather Models (ERA5) improves the WTC retrieval. Given that Sentinel-3 carries on board the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR), from which SST observations are derived simultaneously with those of the Synthetic Aperture Radar Altimeter and MWR sensors, this study aims to develop a synergistic approach between these sensors for the WTC retrieval over open ocean. Firstly, the SLSTR-derived SSTs are evaluated against the ERA5 model; secondly, their impact on the WTC retrieval is assessed. The results show that using the SST input from SLSTR, instead of ERA5, has no impact on the WTC retrieval, both globally and regionally. Thus, for the WTC retrieval, there seems to be no advantage in having collocated SST and radiometer observations. Additionally, this study reinforces the fact that the use of dynamic SST leads to a significant improvement over the current Sentinel-3 WTC operational algorithms.

TI  - Mapping Degraded Area for Tropical Peatland Revegetation Using Forest Canopy Density Model Landsat 8 OLI-TIRS in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia
T2  - Environment and Natural Resources Journal
M3  - Article
AB  - Peatland rehabilitation in Indonesia has been massively carried out since 2016 following a huge fire event in 2015. Rehabilitation efforts have so far focused only on burned areas, although non-forested areas and areas with a limited number of juveniles must also be considered for natural regeneration. Spatial mapping can identify areas that need revegetation so that resources can be used more effectively and efficiently. This study aims to map potential areas for peatland rehabilitation by determining the distribution of tree canopy cover using the Forest Canopy Density (FCD) model from Landsat 8 OLI. The area selected for study was Ex-Mega Rice Project (MRP) area in Pulang Pisau district and Palangka Raya city, which burns almost every year. The study identifies eight areas with different levels of Forest Cover Density (FCD). Our field observation confirms that the eight different areas have different levels of natural revegetation. When forest cover is 1-30% of the FCD model, natural regeneration is insufficient and revegetation is required. This study found that 34,543.3 ha or 22.1% of the area of the MRP needs to be rehabilitated. This result provides information on which areas can be naturally revegetated and which areas need to be rehabilitated. This information is important to develop a peat restoration strategy and increase the likelihood of success.

TI  - A Multi-Step Approach for Optically Active and Inactive Water Quality Parameter Estimation Using Deep Learning and Remote Sensing
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Water is a fundamental resource for human survival but the consumption of water that is unfit for drinking leads to serious diseases. Access to high-resolution satellite imagery provides an opportunity for innovation in the techniques used for water quality monitoring. With remote sensing, water quality parameter concentrations can be estimated based on the band combinations of the satellite images. In this study, a hybrid remote sensing and deep learning approach for forecasting multi-step parameter concentrations was investigated for the advancement of the traditionally employed water quality assessment techniques. Deep learning models, including a convolutional neural network (CNN), fully connected network (FCN), recurrent neural network (RNN), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and long short term memory (LSTM), were evaluated for multi-step estimations of an optically active parameter, i.e., electric conductivity (EC), and an inactive parameter, i.e., dissolved oxygen (DO). The estimation of EC and DO concentrations can aid in the analysis of the levels of impurities and oxygen in water. The proposed solution will provide information on the necessary changes needed in water management techniques for the betterment of society. EC and DO parameters were taken as independent variables with dependent parameters, i.e., pH, turbidity, total dissolved solids, chlorophyll-alpha, Secchi disk depth, and land surface temperature, which were extracted from Landsat-8 data from the years 2014-2021 for the Rawal stream network. The bidirectional LSTM obtained better results with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.2 (mg/L) for DO and an RMSE of 281.741 (mu S/cm) for EC, respectively. The results suggest that a hybrid approach provides efficient and accurate results in feature extraction and evaluation of multi-step forecast of both optically active and inactive water quality parameters.

TI  - Potential Applicability of Local Resection With Prophylactic Left Gastric Artery Basin Dissection for Early-Stage Gastric Cancer in the Upper Third of the Stomach
T2  - JOURNAL OF GASTRIC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Total or proximal gastrectomy of the upper-third early gastric cancer (u-EGC) often causes severe post-gastrectomy syndrome, suggesting that these procedures are extremely invasive for patients without pathologically positive lymph node (LN) metastasis. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical applicability of a stomach function-preserving surgery, local resection (LR), with prophylactic left gastric artery (LGA)-basin dissection (LGA-BD). Materials and Methods: The data of patients with u-EGC (pathologically diagnosed as T1) were retrospectively analyzed. Total gastrectomy was performed in 30 patients, proximal gastrectomy in 45, and subtotal gastrectomy in 6; the LN status was evaluated assuming that the patients had already underwent LR + LGA-BD. This procedure was considered feasible in patients without LN metastases or in patients with cancer in the LGA basin. The reproducibility of the results was also evaluated using an external validation dataset. Results: Of the 82 eligible patients, 79 (96.3%) were cured after undergoing LR + LGA-BD, 74 (90.2%) were pathologically negative for LN metastases, and 5 (6.1%) had LN metastases, but these findings were only observed in the LGA basin. Similarly, of the 406 eligible tumors in the validation dataset, 396 (97.5%) were potentially curative. Tumors in the lesser curvature, post-endoscopic resection status, and small tumors (<20 mm) were considered to be stronger indicators of LR + LGA-BD as all subpopulation cases met our feasibility criteria. Conclusions: More than 95% of the patients with u-EGC might be eligible for LR + LGA-BD. This function-preserving procedure may contribute to the development of u-EGC without pathological LN metastases, especially for tumors located at the lesser curvature.

TI  - Developing a Fuzzy Inference System Based on Multi-Sensor Data to Predict Powerful Earthquake Parameters
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Predicting the parameters of upcoming earthquakes has always been one of the most challenging topics in studies related to earthquake precursors. Increasing the number of sensors and satellites and consequently incrementing the number of observable possible earthquake precursors in different layers of the lithosphere, atmosphere, and ionosphere of the Earth has opened the possibility of using data fusion methods to estimate and predict earthquake parameters with low uncertainty. In this study, a Mamdani fuzzy inference system (FIS) was proposed and implemented in five case studies. In particular, the magnitude of Ecuador (16 April 2016), Iran (12 November 2017), Papua New Guinea (14 May 2019), Japan (13 February 2021), and Haiti (14 August 2021) earthquakes were estimated by FIS. The results showed that in most cases, the highest number of anomalies was usually observed in the period of about one month before the earthquake and the predicted magnitude of the earthquake in these periods was slightly different from the actual magnitude value. Therefore, based on the results of this study, it could be concluded that if a significant number of anomalies are observed in the time series of different precursors, it is likely that an earthquake of the magnitude predicted by the proposed FIS system within the Dobrovolsky area of the studied location will happen during the next month.

TI  - An exceedingly rare simultaneous incidental occurrence of synchronous primary malignancies; Invasive Ductal Carcinoma and Renal Cell Carcinoma in a male - A Case Report
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction and importance: Synchronous malignancies are defined as the emergence of one or more tumors which either occur simultaneously or within 6 months of each other. Populations older than 50 years of age are the most vulnerable. Documented prevalence rates of synchronous neoplasia are 4.5-11.7 %. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first documented case of synchronous primary incidental occurrence of Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) and Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) in a Middle Eastern male. This type of co-occurrence must be borne in mind because such neoplastic occurrence is potentially fatal. Documentation is essential to raise awareness and to decrease the resultant morbidity and mortality.Case presentation: We present a case of a 61-year-old male who presented to our clinic with a 22-day-history of gradual, painless, and disproportionate hypertrophy of his left breast. CT scan revealed incidental breast and right kidney masses. Therapeutic intervention included a modified radical mastectomy with Sentinel lymph node excision along with right radical nephrectomy.Clinical discussion: Treatment of our patient was multimodal. Accurate radiological studying together with clinical examination helped us in making a diagnosis. Treatment options for this pathology consist of a com-bination of surgery and/or adjuvant therapy.Conclusion: Synchronous IDC and RCC are an extremely rare co-occurrence, especially in males, particularly Middle Eastern males, and more specifically, those presenting asymptomatically as incidental findings. It is vital to further document and study such cases to establish innovative surgical techniques, screening modalities for males, and to overcome the consequential morbidity and mortality.

TI  - Locoregional Management of Breast Cancer: A Chronological Review
T2  - CURRENT ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Locoregional management of breast cancer is founded on evidence generated over a vast time period, much longer than the career span of many practicing physicians. Oncologists rely on specific patient and tumour characteristics to recommend modern-day treatments. However, some of this information may not have been available during prior periods in which the evidence was generated. For example, the comprehensive Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group (EBCTCG) meta-analyses published in the 2000s typically included older trials accruing patients between the 1960s and 1980s. This raises some uncertainty about whether conclusions from studies conducted in prior eras are as relevant or applicable to modern-day patients and treatments. Reviewing the chronological order and details of the evidence can be beneficial to understanding these nuances. This review discusses the evolution of locoregional management through some key clinical trials. We aim to highlight the time period in which the evidence was generated and emphasize the 10-year outcomes for the comparability of results. Evidence supporting surgical management of the breast and axilla, as well as details of radiotherapy are discussed briefly for all stages of breast cancer.

TI  - The Impact on Healthcare Workers of Italian Law n. 24/2017 "Gelli-Bianco" on Patient Safety and Medical Liability: A National Survey
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Italian "Gelli-Bianco" law (law n. 24 enacted by the Italian Government on 8 March 2017) introduced innovative changes and regulations regarding patient safety and healthcare workers' (HCWs) liability. We promoted a national survey to evaluate the effect of the law on HCWs. The questionnaire was edited and distributed using the free online tool "Google Forms" (Google LLC). The mode of administration chosen for the questionnaire was telematic self-completion. In particular, the questionnaire was sent to several portals of information, websites, in the scientific and medical sectors. Four hundred forty-five subjects participated in the survey. The differences in categorical variables for Gelli-Bianco Law reading with professional variables were analyzed in a univariate analysis using the Chi-square test and Fisher's exact test. Reading the law is significantly and positively related to knowledge and communication of adverse events and sentinel events, checklist adoption, and participation in educational activities on risk management. The law's implementation and promotion is a reliable educational tool for increasing patient safety culture and involving HCWs in risk management activities. Knowledge of the law, related education, and understanding of its application are still inadequate; therefore, educational programs regarding patient safety, risk management, and the contents of the law itself must be vigorously promoted to achieve clinical governance goals.

TI  - Assessment of Spatio-Temporal Changes in Water Surface Extents and Lake Surface Temperatures Using Google Earth Engine for Lakes Region, Turkiye
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to extract water surface area and lake surface water temperature (LSWT), and to present long-term spatio-temporal analysis of these variables together with meteorological parameters. Three lakes in Turkiye's Lakes Region, namely, Lake Burdur, Egirdir, and Beysehir, were considered as test sites. The normalized difference water index (NDWI) was applied to Landsat 5 and 8 data from 2000 to 2021 to extract the water extent in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud-based platform. In addition to the lake surface area, Landsat thermal images were used to examine the LSWT. The findings indicated that water pixels could be extracted rather accurately using NDWI, with an overall accuracy of 98%. Between 2000 and 2021, the water surface area value of Lake Burdur decreased by more than 22%, while Lake Egirdir has dropped by less than 4%, and Lake Beysehir has not changed noticeably. LSWT of Burdur and Egirdir Lakes increased by more than 2.13 degrees C and 0.32 degrees C, respectively, while it decreased about 1.5 degrees C for Beysehir Lake. The obtained results were evaluated with meteorological parameters and our findings indicated that human-induced activities were more dominant than climate effects over Lake Burdur, unlike the others.

TI  - Confocal Characterization of Intestinal Dendritic Cells from Myxines to Teleosts
T2  - BIOLOGY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary This research aimed to define intestinal DCs from myxines to teleosts by using immunohistochemistry with TLR-2, Langerin/CD207, and MHC II. In particular, we analyzed intestinal DCs in several species of fish phylogenetically organized: Eptatretus cirrhatus (myxines), Scyliorhinus canicula (Chondrichthyes), Polypterus senegalus (Osteichthyes, Brachiopterygii), Lepisosteus oculatus (Osteichthyes, Holostei), and Clarias batrachus (Osteichthyes, Teleostei). The findings show that intestinal DCs and DC-like cells are positive to all the antibodies tested, demonstrating the presence of these cells phylogenetically from myxines to teleosts. These results could improve the state-of-the-art on the evolution of the immune system and the importance of sentinel cells in the body's defense. In addition, we demonstrated with immunohistochemistry the presence of MHC II in myxines (Eptatretus cirrhatus) for the first time. Dendritic cells (DCs) are antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that regulate the beginning of adaptive immune responses. The mechanisms of tolerance to antigens moving through the digestive tract are known to be regulated by intestinal DCs. Agnatha and Gnathostoma are descendants of a common ancestor. The Ostracoderms gave rise to Cyclostomes, whereas the Placoderms gave rise to Chondrichthyes. Sarcopterygii and Actinopterygii are two evolutionary lines of bony fishes. Brachiopterygii and Neopterygii descend from the Actinopterygii. From Neopterygii, Holostei and Teleostei evolved. Using immunohistochemistry with TLR-2, Langerin/CD207, and MHC II, this study aimed to characterize intestinal DCs, from myxines to teleosts. The findings reveal that DCs are positive for the antibodies tested, highlighting the presence of DCs and DC-like cells phylogenetically from myxines, for the first time, to teleosts. These findings may aid in improving the level of knowledge about the immune system's evolution and these sentinel cells, which are crucial to the body's defense.

TI  - What is a Worldview? Some Suggestions from the History of the Concept
T2  - NEGOTIATION JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The word "worldview" comes from German philosophy and literally means an all-inclusive "vision of the world." Nowadays, the word has a more generic cultural or geopolitical usage, often associated with an equivocal or indefinite meaning. This article looks at the history of the word and clarifies its meaning and implications. For such an analysis, two thinkers, Wilhelm Dilthey and Karl Jaspers, both of whom thematized the concept of Weltanschauung at the beginning of the twentieth century, will be taken into account. What follows is a brief depiction of some peculiar and constitutive traits of the concept: its composite nature; its connection to life; its value in general; and its value for each individual who holds a worldview. The article suggests that the potential conflictuality between contrary or competing worldviews is not accidental; rather, it is an inherent aspect of the concept, at whose core is a delicate balance between internal strength and external challenge, referred to here as "the vitality paradox" of a worldview.

TI  - Crop Yield Prediction Using Multi Sensors Remote Sensing (Review Article)
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Pre-harvest prediction of a crop yield may prevent a disastrous situation and help decision-makers to apply more reliable and accurate strategies regarding food security. Remote sensing has numerous returns in the area of crop monitoring and yield prediction which are closely related to differences in soil, climate, and any biophysical and biochemical changes. Different remote techniques could be used for crop monitoring and yield prediction including multi and hyper spectral data, radar and lidar imagery.This study reviews the potentialities, advantages and disadvantages of each technique and the applica-bility of these techniques under different agricultural conditions. It also shows the different methods in which these techniques could be used efficiently. In addition, the study expects future scenarios of remote sensing applications in vegetation monitoring and the ways to overcome any obstacles that may face this work.It was found that using satellite data with high spthermaatial resolution are still the most powerful method to be used for crop monitoring and to monitor crop parameters. Assessment of crop spectroscopic parameters through field or laboratory devices could be used to identify and quantify many crop bio -chemical and biophysical parameters. They could be also used as early indicators of plant infections; however, these techniques are not efficient for crop monitoring over large areas.(c) 2022 National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science.

TI  - Investigating the Ability to Identify New Constructions in Urban Areas Using Images from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, Google Earth, and Sentinel-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the main problems in developing countries is unplanned urban growth and land use change. Timely identification of new constructions can be a good solution to mitigate some environmental and social problems. This study examined the possibility of identifying new constructions in urban areas using images from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), Google Earth and Sentinel-2. The accuracy of the land cover map obtained using these images was investigated using pixel-based processing methods (maximum likelihood, minimum distance, Mahalanobis, spectral angle mapping (SAM)) and object-based methods (Bayes, support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest-neighbor (KNN), decision tree, random forest). The use of DSM to increase the accuracy of classification of UAV images and the use of NDVI to identify vegetation in Sentinel-2 images were also investigated. The object-based KNN method was found to have the greatest accuracy in classifying UAV images (kappa coefficient = 0.93), and the use of DSM increased the classification accuracy by 4%. Evaluations of the accuracy of Google Earth images showed that KNN was also the best method for preparing a land cover map using these images (kappa coefficient = 0.83). The KNN and SVM methods showed the highest accuracy in preparing land cover maps using Sentinel-2 images (kappa coefficient = 0.87 and 0.85, respectively). The accuracy of classification was not increased when using NDVI due to the small percentage of vegetation cover in the study area. On examining the advantages and disadvantages of the different methods, a novel method for identifying new rural constructions was devised. This method uses only one UAV imaging per year to determine the exact position of urban areas with no constructions and then examines spectral changes in related Sentinel-2 pixels that might indicate new constructions in these areas. On-site observations confirmed the accuracy of this method.

TI  - Precision Chemical Weed Management Strategies: A Review and a Design of a New CNN-Based Modular Spot Sprayer
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Review
AB  - Site-specific weed control offers a great potential for herbicide savings in agricultural crops without causing yield losses and additional weed management costs in the following years. Therefore, precision weed management is an efficient tool to meet the EU targets for pesticide reduction. This review summarizes different commercial technologies and prototypes for precision patch spraying and spot spraying. All the presented technologies have in common that they consist of three essential parts. (1) Sensors and classifiers for weed/crop detection, (2) Decision algorithms to decide whether weed control is needed and to determine a suitable type and rate of herbicide. Usually, decision algorithms are installed on a controller and (3) a precise sprayer with boom section control or single nozzle control. One point that differs between some of the techniques is the way the decision algorithms classify. They are based on different approaches. Green vegetation can be differentiated from soil and crop residues based on spectral information in the visible and near-infrared wavebands ("Green on Brown"). Those sensors can be applied for real-time on/off control of single nozzles to control weeds before sowing after conservation tillage and in the inter-row area of crops. More sophisticated imaging algorithms are used to classify weeds in crops ("Green on Green"). This paper will focus on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for plant species identification. Alternatively, the position of each crop can be recorded during sowing/planting and afterward herbicides can be targeted to single weeds or larger patches of weeds if the economic weed threshold is exceeded. With a standardized protocol of data communication between sensor, controller and sprayer, the user can combine different sensors with different sprayers. In this review, an ISOBUS communication protocol is presented for a spot sprayer. Precision chemical weed control can be realized with tractor-mounted sprayers and autonomous robots. Commercial systems for both classes will be introduced and their economic and environmental benefits and limitations will be highlighted. Farmers ask for robust systems with less need for maintenance and flexible application in different crops.

TI  - Impact of image acquisition lag-time on monitoring short-term postfire spectral dynamics in tropical savannas: the Campos Amazonicos Fire Experiment
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of optical remote sensing to monitor short-term postfire dynamics in rapidly recovering ecosystems is a complex task, requiring strong spectral separability and high temporal resolution. Thus, characterizing the effects of temporal lag in image acquisitions in relation to fire occurrence is of fundamental importance to improve our understanding of how fire-related environmental and ecological processes are connected to multitemporal spectral information. We used a harmonized series of Sentinel-2A/2B and Landsat-7/8 images paired with a fire experiment specifically designed for remote sensing assessment to evaluate short-term spectral responses of fire in tropical savannas. Our experimental design included strategic geolocation of experimental plots and separate prescribed burnings during the early- and mid-dry seasons. The M-statistic was used to assess spectral separability between burned and control treatments, and the temporal stability was assessed using fire scar latency, a custom statistic adapted to capture scar spectral responses over time. Finally, linear regressions were fitted to explore the association between consumed fuel load and spectral indices. The variation of normalized burn ratio and mid-infrared bispectral index indices stood out with the highest separability (M-statistic > 3) in both treatments and moderate-high association with consumed fuel load (R-2 > 0.54). We observed that burned areas spectral sensitivity depends not only on timing of image acquisition but also on fire season and their interactions with land surface phenology. Our characterization provides a solid benchmark for future experimental assessments of fire spectral responses and provides new insights for improving fire monitoring algorithms.

TI  - Wetland Hydroperiod Analysis in Alberta Using InSAR Coherence Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are dynamic environments, the water and vegetation of which can change considerably over time. Thus, it is important to investigate the hydroperiod status of wetlands using advanced techniques such as remote sensing technology. Wetland hydroperiod analysis has already been investigated using optical satellite and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscattering data. However, interferometric SAR (InSAR) coherence products have rarely been used for wetland hydroperiod mapping. Thus, this study utilized Sentinel-1 coherence maps produced between 2017 and 2020 (48 products) to map the wetland hydroperiod over the entire province of Alberta, Canada. It was observed that a coherence value of 0.45 was an optimum threshold value to discriminate flooded from non-flooded wetlands. Moreover, the results showed that most wetlands were inundated less than 50% of the time over these four years. Furthermore, most wetlands (similar to 40%) were seasonally inundated, and there was a small percentage of wetlands (similar to 5%) that were never flooded. Overall, the results of this study demonstrated the high capability of InSAR coherence products for wetland hydroperiod analysis. Several suggestions are provided to improve the results in future works.

TI  - Facies Mapping of the Holocene Carbonate Complexes in Kepulauan Seribu Java Basin, Indonesia Using Satellite-Derived Data Set
T2  - PERTANIKA JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The analog study is common in understanding buried reservoirs and the relationship between architectural complexity and heterogeneity of carbonate deposits. This study processed satellite and false-color images using single-band images and classified them using a supervised classification technique to generate an environmental facies map. Thus, the study's objectives are to map facies distribution in selected carbonate depositional environment and investigate oceanographic parameters that influence the development and evolution of modern carbonates in Holocene Kepulauan Seribu patch reef complexes, Java Basin. The main sub-environments are reef sand apron, subtidal reefal margin, and shallower subtidal lagoon. Annual wind patterns in the Java Basin have influenced the development of carbonate sediment in the Kepulauan Seribu archipelago, resulting in the formation of an isolated carbonate platform pattern with a single crest and asymmetrical dipping flanks. Meanwhile, the salinity of seawater influences the production of modern carbonate deposits as the Java basin is situated at the equator line, where the salinity of the seawater is moderately salty (35 parts per thousand) and contributes to the favorable conditions for carbonate growth. The analysis of oceanographic elements with the integration of quantified environmental facies distribution is conducted to monitor the deposition of carbonate sediments which the deposition of carbonate sediments which gives insight into carbonate distribution on the studied platforms. Satellite-derived facies maps provide an accurate overview of depositional facies patterns at the field scale in the oil and gas industry, enabling geologists to assess the potential of an oil and gas reservoir.

TI  - Drought Risk Evaluation in Iran by Using Geospatial Technologies
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A drought risk map has been developed at the national scale by using remote-sensing satellite data over Iran by combining output layers resulting from three main components of a risk-evaluation procedure including Hazard Quantification (HQ), Vulnerability Assessment (VA) and Identification of Elements at Risk (IER) in a GIS environment. In this respect, Drought Severity (DS) was calculated by using the monthly Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) (over 31 years from 1986-2016). Iran landcover classification and a slope map, population density maps, and irrigated farm percentages at the provincial scale were utilized within the drought risk evaluation (DRE) process. The final risk map reveals that the northwest of the country, with a climate similar to the central European weather conditions, is exposed to the maximum drought risk. In contrast, the areas with an arid climate, mainly located in the middle of Iran, exhibits minimum risk against drought. Based on the risk map, the southern part of the Caspian Sea shows very low drought risk due to the moderate and subtropical climate in this region. The outputs of this research will provide advice and warnings to help decision makers reduce drought risk consequences after prioritizing risk areas at the administrative scale.

TI  - Lowering the Temperature to Increase Heat Equity: A Multi-Scale Evaluation of Nature-Based Solutions in Toronto, Ontario, Canada
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Nature-based solutions (NbS) present an opportunity to reduce rising temperatures and the urban heat island effect. A multi-scale study in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, evaluates the effect of NbS on air and land surface temperature through two field campaigns at the micro and meso scales, using in situ measurements and LANDSAT imagery. This research demonstrates that the application of NbS in the form of green infrastructure has a beneficial impact on urban climate regimes with measurable reductions in air and land surface temperatures. Broad implementation of green infrastructure is a sustainable solution to improve the urban climate, enhance heat and greenspace equity, and increase resilience.

TI  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY OF ENDEMIC BLACK-WINGED STARLING Acridotheres melanopterus tricolor (HORSFIELD, 1821) RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS IN A TROPICAL SAVANNA OF INDONESIA.
T2  - Zoo Indonesia
M3  - Article
AB  - The black-winged starling (Acridotheres melanopterus tricolor) is a bird species in Southeast Asia, and this species still exists within Indonesia's tropical savanna landscape. This study aims to estimate the population density of the A. m. tricolor and to model the relationship between this species density and its environmental factors in several land cover types in the Baluran National Park savanna landscape in Java. The environmental factors were Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), land cover size, and distance to river obtained from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and analyzed using Geographical Information System (GIS). General Additive Models (GAM) combined with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to analyze the correlation of bird density with environmental factors. Based on the results, the average density of the A. m. tricolor was eight (8) inds./km2. The correlation model showed a significant positive relationship between bird density and NDVI and a significant negative relationship for distance to river factors, while land cover size did not significantly correlate with the bird density. These findings suggest that vegetation and access to water sources remain a relatively important environmental factors for supporting A. m. tricolor populations and this species conservation in the tropical landscape. The novelty of this research is satellite imagery and GIS usage to elaborate the landscape and habitat of A. m. tricolor. In addition, this study also contributes to modelling the most overarching environmental factors of A. m. tricolor in Indonesia's tropical savanna landscape.

TI  - Terra and Aqua MODIS collection 7 level 1B algorithm
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) continues to be an important instrument for NASA's earth observing system. Terra and Aqua MODIS have produced more than 22 and 20 years of global datasets that have significantly helped scientists better understand the Earth's systems, respectively. The MODIS level-1B (L1B) algorithms use the uncalibrated, geolocated Earth scene observations as input and convert the instrument response into calibrated reflectance and radiance, which are used to generate the downstream science products. The sustained calibration and characterization activities undertaken by the MODIS characterization support team have resulted in several upgrades to the L1B algorithms to maintain accurate calibration in the data products. We present an overview of the L1B algorithm designated as Collection 7. Various algorithm enhancements both in the reflective bands and thermal bands characterization are currently under science testing and evaluation. Once applied in data processing (projected in early 2023), they are expected to manifest in improved science products, both in terms of radiometric accuracy and long-term stability.

TI  - Channel Migration Detection and Landuse/Landcover Changes for Barak River in Northeast India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA
M3  - Article
AB  - In northeast India, Barak river is among one of the principal rivers, which is highly meandering in nature in its flood plain area. For infrastructural development and river protection works, it is essential to know the behavior of banklines shifting on landuse and landcover changes. This study is to evaluate the impact of bank lines shifting on land use and land cover changes. In order to fulfill the purpose of the present study 12 reaches with 41 cross-sections have been selected. The whole work has been done with the help of RS and GIS techniques using Landsat images and hybrid classification for the landuse and landcover classification. The result of the study shows that in the upper reach of the alluvial plain, there is an active shifting. Also, it is observed that at the lower reach, the river has moved in both north and south direction. It is observed that maximum migration rate is 130.2 m/year with a mean migration rate (9.43 m/year). The sinuosity estimated for the same reach with 12 bends is in the range 1.24-3.89. Among all the sections, the minimum and maximum changes of width are 0.26m and 249.93m respectively with an average value of 84.51m. It is found that the Barak river can be classified into sinuous channel (1.05 to 1.5), as well as meandering channel (>1.5). The investigation of changes in the pattern of land use land cover (LULC) of the Barak basin over 33 year's period (1984-2017) shows that urban/built-up and agricultural land was increased gradually, e.g., urban increased by 40.6% for 1984-1992, 72.14% for 2002-2012, 180.15% for 1984-2017. While, agricultural land increased by 18.9% for 1984-1992, 41.15% for 1992-2002 and 93.20% for 1984-2017. In addition water bodies increased by 19% and 41.73% from 1984-1992 and 1984-2017 respectively. In contrast, dense vegetation decreased by 5.6% for 1984-1992 and 21.77% for 2002-2012 and 39.14% for 1984-2017. Open vegetation showed a decreasing trend by 11.1% for 1984-1992, 26.83% for 1992-2002, and 36.27% for 1984-2017. Rapid population growth, migration of rural people to urban, unawareness of biophysical limitations and poverty are some of the probable reasons behind the changes in the LULC. The results of the hybrid classification of the LULC of the Barak River for the Landsat 1(1984; MSS), Landsat 2 (1992; TM), Landsat 5 (2002; TM), Landsat 7(2012; ETM+) and Landsat 8(2017; OLI) showed overall classification accuracy of 90.83%, 86.67%, 90.56%, 93.33% and 86.11% with overall kappa statistics of 0.8900, 0.8400, 0.8867, 0.9200 and 0.8333 respectively. The channel migration directly affects the land use and land use change and has direct effect on the flood plain dwellers of the study area. All the assessments of this study highlight a significant message of immense vulnerability of the Barak river and also provide news about geomorpho-logical instabilities of the study area

TI  - Relationship between economy and ecology of Pearl River Delta Urban Agglomeration based on ecological footprint of net primary productivity.
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - With the acceleration of regional economic integration, human activities have played an increasingly crucial role in regional sustainable development. In this study, MODIS remote sensing data and ecological footprint of net primary productivity (EF-NPP) were leveraged to calculate the equivalence factor and yield factor of the six major biologically productive land areas in the Pearl River Delta Urban Agglomeration. We analyzed the changes in per capita ecological footprint, per capita ecological carrying capacity, natural resource utilization efficiency and ecological moderate population from 2000 to 2020. Results showed that the per capita ecological footprint in the Pearl River Delta Urban Agglomeration continued to rise from 2000 to 2020. The ecological occupation of energy land was the highest. The ecological footprint was high in west, low in middle, and higher in northwest of the study area. The per capita ecological carrying capacity was relatively high in Zhaoqing and hangmen and low in Shenzhen, Dongguan, Foshan and Zhongshan. The gap between the ecological moderate population and the regional actual population widened over time, reaching 30.62 million in 2020. The regional actual population was much larger than the ecological moderate population, indicating huge population pressure. The natural resource utilization efficiency of the three main industries was high. The economic benefits created by the per capita ecological footprint increased by 36800 yuan . hm(-2) during the research period, with an average annual growth rate of 1800 yuan . hm(-2). The growth rate of the tertiary industry was the highest. Therefore, the results could provide reference for the study on natural resource utilization efficiency in medium and small-scale regions.

TI  - Comparison of univariate and multivariate drought indices based on satellite data for hydrological drought monitoring in the Southern ARA, Mozambique
T2  - INGENIERIA DEL AGUA
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a natural phenomenon that affects socio-economic and environmental systems, so monitoring it is crucial to minimize its impacts. In Mozambique, in southern Africa, 70% of the population depends on agriculture for subsistence, and water for this activity is mostly extracted directly from rivers. In this paper we have compared several univariate and multivariate drought indices calculated with variables from satellite databases to define one that best fits the hydrological drought conditions in the watersheds of the Southern ARA of Mozambique. The hydrological conditions were defined using the Standardized Runoff Index 3-month cumulative (SRI-3). Using cross-correlations and linear and non-linear regression models, it was found that the Standardized Precipitation Index 3-month cumulative (SPI-3) could be used to monitor hydrological droughts in this region in (near) real time.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Changing coastal zones in Indonesia, such as coral reefs. seagrass, and mangroves, have an impact on tropical ecosystems. Excessive exploitation and sedimentation, in particular, have threatened the mangrove at Segara Anakan Cilacap. In order to evaluate temporal land cover changes and the impact of high siltation on the Segara Anakan lagoon system in Cilacap, Indonesia, a research was conducted. The land cover data from SPOT 4 was available in 2008, and the Sentinel-2A data was available in 2019. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used to enhance the Macro Class with supervised classification utilizing Maximum Likelihood techniques. Mangroves and water bodies declined between 2009 and 2019, whereas settlements and farmland areas increased, according to this study. In the western part of Segara Anakan. extensive siltation altered the biomass, structure. and composition of mangrove vegetation. At high sedimented habitats, Acanthus and Derris dominate, followed by Nypa. The changes in land cover and land use had an impact on socioeconomic factors. Decreases in water bodies and mangrove areas, as well as an increase in farmland, were significantly linked to a shift in society's livelihoods from fishermen to farmers. The destruction of mangrove habitats in the Segara Anakan has been accelerated by anthropogenic activity and population pressure. Because this sensitive environment is constantly threatened by anthropogenic activity and climate change, effective management of the Segara Anakan Lagoon mangrove eco-system is important for its long-term viability.

TI  - On the Importance of Representing Snow Over Sea-Ice for Simulating the Arctic Boundary Layer
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Correctly representing the snow on sea-ice has great potential to improve cryosphere-atmosphere coupling in forecasting and monitoring (e.g., reanalysis) applications, via improved modeling of surface temperature, albedo and emissivity. This can also enhance the all-weather all-surface coupled data assimilation for atmospheric satellite radiances. Using wintertime observations from two Arctic field campaigns, SHEBA and N-ICE2015, and satellite data, we explore the merits of different approaches to represent the snow over sea-ice in a set of 5-day coupled forecasts. Results show that representing the snow insulation effects is essential for capturing the wintertime surface temperature variability over sea-ice and its response to changes in the atmospheric forcing. Modeling the snow over sea-ice improves the representation of strong cooling events, reduces surface temperature biases in clear-sky conditions and improves the simulation of surface-based temperature inversions. In clear-sky conditions, when using a multi-layer snow scheme the root-mean-squared error in the surface temperature is reduced by about 60% for both N-ICE2015 and SHEBA. This study also highlights the role of compensating errors in different components of the surface energy budget in the Arctic boundary layer. During warm air intrusions, errors in the surface temperature increase when cloud phase and cloud radiative processes are misrepresented in the model, inducing large errors in the net radiative energy at the surface. This work indicates that numerical weather prediction systems can fully benefit from a better representation of snow over sea-ice, for example, with multi-layer snow schemes, combined with improvements to other boundary layer processes including mixed phase clouds.

TI  - Advantages of Nonlinear Intensity Components for Contrast-Based Multispectral Pansharpening
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we investigate whether a nonlinear intensity component can be beneficial for multispectral (MS) pansharpening based on component-substitution (CS). In classical CS methods, the intensity component is a linear combination of the spectral components and lies on a hyperplane in the vector space that contains the MS pixel values. Starting from the hyperspherical color space (HCS) fusion technique, we devise a novel method, in which the intensity component lies on a hyper-ellipsoidal surface instead of on a hyperspherical surface. The proposed method is insensitive to the format of the data, either floating-point spectral radiance values or fixed-point packed digital numbers (DNs), thanks to the use of a multivariate linear regression between the squares of the interpolated MS bands and the squared lowpass filtered Pan. The regression of squared MS, instead of the Euclidean radius used by HCS, makes the intensity component no longer lie on a hypersphere in the vector space of the MS samples, but on a hyperellipsoid. Furthermore, before the fusion is accomplished, the interpolated MS bands are corrected for atmospheric haze, in order to build a multiplicative injection model with approximately de-hazed components. Experiments on GeoEye-1 and WorldView-3 images show consistent advantages over the baseline HCS and a performance slightly superior to those of some of the most advanced methods.

TI  - Gamma-ray protection capacity evaluation and satellite data based mapping for the limestone, charnockite, and gneiss rocks in the Sirugudi taluk of the Dindigul district, India
T2  - RADIATION PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The remote sensing techniques for investigation and mapping of mineral resources along with the lithological variations have become a leading and optimistic way in recent years. Sirugudi taluk of Dindigul district, Tamil Nadu, is identified with many quarries of limestone and charnockite that have economic importance since that is used in the cement and construction industry. The present study validates the radiation shielding properties of limestone, charnockite, and gneiss rock and the mapping through remote sensing techniques. Several images processing techniques were performed using the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer data to delineate the boundaries of lithology at Sirugudi. The laboratory-based reflectance spectra obtained for the limestone, charnockite, and gneiss sample in the range of 350 nm-2500 nm shows a remarkable correlation with the significant oxides of the samples. The radiation shielding performance for the present rocks was investigated using the Monte Carlo simulation and the theoretical online program XCOM. The three investigated rock types' linear attenuation coefficient (mu) values are at their maximum at low energies, and the mu rapidly decreases as energy increases in the low energy range. For gneiss, the mu decreases from 32.484 cm(-1) to 4.731 cm(-1) between 0.015 and 0.030 MeV. At all investigated energies, the mu values follow the order of Charnockite > Gneiss > Limestone. Based on the simulated linear attenuation coefficient values, the half-value layer, radiation protection efficiency, and the thickness equivalent were estimated. The estimated results demonstrated that thinner rock thicknesses are needed to shield the incoming photons at lower energies. The half-value thicknesses are 0.021, 0.026, and 0.018 cm for Gneiss, Limestone, and Charnockite at 15 keV.

TI  - Mapping Crop Types of Germany by Combining Temporal Statistical Metrics of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Time Series with LPIS Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Nationwide and consistent information on agricultural land use forms an important basis for sustainable land management maintaining food security, (agro)biodiversity, and soil fertility, especially as German agriculture has shown high vulnerability to climate change. Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite data of the Copernicus program offer time series with temporal, spatial, radiometric, and spectral characteristics that have great potential for mapping and monitoring agricultural crops. This paper presents an approach which synergistically uses these multispectral and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) time series for the classification of 17 crop classes at 10 m spatial resolution for Germany in the year 2018. Input data for the Random Forest (RF) classification are monthly statistics of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 time series. This approach reduces the amount of input data and pre-processing steps while retaining phenological information, which is crucial for crop type discrimination. For training and validation, Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) data were available covering 15 of the 16 German Federal States. An overall map accuracy of 75.5% was achieved, with class-specific F1-scores above 80% for winter wheat, maize, sugar beet, and rapeseed. By combining optical and SAR data, overall accuracies could be increased by 6% and 9%, respectively, compared to single sensor approaches. While no increase in overall accuracy could be achieved by stratifying the classification in natural landscape regions, the class-wise accuracies for all but the cereal classes could be improved, on average, by 7%. In comparison to census data, the crop areas could be approximated well with, on average, only 1% of deviation in class-specific acreages. Using this streamlined approach, similar accuracies for the most widespread crop types as well as for smaller permanent crop classes were reached as in other Germany-wide crop type studies, indicating its potential for repeated nationwide crop type mapping.

AB  - The ground-based measurement of sea salt (SS) aerosol over the ocean requires the massive utilization of satellite-derived aerosol products. In this study, n-order spectral derivatives of aerosol optical depth (AOD) based on wavelength were examined to characterize SS and other aerosol types in terms of their spectral dependence related to their optical properties such as particle size distributions and complex refractive indices. Based on theoretical simulations from the second simulation of a satellite signal in the solar spectrum (6S) model, AOD spectral derivatives of SS were characterized along with other major types including mineral dust (DS), biomass burning (BB), and anthropogenic pollutants (APs). The approach (normalized derivative aerosol index, NDAI) of partitioning aerosol types with intrinsic values of particle size distribution and complex refractive index from normalized first- and second-order derivatives was applied to the datasets from a moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) as well as by the ground-based aerosol robotic network (AERONET). The results after implementation from multiple sources of data indicated that the proposed approach could be highly effective for identifying and segregating abundant SS from DS, BB, and AP, across an ocean. Consequently, each aerosol's shortwave radiative forcing and its efficiency could be further estimated in order to predict its impact on the climate.

TI  - Relationship of Attributes of Soil and Topography with Land Cover Change in the Rift Valley Basin of Ethiopia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the spatiotemporal trend of land cover (LC) change and its impact on humans and the environment is essential for decision making and ecosystem conservation. Land degradation generally accelerates overland flow, reducing soil moisture and base flow recharge, and increasing sediment erosion and transport, thereby affecting the entire basin hydrology. In this study, we analyzed watershed-scale processes in the study area, where agriculture and natural shrub land are the dominant LCs. The objective of this study was to assess the time series and spatial patterns of LCC using remotely-sensed data from 1973 to 2018, for which we used six snapshots of satellite images. The LC distribution in relation to watershed characteristics such as topography and soils was also evaluated. For LCC detection analysis, we used Landsat datasets accessed from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) archive, which were processed using remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques. Using these data, four major LC types were identified. The findings of an LC with an overall accuracy above 90% indicates that the area experienced an increase in agricultural LC at the expense of other LC types such as bushland, grazing land, and mixed forest, which attests to the semi-continuous nature of deforestation between 1973 and 2018. In 1973, agricultural land covered only 10% of the watershed, which later expanded to 48.4% in 2018. Bush, forest, and grazing land types, which accounted for 59.7%, 16.7%, and 13.5% of the watershed in 1973, were reduced to 45.2%, 2.3%, and 4.1%, respectively in 2018. As a result, portions of land areas, which had once been covered by pasture, bush, and forest in 1973, were identified as mixed agricultural systems in 2018. Moreover, spatial variability and distribution in LCC is significantly affected by soil type, fertility, and slope. The findings showed the need to reconsider land-use decision tradeoffs between social, economic, and environmental demands.

TI  - A novel method to simulate AVIRIS-NG hyperspectral image from Sentinel-2 image for improved vegetation/wildfire fuel mapping, boreal Alaska
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed vegetation maps are one of the primary inputs for forest and wildfire management. Hyperspectral remote sensing is a proven technique for detailed and accurate vegetation mapping. However, the availability of recent hyperspectral imagery in Alaska is limited because of the logistics and high cost involved in its acquisition. In this study, we simulated AVIRIS-NG (Airborne Visible InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer -Next Generation) hyperspectral data from widely available Sentinel-2 multispectral data using the Universal Pattern Decomposition Method (UPDM). The UPDM is a spectral unmixing technique that uses detailed ground spectra of vegetation classes and the Spectral Response Functions of AVIRIS-NG and Sentinel-2 sensors to simulate imagery with the same number of bands and spectral resolution as an AVIRIS-NG image. We simulated three images (each covering an area of 100 km x 100 km) from two ecoregions to test portability of the approach. We collected ground spectra of vegetation and bare ground during summers (2019-2021) using a PSR+ 3500 hand-held spectror-adiometer and created a spectral library for this study. The Iterative Endmember Selection (IES) algorithm was used to optimize the spectral library and to select the most representative endmembers for simulation: birch, spruce, and gravel. We validated the simulated hyperspectral imagery by comparing it with available AVIRIS-NG images. The simulated image was visually and spectrally similar to the AVIRIS-NG image (RMSE of 0.03 and 0.02 for birch and spruce spectra, respectively). We applied the Random Forest image classification model to derive detailed vegetation maps from the simulated images. Our vegetation map showed an improvement of 33% in the map accuracy compared to the LANDFIRE EVT map. This study demonstrated an efficient and cost-effective approach to derive detailed vegetation maps at the Sentinel scene scale by simulating hyperspectral images in Google's cloud environment. It offers a novel pathway to generate detailed vegetation and fuel maps for the whole boreal region of Alaska to aid effective forest and fire management.

TI  - Implications of an Elevated Nucleated Red Blood Cell Count in Neonates with Moderate to Severe Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives To investigate associations between nucleated red blood cell (NRBC) count in neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), acute perinatal sentinel events, and neurodevelopmental outcomes and to examine the mechanism(s) causing elevated counts.Study design We included newborn infants with HIE treated with therapeutic hypothermia with >= 3 NRBC counts during their neonatal intensive care unit hospitalization and neurodevelopmental evaluations at a mean of 24 +/- 6 months.Results Ninety-five of 152 infants who met our study criteria (63%) had a normal NRBC count after birth, defined as 95th percentile of the upper reference interval, and the other 57 (37%) had an elevated count. Documented sentinel events during labor resulting in emergency delivery (eg, acute abruption) (n = 79) were associated with a normal NRBC count (OR, 257; 95% CI, 33-1988). Of the 152 infants evaluated, 134 (88%) survived to discharge. The odds of surviving were 3-fold greater (OR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.1-8.3) when the first NRBC count was normal than when it was elevated. Normal counts were moderately predictive of infants without neurodevelopmental impairment at a 2-year evaluation (P < .001). NRBC half-life was longer in infants with an elevated NRBC count compared with those with a normal count (60 hours vs 39 hours; P < .01).Conclusions In infants with HIE, a normal NRBC count after birth was associated with acute intrapartum events necessitating emergent delivery. Normal counts were modestly predictive of a better prognosis. We speculate that the elevated NRBC counts at birth resulted from hypoxia that occurred earlier or chronically. Impaired clearance of NRBCs from the blood might be one mechanistic explanation for the high counts.

TI  - Thermal Structure of Water Exchange at the Entrance of a Tide-Dominated Strait
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In summer, westward residual flow in the Qiongzhou Strait (QS) drives a water transport through the strait into the Beibu Gulf, playing a vital role in modifying the gulf-scale circulation. By utilizing multi-source observations, realistic simulations, as well as idealized modeling, the water exchange process at the western entrance of the QS was explored from the perspective of thermal structure. High-resolution satellite sea-surface temperature images captured an interesting thermal phenomenon in the studied region, i.e., a trident-shaped warm water tongue. Validations of numerical results suggested satisfactory model performance in reproducing the trident-shaped warm water tongue. Modeling results together with cruise observations indicates extremely weak stratification in the studied region, which is a result of local intense tidal mixing. The cold upwelling water developed at the eastern side of the strait arrived at the western entrance by the westward residual flow, and then encountered and communicated with the well-mixed warm gulf water there. The alternatively deep/shallow topography (sea trough/ridge) triggers spatial variability in tidal current intensity: stronger currents over the deep area with weaker flow above the shallow region leads to alternatively warm/cold thermal distribution in the cross-isobath direction. Further investigation demonstrates that, through modifying the circulation and regulating the intensity of upwelling on the eastern side of the QS, wind also makes a significant contribution to the thermal distribution at the western entrance of the QS.

AB  - Objective Several controversies remain on conservative management of cervical cancer. Our aim was to develop a consensus recommendation on important and novel topics of fertility-sparing treatment of cervical cancer. Methods The consensus was sponsored by the Brazilian Society of Surgical Oncology (BSSO) from March 2020 to September 2020 and included a multidisciplinary team of 55 specialists. A total of 21 questions were addressed and they were assigned to specialists' groups that reviewed the literature and drafted preliminary recommendations. Further, the coordinators evaluated the recommendations that were classified by the level of evidence, and finally, they were voted by all participants. Results The questions included controversial topics on tumor assessment, surgical treatment, and surveillance in conservative management of cervical cancer. The two topics with lower agreement rates were the role of minimally invasive approach in radical trachelectomy and parametrial preservation. Additionally, only three recommendations had <90% of agreement (fertility preservation in Stage Ib2, anti-stenosis device, and uterine transposition). Conclusions As very few clinical trials have been developed in surgery for cervical cancer, most recommendations were supported by low levels of evidence. We addressed important and novel topics in conservative management of cervical cancer and our study may contribute to literature.

TI  - Wheat Water Deficit Monitoring Using Synthetic Aperture Radar Backscattering Coefficient and Interferometric Coherence
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the climate change situation, water deficit stress is becoming one of the main factors that threatens the agricultural sector in semi-arid zones. Thus, it is extremely important to provide efficient tools of water deficit monitoring and early detection. To do so, a set of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) backscattering and interferometric SAR (InSAR) Sentinel-1 data, covering the period from January to June 2016, are considered over a durum wheat field in Tunisia. We first studied the temporal variation of the InSAR coherence data and the SAR backscattering coefficient as a function of the phenological stage of the wheat. Subsequently, the parameters of the SAR and InSAR coherence images were analyzed with regard to the water stress coefficient and the wheat height variations. The main findings of this study highlight the high correlation (r = 0.88) that exists between the InSAR coherence and the water stress coefficient, on the one hand, and between the backscattering coefficient, the interferometric coherence, and the water deficit coefficient (R-2 = 0.95 and RMSE = 14%), on the other hand. When a water deficit occurs, the water stress coefficient increases, the crop growth decreases, and the height variation becomes low, and this leads to the increase of the InSAR coherence value. In summary, the reliability of Sentinel-1 SAR and InSAR coherence data to monitor the biophysical parameters of the durum wheat was validated in the context of water deficits in semi-arid regions.

TI  - Analysis of Meandering River Morphodynamics Using Satellite Remote Sensing Data-An Application in the Lower Deduru Oya (River), Sri Lanka
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - River meandering and anabranching have become major problems in many large rivers that carry significant amounts of sediment worldwide. The morphodynamics of these rivers are complex due to the temporal variation of flows. However, the availability of remote sensing data and geographic information systems (GISs) provides the opportunity to analyze the morphological changes in river systems both quantitatively and qualitatively. The present study investigated the temporal changes in the river morphology of the Deduru Oya (river) in Sri Lanka, which is a meandering river. The study covered a period of 32 years (1989 to 2021), using Landsat satellite data and the QGIS platform. Cloud-free Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 satellite images were extracted and processed to extract the river mask. The centerline of the river was generated using the extracted river mask, with the support of semi-automated digitizing software (WebPlotDigitizer). Freely available QGIS was used to investigate the temporal variation of river migration. The results of the study demonstrated that, over the past three decades, both the bend curvatures and the river migration rates of the meandering bends have generally increased with time. In addition, it was found that a higher number of meandering bends could be observed in the lower (most downstream) and the middle parts of the selected river segment. The current analysis indicates that the Deduru Oya has undergone considerable changes in its curvature and migration rates.

TI  - Estimation of aboveground biomass and carbon in palustrine wetland using bands and multispectral indices derived from optical satellite imageries PlanetScope and Sentinel-2A
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Facing the climate change and anthropogenic activities that have been discharging a large proportion of carbon dioxide CO2) into the atmosphere, wetlands stand out as an important sink for CO2 that is fixed in plant biomass and peatlands. Therefore, quantifying and monitoring wetland biomass is of great importance to preserve carbon stocks. This study aims to explore the potential of multispectral bands and vegetation indices (VIs) derived from PlanetScope and Sentinel-2A sensors to estimate of aboveground biomass (AGB) and organic carbon in AGB (Corg) in the emergent vegetation of a palustrine wetland. We use correlation analysis and linear regression models to examine the relationships between spectral and biophysical variables and verify the best predictor spectral variables for AGB and Corg. Scirpus giganteus vegetation was sampled in the Banhado Grande wetland, in southern Brazil. The VIs were best correlated and preferred as predictor variables. The most accurate model used data from the PlanetScope sensor and VI of photochemical reflectance. Both sensors showed potential for pixel-based estimates of AGB and Corg due to their low RMSE values and their contribution as predictors of biophysical variables, which can contribute to opening new avenues in scientific research focusing on the management, monitoring, and conservation of marshes and your ecosystem service of carbon sink.

TI  - Assessment of Large-Scale Seasonal River Morphological Changes in Ayeyarwady River Using Optical Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring morphologically dynamic rivers over large spatial domains at an adequate frequency is essential for informed river management to protect human life, ecosystems, livelihoods, and critical infrastructures. Leveraging the advancements in cloud-based remote sensing data processing through Google Earth Engine (GEE), a web-based, freely accessible seasonal river morphological monitoring system for Ayeyarwady River, Myanmar was developed through a collaborative process to assess changes in river morphology over time and space. The monitoring system uses Landsat satellite data spanning a 31-year long period (1988-2019) to map river planform changes along 3881.4 km of river length including Upper Ayeyarwady, Lower Ayeyarwady, and Chindwin. It is designed to operate on a seasonal timescale by comparing pre-monsoon and post-monsoon channel conditions to provide timely information on erosion and accretion areas for the stakeholders to support planning and management. The morphological monitoring system was validated with 85 reference points capturing the field conditions in 2019 and was found to be reliable for operational use with an overall accuracy of 89%. The average eroded riverbank area was calculated at around 45, 101, and 134 km(2) for Chindwin, Upper Ayeyarwady, and Lower Ayeyarwady, respectively. The historical channel change assessment aided us to identify and categorize river reaches according to the frequency of changes. Six hotspots of riverbank erosion were identified including near Mandalay city, the confluence of Upper Ayeyarwady and Chindwin, near upstream of Magway city, downstream of Magway city, near Pyay city, and upstream of the Ayeyarwady delta. The web-based monitoring system simplifies the application of freely available remote sensing data over the large spatial domain to assess river planform changes to support stakeholders' operational planning and prioritizing investments for sustainable Ayeyarwady River management.

TI  - Comparison between Physical and Empirical Methods for Simulating Surface Brightness Temperature Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a vital parameter in the surface energy budget and water cycle. One of the most important foundations for LST studies is a theory to understand how to model LST with various influencing factors, such as canopy structure, solar radiation, and atmospheric conditions. Both physical-based and empirical methods have been widely applied. However, few studies have compared these two categories of methods. In this paper, a physical-based method, soil canopy observation of photochemistry and energy fluxes (SCOPE), and two empirical methods, random forest (RF) and long short-term memory (LSTM), were selected as representatives for comparison. Based on a series of measurements from meteorological stations in the Heihe River Basin, these methods were evaluated in different dimensions, i.e., the difference within the same surface type, between different years, and between different climate types. The comparison results indicate a relatively stable performance of SCOPE with a root mean square error (RMSE) of approximately 2.0 K regardless of surface types and years but requires many inputs and a high computational cost. The empirical methods performed relatively well in dealing with cases either within the same surface type or changes in temporal scales individually, with an RMSE of approximately 1.50 K, yet became less compatible in regard to different climate types. Although the overall accuracy is not as stable as that of the physical method, it has the advantages of fast calculation speed and little consideration of the internal structure of the model.

TI  - Remote Sensing of the Water Quality Parameters for a Shallow Dam Reservoir
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines the chlorophyll a content and turbidity in the shallow dam reservoir of Lake Dobczyce. The analysis of satellite images for thirteen wavelength ranges enabled the selection of wavelengths applicable for a remote determination of chlorophyll a and turbidity. The selection was completed as the test of the significance of the coefficients in the equation, which calculates the values of the parameters on the basis of reflectance. The reflectance of the reservoir surface differs from the reflectance of individual water components, and the overlapping of spectral curves makes it difficult to isolate the significant reflectance. In the case of Lake Dobczyce, the significant reflectance was for wavelengths 665, 705, 740, and 842 nm (chlorophyll a) and for wavelengths 705, 740, and 783 nm (turbidity). In the model, the natural logarithm of chlorophyll a or turbidity was a linear combination of the natural log reflectance and the squares of those logarithms. A lake surface reflectance also includes the bottom reflectance. The reflectance obtained from the Sentinel-2 satellite was corrected with a bottom reflectance determined using the Lambert-Beer equation. The reflectance of a given surface may vary with the position of both the satellite and the sun, atmospheric pollution, and other factors. Correction of reflectance from satellite measurements was performed, as reflectance changes for the reference surface; the reference reflectance was assumed as the first reflectance of the reference surface observed during the study. The models helped to develop the maps of turbidity and chlorophyll a content in the lake.

TI  - Brain-Implantable Multifunctional Probe for Simultaneous Detection of Glutamate and GABA Neurotransmitters: Optimization and In Vivo Studies
T2  - MICROMACHINES
M3  - Article
AB  - Imbalances in levels of glutamate (GLU) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and their sub-second signaling dynamics occur in several brain disorders including traumatic brain injury, epilepsy, and Alzheimer's disease. The present work reports on the optimization and in vivo testing of a silicon (Si) multifunctional biosensor probe for sub-second simultaneous real-time detection of GLU and GABA. The Si probe features four surface-functionalized platinum ultramicroelectrodes (UMEs) for detection of GLU and GABA, a sentinel site, and integrated microfluidics for in-situ calibration. Optimal enzyme concentrations, size-exclusion phenylenediamine layer and micro spotting conditions were systematically investigated. The measured GLU sensitivity for the GLU and GABA sites were as high as 219 +/- 8 nA mu M-1 cm(-2) (n = 3). The measured GABA sensitivity was as high as 10 +/- 1 nA mu M-1 cm(-2) (n = 3). Baseline recordings (n = 18) in live rats demonstrated a useful probe life of at least 11 days with GLU and GABA concentrations changing at the levels of 100 ' s and 1000 ' s of mu M and with expected periodic bursts or fluctuations during walking, teeth grinding and other activities and with a clear difference in the peak amplitude of the sensor fluctuations between rest (low) and activity (higher), or when the rat was surprised (a reaction with no movement). Importantly, the probe could improve methods for large-scale monitoring of neurochemical activity and network function in disease and injury, in live rodent brain.

TI  - Combining Spatial and Temporal Data to Create a Fine-Resolution Daily Urban Air Temperature Product from Remote Sensing Land Surface Temperature (LST) Data
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST) is often used as a proxy for air temperature in urban heat island studies, particularly to illustrate relative temperature differences between locations. Two sensors are used predominantly in the literature, Landsat and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). However, each has shortcomings that currently limit its utility for many urban applications. Landsat has high spatial resolution but low temporal resolution, and may miss hot days, while MODIS has high temporal resolution but low spatial resolution, which is inadequate to represent the fine grain heterogeneity in cities. In this paper, we overcome this inadequacy by combining high spatial frequency Environmental Services (ES), Landsat-driven Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and MODIS low spatial frequency background LST at different spatial frequency bands (spatial spectral composition). The method is able to provide fine scale LST four times daily on any day of the year. Using data from Paris in 2019 we show that (1) daytime cooling by vegetation reaches a maximum of 30 degrees C, above which there is no further increase in cooling. In addition, (2) the cooling is relatively local and does not extend further than 200 m beyond the boundary of the NBS. This model can be used to quantify the benefits of NBS in providing cooling in cities.

TI  - Operational challenges of the Philippine Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Program during the COVID-19 pandemic
T2  - WESTERN PACIFIC SURVEILLANCE AND RESPONSE
M3  - Article
AB  - Problem: Operation of the Philippine Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Program (ARSP) has been affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, during which time difficulties in maintaining laboratory functions, staffing levels and participation were reported.Context: The COVID-19 pandemic has increased pressure on most health systems and programmes in the Philippines, including ARSP. As ARSP is the source of national data on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) trends, there are concerns that the negative effects of the pandemic may have impacted the quality of data produced.Action: We describe disruptions to laboratory operations, personnel availability and participation in ARSP surveillance, and their impact on reported data for 2020.Outcome: Surveillance operations were challenged by reallocation of human, infrastructure and financial resources for pandemic response among both the sentinel sites and the coordinating laboratory, the Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Reference Laboratory. There was a decrease in the amount of data submitted to the surveillance system, as well as in the number of isolates sent to the reference laboratory for confirmation of bacterial identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Nevertheless, overall performance scores of the sentinel sites for most parameters were comparable to 2019, the year prior to the pandemic.Discussion: The impact of operational changes to ARSP due to the pandemic needs to be considered when analysing AMR surveillance data from 2020. Automation of data submission, good working relationships between the coordinating laboratory and sentinel sites, and supply chain system strengthening were identified as key to maintaining AMR surveillance during the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - Comparing CNNs and Random Forests for Landsat Image Segmentation Trained on a Large Proxy Land Cover Dataset
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover mapping from satellite images has progressed from visual and statistical approaches to Random Forests (RFs) and, more recently, advanced image recognition techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs). CNNs have a conceptual benefit over RFs in recognising spatial feature context, but potentially at the cost of reduced spatial detail. We tested the use of CNNs for improved land cover mapping based on Landsat data, compared with RFs, for a study area of approximately 500 km x 500 km in southeastern Australia. Landsat 8 geomedian composite surface reflectances were available for 2018. Label data were a simple nine-member land cover classification derived from reference land use mapping (Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia-CLUM), and further enhanced by using custom forest extent mapping (Forests of Australia). Experiments were undertaken testing U-Net CNN for segmentation of Landsat 8 geomedian imagery to determine the optimal combination of input Landsat 8 bands. The results were compared with those from a simple autoencoder as well as an RF model. Segmentation test results for the best performing U-Net CNN models produced an overall accuracy of 79% and weighted-mean F1 score of 77% (9 band input) or 76% (6 band input) for a simple nine-member land cover classification, compared with 73% and 68% (6 band input), respectively, for the best RF model. We conclude that U-Net CNN models can generate annual land cover maps with good accuracy from proxy training data, and can also be used for quality control or improvement of existing land cover products.

TI  - Gleissberg Cycle Dependence of Inner Zone Proton Flux
T2  - SPACE WEATHER-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Inner zone proton flux from 1980 to mid-2021 is examined using NOAA POES satellite data, indicating a long-term increase corresponding to a one hundred year minimum in solar activity consistent with the Centennial Gleissberg Cycle. Variation of inner belt protons is correlated with decreasing F10.7 maxima over the 40-year period, serving as proxy for solar EUV input to Earth's atmosphere. Extending an earlier study (Qin et al., 2014; ) of >70 MeV protons from 1980 - 2021 using the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) peak flux, and at fixed L = 1.3, a comparison is made between the >35, >70 and >140 MeV energy channels on POES. All three energies show an increase in proton flux over the period 1998 - 2021 using a single spacecraft. The observed flux increase is correlated with decreasing F10.7 over the longer 40-year time interval, as with the similar to 11-year solar cycle. A phase lag during Solar Cycle 24 (January 2010 - June 2021) between the F10.7 minimum and proton flux maximum was determined to be similar to 500 days, the same at all energies studied. A model calculation of the inner zone proton flux is found to generally confirm the long-term trend examined both in absolute magnitude and phase lag. It is concluded that this long-term trend is a manifestation of the concurrent Gleissberg cycle minimum and accompanying decrease in solar EUV. Reduced EUV at solar maximum (F10.7 proxy) reduces proton loss to the atmosphere following solar maximum, thus explaining the long-term flux increase observed.

TI  - Evidence and implementation gaps in management of sentinel node-positive melanoma in the United States
T2  - SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Melanoma clinical trials demonstrated that completion lymph node dissection is low value for most sentinel lymph node-positive patients. Contemporaneous trials of adjuvant systemic immunotherapy and BRAF/MEK targeted therapy showed improved recurrence-free survival in high-risk sentinel lymph node-positive patients. To better understand how oncologic evidence is incorporated into practice (implementation), we evaluated factors associated with discontinuation of completion lymph node dissection and adoption of systemic treatment at United States Commission on Cancer -accredited centers. Methods: In a retrospective cohort study of adults with sentinel lymph node-positive melanoma treated from 2012 to 2017 using the National Cancer Database, we evaluated use of completion lymph node dissection and adjuvant systemic treatment using mixed-effects logistic regression, reporting results as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Results: Among 10,240 sentinel lymph node-positive melanoma patients, performance of completion lymph node dissection declined from 60% to 27%. Adjuvant systemic treatment increased from 29% to 43% (37% in stage IIIA patients, 46% in IIIB-C). Completion lymph node dissection was less common with lower extremity tumors (odds ratio = 0.53, 95% confidence interval = 0.44-0.64) and more common with multiple positive sentinel lymph nodes (odds ratio = 2.36, 95% confidence interval = 2.08-2.67), treatment at a high-or moderate-volume center (odds ratiohigh = 1.49, 95% confidence interval = 1.05 -2.12; odds ratiomoderate = 1.32, 95% confidence interval = 1.05-1.64), and receipt of systemic therapy (odds ratio = 1.44, 95% confidence interval = 1.27-1.63). The increased likelihood of completion lymph node dissection in patients receiving adjuvant systemic treatment persisted in the most recent study years and in patients with a single positive sentinel lymph node. Conclusion: At a population level, completion lymph node dissection declined and adjuvant systemic treatment increased, reflecting evidence-responsive care. Variation in persistent use of completion lymph node dissection and in provision of adjuvant treatment for lower risk patients highlights residual gaps in both evidence and implementation.(C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Grassland Use Intensity Classification Using Intra-Annual Sentinel-1 and-2 Time Series and Environmental Variables
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed spatial data on grassland use intensity is needed in several European policy areas for various applications, e.g., agricultural management, supporting nature conservation programs, improving biodiversity strategies, etc. Multisensory remote sensing is an efficient tool to collect information on grassland parameters. However, there is still a lack of studies on how to process, combine, and implement large radar and optical image datasets in a joint observation framework to map grassland types on large heterogeneous study areas. In our study, we assessed the usefulness of 2521 Sentinel-1 and 586 Sentinel-2 satellite images and topographic data for mapping grassland use intensity. We focused on the distinction between intensively and extensively managed permanent grassland in a large heterogeneous study area in Slovenia. We provided dense Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) for 2017, 2018 and 2019 to identify important differences, e.g., management practices, between the two grassland types analysed. We also investigated the effectiveness of combining two different remote-sensing products, the optical Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and radar coherence. Grassland types were distinguished using an object-based approach and the Random Forest classification. With the use of SITS only, the models achieved poor performance in the case of cloudy years (2018). However, the performance improved with additional features (environmental variables). The feature selection method based on Mean Decrease Accuracy (MDA) provided a deeper insight into the high-dimensional multisensory SITS. It helped select the most relevant features (acquisition dates, environmental variables) that distinguish between intensive and extensive grassland types. The addition of environmental variables improved the overall classification accuracy by 7-15%, while the feature selection additionally improved the final overall classification accuracy (using all available features) by 2-3%. Although the reference dataset was limited (1259 training samples), the final overall classification accuracy was above 88% in all years analysed. The results show that the proposed Random Forest classification using combined multisensor data and environmental variables can provide better and more stable information on grasslands than single optical or radar data SITS on large heterogeneous areas. Therefore, a combined approach is recommended to distinguish different grassland types.

TI  - Early detection and treatment of acute illness in medical patients with novel software: a prospective quality improvement initiative
T2  - BMJ OPEN QUALITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective An ageing population and rising healthcare costs place healthcare systems at risk of failure. Our goal was to develop a technology that would identify illness early, initiate action and therein improve patient care, outcomes and save healthcare resources. Design This was a prospective interventional quality improvement study. Setting A 40 bed medical floor in a 300 bed Canadian tertiary care regional referral hospital. Participants General ward patients randomly assigned to control or treatment groups. There was no cross-over or loss to follow-up. Intervention We designed an algorithm and software programme capable of detecting the sentinel change in a deteriorating patient's clinical condition and once detected direct early investigation and care. Study duration was 1 year. Main outcome measures Primary outcome was patient transfer from the general medical ward to the intensive care unit (ICU). The secondary outcome was the time needed to (1) order investigations (2) contact senior medical staff and (3) senior medical staff intervention. Results We identified a decrease in the transfer of patients from the medical ward to the ICU. Over the course of the study including 273 patients (110 in the control group and 163 in the treatment group), transfers dropped from 14 to 3 with a relative risk reduction of 85.54% (95% CI 84.96 to 86.1), a number needed to treat of 9.19 (95% CI 9.01 to 9.36) and a absolute risk reduction of 10.89% (95% CI 10.7 to 11.1). We also found a statistically significant reduction in the time required to order investigations (p=0.049), contact senior medical staff (p=0.040) and senior medical staff intervention (p=0.045). Conclusion A novel algorithm and software in the hands of nursing staff identified acute illness with adequate sensitivity and specificity to dramatically reduce ICU transfers and time to clinical intervention on a medical ward.

TI  - 100 global bright spots of green growth: Co-occurrence of nighttime light gain and forest gain, 1990-2015
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Economic growth commonly occurs at the expense of environmental quality, but there are exceptions. Here we use satellite data to identify places where exceptional economic growth and exceptional environmental improvement co-occurred between 1990 and 2015. We term as "bright spots of green growth" those spatial clusters with the most cells above the 95th percentile within their world region in both economic growth (as proxied by increase in nighttime lights) and one aspect of environmental improvement (forest area). Because the locations of bright spots are sensitive to methodological choices, we applied two different approaches to identifying bright spots. The two approaches differed in their choice of nighttime lights data (DSMP-OLS in Approach A vs. DSMP-VIIRS composite in Approach B); choice of forest area data (forest cover vs. forest land-use); time period (2000-2010 vs. 1990-2015); and clustering technique (visual inspection vs. HDBSCAN algorithm). We identified the top five bright spots in each of ten world regions using each of two approaches, for a total of 100 global bright spots of green growth. We then tested the extent to which the attributes of bright spots were consistent with four non-mutually exclusive theories of green growth. Of the bright spots we identified, around two-thirds (65% using Approach A; 71% using Approach B) had significantly higher-than-regional-average growth in the share of labor employed in services, consistent with sectoral shift and "tertiarization." Fewer than half (38%; 46%) had significantly higher growth in income, consistent with the "Environmental Kuznets Curve" theory. Some (54%; 29%) had significantly higher growth in timber plantation area, consistent with "ecoindustry"-driven rural development. Few (0%; 10%) had significantly higher growth in protected area coverage, consistent with public policy-induced forest conservation. Our findings suggest sectoral shift toward services, rather than rising income per se, may be a promising pathway for other regions seeking to combine economic growth and environmental improvement.

TI  - Historical prevalence of slavery predicts contemporary American gun ownership.
T2  - PNAS nexus
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - American gun-owners, uniquely, view firearms as a means of keeping themselves safe from dangers both physical and psychological. We root this belief in the experience of White Southerners during Reconstruction-a moment when a massive upsurge in the availability of firearms co-occurred with a worldview threat from the emancipation and the political empowerment of Black Southerners. We show that the belief-complex formed in this historical moment shapes contemporary gun culture: The prevalence of slavery in a Southern county (measured in 1860) predicts the frequency of firearms in the present day. This relationship holds above and beyond a number of potential covariates, including contemporary crime rates, police spending, degree of racial segregation and inequality, socioeconomic conditions, and voting patterns in the 2016 Presidential election; and is partially mediated by the frequency of people in the county reporting that they generally do not feel safe. This Southern origin of gun culture may help to explain why we find that worries about safety do not predict county-level gun ownership outside of historically slave-owning counties, and why we find that social connection to historically slaveholding counties predicts county-level gun ownership, even outside of the South.

AB  - By applying data processing techniques of earth observation which makes easier to study human-induced changes in forest cover along with the availability of highly refined and standardized data, such as image collections LandSat 5 ETM (Enhanced Thematic Mapper), Landsat 7 E7M+ (Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus) y Landsat 8 OH (Operational Land Imager)/TIRS (Thermal Infrared Sensor) different types of variables are considered; together with tools of Google Earth Engine, an approach is developed that makes the spatial analysis more efficient and allows to know the evolution of a geographical space of interest. For this case, it was searched through remote sensing, to provide elements of study that allowed to know the spatial evolution of the processes of transformation of the natural coverages of the Tinigua National Natural Park, finding that the first processes of change, between 1989 and 1996 were presented taking from the rivers named "Guayabero", "Guaduas" and "Rio Perdido" as ways of mobility; subsequently, between 1996 and 1998, years after the first peak of change in coverage, Colombia suffered from the harshness of the armed conflict, in that period it went from 117 hectares of forest transformed in 1996, to 2423 hectares of loss of that natural coverage in 1998, later, for 1999 this figure was drastically reduced.

TI  - The Determination of Priority Areas for the Restoration of Degraded Tropical Peatland Using Hydrological, Topographical, and Remote Sensing Approaches
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Degraded peatland is caused by forest clearing and the construction of artificial water networks. When water management is not implemented across land uses in the entire peatland landscape, then it will be a big issue that causes a water deficit and leads to increasing droughts and fires. Effective restoration must first identify the part of Peatland Hydrological system Units (PHUs) with insufficient water storage and resources. This study used intercorrelated factors of water balance, deficit months, NDMI-NDVI indices, dry periods, recurrent fires, peat depth, and water loss conditions, as the evaluation parameters, within individual sub-PHUs to determine the most degraded areas that require intervention and restoration. Sub-PHU was determined based on the peat hydrological unity concept by identifying streamline, outlet channels, peat-depth, slopes, and network connectivity. Global hydrological data using TerraClimate and CHIRPS, combined with field observations, were used to validate and calculate each sub-PHU's water balance and dry periods. Soil moisture (NDMI), vegetation density (NDVI), and fire frequency were extracted from multispectral satellite images (e.g., Landsat 8, MODIS-Terra, and MODIS-Aqua). Each parameter was ranked by the score for each sub-PHU. The parameters that can be ranked are only the ordinal type of number. The lowest ranks indicated the most degraded sub-PHUs requiring peat rewetting interventions.

TI  - Satellite Observation of the Long-Term Dynamics of Particulate Organic Carbon in the East China Sea Based on a Hybrid Algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The distribution pattern and flux variation of POC in the continental shelf seas are essential for understanding the carbon cycle in marginal seas. The hydrodynamic environment and complicated estuarine processes in the East China Sea result in challenging estimates and substantial spatio-temporal variability in terms of POC concentrations. A hybrid retrieval model based on the mutual combination of the color index algorithm (CIPOC) and the empirical band ratio algorithm was applied in this study to effectively and dynamically monitor the surface POC concentration in the East China Sea in a long-term series for the first time using MODIS/Aqua remote sensing satellite data from 2003 to 2020. A hybrid retrieval model based on the mutual combination of the color index algorithm (CIPOC) and the empirical band ratio algorithm was applied in this study. The MODIS/Aqua remote sensing satellite data from 2003 to 2020 were employed for the first time to dynamically monitor the surface POC concentrations in the East China Sea for a long time series. The results demonstrated that the performance (R-2 = 0.84, RMSE = 156.14 mg/m(3), MAPE = 43.30%, bias = -64.79 mg/m(3)) exhibited by this hybrid retrieval algorithm confirms the usability of inversion studies of surface POC in the East China Sea. Different drivers such as river discharge, phytoplankton, wind, and the sea surface current field jointly influence the spatial and temporal distribution of POC concentrations in the East China Sea. This paper also verifies that the hybrid algorithm can be applied to retrieval tasks for POC in different seas with similar optical properties to the waters of the East China Sea. In conclusion, the long-term series East China Sea POC data record, which was established based on MODIS/Aqua, provides supplementary information for in-situ sampling, which will aid the long-term monitoring of POC fluxes in shelf seas. At the same time, it has also improved our understanding of the transport and spatio-temporal variability of POC in the East China Sea, enhancing our comprehension of the impact of POC on environmental changes and carbon cycling in marginal seas.

TI  - Effect of a Heavy Rainstorm on the Surface Hydrodynamic Properties of a Sandy-Loam Soil
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in surface-soil hydrodynamic properties associated with torrential natural rainstorms are largely unknown. This investigation aimed at verifying if the surface hydrodynamic properties of a sandy-loam soil varied due to the heavy rainfall event (130 mm in nearly three hours) that occurred in the summer of 2020 at Palermo (Italy) and also to establish if soil recovery processes occurred soon after the event. The soil of an orchard was sampled immediately before the rainstorm and a few days and 1.5 months later. The rainstorm determined a moderate decrease (by 1.8 times) of the saturated soil hydraulic conductivity, K-s, and an increase of its relative variability. In the subsequent weeks, the lowest Ks values detected soon after rainfall tended to disappear but the soil remained moderately less conductive (by 1.4 times) than before rainfall. Wetting and subsequent drying did not influence the means of macroscopic capillary length, lambda(c), characteristic microscopic pore radius, lambda(m), and depth of the wetting front, dwf, but reduced relative variability of these parameters. Therefore, this investigation confirmed that K-s is a sentinel soil property. It also suggested that a torrential rainstorm can have no more than a moderate impact on the surface-soil hydrodynamic properties. Additional investigations are necessary to (1) verify if the canopy should have a key role on the stability of the soil properties in meteorologically critical conditions; (2) determine if a link between natural and soil-perturbing artificial events can be established to investigate the short-term dynamics of the surface soil properties more easily; and (3) test the hypothesis that the greater the disturbance the faster the onset of reorganization processes.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Modeling of Zoonotic Arbovirus Transmission in Northeastern Florida Using Sentinel Chicken Surveillance and Earth Observation Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The irregular timing and spatial variation in the zoonotic arbovirus spillover from vertebrate hosts to humans and livestock present challenges to predicting spillover occurrence over time and across broader geographic areas, compromising effective prevention and control strategies. The objective of this study was to quantify the effects of the landscape composition and configuration and dynamic weather events on the 2018 spatiotemporal distribution of eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) (Togaviridae, Alphavirus) and West Nile virus (WNV) (Flaviviridae, Flavivirus) sentinel chicken seroconversion in northeastern Florida. We used a modeling framework that explicitly accounts for joint spatial and temporal effects and incorporates key EO (Earth Observation) information on the climate and landscape in order to more accurately quantify the environmental effects on the transmission to sentinel chickens. We investigated the environmental effects using Bernoulli generalized linear mixed effects models (GLMMs), including a site-level random effect, and then added spatial random effects and spatiotemporal random effects in subsequent runs. The models were executed using an integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) and a stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) approach in R-INLA. The GLMMs that included a spatiotemporal random effect performed better relative to models that included only spatial random effects and also performed better than non-spatial models. The results indicated a strong spatiotemporal structure in the seroconversion for both viruses, but EEEV exhibited a more punctuated and compact structure at the beginning of the sampling season, while WNV exhibited a more gradual and diffuse structure across the study area toward the end of the sampling season. The percentage of cypress-tupelo wetland land cover within 3500 m of coop sites and the edge density of the forest land cover within 500 m had a strong positive effect on the EEEV seroconversion, while the best fitting model for WNV was the intercept-only model with spatiotemporal random effects. The lagged climatic variables included in our study did not have a strong effect on the seroconversion for either virus when accounting for temporal autocorrelation, demonstrating the utility of capturing this structure to avoid type I errors. The predictive accuracy for out-of-sample data for the EEEV seroconversion demonstrates the potential to develop a framework that incorporates temporal dynamics in order to better predict arbovirus transmission.

TI  - Evaluation of R Tools for Downloading MODIS Images and Their Use in Urban Growth Analysis of the City of Tarija (Bolivia)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the available tools in R for downloading and processing Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, specifically the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) product. The R tools evaluated were the MODIS package, RGISTools, MODISTools, R Google Earth Engine (RGEE) package, MODIStsp, and the Application for Extracting and Exploring Analysis Ready Samples (AppEEARS) application. Each tool was used to download the same product (EVI) corresponding to the same day (3 December 2015), and downloaded data were used to analyze the urban growth of Tarija (Bolivia) as an interesting application. The following features were analyzed: download time and memory used during the download, additional post-processing time, local memory occupied on the computer, and downloaded file formats. Results showed that the most efficient R tools were those that work directly in the "cloud" or use text queries (RGEE and AppEEARS, respectively) and provide, as a final product, a cropped.tif image according to the area of interest.

TI  - Sentinel Node Biopsy Imaging in Breast Cancer Scatter Reduction Using 3-Dimensionally Printed Lead Shields
T2  - CLINICAL NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Point of injection scatter (SPI) confounds breast cancer sentinel lymph node detection. Round flat lead shields (FLSs) incompletely reduce SPI, requiring repositioning. We designed lead shields that reduce SPI and acquisition time. Methods Two concave lead shields, a semioval lead shield (OLS) and a semispherical lead alloy shield (SLS), were created with a SICNOVA JCR 1000 3D printer to cover the point of injection (patent no. ES1219895U). Twenty breast cancer patients had anterior and anterior oblique imaging, 5 minutes and 2 hours after a single 111 MBq nanocolloid in 0.2 mL intratumoral or periareolar injection. Each acquisition was 2 minutes. Absolute and normalized background corrected scatter counts (CSCs) and scatter reduction percentage (%SR) related to the FLS were calculated. Repositionings were recorded. Differences between means of %SR (t test) and between means of CSC (analysis of variance) with Holm multiple comparison tests were determined. Results Mean %SR was 91.8% with OLS and 92% using SLS in early images (P = 0.91) and 87.2%SR in OLS and 88.5% in late images (P = 0.66). There were significant differences between CSC using FLS and OLS (P < 0.001) and between FLS and SLS (P < 0.001), but not between OLS and SLS (P = 0.17) in early images, with the same results observed in delayed studies (P < 0.001 in relation to FLS and P = 0.1 between both curved lead shields). Repositioning was required 14/20 times with FLS, 4/20 times with OLS, and 2/20 times with SLS. Conclusions We designed 2 concave lead shields that significantly reduce the SPI and repositioning with sentinel lymph node lymphoscintigraphy.

TI  - Strategies for Lynch syndrome identification in selected and unselected gynecological cancers
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER PREVENTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Endometrial carcinoma represents a sentinel cancer for Lynch syndrome (LS) identification. It is crucial to highlight how other types of tumors can arise in the gynecological tract acting as sentinel tumors in LS patients. Up to now, no established LS patient management strategy has incorporated the presence of these additional candidate sentinel tumors to improve the prevention and management of LS tumors. Methods In order to investigate the involvement of the most frequent gynecological cancers in gynecological cancers, we studied different subsets of gynecological cancers using both somatic approaches, including mismatch repair (MMR) gene immunohistochemical expression, microsatellite instability, and germline analyses ofMSH2, MSH6, MLH1, PMS2 and EPCAM genes. A total of 261 patients referring to the Cancer Genetic Counselling Service of our institution were included in the study. In detail, our series was composed of 131 patients affected by uterus cancers including endometrial, isthmus and non-HPV endocervical carcinomas, 113 patients affected by ovarian cancers and 17 patients affected by synchronous endometrial/ovarian carcinomas (SEOC). In addition, we studied 115 cases of endometrial cancers identified by 2 years of universal testing (endometrial cancers/UTs) using IHC analysis of four MMR proteins. Results and conclusions The incidence of MMR defective gynecological cancers ranged from 7.1 to 47.1% depending on cancer site and selection. LS patients carriers of pathogenetic MMR variants were identified in 19.8% of uterus cancers, 35.3% of SEOC, 4.4% of ovarian cancers. In addition, pathogenetic MMR variants were identified in 4.3% of endometrial cancers/universal testing investigated with universal screening. In conclusion, gynecological cancers are heavily involved in LS and our study shows that MMR screening using immunohistochemical pattern and MSI analysis of endometrial and ovarian cancers as well as of rare entities such as non-HPV related endocervical cancers and synchronous endometrial and ovarian cancers are sentinels for LS. Tumor testing approach improves early identification of MMR defective gynecological cancers and this is an effective strategy to detect high-risk patients and to offer them and their relatives personalized cancer prevention.

TI  - Machine-Learning Classification of SAR Remotely-Sensed Sea-Surface Petroleum Signatures-Part 1: Training and Testing Cross Validation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea-surface petroleum pollution is observed as "oil slicks" (i.e., "oil spills" or "oil seeps") and can be confused with "look-alike slicks" (i.e., environmental phenomena, such as low-wind speed, upwelling conditions, chlorophyll, etc.) in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) measurements, the most proficient satellite sensor to detect mineral oil on the sea surface. Even though machine learning (ML) has become widely used to classify remotely-sensed petroleum signatures, few papers have been published comparing various ML methods to distinguish spills from look-alikes. Our research fills this gap by comparing and evaluating six traditional techniques: simple (naive Bayes (NB), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), decision trees (DT)) and advanced (random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN)) applied to different combinations of satellite-retrieved attributes. 36 ML algorithms were used to discriminate "ocean-slick signatures" (spills versus look-alikes) with ten-times repeated random subsampling cross validation (70-30 train-test partition). Our results found that the best algorithm (ANN: 90%) was >20% more effective than the least accurate one (DT: similar to 68%). Our empirical ML observations contribute to both scientific ocean remote-sensing research and to oil and gas industry activities, in that: (i) most techniques were superior when morphological information and Meteorological and Oceanographic (MetOc) parameters were included together, and less accurate when these variables were used separately; (ii) the algorithms with the better performance used more variables (without feature selection), while lower accuracy algorithms were those that used fewer variables (with feature selection); (iii) we created algorithms more effective than those of benchmark-past studies that used linear discriminant analysis (LDA: similar to 85%) on the same dataset; and (iv) accurate algorithms can assist in finding new offshore fossil fuel discoveries (i.e., misclassification reduction).

TI  - Afforestation monitoring through automatic analysis of 36-years Landsat Best Available Composites
T2  - IFOREST-BIOGEOSCIENCES AND FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The study of afforestation is crucial to monitor land transformations and represents a central topic in sustainable development procedures, in terms of climate change, ecosystem services monitoring, and planning policies activities. Although surveying afforestation is important, the assessment of the growing forests is difficult, since land cover has different durations depending on the species. In this context, remote sensing can be a valid instrument to evaluate the afforestation process. Nevertheless, while a vast literature on forest disturbance exists, only a few studies focus on afforestation and almost none directly exploits remote sensing data. This study aims to automatically classify non-forest, afforestation, and forest areas using remote sensing data. To this purpose, we constructed a reference dataset of 61 polygons that suffered a change from non-forest to forest in the period 1988-2020. The reference data were constructed with the Land Use Inventory of Italy and through photo-interpretation of orthophotos (1988-2012, spatial resolution 50 x 50 cm) and very high- resolution images (2012-2020, spatial resolution 30 x 30 cm). Using Landsat Best Available Pixel composites time-series (1984-2020) we calculated 52 temporal predictors: four temporal metrics (median, standard deviation, Pearson's correlation coefficient R, and slope) calculated for 13 different bands (the six Landsat spectral bands, three Spectral Vegetation Indices, and four Tasseled Cap Indices). To verify the possibility of distinguishing afforestation from non-forest and forest, given the differences between them can be minimal, we tested four different models aiming at classifying the following categories: (i) non-forest/afforestation, (ii) afforestation/forest, (iii) non-forest/ forest and (iv) non-forest/afforestation/forest. Temporal predictors were used with random forest which was calibrated using random search, validated using k-fold Cross-Validation Overall Accuracy (OAcv), and further using out-of-bag independent data (OAoob). Results illustrate that the distinction of afforestation/forest reaches the largest OAcv (87%), followed by non-forest/forest (83%), non-forest/afforestation (75%) and non-forest/afforestation/forest (72%). The different OA values confirm that the difference in photosynthetic activity between forest and afforestation can be analysed through remote sensing to distinguish them. Although remote sensing data are currently not exploited to monitor afforestation areas our results suggest it may be a valid support for country-level monitoring and reporting.

TI  - Examination of the Change in the Vegetation Around the Kirka Boron Mine Site by Using Remote Sensing Techniques
T2  - WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Within the scope of the study, the change occurring in the vegetation cover was examined in different temporal and spatial scales for in the example of Kirka boron mining site. Two different satellite images, namely Landsat and Sentinel, were utilized while the competence of these two satellite images were analyzed. Unsupervised classification and vegetation indexes have been used from remote sensing techniques. It was observed that the mining area boundary could not be determined using vegetation indexes, whereas unsupervised classification techniques showed that the miningral site occupies 1144.5 ha area. NDVI and NDRe analyses were conducted to determine the vegetation change outside the mining area. It has been determined that the analyses performed with the NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) and NDRe (normalized difference red edge index) indexes show different results on water surfaces, while they show similar results in rest of the areas. In NDVI analysis, it has been determined that the two satellite images gave similar results in NDVI analyses, while having higher spatial resolution, sentinel satellite images were able to capture more details.

TI  - ECDSA-Based Water Bodies Prediction from Satellite Images with UNet
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The detection of water bodies from satellite images plays a vital role in research development. It has a wide range of applications such as the prediction of natural disasters and detecting drought and flood conditions. There were few existing applications that focused on detecting water bodies that are becoming extinct in nature. The dataset to train this deep learning model is taken from Kaggle. It has two classes, namely water bodies and masks. There is a total of 2841 sentinel-2 satellite images with corresponding 2841 masks. Additionally, the present work focuses on using UNet, Tensorflow to detect the water bodies. It uses a Nadam optimizer to reduce the losses. It also finds best-optimized parameters for the activation function, a number of nodes in each layer. This proposed model achieves integrity by embedding a security feature Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). It generates a digital signature for the predicted area of water bodies which helps to secure the key and the detected water bodies while transmitting in a channel. Thus, the proposed model ensures the performance accuracy of 94% which can also work the same for edge detection, detection in blurred and low-resolution images. The model is highly robust.

M3  - Article
AB  - Indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescent imaging has been used in colorectal surgery to assess intraoperative blood flow to the colon. However, its use has expanded to allow imaging of the lymphatic drainage within the mesentery in cancer resections. This technique can been used for real-time visualization of lymph nodes, and the detection of sentinel lymph nodes, lateral sidewall nodes, metastatic lymph nodes, and peritoneal metastases. Ultimately, this provides a more informative map of the mesentery displaying lymphatics and blood flow. The technique is economical and easy to use by the surgeon intraoperatively. ICG lymphangiography has the potential to aid the surgeon to ensure complete lymphadenectomy is performed in cancer resections.

T2  - DIXIT
M3  - Article
AB  - EAMI, the fourth feature film by Paz Encina, introduces an ethical interest in the construction of a memory already present in Encina's previous films, but here it assumes a cosmopolitics that redefines the relationships between humans and the more than human. In its ways of accounting for the extractivist advance, the territorial dispossession and the extermination of the Ayoreo world, EAMI problematizes the dichotomy between fiction and documentary not only because the testimonies and recreations that it stages speak the language of that community, but also because they follow their worldview, their understanding of time and space. Based on recent studies on new materialisms and affect, reflections on Amerindian ontologies and visual anthropology, this essay aims to discuss the ways in which this documentary rearticulates the order of the sensible to delimit the order of what matters. If the decapitation of the forest is also the destruction of their common forms of understanding, EAMI's act of memory seeks to create a sensory atmosphere and a temporality that makes it possible to broaden the audience for this loss. Inscribed in its formal language, the film assumes the denunciation of the Ayoreo and tries to subdue our (in)sensitivity of conone (the term with which that community refers to all outsiders as "the insensitive") to make us participate in the suffering of another people.

TI  - Extraction of Water Body Information from Remote Sensing Imagery While Considering Greenness and Wetness Based on Tasseled Cap Transformation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water, as an important part of ecosystems, is also an important topic in the field of remote sensing. Shadows and dense vegetation negatively affect most traditional methods used to extract water body information from remotely sensed images. As a result, extracting water body information with high precision from a wide range of remote sensing images which contain complex ground-based objects has proved difficult. In the present study, a method used for extracting water body information from remote sensing imagery considers the greenness and wetness of ground-based objects. Ground objects with varied water content and vegetation coverage have different characteristics in their greenness and wetness components obtained by the Tasseled Cap transformation (TCT). Multispectral information can be output as brightness, greenness, and wetness by Tasseled Cap transformation, which is widely used in satellite remote sensing images. Hence, a model used to extract water body information was constructed to weaken the influence of shadows and dense vegetation. Jiangsu and Anhui provinces are located along the Yangtze River, China, and were selected as the research area. The experiment used the wide-field-of-view (WFV) sensor onboard the Gaofen-1 satellite to acquire remotely sensed photos. The results showed that the contours and spatial extent of the water bodies extracted by the proposed method are highly consistent, and the influence of shadow and buildings is minimized; the method has a high Kappa coefficient (0.89), overall accuracy (92.72%), and user accuracy (88.04%). Thus, the method is useful in updating a geographical database of water bodies and in water resource management.

TI  - Phytoplankton Blooms Expanding Further Than Previously Thought in the Ross Sea: A Remote Sensing Perspective
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and robust measurements from ocean color satellites are critical to studying spatial and temporal changes of surface ocean properties. Satellite-derived Chlorophyll-a (Chl) is an important parameter to monitor phytoplankton blooms on synoptical scales, particularly in remote seas. However, the present NASA standard Chl algorithm tends to strongly underestimate the Chl in the Ross Sea. Based on a locally-tuned Chl algorithm in the Ross Sea and using the data record from MODIS between 2002 and 2020, here we investigated the spatial expansion of phytoplankton blooms in the Ross Sea. Our results show the geometric areas of the phytoplankton blooms could reach (7.20 +/- 2.8) x 10(4) km(2) on average, which was similar to 3.1 times that of those identified using the NASA default Chl algorithm. Spatially, blooms were frequently identified on the shelf of the Ross Sea polynya with a typical chance of >= 80%. In the context of climate change and global warming, the general decrease and interannual dynamics of sea ice cover tends to affect solar light penetration and surface seawater temperature, which were found to regulate the spatial expansion of the phytoplankton blooms over the years. Statistical analyses showed that the spatial coverages of the phytoplankton blooms were significantly correlated with sea surface temperature (Spearman correlation coefficient R = 0.55, at p < 0.05), sea surface wind speed (R = 0.42, at p < 0.05), and sea ice concentration (R = -0.84, at p < 0.05), yet without significant long-term (>10 years) trends over the study period. The stronger phytoplankton blooms than those previously observed may indicate larger carbon sequestration, which needs to be investigated in the future. More valid satellite observations under cloud covers will further constrain the estimates.

TI  - New Archaeological Discoveries Based on Spatial Information Technology and Cultural Analysis: Taking the Study of the Spatial Relationship between Ancient Chinese Capitals and the Natural Environment as an Example
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - How to combine science and technology with the humanities in the research on ancient cities to reveal ancient peoples' urban planning thoughts is worthy of in-depth study. The capitals of the Western Han dynasty as well as the Sui and Tang dynasties were some of the greatest cities in the world at the time. This paper takes them as its subjects and puts forward a method to study the spatial relationship between ancient cities and the natural environment by combining spatial information technology and cultural analysis. Firstly, satellite images, elevation maps, urban ichnographies, and literature materials were collected and sorted to deeply understand the cultural thoughts involved in ancient urban planning; based on this, key element points were marked and rechecked on the spot, and the above drawings were accurately superimposed by GIS technology to form a geographic information base that integrated multisource information. Then, Python was used to construct a "decision model of spatial relationship between urban elements and natural elements", and rules as well as parameters were set through man-machine collaboration. The decision model was used to test the geographic information base, and the information of strong correlations between urban objects and natural objects was outputted. The drawings were exported after screening, and a visual expression was realized with Illustrator software. The research results indicated that this analysis method was feasible, effective, and easy to promote. The new archaeological discoveries included eight important line segments with a 9:6 proportional relationship (which represents the balance of Yin and Yang) and two important line segments with a 9:5 proportional relationship (which represents the supreme imperial power) in the capitals of the Western Han dynasty as well as the Sui and Tang dynasties, and 16 contraposition lines in a positive direction or oblique 45 degrees direction (which reflects the close relationship between urban elements and natural elements). We consider that the two capitals were intentionally closely related to natural environments such as mountain peaks and valley entrances in the planning stage, and that proportions and scales with profound humanistic meaning were selected. The capital of the Sui and Tang dynasties was specially aligned with the capital of the Western Han dynasty in space. These characteristics embody ancient Chinese Confucian cultural thoughts such as the "integration of yang and yin", "harmony between nature and humans", the "supremacy of emperors", and the "use of numbers and shapes to convey meaning".

TI  - Distribution and Attribution of Earlier Start of the Growing Season over the Northern Hemisphere from 2001-2018
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The start of the growing season (SOS) is a vital ecological indicator for climate change and the terrestrial ecosystem. Previous studies have reported that the SOS over the Northern Hemisphere (NH) has experienced remarkable changes in the past few decades. However, because of the different spatial and temporal coverages of existing SOS studies, a coherent and robust account for SOS changes in the NH has been lacking. Using satellite-retrieved vegetation-phenology datasets, ground observations, and several auxiliary datasets, this study evaluated the performance of the latest MODIS vegetation-dynamics dataset (MCD12Q2-C6) and explored the distribution and attribution of the SOS to climate change over the NH for the period 2001-2018. The validation results using the Chinese Ecosystem Research Network (CERN) and Lilac-leafing observations (Lilac) displayed that the MCD12Q2-C6 has a good performance in SOS monitoring over the NH mid-latitudes. Meanwhile, evidence from MCD12Q2-C6 pointed out that the SOS was advanced by 2.08 days on average over the NH during 2001-2018, especially for Europe, China, and Alaska, United States. In addition, detailed-sensitivity analysis showed that the increased surface air temperature (T-s) (-1.21 +/- 0.34 days degrees C-1) and reduced snow-cover fraction (S-c) (0.62 +/- 0.29 days%(-1)) were the key driving factors of the observed SOS changes over the NH during 2001-2018. Compared with T-s and S-c, the role of total precipitation (P-t) was minor in dominating the spring vegetation-phenology changes at the same period. The findings of this study contribute to our understanding of the responses of SOS to the competing changes of T-s, P-t, and S-c over the NH.

TI  - Remote-Sensing Monitoring of Postfire Vegetation Dynamics in the Greater Hinggan Mountain Range Based on Long Time-Series Data: Analysis of the Effects of Six Topographic and Climatic Factors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The frequency of forest fires is increasing under global climate change, and forest fires can cause devastating disturbances to forest systems and varying degrees of recovery of forest ecosystems after a disaster. Due to the different intensity of forest fires and forest systems, and in particular the fact that forest ecological recovery is influenced by many topographical and climatic factors, the process of postfire vegetation recovery is unclear and must be studied in depth. In this study, the Greater Hinggan Mountain Range was taken as the study area. Based on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat time-series images acquired from 2000 to 2018, this study used the spatiotemporal data fusion method to construct reflectance images of vegetation with a relatively consistent growth period to study the vegetation restoration after forest fires. The vegetation restoration was characterized by disturbance index (DI) values, which eliminated phenological influence. Six types of topography and climatic factors (elevation, aspect, slope; temperature, precipitation, and wind speed) were coupled with DI. Through single-factor analysis of variance and multiple comparison statistical methods, it was found that there was a significant relationship between the six factors and DI, which indicated those factors had a significant impact on the restoration of forest vegetation in burned areas. The results will be useful as a reference for future monitoring and management of forest resources.

TI  - Observational Analysis of the Formation Reasons and Evolution Law of Winter Counter-Wind Current in Jiazi Sea Area of Northeastern South China Sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the observational data of wind, current, and sea surface temperature in the Jiazi sea area of the northeastern South China Sea in 2018 and the satellite remote sensing data of sea surface temperature in the northern South China Sea, this paper explores the formation reasons and evolution law of winter counter-wind currents in the Jiazi sea area of the northeastern South China Sea. The results show that: (1) The counter-wind current in the Jiazi sea occurs only in certain time periods instead of the entire winter; (2) When the eastern component of wind stress weakens, the eastern component of seafloor friction also weakens to some extent. A high-frequency northeast current often occurs in the bottom layer of the sea area, indicating that the formation of winter counter-wind current in the Jiazi sea area is a result of the concerted action of wind stress, the baroclinic effect, and geostrophic effect; (3) When the counter-wind current is formed, there is a low temperature water mass in the northwest of Jiazi and a high-temperature water mass in the southeast. The baroclinic effect causes the sea water to flow to the shore and produce a westward flow on the shore, and northeastward counter-wind current occurs on convergent sea water on the shore due to the baroclinic effect and geostrophic effect (Ekman effect). Therefore, two different current systems are formed in the northeastern South China Sea in winter with 116 degrees E as the boundary. The appearance of cold water masses in the northwest of 116 degrees E sea area and warm water masses in the southeast of the South China Sea is the key to the formation of both the two different current systems with 116 degrees E as the boundary and the winter counter-wind flow; (4) The formation and disappearance of the counter-wind current can be divided into four stages: in the first stage, the northeast monsoon gradually relaxes to become the southeast wind, forming the northwest current; in the second stage, the warm water masses on the west side of the Luzon Strait flow to the coastal waters due to the northwest current, forming a significant onshore pressure gradient force; in the third stage, a high-temperature seawater convergence zone is formed in the Jiazi sea area, forming southwest and northeast pressure gradient forces, and the northwest coastal current forms a counter-wind current under the combined action of pressure gradient force and geostrophic effect; in the fourth stage, the northeast monsoon intensifies and the counter-wind current weakens gradually until it disappears, and the sea water flows to the southwest again.

TI  - Himawari-8/AHI Aerosol Optical Depth Detection Based on Machine Learning Algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the advantage of geostationary satellites, Himawari-8/AHI can provide near-real-time air quality monitoring over China with a high temporal resolution. Satellite-based aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieval over land is a challenge because of the large surface contribution to the top of atmosphere (TOA) signal and the uncertainty of aerosol modes. Here, by combining satellite TOA reflectance, sun-sensor geometries, meteorological factors and vegetation information, we propose a data-driven AOD detection algorithm based on a deep neural network (DNN) model for Himawari-8/AHI. It is trained by sample data of 2018 and 2019 and is applied to derive hourly AODs over China in 2020. By comparison with ground-based AERONET measurements, R-2 for DNN-estimated AOD is up to 0.8702, which is much higher than that for the AHI AOD product with R-2 = 0.4869. The hourly AOD results indicate that the DNN model has a good potential in improving the performance of AOD retrieval in the early morning and in the late afternoon, and the spatial distribution is reliable for capturing the variation of aerosol pollution on the regional scale. By analyzing different DNN modeling strategies, it is found that seasonal modeling can hardly increase the accuracy of AOD retrieval to a certain extent, and R-2 increases from 0.7394 to 0.8168 when meteorological features, especially air pressure, are involved in the model training.

TI  - Prediction of Potential Geothermal Disaster Areas along the Yunnan-Tibet Railway Project
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As China's railways continue to expand into the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the number of deep-buried long tunnels is increasing. Tunnel-damaging geothermal disasters have become a common problem in underground engineering. Predicting the potential geothermal disaster areas along the Yunnan-Tibet railway project is conducive to its planning and construction and the realization of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)-specifically, the industry, innovation and infrastructure goal (SDG 9). In this paper, the Yunnan-Tibet railway project was the study area. Landsat-8 images and other spatial data were used to investigate causes and distributions of geothermal disasters. A collinearity diagnosis of environmental variables was carried out. Twelve environmental variables, such as land surface temperature, were selected to predict potential geothermal disaster areas using four niche models (MaxEnt, Bioclim, Domain and GARP). The prediction results were divided into four levels and had different characteristics. Among them, the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and kappa values of the MaxEnt model were the highest, at 0.84 and 0.63, respectively. Its prediction accuracy was the highest and the algorithm results are more suitable for the prediction of geothermal disasters. The prediction results show that the geothermal disaster potential is greatest in the Markam-Deqen, Zuogong-Zayu and Baxoi-Zayu regions. Through jack-knife analysis, it was found that the land surface temperature, active faults, water system distribution and Moho depth are the key environmental predictors of potential geothermal disaster areas. The research results provide a reference for the design and construction of the Yunnan-Tibet railway project and associated sustainable development.

TI  - STF-EGFA: A Remote Sensing Spatiotemporal Fusion Network with Edge-Guided Feature Attention
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal fusion in remote sensing plays an important role in Earth science applications by using information complementarity between different remote sensing data to improve image performance. However, several problems still exist, such as edge contour blurring and uneven pixels between the predicted image and the real ground image, in the extraction of salient features by convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We propose a spatiotemporal fusion method with edge-guided feature attention based on remote sensing, called STF-EGFA. First, an edge extraction module is used to maintain edge details, which effectively solves the boundary blurring problem. Second, a feature fusion attention module is used to make adaptive adjustments to the extracted features. Among them, the spatial attention mechanism is used to solve the problem of weight variation in different channels of the network. Additionally, the problem of uneven pixel distribution is addressed with a pixel attention (PA) mechanism to highlight the salient features. We transmit the different features extracted by the edge module and the encoder to the feature attention (FA) module at the same time after the union. Furthermore, the weights of edges, pixels, channels and other features are adaptively learned. Finally, three remote sensing spatiotemporal fusion datasets, Ar Horqin Banner (AHB), Daxing and Tianjin, are used to verify the method. Experiments proved that the proposed method outperformed three typical comparison methods in terms of the overall visual effect and five objective evaluation indexes: spectral angle mapper (SAM), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), spatial correlation coefficient (SCC), structural similarity (SSIM) and root mean square error (RMSE). Thus, the proposed spatiotemporal fusion algorithm is feasible for remote sensing analysis.

TI  - STUDY ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES AND BREEDING SITESOF LARUS RELICTUS IN HONGJIANNAO LAKE.
T2  - Disiji Yanjiu
M3  - Article
AB  - Hongjiannao Lake (38[degree]59'59'' 39[degree] 10'01''N, 109[degree]45'16'' [approximately] 109[degree] 59'58''E) is located at the main route of migrant birds in China and is the main spot for resting and reproduction of many types of rare waterfowl, such as Larus relictus, at the junction of Shenmu City, Shaanxi Province and Ordos City, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. In this study, in order to further improve the protection of Larus relictus, using the Modified Normalized Differential Water Index(MNDWI), 20 Landsat remote sensing images during the breeding period between 1987 and 2006 were used to extract Hongjiannao Lake island area and water area. Secondly, in 2015, 2016, and 2020, we came to Shenmu City, Shaanxi Province Nature Reserve for field research and data collection, and we sampled the water quality and benthic animals in the lake center and lakeside, which the water quality monitoring indicators is including pH, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, permanganate index, total alkalinity, salinity, etc. This research analyzes the changes of the ecological environment of Hongjiannao Lake, breeding conditions, and the change of Larus relictus breeding sites in the past 30 years, and explores why Larus relictus choose Hongjiannao Lake as a breeding site since 2001. The results show that: (1) Since the 1980s, with the shrinkage of water surface area, the pH, salinity, total nitrogen and total phosphorus of Hongjiannao Lake have increased, continuously salinized and eutrophicated. The fish in the lake disappeared after 2003 and improved slightly with the increase of water surface area after 2016; (2) Since 2001, Larus relictus has taken Hongjiannao Lake as a new breeding ground, which is closely related to the sharp decline and gradual disappearance of fish production in Hongjiannao Lake, which has liberated the Larus relictus food such as Ischnura heterosticta larvae and Chironomidae larvae from the grazing pressure; (3) Hongjiannao Lake is located in the distribution area of Larus relictus in Ordos. The parent birds of Larus relictus first moved out and scattered in the distribution area of Larus relictus in late July, which is qualified for the discovery of Hongjiannao Lake; (4) Since 2001, Hongjiannao Lake has had the conditions for the reproduction and survival of Larus relictus, which can provide suitable lake-center island and main food source for the whole breeding season, so it has been selected as a breeding site. These studies can better explain the reasons why Larus relictus inhabits in desert saline-alkaline lakes, which can provide technical support for its habitat management, and are of great significance to further protect Larus relictus.

TI  - RADAR-Vegetation Structural Perpendicular Index (R-VSPI) for the Quantification of Wildfire Impact and Post-Fire Vegetation Recovery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The precise information on fuel characteristics is essential for wildfire modelling and management. Satellite remote sensing can provide accurate and timely measurements of fuel characteristics. However, current estimates of fuel load changes from optical remote sensing are obstructed by seasonal cloud cover that limits their continuous assessments. This study utilises remotely sensed Synthetic-Aperture Radar (SAR) (Sentinel-1 backscatter) data as an alternative to optical-based imaging (Sentinel-2 scaled surface reflectance). SAR can penetrate clouds and offers high-spatial and medium-temporal resolution datasets and can hence complement the optical dataset. Inspired by the optical-based Vegetation Structural Perpendicular Index (VSPI), an SAR-based index termed RADAR-VSPI (R-VSPI) is introduced in this study. R-VSPI characterises the spatio-temporal changes in fuel load due to wildfire and the subsequent vegetation recovery thereof. The R-VSPI utilises SAR backscatter (sigma degrees) from the co-polarized (VV) and cross-polarized (VH) channels at a centre frequency of 5.4 GHz. The newly developed index is applied over major wildfire events that occurred during the "Black Summer" wildfire season (2019-2020) in southern Australia. The condition of the fuel load was mapped every 5 (any orbit) to 12 (same orbit) days at an aggregated spatial resolution of 110 m. The results show that R-VSPI was able to quantify fuel depletion by wildfire (relative to healthy vegetation) and monitor its subsequent post-fire recovery. The information on fuel condition and heterogeneity improved at high-resolution by adapting the VSPI on a dual-polarization SAR dataset (R-VSPI) compared to the historic forest fuel characterisation methods (that used visible and infrared bands only for fuel estimations). The R-VSPI thus provides a complementary source of information on fuel load changes in a forest landscape compared to the optical-based VSPI, in particular when optical observations are not available due to cloud cover.

TI  - Assessment of CALIOP-Derived CCN Concentrations by In Situ Surface Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The satellite-based cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) proxies used to quantify the aerosol-cloud interactions (ACIs) are column integrated and do not guarantee the vertical co-location of aerosols and clouds. This has encouraged the use of height-resolved measurements of spaceborne lidars for ACI studies and led to advancements in lidar-based CCN retrieval algorithms. In this study, we present a comparison between the number concentration of CCN (n(CCN)) derived from ground-based in situ and spaceborne lidar cloud-aerosol lidar with orthogonal polarization (CALIOP) measurements. On analysing their monthly time series, we found that about 88% of CALIOP n(CCN) estimates remained within a factor of 1.5 of the in situ measurements. Overall, the CALIOP estimates of monthly n(CCN) were in good agreement with the in situ measurements with a normalized mean error of 71%, normalized mean bias of 39% and correlation coefficient of 0.68. Based on our comparison results, we point out the necessary measures that should be considered for global n(CCN) retrieval. Our results show the competence of CALIOP in compiling a global height- and type-resolved n(CCN) dataset for use in ACI studies.

AB  - The NW-SE trending Son-Mahanadi basin is one of the largest intra-cratonic Gondwana rift basins of Peninsular India covering an area of approximately 48,000 sq. km. Here we employed a combined analysis of gravity and magnetic (GM) and remote sensing (RS) techniques to delineate the subsurface structures to tracing the tectonic evolution of the Son-Mahanadi basin. Landsat remote sensing data, ground gravity, and EMAG2 magnetic data were used to understand the surface and subsurface structures. The Bouguer gravity anomaly map of the region shows short wavelength gravity lows and highs due to depressions and upwarps in the basement. Interestingly, short wavelength gravity anomalies are superposed on a long wavelength regional gravity low centered over the basin. The regional gravity low bears an inverse correlation with the regional topography suggesting that the excess topographic load is compensated at depth and the required buoyancy might be due to thinning of the lithosphere as a consequence of Deccan volcanism. The ENE-WSW structural grain inferred from remote sensing data coincides with the trend of dyke swarms and the WNW-ESE trend possibly corresponds to the rift boundary faults in the south. The lineament trends show preferred spatial distribution in three sub-basins (Son, Hasdo-Arand, and Mahanadi), each separated by basement ridges. Integration of remote sensing, geological, and potential field data suggests reactivation of ENE-WSW trending structural lineaments which are associated with the dyke emplacement during Deccan volcanism. Thus, the Son-Mahanadi Gondwana basin witnessed a post-rift tectonic event associated with the Deccan volcanism.

TI  - Fine structure analysis of urban heat island of a central city in low-latitude plateau of China
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution automatic weather station data and remote sensing data were used to analyze the canopy urban heat island (UHI) effect in Kunming, a central city on a low-latitude plateau in China, and its relationship with land cover types, anthropogenic heat, and meteorological conditions. Results showed that the UHI intensity exponentially decreased with the distance from downtown regions. Furthermore, a forward stepwise regression algorithm was used to assess the contribution of spatial factors (e.g., land cover types and population density) and temporal factors (e.g., meteorological factors) to UHI changes. The contributions of spatial factors to the patterns of nighttime (daytime) UHI intensity reached 61.5% (32.6%). By contrast, the contributions of temporal factors to the temporal changes of nighttime (daytime) UHI varied considerably throughout the seasons, characterized by a maximum in autumn 79.70% (28.00%) and a minimum in spring 57.90% (12.00%). The temporal and spatial factors jointly determined the spatiotemporal patterns of the UHI effects. The temporal variation of spatial factors likewise affected the temporal variation of UHI intensity, whereas temporal factors did not change the spatial distribution of UHI intensity but aggravated its heterogeneity.

TI  - Empirical correction of systematic orthorectification error in Sentinel-2 velocity fields for Greenlandic outlet glaciers
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - By utilising imagery from overlapping orbits, the Sentinel-2 programme offers high-frequency observations of high-latitude environments well in excess of its 5 d repeat rate, which is valuable for obtaining large-scale records of rapid environmental change. However, the production of glacier velocity datasets from optical feature tracking of Sentinel-2 imagery is limited by the orthorectification error in ESA products, which introduces significant systematic errors (on the order of tens of metres) into displacement fields produced from cross-track image pairs. As a result, most standard processing chains ignore cross-track pairs, which limits the opportunity to fully benefit from Sentinel-2's high-frequency observations during periods of intermittent coverage or for rapid dynamic events. Here, we use temporally complete glacier velocity datasets to empirically reconstruct systematic error, allowing for the corrected velocity datasets to be produced for four key fast-flowing marine-terminating outlets across the Greenland Ice Sheet between 2017-2021. We show that corrected data agree well with comparison velocity datasets derived from optical (Landsat 8) and synthetic aperture radar (Sentinel-1) data. The density of available velocity pairs produces a noisier dataset than for these comparative records, but a best-fit velocity reconstructed by time-series modelling can identify periods of rapid change (e.g. summer slowdowns), even where gaps exist in other datasets. We use the empirical error maps to identify that the commercial DEM used to orthorectify Sentinel-2 scenes over Greenland between 2017-2021 likely shares data sources with freely available public DEMs, opening avenues for the analytical correction of Sentinel-2 glacier velocity fields in the future.

TI  - Assessing Climate Influence on Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Macrophytes in Eutrophicated Reservoirs by Remotely Sensed Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The overgrowth of macrophytes is a recurrent problem within reservoirs of urbanized and industrialized areas, a condition triggered by the damming of rivers and other human activities. Although the occurrence of aquatic plants in waterbodies has been widely monitored using remote sensing, the influence of climate variables on macrophyte spatiotemporal dynamics is rarely considered in studies developed for medium scales to long periods of time. We hypothesize that the spatial dispersion of macrophytes has its natural rhythms influenced by climate fluctuations, and, as such, its effects on the heterogeneous spatial distribution of this vegetation should be considered in the monitoring of water bodies. A eutrophic reservoir is selected for study, which uses the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as a proxy for macrophytes. Landsat's NDVI long-term time series are constructed and matched with the Climate Variable (CV) from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to assess the spatiotemporal dynamics of aquatic plants and their associated climate triggers. The NDVI and CV time series and their seasonal and trend components are correlated for the entire reservoir, compartments, and segmented areas of the water body. Granger-causality of these climate variables show that they contribute to describe and predict the spatial dispersion of macrophytes.

TI  - Wind-Wave Attenuation in Arctic Sea Ice: A Discussion of Remote Sensing Capabilities
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wind-generated waves strongly interact with sea ice and impact air-sea exchanges, operations at sea, and marine life. Unfortunately, the dissipation of wave energy is not well quantified and its possible effect on upper ocean mixing and ice drift is still mysterious. As the Arctic is opening up and wave energy increases, the limited amount of in situ observations is a clear limitation to our scientific understanding. Both radar and optical remote sensing has revealed the frequent presence of waves in ice, and could be used more systematically to investigate wave-ice interactions. Here we show that, in cloud-free conditions, Sentinel-2 images exhibit brightness modulations in ice-covered water, consistent with the presence of waves measured a few hours later by the ICESat-2 laser altimeter. We show that a full-focus SAR processing of Sentinel-3 radar altimeter data also reveals the presence and wavelengths of waves in sea ice, within minutes of Sentinel-2 imagery. The SWIM instrument on CFOSAT is another source of quantitative evidence for the direction and wavelengths of waves in ice, when ice conditions are spatially homogeneous. In the presence of sea ice, a quantitative wave height measurement method is not yet available for all-weather near-nadir radar instruments such as altimeters and SWIM. However, their systematic colocation with optical instruments on Sentinel-2 and ICESat-2, which are less frequently able to observe waves in sea ice, may provide the empirical transfer functions needed to interpret and calibrate the radar data, greatly expanding the available data on wave-ice interactions.

TI  - A Novel Approach for Automatic Urban Surface Water Mapping with Land Surface Temperature (AUSWM)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The principal difficulty in extracting urban surface water using remote-sensing techniques is the influence of noise from complex urban environments. Although various methods exist, there are still many sources of noise interference when extracting urban surface water, and automatic cartographic methods with long time series are especially scarce. Here, we construct an automatic urban surface water extraction method from the combination of traditional water index, urban shadow index (USI), and land surface temperature (LST) by using the Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform and Landsat imagery. The three principal findings derived from the application of the method were as follows. (i) In comparison with autumn and winter, LST in spring and summer could better distinguish water from high-reflection ground objects, shadows, and roads and roofs covered by asphalt. (ii) The overall accuracy of Automated Water Extraction Index (AWEIsh) in Zhengzhou was 77.5% and the Kappa coefficient was 0.55; with consideration of the USI and LST, the overall accuracy increased to 96.0% and the Kappa coefficient increased to 0.92. (iii) During 1990-2020, the area of urban surface water in Zhengzhou increased, with an evident trend in expansion from 11.51 km(2) in 2008 to 49.28 km(2) in 2020. Additionally, possible omissions attributable to using 30m-resolution imagery to extract urban water areas were also discussed. The method proposed in this study was proven effective in eliminating the influence of noise in urban areas, and it could be used as a general method for high-accuracy long-term mapping of urban surface water.

TI  - Live Fuel Moisture Content Mapping in the Mediterranean Basin Using Random Forests and Combining MODIS Spectral and Thermal Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed vegetation indices have been widely used to estimate live fuel moisture content (LFMC). However, marked differences in vegetation structure affect the relationship between field-measured LFMC and reflectance, which limits spatial extrapolation of these indices. To overcome this limitation, we explored the potential of random forests (RF) to estimate LFMC at the subcontinental scale in the Mediterranean basin wildland. We built RF models (LFMCRF) using a combination of MODIS spectral bands, vegetation indices, surface temperature, and the day of year as predictors. We used the Globe-LFMC and the Catalan LFMC monitoring program databases as ground-truth samples (10,374 samples). LFMCRF was calibrated with samples collected between 2000 and 2014 and validated with samples from 2015 to 2019, with overall root mean square errors (RMSE) of 19.9% and 16.4%, respectively, which were lower than current approaches based on radiative transfer models (RMSE similar to 74-78%). We used our approach to generate a public database with weekly LFMC maps across the Mediterranean basin.

TI  - Facility-based disease surveillance and Bayesian hierarchical modeling to estimate endemic typhoid fever incidence, Kilimanjaro Region, Tanzania, 2007-2018
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Growing evidence suggests considerable variation in endemic typhoid fever incidence at some locations over time, yet few settings have multi-year incidence estimates to inform typhoid control measures. We sought to describe a decade of typhoid fever incidence in the Kilimanjaro Region of Tanzania. Cases of blood culture confirmed typhoid were identified among febrile patients at two sentinel hospitals during three study periods: 2007-08, 201114, and 2016-18. To account for under-ascertainment at sentinel facilities, we derived adjustment multipliers from healthcare utilization surveys done in the hospital catchment area. Incidence estimates and credible intervals (CrI) were derived using a Bayesian hierarchical incidence model that incorporated uncertainty of our observed typhoid fever prevalence, of healthcare seeking adjustment multipliers, and of blood culture diagnostic sensitivity. Among 3,556 total participants, 50 typhoid fever cases were identified. Of typhoid cases, 26 (52%) were male and the median (range) age was 22 (< 1-60) years; 4 (8%) were aged < 5 years and 10 (20%) were aged 5 to 14 years. Annual typhoid fever incidence was estimated as 61.5 (95% CrI 14.9-181.9), 6.5 (95% CrI 1.4-20.4), and 4.0 (95% CrI 0.6-13.9) per 100,000 persons in 2007-08, 2011-14, and 2016-18, respectively. There were no deaths among typhoid cases. We estimated moderate typhoid incidence (>= 10 per 100 000) in 2007-08 and low (>= 10 per 100 000) incidence during later surveillance periods, but with overlapping credible intervals across study periods. Although consistent with falling typhoid incidence, we interpret this as showing substantial variation over the study periods. Given potential variation, multi-year surveillance may be warranted in locations making decisions about typhoid conjugate vaccine introduction and other control measures.Author summaryThere is evidence that typhoid fever incidence may vary over time, but there are few longitudinal studies estimating incidence. This is especially true in Sub-Saharan Africa, where recent estimates show wide variation in incidence across different settings, but very limited longitudinal descriptions from those settings. Incidence estimates were generated using facility-based surveillance data from three study periods that was adjusted for health-seeking behavior established through healthcare utilization surveys performed in the catchment area. In addition to coupling facility-based surveillance data with healthcare utilization data, we utilized a Bayesian statistical methodology in order to estimate incidence and characterize uncertainty around the estimates. Our results demonstrate moderate typhoid incidence in 2007-08 and low incidence during 2012-14 and 2016-18, but with overlapping credible intervals across study periods. Our data are consistent with evidence that endemic typhoid may vary substantially over time. Given potential variation, multi-year surveillance may be warranted in locations making decisions about typhoid conjugate vaccine introduction and other control measures.

TI  - Assessment of Machine Learning Techniques for Oil Rig Classification in C-Band SAR Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article aims at performing maritime target classification in SAR images using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. In particular, the targets of interest are oil platforms and ships located in the Campos Basin, Brazil. Two convolutional neural networks (CNNs), VGG-16 and VGG-19, were used for attribute extraction. The logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbours (kNN), decision tree (DT), naive Bayes (NB), neural networks (NET), and AdaBoost (ADBST) schemes were considered for classification. The target classification methods were evaluated using polarimetric images obtained from the C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system Sentinel-1. Classifiers are assessed by the accuracy indicator. The LR, SVM, NET, and stacking results indicate better performance, with accuracy ranging from 84.1% to 85.5%. The Kruskal-Wallis test shows a significant difference with the tested classifier, indicating that some classifiers present different accuracy results. The optimizations provide results with more significant accuracy gains, making them competitive with those shown in the literature. There is no exact combination of methods for SAR image classification that will always guarantee the best accuracy. The optimizations performed in this article were for the specific data set of the Campos Basin, and results may change depending on the data set format and the number of images.

TI  - Mapping a European Spruce Bark Beetle Outbreak Using Sentinel-2 Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Insect outbreaks affect forests, causing the deaths of trees and high economic loss. In this study, we explored the detection of European spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus, L.) outbreaks at the individual tree crown level using multispectral satellite images. Moreover, we explored the possibility of tracking the progression of the outbreak over time using multitemporal data. Sentinel-2 data acquired during the summer of 2020 over a bark beetle-infested area in the Italian Alps were used for the mapping and tracking over time, while airborne lidar data were used to automatically detect the individual tree crowns and to classify tree species. Mapping and tracking of the outbreak were carried out using a support vector machine classifier with input vegetation indices extracted from the multispectral data. The results showed that it was possible to detect two stages of the outbreak (i.e., early, and late) with an overall accuracy of 83.4%. Moreover, we showed how it is technically possible to track the evolution of the outbreak in an almost bi-weekly period at the level of the individual tree crowns. The outcomes of this paper are useful from both a management and ecological perspective: it allows forest managers to map a bark beetle outbreak at different stages with a high spatial accuracy, and the maps describing the evolution of the outbreak could be used in further studies related to the behavior of bark beetles.

TI  - Multi-Decadal Mapping and Climate Modelling Indicates Eastward Rubber Plantation Expansion in India
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Automated long-term mapping and climate niche modeling are important for developing adaptation and management strategies for rubber plantations (RP). Landsat imageries at the defoliation and refoliation stages were employed for RP mapping in the Indian state of Tripura. A decision tree classifier was applied to Landsat image-derived vegetation indices (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Difference Vegetation Index) for mapping RPs at two-three years intervals from 1990 to 2017. A comparison with actual plantation data indicated more than 91% mapping accuracy, with most RPs able to be identified within six years of plantation, while several patches were detected after six years of plantations. The RP patches identified in 1990 and before 2000 were used for training the Maxent species distribution model, wherein bioclimatic variables for 1960-1990 and 1970-2000 were used as predictor variables, respectively. The model-estimated suitability maps were validated using the successive plantation sites. Moreover, the RPs identified before 2017 and the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) climate projections (SSP126 and SSP245) were used to predict the habitat suitability for 2041-2060. The past climatic changes (decrease in temperature and a minor reduction in precipitation) and identified RP patches indicated an eastward expansion in the Indian state of Tripura. The projected increase in temperature and a minor reduction in the driest quarter precipitation will contribute to more energy and sufficient water availability, which may facilitate the further eastward expansion of RPs. Systematic multi-temporal stand age mapping would help to identify less productive RP patches, and accurate monitoring could help to develop improved management practices. In addition, the existing RP patches, their expansion, and the projected habitat suitability maps could benefit resource managers in adapting climate change measures and better landscape management.

AB  - Arterio-enteric fistulas involving pancreas allograft are rare complications of transplantation that manifest as gastrointestinal bleeding. We discuss the case of a 34-year-old patient with failed pancreas transplant who presented with recurrent sentinel bleeding before catastrophic hemorrhage. Multiple endoscopies did not identify the source of bleeding, and subsequent angiography demonstrated a fistulous connection between the transplanted pancreatic artery and the small bowel. A stent graft was placed with immediate stabilization. We provide a review of the literature and discuss the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of arterio-enteric fistulas to highlight the importance of early recognition and intervention in preventing life-threatening bleeding.

AB  - This work presents the results of a doctoral dissertation that aimed to analyze the implications of movements for the commodification and democratization of knowledge in Education. We herein present how knowledge, as an immaterial good, is born "free", and becomes a commodity through the commodification movement, which has been operating, with greater evidence, in the arts (music and cinema), in entertainment (games), in technology (softwares) and in science (scientific literature). For this demonstration, we go through the reflection on knowledge, the commodity, the commodity as knowledge, the history of this process and its concrete manifestations in our present time, whether through efforts to maintain the status quo or the creation of new legal mechanisms or technology for the continuity and expansion of this worldview.

TI  - Metrics analysis of non fluvial lacustrine systems of the Lavrado, northeast region of Roraima State
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE GEOMORFOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study describe the morphometrics and seasonal dynamics of the lavrado's lacustrine systems, northeast portion of Roraima State in Brazil. The methods to identify the lake systems was performed by supervised classification based on Landsat 8 (OLI) of 2014 (rainy season) and 2015 ( dry season). The morphology of the permanent and temporary lakes was characterized by a shape index, which is a correlation of the lake perimeter with the geometry of a circle of equal area. Digital elevation models of SRTM were used to characterize the regional environment. The lavrado's lakes are develop in elevations between 50 and 200 meters of altitude, in regions dominated by agradationals geomorphological features. The lakes were classified as headwaters, isolated or connected ones. In relation to morphology the lakes are predominantly circular and semicircular in both seasons of the year. In the rainy season the lakes are interconnected to each other and also to the fluvial systems (fluvial-lacustrine connectivity), covering an area of 832,62 km(2) ; during dry season the lakes cover 129,25 km(2) of the region, with about 17,000 lakes between perennial and seasonal.

TI  - Dynamic Modeling of Land Use and Coverage Changes in the Dryland Pernambuco, Brazil
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this work was to carry out a multitemporal analysis of changes in land use and land cover in the municipality of Floresta, Pernambuco State in Brazil. Landsat images were used in the years 1985, 1989, 1993, 1997, 2001, 2005, 2009, 2014, and 2019, and the classes were broken down into areas: water, exposed soil, agriculture, and forestry, and using the Bhattacharya classifier, the classification was carried out for generating land use maps. The data was validated by the Kappa index and points collected in the field, and the projection of the dynamics of use for 2024 was constructed. The thematic maps of land use and coverage from 1985 to 2019 show more significant changes in the forest and exposed soil classes. The increase in the forest class and the consequent reduction in exposed soil are consequences of the interaction between climate and human activities and the quality of the spatial resolution of the satellite images used between the years analyzed.

TI  - Operational Use of EO Data for National Land Cover Official Statistics in Lesotho
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) is building a land cover monitoring system in Lesotho in support of ReNOKA ('we are a river'), the national program for integrated catchment management led by the Government of Lesotho. The aim of the system is to deliver land cover products at a national level on an annual basis that can be used for global reporting of official land cover statistics and to inform appropriate land restoration policies. This paper presents an innovative methodology that has allowed the production of five standardized annual land cover maps (2017-2021) using only a single in situ dataset gathered in the field for the reference year, 2021. A total of 10 land cover classes are represented in the maps, including specific features, such as gullies, which are under close monitoring. The mapping approach developed includes the following: (i) the automatic generation of training and validation datasets for each reporting year from a single in situ dataset; (ii) the use of a Random Forest Classifier combined with postprocessing and harmonization steps to produce the five standardized annual land cover maps; (iii) the construction of confusion matrixes to assess the classification accuracy of the estimates and their stability over time to ensure estimates' consistency. Results show that the error-adjusted overall accuracy of the five maps ranges from 87% (2021) to 83% (2017). The aim of this work is to demonstrate a suitable solution for operational land cover mapping that can cope with the scarcity of in situ data, which is a common challenge in almost every developing country.

TI  - Creating a Detailed Wetland Inventory with Sentinel-2 Time-Series Data and Google Earth Engine in the Prairie Pothole Region of Canada
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands in the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) of Canada and the United States represent a unique mapping challenge. They are dynamic both seasonally and year-to-year, are very small, and frequently altered by human activity. Many efforts have been made to estimate the loss of these important habitats but a high-quality inventory of pothole wetlands is needed for data-driven conservation and management of these resources. Typical landcover classifications using one or two image dates from optical or Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Earth Observation (EO) systems often produce reasonable wetland inventories for less dynamic, forested landscapes, but will miss many of the temporary and seasonal wetlands in the PPR. Past studies have attempted to capture PPR wetland dynamics by using dense image stacks of optical or SAR data. We build upon previous work, using 2017-2020 Sentinel-2 imagery processed through the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform to capture seasonal flooding dynamics of wetlands in a prairie pothole wetland landscape in Alberta, Canada. Using 36 different image dates, wetland flood frequency (hydroperiod) was calculated by classifying water/flooding in each image date. This product along with the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) Canopy Height Model (CHM) was then used to generate a seven-class wetland inventory with wetlands classified as areas with seasonal but not permanent water/flooding. Overall accuracies of the resulting inventory were between 95% and 96% based on comparisons with local photo-interpreted inventories at the Canadian Wetland Classification System class level, while wetlands themselves were classified with approximately 70% accuracy. The high overall accuracy is due, in part, to a dominance of uplands in the PPR. This relatively simple method of classifying water through time generates reliable wetland maps but is only applicable to ecosystems with open/non-complex wetland types and may be highly sensitive to the timing of cloud-free optical imagery that captures peak wetland flooding (usually post snow melt). Based on this work, we suggest that expensive field or photo-interpretation training data may not be needed to map wetlands in the PPR as self-labeling of flooded and non-flooded areas in a few Sentinel-2 images is sufficient to classify water through time. Our approach demonstrates a framework for the operational mapping of small, dynamic PPR wetlands that relies on open-access EO data and does not require costly, independent training data. It is an important step towards the effective conservation and management of PPR wetlands, providing an efficient method for baseline and ongoing mapping in these dynamic environments.

TI  - Monitoring and Predicting Channel Morphology of the Tongtian River, Headwater of the Yangtze River Using Landsat Images and Lightweight Neural Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tongtian River is the source of the Yangtze River and is a national key ecological reserve in China. Monitoring and predicting the changes and mechanisms of the Tongtian River channel morphology are beneficial to protecting the "Asian Water Tower". This study aims to quantitatively monitor and predict the accretion and erosion area of the Tongtian River channel morphology during the past 30 years (1990-2020). Firstly, the water bodies of the Tongtian River were extracted and the accretion and erosion areas were quantified using 1108 Landsat images based on the combined method of three water-body indices and a threshold, and the surface-water dataset provided by the European Commission Joint Research Centre. Secondly, an intelligent lightweight neural-network model was constructed to predict and analyze the accretion and erosion area of the Tongtian River. Results indicate that the Tongtian River experienced apparent accretion and erosion with a total area of 98.3 and 94.9 km(2), respectively, during 1990-2020. The braided (meandering) reaches at the upper (lower) Tongtian River exhibit an overall trend of accretion (erosion). The Tongtian River channel morphology was determined by the synergistic effect of sediment-transport velocity and streamflow. The lightweight neural network well-reproduced the complex nonlinear processes in the river-channel morphology with a final prediction error of 0.0048 km(2) for the training session and 4.6 km(2) for the test session. Results in this study provide more effective, reasonable, and scientific decision-making aids for monitoring, protecting, understanding, and mining the evolution characteristics of rivers, especially the complex change processes of braided river channels in alpine regions and developing countries.

TI  - Study on Spatiotemporal Variation Pattern of Vegetation Coverage on Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the Analysis of Its Climate Driving Factors
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - As one of the most sensitive areas to global environmental change, especially global climate change, the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is an ideal area for studying global climate change and ecosystems. There are few studies on the analysis of the vegetation's driving factors on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau based on large-scale and high-resolution data due to the incompetence of satellite sensors. In order to study the long-term vegetation spatiotemporal pattern and its driving factors, this study used the enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (ESTARFM) to improve the spatial resolution of the GIMMS NDVI3g (8 km) data of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in 1990 and 1995 based on the MODIS NDVI (500 m) data. The research on the spatiotemporal pattern and driving factors of vegetation on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau from 1990 to 2015 was carried out afterward, with combined data including topographic factors, annual average temperature, and annual precipitation. The results showed that there was a strong correlation between the actual MODIS NDVI image and the fused GIMMS NDVI3g image, which means that the accuracy of the fused GIMMS NDVI3g image is reliable and can provide basic data for the accurate evaluation of the spatial and temporal patterns of vegetation on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. From 1990 to 2015, the overall vegetation coverage of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau showed a degrading trend at a rate of -0.41%, and the degradation trend of vegetation coverage was the weakest when the slope was >= 25 degrees. Due to the influence of the policy of returning farmland to forests, the overall degradation trend has gradually weakened. The significant changes in vegetation in 2010 can be attributed to the difference in the spatial distribution of climatic factors such as temperature and precipitation. The area with reduced vegetation in the west was larger than the area with increased vegetation in the east. The effects of temperature and precipitation on the distribution, direction, and degradation level of vegetation coverage were varied by the areal differentiation in different zones.

TI  - Evaluation of the Ecological Effects of Ecological Restoration Programs: A Case Study of the Sloping Land Conversion Program on the Loess Plateau, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sloping Land Conversion Program (SLCP) is the largest ecological restoration program in the world. Evaluating the ecological effects of the SLCP not only provides a scientific basis for China to improve the SLCP but also provides a reference for other countries in the world to evaluate the ecological effects of ecological restoration programs being implemented or to be implemented. To this end, we took the Loess Plateau, the core area for the implementation of the SLCP, as an example and, based on multi-source remote sensing data and GIS technology, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the ecological effects of the implementation of the SLCP on the Loess Plateau. The results showed that, first, from 2000 to 2018, a total of 12,372.05 km(2) of cultivated land was converted into forest land and grassland on the Loess Plateau, and this contributed to an increase in vegetation cover from 45.09% in 2000 to 64.15% in 2018, and a decrease in the soil erosion modulus from 26.41 t center dot hm(-2)center dot yr(-1) in 2000 to 17.92 t center dot hm(-2)center dot yr(-1) in 2018. Second, the 6-25 degrees slope range is the core area of the Loess Plateau for implementation of the SLCP. In this range, the area of cultivated land converted into forest land and grassland accounts for 60.16% of the total area of transferred cultivated land. As a result, the 6-25 degrees slope range has become the most significant area for improving vegetation cover and reducing the soil erosion intensity, and it is mainly concentrated in the southwestern, central and central-eastern hilly and gully areas of the Loess Plateau. Third, from 2000 to 2018, the climate of the Loess Plateau tended to be warm and humid and was conducive to the implementation of the SLCP. Among these factors, precipitation is the dominant factor in determining the spatial distribution of vegetation on the Loess Plateau, and the increase in precipitation is also the main reason for the promotion of vegetation growth. Fourthly, from 2000 to 2018, the ecological environment of the Loess Plateau was significantly improved as a result of the combined effects of the implementation of the SLCP and climate warming and humidification, but the primary reason is still the implementation of the SLCP.

T2  - ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Subdwarf (sdB) stars include core helium-burning stars with a very thin hydrogen envelope that lies at the blue end of the horizontal branch (or extreme horizontal branch). Among them, short-period sdB binaries especially with cool companions are significant to test and constrain binary evolution. We discuss one such sdB+dM type binary, TYC 3315-1807-1 (V1), which was first reported by Kawka. Results of the photometric analysis on Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite data are being reported. Light variation in the light curve suggests that the system displays a large reflection effect with no eclipses. Spectroscopic observations of the object were also carried out to probe into the nature of secondary companion as well as to understand the post-common-envelope evolution of such objects. The variability in Balmer, He, and Na line profiles as a function of phase, probably caused by observed reflection effect was identified and studied. Period variation study of the object was done using times of minima obtained from the literature and the O - C plot was produced, which points to a decrease in the period (dp/dt = -1.36315 x 10(-7) day yr(-1)), and the possible scenario of evolution is discussed. From the evolutionary models, we constrain the possible mass of the sdB to be 0.274 M (circle dot) and that of the secondary is 0.113 M (circle dot), and we conclude that V1 may evolve directly as a helium-core white dwarf.

TI  - Multiple Linear Regression Models with Limited Data for the Prediction of Reference Evapotranspiration of the Peloponnese, Greece
T2  - HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the utility of multiple linear regression (MLR) for the estimation of reference evapotranspiration (ETo) of the Peloponnese, Greece, for two representative months of winter and summer during 2016-2019. Another objective was to test the number of inputs needed for satisfactorily accurate estimates via MLR. Datasets from sixty-two meteorological stations were exploited. The available independent variables were sunshine hours (N), mean temperature (Tmean), solar radiation (Rs), net radiation (Rn), wind speed (u(2)), vapour pressure deficit (es - ea), and altitude (Z). Sixteen MLR models were tested and compared to the corresponding ETo estimates computed by FAO-56 Penman-Monteith (FAO PM) in a previous study, via statistical indices of error and agreement. The MLR5 model with five input variables outperformed the other models (RMSE = 0.28 mm d(-1), adj. R-2 = 98.1%). Half of the tested models (two to six inputs) exhibited very satisfactory predictions. Models of one input (e.g., N, Rn) were also promising. However, the MLR with u(2) as the sole input variable presented the worst performance, probably because its relationship with ETo cannot be linearly described. The results indicate that MLR has the potential to produce very good predictive models of ETo for the Peloponnese, based on the literature standards.

TI  - Time series monitoring and prediction of coal mining subsidence based on multitemporal InSAR technology and GSM-HW model
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The surface subsidence caused by coal mining will cause serious environmental problems, and an effective monitoring and prediction system is indispensable. Aiming at this phenomenon, a mining subsidence monitoring and dynamic prediction model combining time series stacking differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (TSS-DInSAR) technology, small baseline subset InSAR technology (SBAS-InSAR), and golden section method-Holt-Winters (GSM-HW) model was proposed. First, based on the nine scene images of Sentinel-1A satellite in the study area, the time series subsidence of 811 work-face in Guobei coal mine from April 5 to July 10, 2021, was obtained using TSS-DInSAR and SBAS-InSAR monitoring technologies, respectively. Then, the original training samples of the GSM-HW model were generated by combining the cumulative surface subsidence results monitored by TSS-DInSAR and SBAS-InSAR, and the monitoring and prediction of surface subsidence were realized using this model. The experimental results show that the application of TSS-DInSAR and SBAS-InSAR monitoring technology to the impact of surface mining in mining areas has certain reliability, and the GSM-HW prediction model can make up for the deficiency of a single HW model in parameter optimization. The maximum fitting accuracy and prediction accuracy of the model for the 10 monitoring pilot sites are 96.9% and 98.4%, respectively, which can provide a reference for the design of surface monitoring and prediction system in the mining area.

TI  - Inferring 2D Local Surface-Deformation Velocities Based on PSI Analysis of Sentinel-1 Data: A Case Study of Oraefajokull, Iceland
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Two-dimensional deformation estimates derived from Persistent Scatterer Interferometric (PSI) analysis of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data can improve the characterisation of spatially and temporally varying deformation processes of Earth's surface. In this study, we examine the applicability of Persistent Scatterer (PS) Line-Of-Sight (LOS) estimates in providing two-dimensional deformation information, focusing on the retrieval of the local surface-movement processes. Two Sentinel-1 image stacks, ascending and descending, acquired from 2015 to 2018, were analysed based on a single master interferometric approach. First, Interferometric SAR (InSAR) deformation signals were corrected for divergent plate spreading and the Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA) signals. To constrain errors due to rasterisation and interpolation of the pointwise deformation estimates, we applied a vector-based decomposition approach to solve the system of linear equations, resulting in 2D vertical and horizontal surface-deformation velocities at the PSs. We propose, herein, a two-step decomposition procedure that incorporates the Projected Local Incidence Angle (PLIA) to solve for the potential slope-deformation velocity. Our derived 2D velocities reveal spatially detailed movement patterns of the active Svinafellsjokull slope, which agree well with the independent GPS time-series measurements available for this area.

TI  - Surface Deformation Monitoring and Risk Mapping in the Surroundings of the Solotvyno Salt Mine (Ukraine) between 1992 and 2021
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The historical Ukrainian rock-salt mining town of Solotvyno and its environmentally related problems are well-known. A complex monitoring system is needed to evaluate the current situation in order to revitalize the investigated area. In addition to other risks, surface deformation due to undermining is one of the major risks endangering building infrastructure in the inhabited area of the town. These processes are well-known in the area, and damages caused by the surface movement are often recognized. Measurement of the process's intensity and identification of the impacted area are crucial for any revitalization work. Information on these processes is the most important element of the hazard management and spatial-developmental planning of the town. This study aimed to characterize the long-term surface deformation processes and to identify the spatial and temporal trends and changes of these processes to assist spatial planning. The first step was to understand the surface deformation history from 1992. An InSAR-based assessment of the surface displacement of the undermined Solotvyno area was performed using data from three satellites, namely the ERS, Envisat, and the Sentinel-1, covering the time period between 1992 and 2021. The derived quantitative analysis indicated an intensive surface displacement and subsidence over the mining area. However, these displacements have not been even in the last 30 years of the investigation. The identification of the stabilized areas and recently started movements indicated the dislocation of the processes, which requires adequate actions for geohazard management and strategic planning. The demonstrated technology (InSAR) has the potential to set up an appropriate alarm system and provides an automated mechanism for continuous risk detection. A complex systems development is able to significantly reduce the geohazards over the unstable built-up zones.

TI  - Skin Cancer Research Goes Digital: Looking for Biomarkers within the Droplets
T2  - JOURNAL OF PERSONALIZED MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Skin cancer, which includes the most frequent malignant non-melanoma carcinomas (basal cell carcinoma, BCC, and squamous cell carcinoma, SCC), along with the difficult to treat cutaneous melanoma (CM), pose important worldwide issues for the health care system. Despite the improved anti-cancer armamentarium and the latest scientific achievements, many skin cancer patients fail to respond to therapies, due to the remarkable heterogeneity of cutaneous tumors, calling for even more sophisticated biomarker discovery and patient monitoring approaches. Droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR), a robust method for detecting and quantifying low-abundance nucleic acids, has recently emerged as a powerful technology for skin cancer analysis in tissue and liquid biopsies (LBs). The ddPCR method, being capable of analyzing various biological samples, has proved to be efficient in studying variations in gene sequences, including copy number variations (CNVs) and point mutations, DNA methylation, circulatory miRNome, and transcriptome dynamics. Moreover, ddPCR can be designed as a dynamic platform for individualized cancer detection and monitoring therapy efficacy. Here, we present the latest scientific studies applying ddPCR in dermato-oncology, highlighting the potential of this technology for skin cancer biomarker discovery and validation in the context of personalized medicine. The benefits and challenges associated with ddPCR implementation in the clinical setting, mainly when analyzing LBs, are also discussed.

TI  - Bridging the Racial Divide: NURSES LEADING BY CHRIST'S EXAMPLE
T2  - JOURNAL OF CHRISTIAN NURSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent civil unrest has proven that positive role models are essential to help bridge the nation's racial divide. Nurses are primed to be among these role models as trusted and respected healthcare professionals. Nursing's code of ethics defines nurses' moral obligations to respect all people and advocate for justice. Christian nurses face a higher calling: to love one's neighbors as themselves. this article explores the application of a Christian worldview of Fawcett's metaparadigm of nursing as a foundation for nurses to extend the love of Christ and promote racial healing.

TI  - Novel Parameterization of Ice Cloud Effective Diameter from Collocated CALIOP-IIR and <i>CloudSat</i> Retrievals
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based measurements of global ice cloud microphysical properties are sampled to develop a novel set of physical parameterizations, relating to cloud layer temperature and effective diameter D-e, that can be implemented for two separate applications: in numerical weather prediction models and lidar-based cloud radiative forcing studies. Ice cloud optical properties (i.e., spectral scattering and absorption) are estimated based on the effective size and habit mixture of the cloud particles. Historically, the ice cloud D-e has been parameterized from aircraft in situ measurements. However, aircraft-based parameterizations are opportunistic in that they only represent specific types of clouds (e.g., convective anvil, tropopause-topped cirrus) in the regions in which they were sampled and, in some cases, are limited in fully resolving the entire vertical cloud layer. Breaking away from the aircraft-based parameterization paradigm, this study is the first of its kind to attempt a parameterization of D-e as a function of temperature, ice water content (IWC), and lidar-derived extinction from satellite-based global oceanic measurements of ice clouds. Data from both active and passive remote sensing sensors from two of NASA's A-Train satellites, CloudSat and CALIPSO, are collected to guide development of globally robust parameterizations of all ice cloud types and one exclusively for cirrus clouds. Significance StatementWe derived unique parameterizations of ice crystal effective size from global satellite measurements in an effort to more robustly and consistently represent ice clouds in numerical models for weather forecasting and climate energy balance studies. Based on our results, effective ice crystal size is easily solved based on temperature and visible cloud translucence. By knowing the size of the ice crystals, we can then estimate cloud scattering and absorption. In comparison with aircraft-based parameterizations, the satellite data reveal that ice crystal effective sizes are much smaller, on global average, for ice clouds occurring in relatively warm layers (>230 K), indicating that many ice clouds are more reflective than previously believed.

TI  - Reconstruction of Subsurface Salinity Structure in the South China Sea Using Satellite Observations: A LightGBM-Based Deep Forest Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately estimating the ocean's interior structures using sea surface data is of vital importance for understanding the complexities of dynamic ocean processes. In this study, we proposed an advanced machine-learning method, the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM)-based Deep Forest (LGB-DF) method, to estimate the ocean subsurface salinity structure (OSSS) in the South China Sea (SCS) by using sea surface data from multiple satellite observations. We selected sea surface salinity (SSS), sea surface temperature (SST), sea surface height (SSH), sea surface wind (SSW, decomposed into eastward wind speed (USSW) and northward wind speed (VSSW) components), and the geographical information (including longitude and latitude) as input data to estimate OSSS in the SCS. Argo data were used to train and validate the LGB-DF model. The model performance was evaluated using root mean square error (RMSE), normalized root mean square error (NRMSE), and determination coefficient (R-2). The results showed that the LGB-DF model had a good performance and outperformed the traditional LightGBM model in the estimation of OSSS. The proposed LGB-DF model using sea surface data by SSS/SST/SSH and SSS/SST/SSH/SSW performed less satisfactorily than when considering the contribution of the wind speed and geographical information, indicating that these are important parameters for accurately estimating OSSS. The performance of the LGB-DF model was found to vary with season and water depth. Better estimation accuracy was obtained in winter and autumn, which was due to weaker stratification. This method provided important technical support for estimating the OSSS from satellite-derived sea surface data, which offers a novel insight into oceanic observations.

TI  - Dynamic Mapping of Paddy Rice Using Multi-Temporal Landsat Data Based on a Deep Semantic Segmentation Model
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely, accurate, and repeatable crop mapping is vital for food security. Rice is one of the important food crops. Efficient and timely rice mapping would provide critical support for rice yield and production prediction as well as food security. The development of remote sensing (RS) satellite monitoring technology provides an opportunity for agricultural modernization applications and has become an important method to extract rice. This paper evaluated how a semantic segmentation model U-net that used time series Landsat images and Cropland Data Layer (CDL) performed when applied to extractions of paddy rice in Arkansas. Classifiers were trained based on time series images from 2017-2019, then were transferred to corresponding images in 2020 to obtain resultant maps. The extraction outputs were compared to those produced by Random Forest (RF). The results showed that U-net outperformed RF in most scenarios. The best scenario was when the time resolution of the data composite was fourteen day. The band combination including red band, near-infrared band, and Swir-1 band showed notably better performance than the six widely used bands for extracting rice. This study found a relatively high overall accuracy of 0.92 for extracting rice with training samples including five years from 2015 to 2019. Finally, we generated dynamic maps of rice in 2020. Rice could be identified in the heading stage (two months before maturing) with an overall accuracy of 0.86 on July 23. Accuracy gradually increased with the date of the mapping date. On September 17, overall accuracy was 0.92. There was a significant linear relationship (slope = 0.9, r(2) = 0.75) between the mapped areas on July 23 and those from the statistical reports. Dynamic mapping is not only essential to assist farms and governments for growth monitoring and production assessment in the growing season, but also to support mitigation and disaster response strategies in the different growth stages of rice.

TI  - High resolution land cover mapping and crop classification in the Loukkos watershed (Northern Morocco): An approach using SAR Sentinel-1 time series
T2  - REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing has become more and more a reliable tool for mapping land cover and monitoring cropland. Much of the work done in this field uses optical remote sensing data. In Morocco, active remote sensing data remain under-exploited despite their importance in monitoring spatial and temporal dynamics of land cover and crops even during cloudy weather. This study aims to explore the potential of C-band Sentinel-1 data in the production of a high-resolution land cover mapping and crop classification within the irrigated Loukkos watershed agricultural landscape in northern Morocco. The work was achieved by using 33 dual-polarized images in vertical-vertical (VV) and vertical-horizontal (VH) polarizations. The images were acquired in ascending orbits between April 16 and October 25, 2020, with the purpose to track the backscattering behavior of the main crops and other land cover classes in the study area. The results showed that the backscatter increased with the phenological development of the monitored crops (rice, watermelon, peanuts, and winter crops), strongly for the VH and VV bands, and slightly for the VH/VV ratio. The other classes (water, built-up, forest, fruit trees, permanent vegetation, greenhouses, and bare lands) did not show significant variation during this period. Based on the backscattering analysis and the field data, a supervised classification was carried out, using the Random Forest Classifier (RF) algorithm. Results showed that radiometric characteristics and 6 days' time resolution covered by Sentinel-1 constellation gave a high classification accuracy by dual-polarization with Radar Ratio (VH/VV) or Radar Vegetation Index and textural features (between 74.07% and 75.19%). Accordingly, this study proves that the Sentinel-1 data provide useful information and a high potential for multi-temporal analyses of crop monitoring, and reliable land cover mapping which could be a practical source of information for various purposes in order to undertake food security issues.

TI  - Hydrothermal Alteration Mapping Using Landsat 8 and ASTER Data and Geochemical Characteristics of Precambrian Rocks in the Egyptian Shield: A Case Study from Abu Ghalaga, Southeastern Desert, Egypt
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluates the geological attributes of rocks within the Abu Ghalaga area using spatial, geochemical, and petrographic approaches. ASTER and Landsat imagery processed using band ratio and principal component analysis were used to map hydrothermal alterations, while a regional tectonic evaluation was based on automated extraction of lineaments from a digital elevation model. Geochemical and petrographic analyses were then employed for discrete scale evaluation of alteration patterns of rocks across the study location. Based on satellite image processing, alteration patterns across the study area are widespread, while evidence from lineament analysis suggests a dominant NW-SE tectonic trend accompanied by a less dominant ENE-WSW direction. The different rock units exposed in the studied district are arranged chronologically from oldest to youngest as arc metavolcanic group (basalt and rhyolite), arc metagabbro-diorite, gneissose granite (granodiorite and tonalite), and dykes (aplite and felsite). Various types of igneous and metamorphic rocks have propylitic, phyllic, and argillic zones. Geochemical data indicate that the studied rocks are classified into granite, granodiorite, gabbroic diorite, and gabbro. Geochemically, the rocks have a sub-alkaline magma type. The granodiorite-tonalite is derived from the calc-alkaline magma nature, while gabbro and diorite samples exhibit tholeiitic to calc-alkaline affinity. The tectonic setting of the studied rocks trends toward volcanic arc granite (VAG). Based on petrographic, geochemical, and remote analyses, sericitization, chloritization, epidotization, kaolinitization, carbonatization, and silicification are the main alteration types present in the study area. As a result of lineaments analysis, the existing fractures and structural planes form valid flow paths for mineral-bearing hydrothermal solutions.

TI  - SPATIAL BAYESIAN ESTIMATION OF HIV INFECTION AMONG FEMALE SEX WORKERS (FSW) IN INDIA
T2  - JP JOURNAL OF BIOSTATISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The HIV epidemic in India is highly heterogeneous and varies within regions. HIV sentinel surveillance and behavioural surveillance in India are conducted periodically among high-risk groups (HRGs). The data from the surveillances facilitate the estimation of levels and trends of HIV prevalence at the national and state levels. As we aim to achieve the UNAIDS' 'End of AIDS by 2030' goal, HIV prevalence estimations at district and further micro-levels become critical for effective HIV management. However, HIV prevalence data at micro -levels is not available for all districts in India, as the surveillance is being conducted in a limited number of sites. Hence, we propose a Geographical Information System (GIS) based spatial kriging method combined with Bayesian estimation to predict the HIV prevalence among female sex workers (FSW) in India. We used the HIV prevalence of FSWs obtained from the national Integrated Bio-behavioural Surveillance (IBBS) conducted across India in 2014-15. After ensuring spatial autocorrelation, the model prediction and Bayesian estimation were done. A spatial prediction map with the posterior distribution for the model parameters was generated. HIV prevalence in the posterior distribution ranged from 0.5% to 5%, with a higher frequency density in the range of 1% to 3%. The spatial prediction map can be used to estimate the HIV prevalence at micro -levels. It was observed that regions of higher HIV prevalence among FSW were more confined to certain states such as Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Rajasthan, Mizoram and Manipur. These estimates will provide invaluable insights on the heterogeneity of HIV prevalence in each state and, thus, will be instrumental in devising region-specific targeted interventions.

TI  - 'The Eliminated Gods': The Christian Reconfiguration of Jukun Theism
T2  - STUDIES IN WORLD CHRISTIANITY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article looks at an aspect of the cosmology of the Jukun of north-central Nigeria, specifically their theism, and how it has changed through their encounter with Christian monotheism. Many contemporary Jukun people assume that their indigenous cosmology has always been anchored on a Supreme Being akin to the Christian God. In this study I show that this currently held belief is largely due to the theological framework which Christian missionaries sought to make the Jukun worldview fit into. And even prior to the first Christian contact, Jukun indigenous cosmology had been in contact with Islam.I give a very brief history of the Jukun and of the Christian missionary efforts among them starting in 1906 and, starting from my own questions growing up as a Jukun, look at how indigenous concepts and categories for deities were adapted over the course of time as the majority of Jukun became Christian.

TI  - Machine-Learning Functional Zonation Approach for Characterizing Terrestrial-Aquatic Interfaces: Application to Lake Erie
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystems at coastal terrestrial-aquatic interfaces play a significant role in global biogeochemical cycles. In this study, we aimed to characterize coastal wetlands with particular focus on the co-variability between plant dynamics, topography, soil, and other environmental factors. We proposed a functional zonation approach based on machine learning clustering to identify the spatial regions, i.e., zones that capture these co-varied properties. This approach was applied to publicly available datasets along Lake Erie, in the Great Lakes Region. We investigated the heterogeneity of coastal ecosystem structures as a function of along-shore distance and transverse distance, based on the spatial data layers, including topography, wetland vegetation cover, and the time series of Landsat's enhanced vegetation index (EVI) between 1990 and 2020. Results showed that the topographic metrics (elevation and slope), soil texture, and plant productivity influence the spatial distribution of wetland land-covers (emergent and phragmites). These results highlight a natural organization along the transverse axis, where the elevation and the EVI increase further away from the coastline. In addition, the clustering analysis allowed us to identify regions with distinct environmental characteristics, as well as the ones that are more sensitive to interannual lake-level variations.

TI  - The potential of citizen science data to complement satellite and airborne lidar tree height measurements: lessons from The GLOBE Program
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment (GLOBE) Program is an international science, citizen science, and education program through which volunteers in participating countries collect environmental data in support of Earth system science. Using the program's software application, GLOBE Observer (GO), volunteers measure tree height and optional tree circumference, which may support the interpretation of NASA and other space-based satellite data such as tree height data from the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) and Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation instrument. This paper describes tree heights data collected through the GO application and identifies sources of error in data collection. We also illustrate how the ground-based citizen science data collected in the GO application can be used in conjunction with ICESat-2 tree height observations from two locations in the United States: Grand Mesa, Colorado, and Greenbelt, Maryland. Initial analyses indicate that data location accuracy and the scientific relevance of data density should be considered in order to align GLOBE tree height data with satellite-based data collections. These recommendations are intended to inform the improved implementation of citizen science environmental data collection in scientific work and to document a use case of the GLOBE Trees data for the science research community.

TI  - Online Hybrid Learning Methods for Real-Time Structural Health Monitoring Using Remote Sensing and Small Displacement Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Structural health monitoring (SHM) by using remote sensing and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is a promising approach to assessing the safety and the integrity of civil structures. Apart from this issue, artificial intelligence and machine learning have brought great opportunities to SHM by learning an automated computational model for damage detection. Accordingly, this article proposes online hybrid learning methods to firstly deal with some major challenges in data-driven SHM and secondly detect damage via small displacement data from SAR images in a real-time manner. The proposed methods contain three main parts: (i) data augmentation by Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and slice sampling for addressing the problem of small displacement data, (ii) data normalization by an online deep transfer learning algorithm for removing the effects of environmental and/or operational variability from augmented data, and (iii) feature classification via a scalar novelty score. The major contributions of this research include proposing two online hybrid unsupervised learning methods and providing effective frameworks for online damage detection. A small set of displacement samples extracted from SAR images of TerraSar-X regarding a long-term monitoring scheme of the Tadcaster Bridge in United Kingdom is applied to validate the proposed methods.

TI  - Detection of Partially Structural Collapse Using Long-Term Small Displacement Data from Satellite Images
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of satellite sensors and interferometry synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technology has enabled the exploitation of their benefits for long-term structural health monitoring (SHM). However, some restrictions cause this process to provide a small number of images leading to the problem of small data for SAR-based SHM. Conversely, the major challenge of the long-term monitoring of civil structures pertains to variations in their inherent properties by environmental and/or operational variability. This article aims to propose new hybrid unsupervised learning methods for addressing these challenges. The methods in this work contain three main parts: (i) data augmentation by the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, (ii) feature normalization, and (iii) decision making via Mahalanobis-squared distance. The first method presented in this work develops an artificial neural network-based feature normalization by proposing an iterative hyperparameter selection of hidden neurons of the network. The second method is a novel unsupervised teacher-student learning by combining an undercomplete deep neural network and an overcomplete single-layer neural network. A small set of long-term displacement samples extracted from a few SAR images of TerraSAR-X is applied to validate the proposed methods. The results show that the methods can effectively deal with the major challenges in the SAR-based SHM applications.

TI  - Comparative study on spatiotemporal fusion of Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 images over strong temporal changes
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 are two remote sensing satellites implemented by the European Space Agency for global observation. The temporal resolution of Sentinel-2 images and the spatial resolution of Sentinel-3 images may not be sufficient for local and precise monitoring. With spatiotemporal image fusion of Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 sensors, images with 1.4 days temporal resolution and 10-m spatial resolution can be produced. However, strong temporal change is a challenging factor for spatiotemporal fusion. The aim of this study was to compare the success of the deep learning-based DMNet model with flexible spatiotemporal data fusion (FSDAF) 2.0 and reliable and adaptive spatiotemporal data fusion (RASDF) algorithms for the spatiotemporal fusion of Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 images over strong temporal changes. Thus, the Kansas dataset was developed for the spatiotemporal fusion of Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 images in this study. It contained a large number of surface changes due to large wheat harvests. The results of this investigation show that in case of strong temporal change, the deep learning-based DMNet model performed better than the FSDAF 2.0 and RASDF methods. On the other hand, in the case of less temporal change, the FSDAF 2.0 and RASDF methods had a very high success compared with the DMNet model.

TI  - Metagenomic Investigation of Ticks From Kenyan Wildlife Reveals Diverse Microbial Pathogens and New Country Pathogen Records
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Focusing on the utility of ticks as xenosurveillance sentinels to expose circulating pathogens in Kenyan drylands, host-feeding ticks collected from wild ungulates [buffaloes, elephants, giraffes, hartebeest, impala, rhinoceros (black and white), zebras (Grevy's and plains)], carnivores (leopards, lions, spotted hyenas, wild dogs), as well as regular domestic and Boran cattle were screened for pathogens using metagenomics. A total of 75 host-feeding ticks [Rhipicephalus (97.3%) and Amblyomma (2.7%)] collected from 15 vertebrate taxa were sequenced in 46 pools. Fifty-six pathogenic bacterial species were detected in 35 pools analyzed for pathogens and relative abundances of major phyla. The most frequently observed species was Escherichia coli (62.8%), followed by Proteus mirabilis (48.5%) and Coxiella burnetii (45.7%). Francisella tularemia and Jingmen tick virus (JMTV) were detected in 14.2 and 13% of the pools, respectively, in ticks collected from wild animals and cattle. This is one of the first reports of JMTV in Kenya, and phylogenetic reconstruction revealed significant divergence from previously known isolates and related viruses. Eight fungal species with human pathogenicity were detected in 5 pools (10.8%). The vector-borne filarial pathogens (Brugia malayi, Dirofilaria immitis, Loa loa), protozoa (Plasmodium spp., Trypanosoma cruzi), and environmental and water-/food-borne pathogens (Entamoeba histolytica, Encephalitozoon intestinalis, Naegleria fowleri, Schistosoma spp., Toxoplasma gondii, and Trichinella spiralis) were detected. Documented viruses included human mastadenovirus C, Epstein-Barr virus and bovine herpesvirus 5, Trinbago virus, and Guarapuava tymovirus-like virus 1. Our findings confirmed that host-feeding ticks are an efficient sentinel for xenosurveillance and demonstrate clear potential for wildlife-livestock-human pathogen transfer in the Kenyan landscape.

TI  - Radar Interferometry as a Monitoring Tool for an Active Mining Area Using Sentinel-1 C-Band Data, Case Study of Riotinto Mine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil instability is a major hazard facing the mining industry in its role of supplying the indispensable mineral resources that our societal challenges require. Aiming to demonstrate the monitoring potential of radar satellites in the mining sector, we analyze the deformation field in the Riotinto mine, Spain. We propose a new method for combining ascending and descending results into a common dataset that provides better resolution. We project the LOS measurements resulting from both geometries to a common reference system without applying any type of geometric restriction. As a projection system, we use the vertical direction in flat areas and the slope in steep topographies. We then identify and remove outliers and artifacts from the joint dataset to finally obtain a deformation map that combines the two acquisition perspectives. The results in the Atalaya pit are consistent with GNSS measurements. The movements observed in the rock dumps were unknown before this study. We demonstrate the great potential of the Sentinel-1 satellite as a complementary tool for monitoring systems in mining environments and we call for its use to be standardized to guarantee a safe and sustainable supply of mineral resources necessary for a just technological transition.

TI  - Evaluation of classification techniques in Very-High-Resolution (VHR) imagery: A case study of the identification of deadwood in the Chilean Central-Patagonian Forests
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - During the past three decades, various methods have been developed to improve the classification accuracy in very high resolution (< 2 m) satellite data. This study's main goal was to evaluate and select the most suitable classification approach for detecting deadwood potentially useful for energy projects that would satisfy part of the demand for heating in the area. We compare five classification approaches using a WorldView-2 (Digital Global, Ins) standard, an orthorectified image of the Ays ' en region of the Chilean Patagonia. The five classifiers were evaluated and selecting the best one was carried out through a confusion matrix and Kappa coefficient. The results showed that the two non-parametric classifiers used (neural net and support vector machine) offered the best performance (98%) and the best Kappa coefficient (0.97). We conclude that it is essential to promote the development of innovative projects in native forests by local owners can contribute, to the formulation of public policies that directly benefit the Ays ' en region's inhabitants.

AB  - The environmental effects of wildfires are a hot issue in current research. This study examines the effects of the 2021 wildfires in the Attica region in Greece based on Earth observation and GIS-based techniques for the development of a web app that includes the derived knowledge. The effects of wildfires were estimated with the use of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery concerning burned area extent and burn severity using a NBR-based method. In addition, the erosion risk was modeled on a pre-fire and post-fire basis with the RUSLE. This study highlights the importance of assessing the effects of wildfires with a holistic approach to produce useful knowledge tools in post-fire impact assessment and restoration.

TI  - Two-stream spatiotemporal image fusion network based on difference transformation
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - For satellite imaging instruments, the tradeoff between spatial and temporal resolution leads to the spatial-temporal contradiction of image sequences. Spatiotemporal image fusion (STIF) provides a solution to generate images with both high-spatial and high-temporal resolutions, thus expanding the applications of existing satellite images. Most deep learning-based STIF methods throw the task to network as a whole and construct an end-to-end model without caring about the intermediate physical process. This leads to high complexity, less interpretability, and low accuracy of the fusion model. To address this problem, we propose a two-stream difference transformation spatiotemporal fusion (TSDTSF), which includes transformation and fusion streams. In the transformation stream, an image difference transformation module reduces the pixel distribution difference of images from different sensors with the same spatial resolution, and a feature difference transformation module improves the feature quality of low-resolution images. The fusion stream focuses on feature fusion and image reconstruction. The TSDTSF shows superior performance in accuracy, vision quality, and robustness. The experimental results show that TSDTSF achieves the effect of the average coefficient of determination (R-2 = 0.7847) and the root mean square error (RMSE = 0.0266), which is better than the suboptimal method average (R-2 = 0.7519) and (RMSE = 0.0289). The quantitative and qualitative experimental results on various datasets demonstrate our superiority over the state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - Inflammatory Immune Responses Trigger Rejection of Allogeneic Fibroblasts Transplanted into Mouse Skin
T2  - CELL TRANSPLANTATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Fibroblasts, or their homolog stromal cells, are present in most tissues and play an essential role in tissue homeostasis and regeneration. As a result, fibroblast-based strategies have been widely employed in tissue engineering. However, while considered to have immunosuppressive properties, the survival and functionality of allogeneic fibroblasts after transplantation remain controversial. Here, we evaluated innate and adaptive immune responses against allogeneic fibroblasts following intradermal injection into different immune-deficient mouse strains. While allogeneic fibroblasts were rejected 1 week after transplantation in immunocompetent mice, rejection did not occur in immunodeficient gamma chain-deficient NOD-SCID (NSG) mice. T-cell- and B-cell-deficient RAG1 knockout mice showed greater loss of fibroblasts by day 5 after transplantation compared with NSG mice (P <= 0.05) but prolonged persistence compared with wild-type recipient (P <= 0.005). Loss of fibroblasts correlated with the expression of proinflammatory chemokine genes and infiltration of myeloid cells in the transplantation site. Depletion of macrophages and neutrophils delayed rejection, revealing the role of innate immune cells in an early elimination of fibroblasts that is followed by T-cell-mediated rejection in the second week. These findings indicate that the application of allogeneic fibroblasts in tissue engineering products requires further improvements to overcome cell rejection by innate and adaptive immune cells.

TI  - Spatial Estimates of Flood Damage and Risk Are Influenced by the Underpinning DEM Resolution: A Case Study in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The sensitivity of simulated flood depth and area to DEM resolution are acknowledged, but their effects on flood damage and risk estimates are less well understood. This study sought to analyse the relative benefits of using global DEMs of different resolution sizes, 5 m AW3D Standard, 12.5 m ALOS PALSAR and 30 m SRTM, to simulate flood inundation, damage and risk. The HEC-RAS 2D model was adopted for flood simulations, and the Toba River in the Klang River Basin in Malaysia was chosen for the case study. Simulated inundation areas from AW3D coincide the most with reported flooded areas, but the coarser-resolution DEMs did capture some of the reported flooded areas. The inundation area increased as the resolution got finer. As a result, AW3D returned almost double flood damage and risk estimates compared to ALOS PALSAR, and almost quadruple compared to SRTM for building-level damage and risk analysis. The findings indicate that a finer-resolution DEM improves inundation modelling and could provide greater flood damage and risk estimates compared to a coarser DEM. However, DEMs of coarser resolution remain useful in data-scarce regions or for large-scale assessments in efforts to manage flood risk.

AB  - As part of a larger revision of the popularity of Patanjali's yoga (ca 4th century CE) in the modern period at the expense of the richness and diversity of yoga phenomenon in classical India, this paper investigates the critique to Patanjali found in various saiva and Tantric sources. Thus, in the first place the yoga of the antinomian pasupata ascetics vis-a-vis Patanjali's yoga is studied. After this, central aspects of the Tantric worldview useful to understand the divergence with Patanjali's model are discussed. Finally, the explicit critique to Patanjali found in the work of Abhinavagupta (10th century), the great Tantric philosopher, is analyzed.

TI  - Uncertainty-Aware Interpretable Deep Learning for Slum Mapping and Monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Over a billion people live in slums, with poor sanitation, education, property rights and working conditions having a direct impact on current residents and future generations. Slum mapping is one of the key problems concerning slums. Policymakers need to delineate slum settlements to make informed decisions about infrastructure development and allocation of aid. A wide variety of machine learning and deep learning methods have been applied to multispectral satellite images to map slums with outstanding performance. Since the physical and visual manifestation of slums significantly varies with geographical region and comprehensive slum maps are rare, it is important to quantify the uncertainty of predictions for reliable and confident application of models to downstream tasks. In this study, we train a U-Net model with Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD) on 13-band Sentinel-2 images, allowing us to calculate pixelwise uncertainty in the predictions. The obtained outcomes show that the proposed model outperforms the previous state-of-the-art model, having both higher AUPRC and lower uncertainty when tested on unseen geographical regions of Mumbai using the regional testing framework introduced in this study. We also use SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values to investigate how the different features contribute to our model's predictions which indicate a certain shortwave infrared image band is a powerful feature for determining the locations of slums within images. With our results, we demonstrate the usefulness of including an uncertainty quantification approach in detecting slum area changes over time.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Evolution of Sowing and the Onset of the Rainy Season in a Region of Large Agricultural Expansion in Brazil
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to assist in high-yield agricultural management in multiple cropping systems, it is essential to understand the link between the rainy season onset and crops sowing dates, since it considerably affects the management, yield and output. We built crop calendars derived from remote sensing products and investigated the link between sowing dates and the onset of the rainy season in irrigated and rainfed agriculture in Western Bahia, a new and important agricultural frontier in Brazilian Cerrado. Crop sowing dates were obtained from green-up dates from 2001 to 2019. Rainy season onset dates were determined using CHIRPS daily precipitation data. Results indicate that sowing occurs from 26 October to 15 November and the rainy season starts from 17 to 27 October. Rainfed sowing dates are strongly correlated to rainy season onset and are particularly affected in years where rains are delayed. Sowing dates in irrigated pixels occur up to 25 days earlier than rainfed and are not correlated to rainy season onset. Irrigated farms are sowing earlier and in a shorter window than rainfed, with a stronger resilience in years where rains are delayed, and have adapted their sowing operation towards a more intensive agriculture and efficient water use during the rainy season.

TI  - Northward Expansion of Amblyomma americanum (Acari: Ixodidae) into Southwestern Michigan
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Amblyomma americanum (Linnaeus) (Acari: Ixodidae) (lone star tick) is an aggressive, generalist parasite that vectors numerous important human and animal pathogens. In recent decades its geographic range has expanded northwards from endemic regions in the southeastern and southcentral United States. In 2019 five questing A. americanum ticks, comprising two life stages were detected at one site in southwestern Michigan, satisfying one CDC criterium for an established population for the first time in recent history in the state. To better characterize the extent of emerging A. americanum, we conducted active surveillance (i.e., drag sampling) in summer 2020 throughout Michigan's southern counties and detected one adult A. americanum from each of six widespread sites, including where they had been detected in 2019. A larger established population was identified at another site in Berrien County, which yielded 691 A. americanum comprising three life stages, and questing phenologies here were similar to that reported for other endemic regions. Statewide surveillance in 2021 revealed no A. americanum outside of Berrien County, but establishment criteria were met again at the two sites where established populations were first detected respectively in 2019 and 2020. These observations may represent the successful invasion of A. americanum into Michigan. Data from passive (1999-2020) and active surveillance (2004-2021) efforts, including a domestic animal sentinel program (2015-2018), are reported to provide context for this nascent invasion. Continued active surveillance is needed to help inform the public, medical professionals, and public health officials of the health risks associated with this vector.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We aimed to study the daily formaldehyde (HCHO) columns over urban and forested areas in Sao Paulo State, Brazil, from the TROPOMI spectrometer onboard the Sentinel-5P satellite during 2020. Nineteen specific areas were defined in four regions: 3 areas in each of two preserved Atlantic Forests (PEMD and PETAR), 3 in a sugarcane growing region (NERG) and 10 in the Metropolitan Area of Sao Paulo (MASP), among which 2 areas are in the Morro Grande reserve, which is a significant remnant of Atlantic Forest outside the densely urbanized area of MASP. An analysis of variance and Tukey's test showed that the mean annual columns over the Morro Grande reserve (1.69 +/- 1.05 x 10(-4) mol/m(2) and 1.73 +/- 1.07 x 10(-4) mol/m(2)) presented greater statistical similarity with the forest and rural areas of the state (<1.70 x 10(-4) mol/m(2)) than with MASP (>2.00 x 10(-4) mol/m(2)), indicating few effects from megacity anthropogenic emissions. Case studies addressing selected days in 2020 showed that fires in and around the state were related to episodes of maximum density of HCHO columns. The results showed significant seasonality, with lower concentrations during summer (wet season) and higher concentrations during winter and spring (dry and transition dry-wet seasons).

AB  - This work is concerned with forest and cumulant type expansions of general random variables on a filtered probability space. We establish a "broken exponential martingale" expansion that generalizes and unifies the exponentiation result of Alos, Gatheral, and Radoicic (SSRN'17; Quant. Finance 20 (2020) 13-27) and the cumulant recursion formula of Lacoin, Rhodes, and Vargas (arXiv; (2019)). Specifically, we exhibit the two previous results as lower dimensional projections of the same generalized forest expansion, subsequently related by forest reordering. Our approach also leads to sharp integrability conditions for validity of the cumulant formula, as required by many of our examples, including iterated stochastic integrals, Levy area, Bessel processes, KPZ with smooth noise, Wiener-Ito chaos, and "rough" stochastic (forward) variance models.

TI  - Investigating accuracies of WorldView-2, Sentinel-2, and SPOT-6 in discriminating morphologically similar savanna woody plant species during a dry season
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate assessment of woody species diversity using remote sensing can assist ecologists by providing timely information for ecosystem management. The increasing availability of remotely sensed data necessitates the investigation of accuracies of different sensors in classifying plant species, especially during the dry season when foliage amount is low. WorldView-2, SPOT-6, and Sentinel-2 images were compared in detecting woody species (n = 27) and three coexisting land cover types in a savanna environment during a dry period. Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers were applied to each imagery to make a strong case for the comparison. The overall classification accuracies ranged between 52% and 65% for all images, with the WorldView-2 image performing the best followed by Sentinel-2 and SPOT-6 images. These accuracy rankings were similar for both the RF and SVM classifiers, with the former faring better. Pairwise comparison of the images using McNemar's test showed significant differences between images in their ability to correctly identify woody species. Analysis of band importance revealed better contributions to the classifications of infrared bands for all images. Overall, the findings showed the potential of optical imagery in classifying and monitoring woody species hotspots in savanna environments even during a low photosynthesis season.

TI  - ETHNOTERRITORIAL FEATURES, ECOLOGICAL RATIONALITY AND COMMUNICATIVE INTERACTION IN THE YOREME-MAYO CELEBRATIONS
T2  - REVISTA RA XIMHAI
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this document is to explore the construct of ecological rationality, highlighting the role of animals and plants in religious and organizational animist traits, in the traditional celebrations of the yoreme mayo ethnic group in southern Sonora. The eminently qualitative method examines such a construct in its expression as tropes, which are used in the communicative interaction that takes place in celebrations of this ethnic group. In this qualitative approach, a series of interviews were conducted with the main actors of such ceremonies. The results indicate that rationality, which emerged as sustenance in the ancestral vision of this social group, was intertwined between nature and religious mysticism, to the point of considering it as its own. The animals, plants, the river and its built utensils are used for their communicative interaction, revealed in the form of tropes in their stories and the lyrics of their songs, which serve as scaffolding in their ceremonial acts. Thus, the animist manifestations between prayers, musicians, dancers, and the entire brotherhood, expose an ecological rationality that brings them together, transcending even everyday rationality.

TI  - Mapping Shrub Coverage in Xilin Gol Grassland with Multi-Temporal Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, shrubs dominated by the genus Caragana have expanded in a large area in Xilin Gol grassland, Inner Mongolia, China. This study comprehensively evaluated the performances of multiple factors for mapping shrub coverage across the Xilin Gol grassland based on the spectral and temporal signatures of Sentinel-2 imagery, and for the first time produced a large-scale shrub coverage mapping result in this region. Considering the regional differences and gradients in the types and sizes of shrub in the study area, the study area was divided into three subregions based on precipitation data, i.e., west, middle and east regions. The shrub coverage estimation accuracy from dry- and wet-year data, different types of vegetation indices (VIs) and multiple regression methods were compared in each subregion, and the key phenological periods were selected. We also compared the accuracy of four mapping strategies, which were pairwise combinations of zoning (i.e., subregions divided by precipitation) and non-zoning, and full time series of VIs and key phenological period. Results show that the mapping accuracy in a dry year (2017) is higher than that in a wet year (2018). The optimal VIs and key phenological periods show high spatial variability. In terms of mapping strategies, the accuracy of zoning is higher than that of non-zoning. The root mean square error (RMSE), overall accuracy (OA) and recall for 'zoning + full time series (or + key phenological period)' strategy were 0.052 (0.055), 76.4% (79.7%) and 91.7% (94.6%), respectively, while for 'non-zoning + full time series (or + key phenological period)' strategy were 0.057 (0.060), 75.5% (74.6%) and 91.7% (88.6%), respectively. The mapping using VIs in key phenological periods is better than that of using full time series in the low-value prediction of shrub cover. Based on the strategy of 'zoning + key phenological period', the shrub coverage map of the whole region was generated with a RMSE of 0.055, OA of 80% and recall of 95%. This study not only provides the first large-scale mapping data of shrub coverage, but also provides reference for shrub dynamic monitoring in this area.

TI  - Extraction of Floating Raft Aquaculture Areas from Sentinel-1 SAR Images by a Dense Residual U-Net Model with Pre-Trained Resnet34 as the Encoder
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine floating raft aquaculture (FRA) monitoring is significant for marine ecological environment and food security assessment. Synthetic aperture radar-based monitoring is considered to be an effective means of FRA identification because of its capability for all-weather applications. Considering the poor generalization and extraction accuracy of traditional monitoring methods, a semantic segmentation model called D-ResUnet is proposed to extract FRA areas from Sentinel-1 images. The proposed model has a U-Net-like structure but combines the pre-trained ResNet34 as the encoder and adds dense residual units into the decoder. For this model, the final layer and cropping operation of the original U-Net model are removed to eliminate the model parameters. The mean and standard deviation of Precision, Recall, Intersection over Union (IoU), and F1 score are calculated under a five-fold training strategy to evaluate the model accuracy. The test experiments indicated that the proposed model performs well with the F1 of 92.6% and IoU of 86.24% in FRA extraction tasks. In particular, the ablation experiments and application experiments proved the effectiveness of the improvement strategy and the portability of the proposed D-ResUnet model, respectively. Compared with the other three state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models, the experiments demonstrate a clear accuracy advantage of the D-ResUnet model. For the FRA extraction task, this paper presents a promising approach that has refined extraction capability, high accuracy, and acceptable model complexity.

AB  - Cutaneous melanoma (CM) is potentially the most dangerous form of skin tumor and causes 90% of skin cancer mortality. A unique collaboration of multidisciplinary experts from the European Dermatology Forum (EDF), the European Association of Dermato-Oncology (EADO) and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) was formed to make recommendations on CM diagnosis and treatment, based on systematic literature reviews and the experts' experience. The diagnosis of melanoma can be made clinically and shall always be confirmed with dermatoscopy. If a melanoma is suspected, a histopathological examination is always required. Sequential digital dermatoscopy and full body photography can be used in high- risk patients to improve the detection of early melanoma. Where available, confocal reflectance microscopy can also improve clinical diagnosis in special cases. Melanoma shall be classified according to the 8th version of the American Joint Committee on Cancer classification. Thin melanomas up to 0.8 mm tumor thickness do not require further imaging diagnostics. From stage IB onwards, examinations with lymph node sonography are recommended, but no further imaging examinations. From stage IIC onwards whole-body examinations with computed tomography ( CT) or positron emission tomography CT (PET-CT) in combination with brain magnetic resonance imaging are recommended. From stage III and higher, mutation testing is recommended, particularly for BRAF V600 mutation. It is important to provide a structured follow-up to detect relapses and secondary primary melanomas as early as possible. There is no evidence to define the frequency and extent of examinations. A stage-based follow-up scheme is proposed which, according to the experience of the guideline group, covers the optimal requirements, but further studies may be considered. This guideline is valid until the end of 2024. (C) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A unique collaboration of multidisciplinary experts from the European Dermatology Forum (EDF), the European Association of Dermato-Oncology (EADO), and the European Organization of Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) was formed to make recommendations on cutaneous melanoma diagnosis and treatment, based on the systematic literature reviews and the experts' experience. Cutaneous melanomas are excised with one to 2cm safety margins. Sentinel lymph node dissection shall be performed as a staging procedure in patients with tumor thickness >= 1.0 mm or >= 0.8 mm with additional histological risk factors, although there is as yet no clear survival benefit for this approach. Therapeutic decisions in stage III/IV patients should be primarily made by an interdisciplinary oncology team ("tumor board"). Adjuvant therapies can be proposed in stage III/completely resected stage IV patients and are primarily anti-PD- 1, independent of mutational status, or alternatively dabrafenib plus trametinib for BRAF mutant patients. In distant metastases (stage IV), either resected or not, systemic treatment is always indicated. For first-line treatment particularly in BRAF wild-type patients, immunotherapy with PD-1 antibodies alone or in combination with CTLA-4 antibodies shall be considered. In stage IV melanoma with a BRAF-V600 E/K mutation, first-line therapy with BRAF/MEK inhibitors can be offered as an alternative to immunotherapy. In patients with primary resistance to immunotherapy and harboring a BRAFV600 E/K mutation, this therapy shall be offered as second-line therapy. Systemic therapy in stage III/IV melanoma is a rapidly changing landscape, and it is likely that these recommendations may change in the near future. (C) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Can clinicopathological factors improve the prediction of metastasis to nonsentinel lymph nodes in patients with breast cancer?
T2  - CIRUGIA Y CIRUJANOS
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: To determine whether clinicopathological characteristics can improve the prediction of metastasis to nonsentinel lymph nodes (NSLNs) over the use of only mRNA copy number in sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsies. Methods: This was a retrospective, observational study that included a total of 824 patients with T1-3 breast cancer who had clinically negative, ultrasound-negative axilla without evidence of metastasis and who underwent one-step nucleic acid amplification in SLN biop-sies. Results: 118 required a complete axillary lymph node dissection (ALNhD). About 35.6% (42/118) had metastases to a NSLN, and 64.4% (76/118) had no metastasis to a NSLN. The ROC curve of the total tumor load (TTL) presented an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.651 (95%; CI: 0.552-0.751). The 7294 copies of CK19 mRNA were established as the optimal cutoff point, with sensitivity: 93%, specificity: 63%, positive predictive value: 44%, and negative predictive value: 91%. By as-sociating the clinicopathological parameters (multicentricity, pooled immunohistochemistry [IHC], and progesterone receptors), the AUC went up to 0.752 (95% CI: 0.663-0.841). Conclusions: Clinicopathological factors should be considered together with the total CK19 mRNA copy number (the TTL) of the SLNs to improve the predictive capacity of metastatic involvement of the NSLNs.

TI  - Evapotranspiration Acquired with Remote Sensing Thermal-Based Algorithms: A State-of-the-Art Review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Almost fifty years have passed since the idea to retrieve a value for Evapotranspiration (ET) using remote sensing techniques was first considered. Numerous ET models have been proposed, validated and improved along these five decades, as the satellites and sensors onboard were enhanced. This study reviews most of the efforts in the progress towards providing a trustworthy value of ET by means of thermal remote sensing data. It starts with an in-depth reflection of the surface energy balance concept and of each of its terms, followed by the description of the approaches taken by remote sensing models to estimate ET from it in the last thirty years. This work also includes a chronological review of the modifications suggested by several researchers, as well as representative validations studies of such ET models. Present limitations of ET estimated with remote sensors onboard orbiting satellites, as well as at surface level, are raised. Current trends to face such limitations and a future perspective of the discipline are also exposed, for the reader's inspiration.

AB  - Rispana River flows through the heart of Dehradun, the capital city of Uttarakhand State, India. Uttarakhand had separated from Uttar Pradesh State in the year 2000; since then, Dehradun City has witnessed numerous changes. Both urban sprawl and densification were noticed, with around a 32% increase in population. The city had faced recurrent high runoff and urban flood situations in these last 2 decades. Therefore, the study was conducted to detect the change in land use/land cover (LULC), especially urbanization, through remote sensing data; and later to determine the impacts of such changes on the Rispana watershed hydrology. The LULC maps for the year 2003 and the 2017 were generated through supervised classification technique using the Landsat Series satellite datasets. The LULC change analysis depicted that mainly the urban settlement class increased with significant area among other classes from the year 2003-2017. It was noticed that majorly agriculture and fallow land (8.18 km(2), which is 13.52% of total watershed area) converted to urban, increasing the impervious area. Almost all the municipal wards, falling in the Rispana watershed, showed urbanization during the said period, with an increase of as high as 71%. The change in LULC or effect of urbanization on the hydrological response of the watershed was assessed using the most widely used Natural Resources Conservation Services Curve Number method. It was noticed that the area under moderated runoff potential (approx. 10.23 km(2)) steeply increased during the lean season, whereas, high runoff potential zones (5 km(2)) increased significantly under wet season. Therefore, it was concluded that an increase in impervious surface resulted in high runoff generation. Further, such LULC change along with climate might lead to high runoff within the watershed, which the present storm drainage network could not withstand. The situation generally led to urban floods and affected urban dwellers regularly. Therefore, it is critical to assess the hydrological impacts of LULC change for land use planning and water resource management. Furthermore, under the smart city project, the local government has various plans to improve present infrastructure; therefore, it becomes necessary to incorporate such observations in the policies.

TI  - A new robust discharge estimation method applied in the context of SWOT satellite data processing
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowing river discharge is vital for monitoring the fresh water cycle at the global scale. The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission will map river water surface elevations and inundated areas for rivers wider than one hundred meters worldwide. These observations can be used for estimating the river discharge. It is the global coverage which makes these observations particularly valuable, however in many cases there will be no data on the bathymetry and river bed properties available. That is why the problem of discharge estimation using solely the SWOT-type observations has received a noticeable attention recently.The attempts to solve this problem have expectedly confirmed that it is highly ill-posed and, therefore, additional data is useful. In particular, the use of the mean discharge estimates retrieved from the global scale hydrological databases (e.g. the Global Water Balance Model) have been accepted. However, taking into account the accuracy of such estimates and the issue of their relevance to the current time period, the problem is still posing a serious challenge. For example, in the results obtained by different methods reported up to date, the estimated hydrograph may suffer from a significant bias, which often makes a major contribution to the total estimation error.In this paper a new estimation method is suggested, which is specially designed to reduce the solution bias. The concept of this method is similar to the one of the Variational Expectation-Maximization method, however its perception and implementation are original and problem-oriented. In our method, the mean values of the unknown variables are obtained using the Bayesian estimator, whereas the 'shape' functions are updated using the variational data assimilation or generated directly using the inverted simplified hydraulic model. The two steps constitute an estimation cycle, which can be repeated after information exchange.The method has been validated using two available testing sets including 51 cases in total. It has demonstrated a much better robustness and reliability than the variational data assimilation method, and quite a promising performance in terms of accuracy. Since the proof of the concept was in the focus of this study, the issue of computational feasibility was not a priority. Nevertheless, the method in its current form can be applied at local/ regional or basin scales. For a possible global scale application, a generalized discharge estimator is suggested, where the major computational burden falls on the 'learning' stage, which is separated from the discharge prediction algorithm.

TI  - Mechanism of the Effect of Urban Form and Land Use on Transportation and Air Pollution in Tehran
T2  - BAGH-E NAZAR
M3  - Article
AB  - Problem statement: Air pollution is one of the major challenges of urban management in Tehran. Nowadays, the problem of air pollution and traffic congestion in the metropolis of Tehran, like most major cities in the world, is quite concerning. Land use and transportation are two main sectors that have a maximum contribution to environmental pollution.Research objective: The impetus of this article is to investigate the urban land use efficiency, the distribution of land use, and their impact on transportation and pollutants. For this purpose, the following question was raised: What has been the impact of urban land-use efficiency and distribution of land use in Tehran on transportation and air pollution over the last two decades?Research method: The present paper is a real-life case study for which data was collected through documentary-library, municipal data, and satellite images. In this study, Landsat satellite images, ENVI 5.3, ArcGIS 10.8, Google Earth Pro, and SPSS 24 were used.Conclusion: The results of this study indicate the expansion of Tehran, the loss of vegetation,and their transformation into built lands. Over the past two decades, the growth of the built-up area in Tehranhas exceeded the population growth which indicates the inefficiency of the land during this period. In other words, the expansion of the city has been more towards the suburbs with low population density. The study of the correlation between land use types during the period 2004-2016 indicates the scattered growth of Tehran. In such situations, residents use more private cars, which increases traffic congestion, fuel consumption, and air pollution.

TI  - Numerical Modeling of the Ash Cloud Movement from the Catastrophic Eruption of the Sheveluch Volcano in November 1964
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper reconstructs, for the first time, the motion dynamics of an eruptive cloud formed during the catastrophic eruption of the Sheveluch volcano in November 1964 (Volcanic Explosivity Index 4+). This became possible due to the public availability of atmospheric reanalysis data from the ERA-40 archive of the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and the development of numerical modeling of volcanic ash cloud propagation. The simulation of the eruptive cloud motion process, which was carried out using the FALL3D and PUFF models, made it possible to clarify the sequence of events of this eruption (destruction of extrusive domes in the crater and the formation of an eruptive column and pyroclastic flows), which lasted only 1 h 12 min. During the eruption, the ash cloud consisted of two parts: the main eruptive cloud that rose up to 15,000 m above sea level (a.s.l.), and the co-ignimbrite cloud that formed above the moving pyroclastic flows. The ashfall in Ust-Kamchatsk (Kamchatka) first occurred out of the eruptive cloud moving at a higher speed, then out of the co-ignimbrite cloud. In Nikolskoye (Bering Island, Commander Islands), ash fell only out of the co-ignimbrite cloud. Under the turbulent diffusion, the forefront of the main eruptive cloud rose slowly in the atmosphere and reached 16,500 m a.s.l. by 04:07 UTC on November 12. Three days after the eruption began, the eruptive cloud stretched for 3000 km over the territories of the countries of Russia, Canada, the USA, Mexico, and over both the Bering Sea and the Pacific Ocean. It is assumed that the well-known long-term decrease in the solar radiation intensity in the northern latitudes from 1963-1966, which was established according to the world remote sensing data, was associated with the spread of aerosol clouds formed not only by the Agung volcano, but those formed during the 1964 Sheveluch volcano catastrophic eruption.

TI  - Frozen section telepathology service: Efficiency and benefits of an e-health policy in South Tyrol
T2  - DIGITAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective/Background Telepathology has been widely adopted to allow intraoperative pathology examinations to be performed remotely and for obtaining second opinion teleconsultation. In the Italian northern region of South Tyrol, the widespread geographical distances and consequent cost for the health system of having a travelling pathologist cover intraoperative consultations in peripheral hospitals was a key driver for the implementation of a telepathology system. Methods In 2010, four Menarini D-Sight whole slide scanners to digitize entire pathology slides were placed in the peripheral hospitals of Merano, Bressanone, Brunico, and in the hub hospital of Bolzano. Digital workstations were also installed to allow pathologists to remotely perform intraoperative consultations with digital slides. This study reviews the outcome after 12 years of telepathology for this intended clinical use. Results After an initial validation phase with 100 cases which yielded a sensitivity of 65% (CI 43-84%) and specificity of 100% (CI 95-100%), there were 2058 intraoperative consultations handled by telepathology. The cases evaluated were mainly breast sentinel lymph nodes, followed by urological, gynecological and general surgical pathology frozen section specimens. There were no false-positive cases and 165 (8%) false-negative cases, yielding an overall sensitivity and specificity of 65% (CI 61-69%) and 100% (CI 99-100%), respectively. Conclusion Telepathology is reliable for remote intraoperative diagnosis and, despite technical issues and initial acquaintance issues, proved beneficial for patient care in satellite hospitals, improved standardization, promoted innovation, and resulted in cost savings for the health system.

TI  - Depth-Specific Soil Electrical Conductivity and NDVI Elucidate Salinity Effects on Crop Development in Reclaimed Marsh Soils
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural management decision-making in salinization-prone environments requires efficient soil salinity monitoring methods. This is the case in the B-XII irrigation district in SW Spain, a heavy clay reclaimed marsh area where a shallow saline water table and intensively irrigated agriculture create a fragile balance between salt accumulation and leaching in the root zone, which might be disrupted by the introduction of new crops and increasing climate variability. We evaluated the potential of electromagnetic induction (EMI) tomography for field-scale soil salinity assessment in this hyper-conductive environment, using EMI and limited analytical soil data measured in 2017 and 2020 under a processing tomato-cotton-sugar beet crop rotation. Salinity effects on crop development were assessed by comparing Sentinel 2 NDVI imagery with inverted depth-specific electrical conductivity (EC). Average apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) for the 1-m depth signal was 20% smaller in 2020 than in 2017, although the spatial ECa pattern was similar for both years. Inverted depth-specific EC showed a strong correlation (R approximate to 0.90) with saturated paste extract EC (ECe), [Na+] and sodium absorption ratio (SAR), resulting in linear calibration equations with R-2 approximate to 0.8 for both years and leave-one-out cross validation Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency Coefficient, ranging from 0.57 to 0.74. Overall, the chemical parameter estimation improved with depth and soil wetness (2017), yielding 0.83 < R <0.98 at 0.9 m. The observed spatial EC distributions showed a steadily increasing inverse correlation with NDVI during the growing season, particularly for processing tomato and cotton, reaching R values of -0.71 and -0.85, respectively. These results confirm the potential of EMI tomography for mapping and monitoring soil salinity in the B-XII irrigation district, while it allows, in combination with NDVI imagery, a detailed spatial assessment of soil salinity impacts on crop development throughout the growing season. Contrary to the popular belief among farmers in the area, and despite non-saline topsoil conditions, spatial EC and subsoil salinity patterns were found to affect crop development negatively in the studied field.

TI  - Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI) in the Integrated Hydrological and Fluvial Systems Modeling: Review of Current Applications and Trends
T2  - WATER
M3  - Review
AB  - This paper reviews the current GeoAI and machine learning applications in hydrological and hydraulic modeling, hydrological optimization problems, water quality modeling, and fluvial geomorphic and morphodynamic mapping. GeoAI effectively harnesses the vast amount of spatial and non-spatial data collected with the new automatic technologies. The fast development of GeoAI provides multiple methods and techniques, although it also makes comparisons between different methods challenging. Overall, selecting a particular GeoAI method depends on the application's objective, data availability, and user expertise. GeoAI has shown advantages in non-linear modeling, computational efficiency, integration of multiple data sources, high accurate prediction capability, and the unraveling of new hydrological patterns and processes. A major drawback in most GeoAI models is the adequate model setting and low physical interpretability, explainability, and model generalization. The most recent research on hydrological GeoAI has focused on integrating the physical-based models' principles with the GeoAI methods and on the progress towards autonomous prediction and forecasting systems.

TI  - Monitoring Heat Extremes across Central Europe Using Land Surface Temperature Data Records from SEVIRI/MSG
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The frequency and intensity of extreme hot events have increased worldwide, particularly over the past couple of decades. Europe has been affected by unprecedented mega heatwaves, namely the events that struck Western Europe in 2003 and Eastern Europe in 2010. The year 2018 was also reported as an unusually hot year, with record-breaking temperatures in many parts of Europe during spring and summer, associated with severe and unusual wildfires and significant crop losses in central and northern Europe. We show the ability of Land Surface Temperature (LST), retrieved from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) onboard Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) to monitor heat extremes, using the 2018 European event as a showcase. The monitoring approach relies on monthly anomalies performed as departures from the median and the monthly number of hot days (NHD), both computed for satellite LST derived from MSG and MODIS, and for 2 m air temperature (T2m) from ERA5 reanalysis, using as threshold the 90th percentiles. Results show strong monthly LST anomalies during the spring and summer of 2018 extending over central and north Europe. Over a vast region in Central and Northern Europe, LST reached the last 15 years high record. Moreover, those outstanding warm LSTs persisted for more than four months. Results obtained using MODIS LST and ERA5 T2m show similar patterns, which, although slightly less intense, corroborate the exceptionality of the heat extremes observed over central and northern Europe during 2018. The spatial pattern of the number of monthly record high anomalies over the MSG observations period clearly depicts the regions in Northern and Central Europe affected by the complex phenomena that occurred in 2018, which resulted from the combined effect of an extreme heatwave in spring and summer with extensive dry conditions. Therefore, the results highlighted the suitability of MSG LST to evaluate and monitor heat extremes alone or combined with dry and bright conditions and prompts the potential of other climate data records from geostationary satellites to characterize these climate extremes that could become the norm in the near future over central and northern Europe.

TI  - Predation on sentinel prey increases with increasing latitude in <i>Brassica</i>-dominated agroecosystems
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - In natural ecosystems, arthropod predation on herbivore prey is higher at lower latitudes, mirroring the latitudinal diversity gradient observed across many taxa. This pattern has not been systematically examined in human-dominated ecosystems, where frequent disturbances can shift the identity and abundance of local predators, altering predation rates from those observed in natural ecosystems. We investigated how latitude, biogeographical, and local ecological factors influenced arthropod predation in Brassica oleracea-dominated agroecosystems in 55 plots spread among 5 sites in the United States and 4 sites in Brazil, spanning at least 15 degrees latitude in each country. In both the United States and Brazil, arthropod predator attacks on sentinel model caterpillar prey were highest at the highest latitude studied and declined at lower latitudes. The rate of increased arthropod attacks per degree latitude was higher in the United States and the overall gradient was shifted poleward as compared to Brazil. PiecewiseSEM analysis revealed that aridity mediates the effect of latitude on arthropod predation and largely explains the differences in the intensity of the latitudinal gradient between study countries. Neither predator richness, predator density, nor predator resource availability predicted variation in predator attack rates. Only greater non-crop plant density drove greater predation rates, though this effect was weaker than the effect of aridity. We conclude that climatic factors rather than ecological community structure shape latitudinal arthropod predation patterns and that high levels of aridity in agroecosystems may dampen the ability of arthropod predators to provide herbivore control services as compared to natural ecosystems.

TI  - Geodetic SAR for Height System Unification and Sea Level Research-Results in the Baltic Sea Test Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal sea level is observed at tide gauge stations, which usually also serve as height reference stations for national networks. One of the main issues with using tide gauge data for sea level research is that only a few stations are connected to permanent GNSS stations needed to correct for vertical land motion. As a new observation technique, absolute positioning by SAR using off the shelf active radar transponders can be installed instead. SAR data for the year 2020 are collected at 12 stations in the Baltic Sea area, which are co-located to tide gauges or permanent GNSS stations. From the SAR data, 3D coordinates are estimated and jointly analyzed with GNSS data, tide gauge records and regional geoid height estimates. The obtained results are promising but also exhibit some problems related to the electronic transponders and their performance. At co-located GNSS stations, the estimated ellipsoidal heights agree in a range between about 2 and 50 cm for both observation systems. From the results, it can be identified that, most likely, variable systematic electronic instrument delays are the main reason, and that each transponder instrument needs to be calibrated individually. Nevertheless, the project provides a valuable data set, which offers the possibility of enhancing methods and procedures in order to develop a geodetic SAR positioning technique towards operability.

TI  - The impact of sampling strategy on the cloud droplet number concentration estimated from satellite data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud droplet number concentration (Nd) is of central importance to observation-based estimates of aerosol indirect effects, being used to quantify both the cloud sensitivity to aerosol and the base state of the cloud. However, the derivation of Nd from satellite data depends on a number of assumptions about the cloud and the accuracy of the retrievals of the cloud properties from which it is derived, making it prone to systematic biases.A number of sampling strategies have been proposed to address these biases by selecting the most accurate Nd retrievals in the satellite data. This work compares the impact of these strategies on the accuracy of the satellite retrieved Nd, using a selection of in situ measurements. In stratocumulus regions, the MODIS Nd retrieval is able to achieve a high precision (r(2) of 0.5-0.8). This is lower in other cloud regimes but can be increased by appropriate sampling choices. Although the Nd sampling can have significant effects on the Nd climatology, it produces only a 20 % variation in the implied radiative forcing from aerosol-cloud interactions, with the choice of aerosol proxy driving the overall uncertainty. The results are summarised into recommendations for using MODIS Nd products and appropriate sampling.

TI  - Determinants and dynamics of blowouts in Hulun Buir sandy grassland, Inner Mongolia, China from 1959 to 2018
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The formation and development of blowouts is an important surface indication of sand drift activity in the Hulun Buir sandy grassland and the main cause of landscape pattern heterogeneity. In this study, dynamic changes and determinants of blowouts in this region were studied via analysis of multi-period high-resolution remote sensing data from 1959 to 2018. The different stages of activity and dominant factors of the fixation and activation of blowouts were analysed with Lancaster's M-index. The results show that the activity of blowouts in Hulun Buir sandy grassland can be divided into three stages from 1959 to 2018: (I) growth and expansion stage, from 1959 to 2004; (II) fixation and grassland recovery stage, from 2005 to 2010; (III) redevelopment stage, from 2011 to 2018. The two geomorphic units of depressions and depositional lobes exhibit different responses to changes in climatic factors. The depositional lobes are more sensitive to the change in external factors with better feedback and their areas and numbers change with the variation of stage, while depressions exhibit relatively slow changes. The wind regime is the dominant factor explaining the variation of activity of blowouts, with precipitation and potential evapotranspiration as secondary factors for this region. Roads have little effect on the development and deformation of blowouts, but the movement of cattle and sheep across the region has a big influence. Therefore, the desertification process of Hulun Buir grassland is driven by both natural and human factors.

TI  - Classification of Heterogeneous Mining Areas Based on ResCapsNet and Gaofen-5 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover classification (LCC) of heterogeneous mining areas is important for understanding the influence of mining activities on regional geo-environments. Hyperspectral remote sensing images (HSI) provide spectral information and influence LCC. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) improve the performance of hyperspectral image classification with their powerful feature learning ability. However, if pixel-wise spectra are used as inputs to CNNs, they are ineffective in solving spatial relationships. To address the issue of insufficient spatial information in CNNs, capsule networks adopt a vector to represent position transformation information. Herein, we combine a clustering-based band selection method and residual and capsule networks to create a deep model named ResCapsNet. We tested the robustness of ResCapsNet using Gaofen-5 Imagery. The images covered two heterogeneous study areas in Wuhan City and Xinjiang Province, with spatially weakly dependent and spatially basically independent datasets, respectively. Compared with other methods, the model achieved the best performances, with averaged overall accuracies of 98.45 and 82.80% for Wuhan study area, and 92.82 and 70.88% for Xinjiang study area. Four transfer learning methods were investigated for cross-training and prediction of those two areas and achieved good results. In summary, the proposed model can effectively improve the classification accuracy of HSI in heterogeneous environments.

TI  - Residential Buildings' Real Estate Values Linked to Summer Surface Thermal Anomaly Patterns and Urban Features: A Florence (Italy) Case Study
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate-change-related extreme events impact ecosystems, people, economy, and infrastructures, with important consequences on the real estate market as well. This study aims to investigate the variation of residential buildings' real estate values in a historic Italian city in relation to the summer surface thermal anomaly pattern and urban features surrounding buildings. Open data from remote sensing products and the national database of the Revenue Agency of Italy were used. Real estate values of residential buildings were spatially analyzed in four urban belts, and the association with daytime summer surface hot- and cool-spot zones was studied through odds ratio (OR) statistic. Urban features (impervious area, tree cover, grassland area, and water body) surrounding residential buildings with different real estate values were also analyzed. Considering the whole Florentine municipality, 13.0% of residential buildings fell into hot-spot zones (only 0.6% into cool-spot ones), characterized by very low tree cover surfaces (generally <1%), most of which were in the central belt (37% of all buildings in central belt). Almost 10% of these buildings belonged to the highest market value class revealing a positive association (OR = 1.53) with hot-spot zones. This study provides useful information to plan targeted building interventions to avoid a probable decrease of the value of residential properties in high heat-related risk areas.

TI  - Study on the Forming Mechanism of the High-Density Spot of Locust Coupled with Habitat Dynamic Changes and Meteorological Conditions Based on Time-Series Remote Sensing Images
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The outbreak of the Asian migratory locust (Locusta migratoria migratoria) (AML) can deal a great blow to agriculture and grassland farming. The emergence of high-density locusts facilitates the outbreak of locusts. Understanding the forming mechanism of the high-density spot of locust (HDSL) is very important for locust monitoring and control. To achieve this goal, this paper took Nong'an County, which used to form an HDSL in 2017, as the study area. Firstly, based on the habitat classification system, support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and maximum likelihood (ML) methods were employed to explore the best classification method for locust habitats. Then, the optimal method was applied to monitor habitat dynamic changes from 2014 to 2017 in the HDSL in Nong'an. Finally, the HDSL forming mechanism was clarified coupled with habitat dynamic changes and meteorological data. The results showed that the SVM method was the optimal method, with an accuracy of 95.28%, which is higher than the RF and ML methods by 0.25% and 8.52%, respectively. The annual increased barren land and sufficient reeds provided adequate suitable habitats for the breeding of AML. From 2014 to 2016, the temperatures during the overwintering and hatching periods were higher than the 2010-2018 average, and the precipitation during the spawning period was lower than the 2010-2018 average. The precipitation during the growing period in 2017 was 30.8 mm less than the average from 2010 to 2018. All these characteristics were conducive to the reproduction of locusts. We concluded that the suitable habitat and meteorological conditions increased the locust quantity yearly, resulting in the formation of HDSL. These results are instrumental for monitoring potential high-risk outbreak areas, which is important to improve locust control and ensure food security.

TI  - An Artificial Neural Network Algorithm to Retrieve Chlorophyll a for Northwest European Shelf Seas from Top of Atmosphere Ocean Colour Reflectance
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll-a (Chl) retrieval from ocean colour remote sensing is problematic for relatively turbid coastal waters due to the impact of non-algal materials on atmospheric correction and standard Chl algorithm performance. Artificial neural networks (NNs) provide an alternative approach for retrieval of Chl from space and results for northwest European shelf seas over the 2002-2020 period are shown. The NNs operate on 15 MODIS-Aqua visible and infrared bands and are tested using bottom of atmosphere (BOA), top of atmosphere (TOA) and Rayleigh corrected TOA reflectances (RC). In each case, a NN architecture consisting of 3 layers of 15 neurons improved performance and data availability compared to current state-of-the-art algorithms used in the region. The NN operating on TOA reflectance outperformed BOA and RC versions. By operating on TOA reflectance data, the NN approach overcomes the common but difficult problem of atmospheric correction in coastal waters. Moreover, the NN provides data for regions which other algorithms often mask out for turbid water or low zenith angle flags. A distinguishing feature of the NN approach is generation of associated product uncertainties based on multiple resampling of the training data set to produce a distribution of values for each pixel, and an example is shown for a coastal time series in the North Sea. The final output of the NN approach consists of a best-estimate image based on medians for each pixel, and a second image representing uncertainty based on standard deviation for each pixel, providing pixel-specific estimates of uncertainty in the final product.

TI  - Evaluating Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 Data Consistency for High Spatiotemporal Inland and Coastal Water Quality Monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The synergy of fine-to-moderate-resolutin (i.e., 10-60 m) satellite data of the Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and the Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) provides a possibility to monitor the dynamics of sensitive aquatic systems. However, it is imperative to assess the spectral consistency of both sensors before developing new algorithms for their combined use. This study evaluates spectral consistency between OLI and MSI-A/B, mainly in terms of the top-of-atmosphere reflectance (rho(t)), Rayleigh-corrected reflectance (rho(rc)), and remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs). To check the spectral consistency under various atmospheric and aquatic conditions, near-simultaneous same-day overpass images of OLI and MSI-A/B were selected over diverse coastal and inland areas across Mainland China and Hong Kong. The results showed that spectral data obtained from OLI and MSI-A/B were consistent. The difference in the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the OLI and MSI-A products was similar to 8% in rho(t) and similar to 10% in both rho(rc) and R-rs for all the matching bands, whereas the MAPE for OLI and MSI-B was similar to 3.7% in rho(t), similar to 5.7% in rho(rc), and similar to 7.5% in R-rs for all visible bands except the ultra-blue band. Overall, the green band was the most consistent, with the lowest MAPE of <= 4.6% in all the products. The linear regression model suggested that product difference decreased significantly after band adjustment with the highest reduction rate in R-rs (NIR band) and R-rs (red band) for the OLI-MSI-A and OLI-MSI-B comparison, respectively. Further, this study discussed the combined use of OLI and MSI-A/B data for (i) time series of the total suspended solid concentrations (TSS) over coastal and inland waters; (ii) floating algae area comparison; and (iii) tracking changes in coastal floating algae (FA). Time series analysis of the TSS showed that seasonal variation was well-captured by the combined use of sensors. The analysis of the floating algae bloom area revealed that the algae area was consistent, however, the difference increases as the time difference between the same-day overpasses increases. Furthermore, tracking changes in coastal FA over two months showed that thin algal slicks (width < 500 m) can be detected with an adequate spatial resolution of the OLI and the MSI.

TI  - Incorporating Ecological Constraints into the Simulations of Tropical Urban Growth Boundaries: A Case Study of Sanya City on Hainan Island, China
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid expansion of cities in tropical regions has triggered a series of problems such as the destruction of rare natural resources and decreases in the environmental resource carrying capacity and ecological security, which seriously threaten the sustainable development of tropical cities. In this study, the city of Sanya, Hainan, China, is taken as an example. A bottom-line ecological security pattern is constructed based on the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) and the patch-generating land use simulation (PLUS) for urban growth boundary (UGB) delineation. The results show that Sanya has a good ecological background, but the overall ecological quality decreased from 2014 to 2018 due to the expansion of construction in hot spot areas. Under the natural growth scenario, the urban built-up area in Sanya in 2030 will be 73.81% greater than in 2018, mainly occupying a large amount of agricultural and ecological space, and urban expansion will not be effectively suppressed. Delineation of the UGBs combined with the ecological constraints can effectively protect the regional ecological security and control the urban sprawl, which is relatively consistent with the current planning. The results of this study demonstrate that the RSEI-PLUS-based UGB delineation perspective has a high scientific and applicability, and they provide a reference for the coordinated ecological-economic sustainable development of ecologically fragile cities in tropical areas.

TI  - Sustainable exploitation of groundwater resources considering the effects of climate change and land use to provide adaptation solutions (case study of the Hashtgerd plain)
T2  - ACTA GEOPHYSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Population growth and increasing demand for water have posed a significant challenge to access to safe water resources. Climate change and land use in the not-too-distant future add to the complexity of this challenge. Therefore, it is essential to achieve reliable methods for predicting changes in aquifer storage to plan for the sustainable use of groundwater resources. This study aimed to investigate the management, protection, and sustainable use of groundwater resources under climate change and land use change conditions. In this regard, groundwater supply and demand in one of the important plains in Iran (Hashtgerd plain) for 2020 as the base year was simulated to forecast the trends until 2050 by considering climate change and land use to develop management scenarios to adapt to these conditions using the WEAP model. First, climate change prediction was performed using the HadGEM2-ES model under two emission scenarios, RCP2.6, and RCP8.5, of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report. The LARS-WG model was used to downscale the climatic data, while land use mapping was performed using Landsat satellite images of 1990, 2005, and 2020 in ENVI 5.3 software. Then, the Markov chain method implemented in TerrSet software was used to model land use change for 2050. The effect of climate change and land use on the decrease of groundwater level was then simulated using the MODFLOW model for the period 2020-2050. In order to manage the water allocation in the area, the information obtained from MODFLOW was transferred to the WEAP model using Link Kitchen interface software. The effects of various management scenarios such as increasing irrigation efficiency, reducing the loss of drinking water distribution networks, and allocating water from the transmission line were evaluated on the adaptation to climate change and land use for a 30-year period. The results showed that with the simultaneous consideration of climate change and land use in the most critical state, the average drop in groundwater level would reach 58 m during the study period, and aquifer reserves will be reduced by more than 50%. The evaluation of management scenarios showed that their implementation not only will protect aquifer reserves but, in addition to meeting 100% of the water needs, will result in sustainable exploitation of groundwater resources.

TI  - Fusion Information Multi-View Classification Method for Remote Sensing Cloud Detection
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, many studies have been carried out to detect clouds on remote sensing images. Due to the complex terrain, the variety of clouds, the density, and content of clouds are various, and the current model has difficulty accurately detecting the cloud in the image. In our strategy, a multi-view data training set based on super pixel is constructed. View A uses multi-level network to extract the boundary, texture, and deep abstract feature of super pixels. View B is the statistical feature of the three channels of the image. Privilege information View P contains the cloud content of super pixels and the tag status of adjacent super pixels. Finally, we propose a cloud detection method for remote sensing image classification based on multi-view support vector machine (SVM). The proposed method is tested on images of different terrain and cloud distribution in GF-1_WHU and Cloud-38 remote sensing datasets. Visual performance and quantitative analysis show that the method has excellent cloud detection performance.

TI  - Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy for Metaplastic Breast Cancer: Response Rates, Management, and Outcomes
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has not been well studied for metaplastic breast cancer (MBC), a rare but aggressive type of breast cancer. The National Cancer Database was queried (2004-2017) for females with histologically-confirmed cM0 MBC who received NAC and definitive surgery with a pathologic staging record. Of 903 MBC patients, 88 (9.8%) experienced a pathologic complete response (pCR). The 5 year OS difference amongst MBC patients between pCR vs. RCB1-3 was significant (93 vs. 63%, P < .001). There was no difference observed between MpBC with pCR and non-MpBC invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) with pCR (93 vs. 93%), with pCR ( P > .05 for all molecular subtypes). This study confirms that response rates of MBC to NAC are low, with pCR being relatively infrequent. However, early-stage MBC may be more likely to achieve pCR. Introduction: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for breast cance has not been well studied for metaplastic breast cancer (MBC), a rare but aggressive type of breast cancer. Materials and Methods: The National Cancer Database was queried (2004-2017) for females with cM0 MBC who received NAC and definitive surgery with a pathologic staging record. Statistics included Kaplan-Meier overall survival (OS) analysis, multivariable logistic regression, and Cox proportional hazards modeling. Results: Of 903 MBC patients, 88 (9.8%) experienced a pathologic complete response (pCR). The vast majority of ypT0 cases were initially cT1-2. On multivariable logistic regression, cT1 disease was a single factor that was associated with pCR. The majority of patients with MBC undergoing pCR still underwent mastectomy (62.5%) and sentinel node biopsy (67.1%). Axillary dissection was more common in non-pCR cases (49.3% vs. 29.6%, P = .001). The 5 year OS difference amongst MBC patients between pCR vs. RCB1-3 was significant (93 vs. 63%, P < .001). There was no difference observed between MpBC with pCR and non-MpBC invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) with pCR (93 vs. 93%), with pCR ( P > .05 for all molecular subtypes). Conclusion: This study confirms that response rates of MBC to NAC are low, with pCR being relatively infrequent. However, early-stage MBC may be more likely to achieve pCR. These findings combined with emerging research on identifying favorable histopathologic subtypes of MBC may better elucidate subsets with higher proclivity for pCR, especially because these patients achieve satisfactory survival, comparable to that of IDC with pCR.

TI  - The formation of an open atoll in strike slip-fault setting: new insight from Maratua Island, Kalimantan-Indonesia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims at reconstructing the mechanism explaining the formation of the V-shaped open atoll of Maratua Island. The reconstruction was conducted by examining the landforms, lithology, and geological structure of the region. We first examined the island through ALOS, SRTM image and using an oblique aerial photograph taken using a drone. Then, a field survey was conducted to identify the detailed morphological features, lithology, and structure of the area. The results reveal that the island has developed into seven different landforms, namely, karst ridge, undulated karst hills, structural valley, marine terrace, beach, fringing reef, and sand cays. The sinistral fault system is the major factor that controlled the Maratua Island's formation, wherein the island is a push-up morphology of the fault that formed a carbonate high. Accordingly, the atoll formation seems to be an inheritance of eroded rollover anticline of Pliocene carbonate or older and continuing to the present time. The open atoll is caused by the southern block's downward movement resulting from an oblique subsidiary sinistral fault mechanism. The research findings unveil new mechanism of atoll formation in the strike-slip fault setting that enrich the previous models.

TI  - Control of Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
T2  - ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN THORACIC SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rationale: Cardiovascular disease accounts for one-third of deaths in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Better control of cardiovascular risk factors in primary care could improve outcomes.Objectives: To define the prevalence, monitoring, treatment, and control of risk factors in patients with COPD.Methods: Repeated cross-sectional analysis of primary care electronic medical records for all patients with COPD in the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network from 2013 to 2018 (n=32,695 in 2018). A control group was matched 1:1 for age, sex, and rural residence = 32,638 in 2018). Five risk factors were defined using validated definitions including laboratory results: hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, obesity, and smoking.Results: All risk factors were more common in patients with COPD compared with matched control subjects, including hypertension (52.3% vs. 44.9%), dyslipidemia (62.0% vs. 57.8% diabetes 25.0% vs. 20.2%), obesity (40.8% vs. 36.8%), and smoking (40.9% vs. 11.4%), respectively. The mean Framingham risk score was 20.6% versus 18.6%, with 53.8% of patients with COPD being high risk (..?-20%). Monitoring of risk factors within the last year in patients with COPD in 2018 was suboptimal: 71.8% hypertension, 39.4% dyslipidemia, 74.5% diabetes, 52.3% obesity. Smoking status was infrequently recorded in the electronic record. In those monitored, guideline recommended targets were achieved in 60.8%, 46.6%, 57.4%, 10.6% and 12.0% for each risk factor. Cardiovascular therapies including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (69%), statins (69%), and smoking cessation therapies (27%) were underused.Conclusions: In patients with COPD, major cardiovascular risk factors are common, yet inadequately monitored, undertreated, and poorly controlled. Strategies are needed to improve comprehensive risk factor management proven to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Land Subsidence in Beijing Plain Based on InSAR and PCA
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the 1970s, uneven ground subsidence caused by groundwater overdraft and uneven thickness of compressible layers has gradually developed into one of the most serious geological hazards in Beijing Plain. There are few research reports on the temporal and spatial analysis of land subsidence in the latest period in Beijing Plain. Therefore, this paper used SBAS-InSAR technology to obtain the ground deformation data of the Beijing Plain from May 2017 to May 2020 based on 39 Sentinel-1A spectral images acquired by active microwaves. The principal component analysis method was used to analyse land subsidence's temporal and spatial characteristics in the Beijing Plain. In the SBAS-InSAR technology processing, the time baseline was set to 120 days, and the threshold of the space baseline was set to 45% of the maximum normal baseline, and 154 interference pairs were generated, and then all interference pairs were registered and interfered. After the interference, the results were flattened, Goldstein flattening for filtering, generated coherence coefficient and used minimum cost flow algorithm for phase unwrapping. The 73 high-quality interference pairs were screened for orbit refinement and re-leveling to estimate and remove the residual phase. The atmospheric phase was removed through temporal high-pass filtering and spatial low-pass filtering. Finally, the least-squares method and singular value decomposition were used to obtain land subsidence data of the Beijing Plain from May 2017 to May 2020. During the monitoring period, the maximum average deformation rate was 114. 9 mm " yr, and the maximum cumulative subsidence was 345. 9 mm. which was located in Chaoyang Jinzhan. Compared with 2018, the ranges where the settlement rate of the central plain decreased by exceeding 50 mm " yr in 2019 in the Haidian District, Changping district, but the settlement rate range of Daxing District was gradually increasing. It analysed the land subsidence of the Beijing Plain by using the principal component analysis method. It was concluded that the first three principal components explained 99. 110 0 of the data characteristics. The first principal component explained 96. 48% of the characteristics, reflecting the longterm and unrecoverable process of groundwater subsidence caused by long-term groundwater extraction. However, the replenishment of groundwater by the South Water entering Beijing slowed down the settlement rate in the central plain. The second principal component explained the 2. 11 Yo feature, highlighting the interannual settlement process, which was related to factors such as the thickness of the compressible layer and the type of land use; The third principal component explained 0. 52% of the characteristics of the data set and emphasized the seasonal elastic deformation regulated by rainfall. The research results of this paper can provide a certain scientific basis for the comprehensive management of land subsidence in the Beijing Plain.

TI  - Designing Optimal Recommended Budgeting Thresholds for a Medicaid Program
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MANAGED CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To develop and test a methodology for optimally setting automatic auditing thresholds to minimize administrative costs without encouraging overall budget growth in a state Medicaid program. STUDY DESIGN: Two-stage optimization using administrative Maryland Medicaid plan-of-service data from fiscal year (FY) 2019. METHODS: In the first stage, we use an unsupervised machine learning method to regroup acuity levels so that plans of service with similar spending profiles are grouped together. Then, using these regroupings, we employ numerical optimization to estimate the recommended budget levels that could minimize the number of audits across those groupings. We simulate the effects of this proposed methodology on FY 2019 plans of service and compare the resulting number of simulated audits with actual experience. RESULTS: Using optimal regrouping and numerical optimization, this method could reduce the number of audits by 10.4% to 36.7% relative to the status quo, depending on the search space parameters. This reduction is a result of resetting recommended budget levels across acuity groupings, with no anticipated increase in the total recommended budget amount across plans of service. These reductions are driven, in general, by an increase in recommended budget level for acuity groupings with low variance in plan-of-service spending and a reduction in recommended budget level for acuity groupings with high variance in plan-of-service spending. CONCLUSIONS: Using machine learning and optimization methods, it is possible to design recommended budget thresholds that could lead to significant reductions in administrative burden without encouraging overall cost growth.

TI  - Combining Multispectral and Radar Imagery with Machine Learning Techniques to Map Intertidal Habitats for Migratory Shorebirds
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Migratory shorebirds are notable consumers of benthic invertebrates on intertidal sediments. The distribution and abundance of shorebirds will strongly depend on their prey and on landscape and sediment features such as mud and surface water content, topography, and the presence of ecosystem engineers. An understanding of shorebird distribution and ecology thus requires knowledge of the various habitat types which may be distinguished in intertidal areas. Here, we combine Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery and a digital elevation model (DEM), using machine learning techniques to map intertidal habitat types of importance to migratory shorebirds and their benthic prey. We do this on the third most important non-breeding area for migratory shorebirds in the East Atlantic Flyway, in the Bijagos Archipelago in West Africa. Using pixel-level random forests, we successfully mapped rocks, shell beds, and macroalgae and distinguished between areas of bare sediment and areas occupied by fiddler crabs, an ecosystem engineer that promotes significant bioturbation on intertidal flats. We also classified two sediment types (sandy and mixed) within the bare sediment and fiddler crab areas, according to their mud content. The overall classification accuracy was 82%, and the Kappa Coefficient was 73%. The most important predictors were elevation, the Sentinel-2-derived water and moisture indexes, and Sentinel-1 VH band. The association of Sentinel-2 with Sentinel-1 and a DEM produced the best results compared to the models without these variables. This map provides an overall picture of the composition of the intertidal habitats in a site of international importance for migratory shorebirds. Most of the intertidal flats of the Bijagos Archipelago are covered by bare sandy sediments (59%), and ca. 22% is occupied by fiddler crabs. This likely has significant implications for the spatial arrangement of the shorebird and benthic invertebrate communities due to the ecosystem engineering by the fiddler crabs, which promotes two vastly different intertidal species assemblages. This large-scale mapping provides an important product for the future monitoring of this high biodiversity area, particularly for ecological research related to the distribution and feeding ecology of the shorebirds and their prey. Such information is key from a conservation and management perspective. By delivering a successful and comprehensive mapping workflow, we contribute to the filling of the current knowledge gap on the application of remote sensing and machine learning techniques within intertidal areas, which are among the most challenging environments to map using remote sensing techniques.

TI  - Quantifying the ecosystem service value dynamics in response to land use and land cover changes in Michoacan, Mexico
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To quantify the variation in the ecosystem service values (ESV) in response to land use and land cover changes in the Lake Patzcuaro watershed, the third largest lake in Mexico, Landsat images from the period 1986-2022 were analyzed and a benefits transfer method was used. Forest class and agricultural soils were the dominant covers occupying an average of 42% and 25% of the study area, respectively. The most evident change was a reduction of 2550 ha of the Lake Patzcuaro surface. Further, with the natural vegetation increasing gradually due to the abandonment of agricultural lands, the ESV also increased from 279.1 to 302.0 million dollars from 1986-2022. These results suggest a positive influence on the protection of natural environments, and although it was not evaluated here but given the lake area reduction, they highlight the need to avoid detrimental actions that affect the biota inhabiting it.

TI  - Turning the Tide on Mapping Marginal Mangroves with Multi-Dimensional Space-Time Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves are a globally important ecosystem experiencing significant anthropogenic and climate impacts. Two subtypes of mangrove are particularly vulnerable to climate-induced impacts (1): tidally submerged forests and (2) those that occur in arid and semi-arid regions. These mangroves are either susceptible to sea level rise or occur in conditions close to their physiological limits of temperature and freshwater availability. The spatial extent and impacts on these mangroves are poorly documented, because they have structural and environmental characteristics that affect their ability to be detected with remote sensing models. For example, tidally submerged mangroves occur in areas with large tidal ranges, which limits their visibility at high tide, and arid mangroves have sparse canopy cover and a shorter stature that occur in fringing and narrow stands parallel to the coastline. This study introduced the multi-dimensional space-time randomForest method (MSTRF) that increases the detectability of these mangroves and applies this on the North-west Australian coastline where both mangrove types are prevalent. MSTRF identified an optimal four-year period that produced the most accurate model (Accuracy of 80%, Kappa value 0.61). This model was able to detect an additional 32% (76,048 hectares) of mangroves that were previously undocumented in other datasets. We detected more mangrove cover using this timeseries combination of annual median composite Landsat images derived from scenes across the whole tidal cycle but also over climatic cycles such as ENSO. The median composite images displayed less spectral differences in mangroves in the intertidal and arid zones compared to individual scenes where water was present during the tidal cycle or where the chlorophyll reflectance was low during hot and dry periods. We found that the MNDWI (Modified Normalised Water Index) and GCVI (Green Chlorophyll Vegetation Index) were the best predictors for deriving the mangrove layer using randomForest.

TI  - Analysis of synergies between Urban Heat Island and Heat Waves using Sentinel-3 images over the city of Granada
T2  - REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the synergies between the Urban Heat Island (ICU) phenomenon and one of the extreme climatic events such as heat waves has become one of the great challenges of society that seeks to improve the quality of life. In this research, the Terrestrial Surface Temperature (TST) and the Urban Surface Heat Island (ICUS) have been determined using Sentinel-3 images of the city of Granada (Spain) during the months of July and August of the years 2019 and 2020. The purpose is to determine the possible synergies between both phenomena in an area classified as highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Using the Data Panel statistical analysis method, multivariate relationships were obtained during the heat wave periods. The results obtained, in line with previous research, indicate that TST and ICUS are intensified under heat wave conditions (Daytime: TST=2.2 degrees C and ICUS=0.2 degrees C; Nighttime: TST=4.4 degrees C and ICUS= 0.3 degrees C) and there are relationships between ICUS and wind direction and solar radiation that intensify in periods of heat wave.

TI  - Delineation of Eastern Beaufort Sea Sub-regions Using Self-Organizing Maps Applied to 17 Years of MODIS-Aqua Data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite observations are an integral component of long-term Arctic Ocean monitoring and help identifying changes resulting from climate warming. A Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) approach was applied to four-day composite satellite images of the Eastern Beaufort Sea (EBS) acquired by the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer over the period 2003-2019. Using sea-surface temperature (SST), suspended particulate matter concentration (SPM) and chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) as input the EBS was partitioned into six biogeochemical regions. The SOM approach revealed region-specific mean conditions and seasonal cycles for all properties, particularly for SPM and Chl-a. Three of the six regions, located on the continental shelf, had the highest SST, SPM and Chl-a with earlier maxima compared to the remaining three regions which comprised the shelf edge, Canada Basin and Amundsen Gulf. While mean and maximum SST did not exhibit significant trends over the 17 years of observations, the annual maximum SST in Amundsen Gulf was reached significantly earlier in recent years compared to the start of the time series. With the exception of Amundsen Gulf, sea-ice concentration (SIC) derived from microwave satellites declined throughout the study area; monthly trends showed dramatic SIC declines in regions on the shelf during May and June, and in Canada Basin during August. Correlation analysis of properties within and between regions showed that SST and SIC were driven by large scale processes while SPM and Chl-a showed regional features. SST and Chl-a in the regions nearest the Mackenzie River showed a strong relationship during seasonal warming. The SOM approach, applied to 17 years of satellite data, revealed spatially distinct marine units with unique characteristics, emphasizing the need for regional considerations when assessing the impact of climate warming in the Arctic Ocean.

TI  - More than a safety net: Ethiopia?s flagship public works program increases tree cover
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - More than one billion people worldwide receive cash or in-kind transfers from social protection programs. In low-income countries, these transfers are often conditioned on participation in labor-intensive public works to rehabilitate local infrastructure or natural resources. Despite their popularity, the environmental impacts of public works programs remain largely undocumented. We quantify the impact on tree cover of Ethiopia's Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP), one of the world's largest and longest-running public works programs, using satellite-based data of tree cover combined with difference-in-differences and inverse probability treatment weighting methodologies. We find that the PSNP increased tree cover by 3.8% between 2005 and 2019, with larger increases in less densely populated areas and on steep-sloped terrain. As increasing tree cover is considered an important strategy to mitigate global warming, our results suggest a win-win potential for social safety net programs with an environmental component.

TI  - Statistical analysis for determination of homogeneous reflectance regions in a coastal lagoon using satellite imagery and bathymetry survey
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal lagoons are highly productive ecosystems that offer a range of natural services for the environment and society. However, anthropic pressure in their basins cause water quality loss and endangers their ecosystem. Monitoring water quality constituent by remote sensing can provide spatial and high temporal resolution analysis. Not recognizing how depth influences on the signal received by a sensor causes on significant errors in estimating water constituent's concentrations. Using a bathymetry survey and Landsat-5 thematic mapper (TM) images, different patterns of depth influence on reflectance were recognized. By means of a statistical analysis, it was able to classify and analyze three different regions of homogeneous spectral behavior for the closest image from the bathymetric survey and for a median image from 2001 to 2011. Nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test and Dunn's post hoc test provided great values in differentiating all groups generated for the coastal lagoon to both closest and median image. The methodology proposed here, being based on statistical methods, can be applied with the use of other images to assist studies in coastal lagoons across the globe.

TI  - Improving Satellite Retrieval of Coastal Aquaculture Pond by Adding Water Quality Parameters
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal aquaculture is an important supply of animal proteins for human consumption, which is expanding globally. Meanwhile, extensive aquaculture may increase nutrient loadings and environmental concerns along the coast. Accurate information on aquaculture pond location is essential for coastal management. Traditional methods use morphological parameters to characterize the geometry of surface waters to differentiate artificially constructed conventional aquaculture ponds from other water bodies. However, there are other water bodies with similar morphology (e.g., saltworks, rice fields, and small reservoirs) that are difficult to distinguish from aquaculture ponds, causing a lot of omission/commissioning errors in areas with complex land-use types. Here, we develop an extraction method with shape and water quality parameters to map aquaculture ponds, including three steps: (1) Sharpen normalized difference water index to detect and binarize water pixels by the Otsu method; (2) Connect independent water pixels into water objects through the four-neighbor connectivity algorithm; and (3) Calculate the shape features and water quality features of water objects and input them into the classifier for supervised classification. We selected eight sites along the coast of China to evaluate the accuracy and generalization of our method in an environment with heterogeneous pond morphology and landscape. The results showed that six transfer characteristics including water quality characteristics improved the accuracy of distinguishing aquaculture ponds from salt pans, rice fields, and wetland parks, which typically had F1 scores > 85%. Our method significantly improved extraction efficiency on average, especially when aquaculture ponds are mixed with other morphological similar water bodies. Our identified area was in agreement with statistics data of 12 coastal provinces in China. In addition, our approach can effectively improve water objects when high-resolution remote sensing images are unavailable. This work was applied to open-source remote sensing imagery and has the potential to extract long-term series and large-scale aquaculture ponds globally.

TI  - Spatial Resolution and Data Integrity Enhancement of Microwave Radiometer Measurements Using Total Variation Deconvolution and Bilateral Fusion Technique
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Passive multi-frequency microwave sensors are indispensable instruments for worldwide environmental monitoring. However, they often suffer from the issues of poor spatial resolution and the original land-sea transition zone data are contaminated severely. Conventional analytical deconvolution methods enhance the spatial resolution at the expense of noise amplification and Gibbs fluctuations in the land-sea transition zone. In order to enhance the spatial resolution as well as simultaneously enhance the integrity of the Microwave Radiometer data, a method based on Total Variation deconvolution, Bilateral Filter, and data fusion (TVBF+) is proposed. Our method substantially improves data integrity and obtains similar enhanced resolution compared to existing methods. Experiments performed using both simulated and actual microwave radiation Imager (MWRI) data demonstrate the method's robustness and effectiveness.

M3  - Article
AB  - The Pearl River Delta Urban Agglomeration ( PRDUA) is a highly urbanized region in China. The urbanized climate, especially the heat island effect, has a significant impact on urban ecosystems and habitats. Based on MODIS land surface temperature ( LST) data and land cover data in 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2019, we quantified the land surface thermal environment and ecosystem service value ( ESV), analyzed the decoupling between LST and ESV in the PRDUA from 2000 to 2019 using the decoupling analysis model, revealed the trade-off between them, and analyzed the spatiotemporal variation of the synergistic state between LST and ESV in PRDUA. The results showed that, from 2000 to 2019, the spatial pattern of land surface thermal environment in the PRDUA was relatively stable in time series but showed spatial variation with high fluctuation in the core area and low fluctuation in the peripheral area. The ESV of the PRDUA showed a trend of stable spatial distribution and decreasing in time series. The ESV of all the nine cities in PRDUA decreased by more than 9%. The decoupling between land surface thermal environment and the overall ESV of the PRDUA, as well as with the values of provisioning, regulating and support services, was dominated by weak negative decoupling and strong negative decoupling, showing a more significant trade-off, which indicated that the ecosystems of the PRDUA were still significantly influenced by the environmental characteristics of urbanization, and that the spatiotemporal variation of the decoupling states was related to the spatial variation of urbanization levels in PRDUA. The formulation of future ecological policies in the PRDUA must consider the differences in urbanization levels and the differences in the trade. offs between urbanized environments and ecosystems to precisely formulate ecological control and restoration plans and improve the efficiency and implementation effects of ecological planning.

T2  - TRANSLATIONAL CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Background: Breast cancer is the leading cancer-related deaths among women. Although great progress has been made in clinical surgical treatment, it is still urgently needed to look for a treatment model with smaller wounds, lower damage, and a better prognosis. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a minimally invasive technique for breast cancer treatment, which can correctly assess the patients' condition, prognosis, and treatment response. Methods: We performed a PubMed-based bibliometric analysis to investigate publication trends of SLNB in breast cancer and determined the annual distribution of annual publication numbers, countries, authors, languages, journals, and high-frequency major Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms.Results: The results showed that the literature on SLNB in breast cancer has shown an upward trend, and stabilized with the most English literature in the past decade at least. The United States was the country with the most publications from 2010 to 2019. M Ahemd was the first-author who had published the most documents related to SLNB in breast cancer since 2010. The most high-frequency main MeSH words were breast neoplasms/pathology, breast neoplasms/surgery and SLNB.Conclusions: Through bicluster analysis, we divided the related articles of SLNB in breast cancer field from 2010 to 2019 into 4 clusters. Among them, indications for SLNB in breast cancer and detection of lymph node metastases and tracking methods for SLNB were considered to be current research hotspots, while assessment of axillary lymph nodes in neoadjuvant chemotherapy and application of SLNB was a potential hotspot.

TI  - Machine Learning-Based Approach Using Open Data to Estimate PM<sub>2.5</sub> over Europe
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Air pollution is currently considered one of the most serious problems facing humans. Fine particulate matter with a diameter smaller than 2.5 micrometres (PM2.5) is a very harmful air pollutant that is linked with many diseases. In this study, we created a machine learning-based scheme to estimate PM2.5 using various open data such as satellite remote sensing, meteorological data, and land variables to increase the limited spatial coverage provided by ground-monitors. A space-time extremely randomised trees model was used to estimate PM2.5 concentrations over Europe, this model achieved good results with an out-of-sample cross-validated R-2 of 0.69, RMSE of 5 mu g/m(3), and MAE of 3.3 mu g/m(3). The outcome of this study is a daily full coverage PM2.5 dataset with 1 km spatial resolution for the three-year period of 2018-2020. We found that air quality improved throughout the study period over all countries in Europe. In addition, we compared PM2.5 levels during the COVID-19 lockdown during the months March-June with the average of the previous 4 months and the following 4 months. We found that this lockdown had a positive effect on air quality in most parts of the study area except for the United Kingdom, Ireland, north of France, and south of Italy. This is the first study that depends only on open data and covers the whole of Europe with high spatial and temporal resolutions. The reconstructed dataset will be published under free and open license and can be used in future air quality studies.

TI  - Analysis of mangrove distribution using satellite images in Rembau River, Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Malaysia has been recognized as a country with the greatest diversity of mangrove species. In this study, the mangrove forest at Rembau River, Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia was classified using multispectral SPOT 5 image. The mangrove vegetation species was identified using texture analysis, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index was also utilized to identify vegetation densities in the mangrove area. Classification approach was implemented using Maximum Likelihood Classifier. Eight classes of mangrove species were found within the study site which includes Sonneratia caseolaris, Nypa fruticans Bruguiera gymnorhiza, Xylocarpus granatum, Cerbera odollam, Sonneratia alba, Thespesia populnea and Rhizophora apiculata. The results showed that the highest per pixel classification accuracy (84.81%) for SPOT 5 image was using NIR band with a 9 x 9 window size. The upstream riverside area was dominated by Sonneratia caseolaris whereas Rhizhopora apiculata were dominant at downstream of the river. Dense vegetation dominates the overall mangrove forest of this study area. However, Sonneratia caseolaris and Nypa fruticans were found in low dense vegetation area. This endangers the firefly habitat. The results suggest preserving mangrove ecosystems to support firefly tourist operations. The findings of this research will benefit in monitoring and conservation of the mangrove habitats for the firefly population. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Simplified Marsh Response Model (SMRM): A Methodological Approach to Quantify the Evolution of Salt Marshes in a Sea-Level Rise Context
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes are highly valued coastal environments for different services: coastline protection, biodiversity, and blue carbon. They are vulnerable to climate changes, particularly to sea-level rise. For this reason, it is essential to project the evolution of marsh areas until the end of the century. This work presents a reduced complexity model to quantify salt marshes' evolution in a sea-level rise (SLR) context through combining field and remote sensing data: SMRM (Simplified Marsh Response Model). SMRM is a two-dimensional rule-based model that requires four parameters: a digital terrain model (DTM), local tidal levels, a sea-level rise projection, and accretion rates. A MATLAB script completes the process, and the output is a GeoTIFF file. Two test areas were selected in Troia sandspit (Setubal, Portugal). Additionally, a sensitivity analysis for each parameter's influence and a comparison with SLAMM (another rule-based model) were undertaken. The sensitivity analysis indicates that SLR is the most relevant parameter, followed by accretion rates. The comparison of SMRM with SLAMM shows quite similar results for both models. This new model application indicates that the studied salt marshes could be resilient to conservative sea-level rise scenarios but not to more severe sea-level rise projections.

TI  - <i>Tinkuy</i> of the Word and the Image: Aesthetic Migration and Imaginary View in the Andean Neo-avant-gard
T2  - LITERATURA-TEORIA HISTORIA CRITICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study is to analyze the existence of an Andean neo-avant-garde in the Peruvian poetry, that could be characterized as the continuity and extension of the aesthetic and literary proposals as well as the worldview developed by the Andean avant-garde throughout the 192os in Puno. From our point of view, in the works of poets as Jose Luis Ayala, Niel Palomino, and Washington Cordova Huamin, we observed a primacy of the visual imagination and the visual and tactile forms of writing of the Andean culture. For this reason, we propose that in the works of these poets, an aesthetic migration takes place, where the image and the poetry confront each other in an experimental form of writing.

TI  - VICAL: Global Calculator to Estimate Vegetation Indices for Agricultural Areas with Landsat and Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The vegetation indices (VIs) estimated from remotely sensed data are simple and based on effective algorithms for quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the dynamics of biophysical crop variables such as vegetation cover, leaf area, vigor and development, and many others. Over the last decade, many VIs have been proposed and validated to enhance the vegetation signal by reducing the noise from effects produced either by the soil or by vegetation such as brightness, shadows, color, etc. VIs are commonly calculated from satellite images such as ones from Landsat and Sentinel-2 because of their medium resolution and free availability. However, despite the VIs being fairly simple algorithms, it can take hours to calculate them for an established agricultural area, mainly due to the pre-processing of the images (including atmospheric corrections, the detection of clouds and shadows), size and download time of the images, and the capacity of the computer equipment used. Time increases as the number of images increases. In this sense, the free to use Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform was here used to develop an application called VICAL to calculate 23 VIs map (VIs commonly used in agricultural applications) and time series of any agricultural area in the world with images (cloud-free) from Landsat and Sentinel-2 data. It was found that VICAL can calculate these 23 VIs accurately, and shows the potential of the GEE cloud-based tools using multispectral dataset to assess many spectral VIs. This tool is very beneficial for researchers with poor access to satellite data or in institutions with a lack of computational infrastructure to handle the large volumes of satellite datasets, since it is not necessary for the user writing a single line of code. The VICAL is open-access image analysis platform that can be modified to carry out more complex analysis or adapt it to a specific VI application.

T2  - HEALTH PROMOTION AND CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTION IN CANADA-RESEARCH POLICY AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Consumption of cocaine can lead to numerous injuries and poisoning. However, only a limited number of studies have explored cocaine-related injuries. This study examined a wide range of injuries and poisonings related to cocaine only and in combination with other substances in Canada using sentinel surveillance data captured by the electronic Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program (eCHIRPP).Methods: Injuries and poisonings related to the use of cocaine only or in combination with other substances were identified in the eCHIRPP database between January 2012 and December 2019 for all ages. Descriptive analyses were performed to investigate the distribution of demographic and injury characteristics in poisoning and injury records related to the use of cocaine only and in combination with other substances. Statistical analyses were conducted to find the proportion of cocaine-related injuries per 100 000 eCHIRPP records. Cocaine-related injury trends were assessed using annual percent change (APC).Results: Cocaine-related injuries and poisonings were observed in 123 records per 100 000 eCHIRPP records. Of the 1482 patients who presented to emergency departments of CHIRPP sites with this type of injury or poisoning, the majority involved cocaine use in combination with one or more substances (80.0%; n = 1186), whereas cocaine-only use was the minority (20.0%; n = 296). Among all cocaine-related records, poisoning was the leading diagnosis (62.7%; n = 930) and most injuries and poisonings were unintentional (73.5%; n = 1090). Overall, the trend of cocaine-related eCHIRPP records for all age groups increased over the study period from 2012 to 2019 (APC [total] = 47.8%, p < 0.05).Conclusion: Our findings of a higher proportion of cocaine-related injuries and poisonings among adolescents and young adults, as well as the co-consumption of cocaine with other substances, demonstrate the importance of extensive surveillance of cocainerelated injuries and poisonings and the implementation of evidence-based public health interventions.

TI  - An Unusual Large Size Ductal Carcinoma In Situ In A Patient On Lithium Therapy: A Case Report With Literature Review.
T2  - Journal of Ayub Medical College, Abbottabad : JAMC
M3  - Review
M3  - Case Reports
AB  - Background: Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is the earliest and most curable form of breast cancer. Patients who harbour this disease for quite some time usually have micro invasion by virtue of high-grade disease or big size. Herein, we report a case of 56-year-old postmenopausal woman presenting with a one-year history of blood-stained nipple discharge from right breast. She was a known case of depression receiving oral anti-depressants containing lithium for 20 years. Her mammogram was performed followed by ultrasound breast. Mammogram identified suspicious clusters of micro calcifications hence subjected to stereotactic core biopsy which revealed two separate foci of high-grade DCIS. Therefore, based on her clinical, radiological, and pathological findings she was subjected to mastectomy and sentinel node biopsy. Final histopathology showed big DCIS (10*8*3 cm in size) with immunohistochemical stains confirmed no invasive focus on extensive sampling. Therefore, we postulated that it might be correlated to the use of Lithium which has anti-cancer properties.

TI  - Creation and Implementation of a New Sentinel Surveillance Model in Pharmacy Offices in Southern Europe
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditionally, health sentinel networks have focused on the reporting of data by primary care physicians and hospitals, ignoring the role of the community pharmacist as an expert in drugs. The objective of this study was to describe a method for creating a network of sentinel pharmacies in a region of Southern Europe in order to have a pharmaceutical surveillance system that is representative of the territory to be monitored and that can respond to any events or incidents that can be followed up by the community pharmacy. The creation process was carried out in three phases: a first phase of selection through a cluster and population analysis and a final adjustment, a second phase of voluntariness and random selection, and a third phase of training and implementation of the network. A sentinel network of 75 community pharmacies has been established in Catalonia. The network monitors 2.47% of the total population with a homogeneous proportion of urban (42), rural (30), and mountain-area (3) pharmacies based on the particular characteristics of the territory. This model allows increased surveillance in the territory, objectively and representatively detects problems arising from the use of medicines, and establishes improvement strategies of public health.

TI  - Endometrial Carcinoma Molecular Subtype Correlates With the Presence of Lymph Node Metastases
T2  - OBSTETRICAL & GYNECOLOGICAL SURVEY
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Endometrial cancer (EC) continues to increase in incidence and mortality globally and represents the most common gynecologic cancer in North America. Approximately 22% of patients with stage 1 EC have extrauterine disease, most commonly in pelvic and/or para-aortic lymph nodes. Although studies have demonstrated lymphadenectomy has no therapeutic role, lymph node dissection remains standard practice in many institutions because of its role in prognostication and guiding the use of adjuvant therapy. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has become a valuable diagnostic technique; however, there remains controversy over which EC patients should be offered nodal assessment and what factors should guide this decision. Histotype and cancer grade can be determined preoperatively as a risk assessment for lymph node metastasis (LNM); however, results are poorly reproducible among expert pathologists. The Proactive Molecular Risk Classifier for Endometrial Cancer (ProMisE), a clinically validated immunohistochemistry (IHC) tool, can assign EC to 1 of 4 molecular subtypes: POLEmut, MMRd, p53abn, and NSMP (no specific molecular profile). These classifications have a stronger prognostic significance than histopathological features and are highly reproducible when performed on endometrial biopsy.

TI  - Analysis of Interannual and Seasonal Nearshore Bar Behaviour Observed from Decadal Optical Satellite Data in the Curonian Spit, Baltic Sea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term observations of nearshore bar behaviour are a vital component of coastal monitoring, management, and prediction. Optical satellite remote sensing enables the possibility of such observations over large spatial areas, but its full potential remains unexploited. This study assessed alongshore variability in cross-shore nearshore bar behaviour on a wave-dominated multi-bar coast of the Curonian Spit (south-eastern Baltic Sea) between 2011 and 2021, using satellite-derived bar data. Nearshore bars were extracted from a time series of PlanetScope and RapidEye satellite images with an automated GIS-based algorithm, previously proposed by the study authors. The cross-shore behaviour of a multiple bar system was analysed by adapting traditional bathymetry-based analysis techniques to satellite-derived data that included bar crestlines and images of multi-scale Relative Bathymetric Position Index (RBPI). The analysis was performed on 1071 shore-perpendicular transects. Multi-bar onshore and offshore migration rates were quantified on interannual and seasonal timescales. The results show that, on an interannual timescale, bars migrated offshore at rates up to 9.7 m/month, while the rates of onshore migration reached up to 11 m/month. During the months of low wave energy, bars moved offshore at rates up to 6.2 m/month, and during the months of high wave energy, up to 12.9 m/month. However onshore migration rates, during the months of low and high wave energy, reached up to 7.0 and 13.4 m/month, respectively. A complex empirical orthogonal function (CEOF) analysis was performed on RBPI-derived cross-shore profiles, and cyclic offshore directed bar behaviour was examined. For the first time, the net offshore migration (NOM) cycle with bar cycle return periods of 1.8 to 13.5 years was investigated on the south-eastern Baltic Sea coast. Bar cycle return periods increased and rates of bar cross-shore migration decreased from north to south along the Curonian Spit. Similar nearshore bar behaviour regions were identified using clustering analysis based on quantified temporal and morphological characteristics of the bars. Factors controlling alongshore variability in bar cross-shore behaviour were determined. The study results suggest that small alongshore variations in nearshore hydrodynamics, caused by the local wave climate and its interplay with the shoreline orientation, determine the morphological and temporal variability of the multi-bar system in the Curonian Spit.

TI  - Demand for Ecosystem Services Drive Large-Scale Shifts in Land-Use in Tropical Mountainous Watersheds Prone to Landslides
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An increasing frequency of extreme atmospheric events is challenging our basic knowledge about the resilience mechanisms that mediate the response of small mountainous watersheds (SMW) to landslides, including production of water-derived ecosystem services (WES). We hypothesized that the demand for WES increases the connectivity between lowland and upland regions, and decreases the heterogeneity of SMW. Focusing on four watersheds in the Central Andes of Colombia and combining "site-specific knowledge", historic land cover maps (1970s and 1980s), and open, analysis-ready remotely sensed data (GLAD Landsat ARD; 1990-2000), we addressed three questions. Over roughly 120 years, the site-specific data revealed an increasing demand for diverse WES, as well as variation among the watersheds in the supply of WES. At watershed-scales, variation in the water balances-a surrogate for water-derived ES flows-exhibited complex relationships with forest cover. Fractional forest cover (p(i)) and forest aggregation (AI(i)) varied between the historic and current data sets, but in general showed non-linear relationships with elevation and slope. In the current data set (1990-2000), differences in the number of significant, linear models explaining variation in p(i) with time, suggest that slope may play a more important role than elevation in land cover change. We found ample evidence for a combined effect of slope and elevation on the two land cover metrics, which would be consistent with strategies directed to mitigate site-specific landslide-associated risks. Overall, our work shows strong feedbacks between lowland and upland areas, raising questions about the sustainable production of WES.

M3  - Article
AB  - This paper shows the work carried out to obtain a methodology capable of monitoring the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) aid line for the protection of steppe birds, which aims to improve the feeding and breeding conditions of these species and contribute to the improvement of their overall biodiversity population. Two methodologies were initially defined, one based on remote sensing (BirdsEO) and the other on Machine Learning (BirdsML). Both use Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data as a basis. BirdsEO encountered certain impediments caused by the land's slope and the crop's height. Finally, the methodology based on Machine Learning offered the best results. It evaluated the performance of up to 7 different Machine Learning classifiers, the most optimal being RandomForest. Fourteen different datasets were generated, and the results they offered were evaluated, the most optimal being the one with more than 150 features, including a time series of 8 elements with Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 data and derived products, among others. The generated model provided values higher than 97% in metrics such as accuracy, recall and Area under the ROC Curve, and 95% in precision and recall. The methodology is transformed into a tool that continuously monitors 100% of the area requesting aid, continuously over time, which contributes positively to optimizing the use of administrative resources and a fairer distribution of CAP funds.

TI  - A Near Real-Time and Free Tool for the Preliminary Mapping of Active Lava Flows during Volcanic Crises: The Case of Hotspot Subaerial Eruptions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the evolution of lava flows is a challenging task for volcano observatories, especially in remote volcanic areas. Here we present a near real-time (every 12 h) and free tool for producing interactive thermal maps of the advance of lava flows over time by taking advantage of the free thermal data provided by FIRMS and the open-source R software. To achieve this, we applied two filters on the FIRMS datasets, one on the satellite layout (track) and another on the fire radiative power (FRP). To determine the latter, we carried out a detailed statistical analysis of the FRP values of nine hotspot subaerial eruptions that included Cumbre Vieja-2021 (Spain), Fagradalsfjall-2021 (Iceland), LERZ Kilauea-2018 (USA), and six eruptions on the Galapagos Archipelago (Ecuador). We found that an FRP filter of 35 +/- 17 MW/pixel worked well at the onset and during the first weeks of an eruption. Afterward, once the cumulative statistical parameters had stabilized, a filter that better fit the investigated case could be obtained by running our statistical code. Using the suggested filters, the thermal maps resulting from our mapping code have an accuracy higher than 75% on average when compared with the official lava flow maps of each eruption and an offset of only 3% regarding the maximum lava flow extension. Therefore, our easy-to-use codes constitute an additional, novel, and simple tool for rapid preliminary mapping of lava fields during crises, especially when regular overflights and/or unoccupied aerial vehicle campaigns are out of budget.

TI  - Vegetation Monitoring for Mountainous Regions Using a New Integrated Topographic Correction (ITC) of the SCS plus C Correction and the Shadow-Eliminated Vegetation Index
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The mountainous vegetation is important to regional sustainable development. However, the topographic effect is the main obstacle to the monitoring of mountainous vegetation using remote sensing. Aiming to retrieve the reflectance of frequently-used red-green-blue and near-infrared (NIR) wavebands of rugged mountains for vegetation mapping, we developed a new integrated topographic correction (ITC) using the SCS + C correction and the shadow-eliminated vegetation index. The ITC procedure consists of image processing, data training, and shadow correction and uses a random forest machine learning algorithm. Our study using the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) multi-spectral images in Fujian province, China, showed that the ITC achieved high performance in topographic correction of regional mountains and in transferability from the sunny area of a scene to the shadow area of three scenes. The ITC-corrected multi-spectral image with an NIR-red-green composite exhibited flat features with impressions of relief and topographic shadow removed. The linear regression of corrected waveband reflectance vs. the cosine of the solar incidence angle showed an inclination that nearly reached the horizontal, and the coefficient of determination decreased to 0.00 similar to 0.01. The absolute relative errors of the cast shadow and the self-shadow all dramatically decreased to the range of 0.30-6.37%. In addition, the achieved detection rate of regional vegetation coverage for the three cities of Fuzhou, Putian, and Xiamen using the ITC-corrected images was 0.92-6.14% higher than that using the surface reflectance images and showed a positive relationship with the regional topographic factors, e.g., the elevation and slope. The ITC-corrected multi-spectral images are beneficial for monitoring regional mountainous vegetation. Future improvements can focus on the use of the ITC in higher-resolution imaging.

TI  - Sea Ice-Water Classification of RADARSAT-2 Imagery Based on Residual Neural Networks (ResNet) with Regional Pooling
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea ice mapping plays an integral role in ship navigation and meteorological modeling in the polar regions. Numerous published studies in sea ice classification using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) have reported high classification rates. However, many of these focus on numerical results based on sample points and ignore the quality of the inferred sea ice maps. We have designed and implemented a novel SAR sea ice classification algorithm where the spatial context, obtained by the unsupervised IRGS segmentation algorithm, is integrated with texture features extracted by a residual neural network (ResNet) and, using regional pooling, classifies ice and water. This algorithm is trained and tested on a published dataset and cross-validated using leave-one-out (LOO) strategy, obtaining an overall accuracy of 99.67% and outperforming several existing algorithms. In addition, visual results show that this new method produces sea ice maps with natural ice-water boundaries and fewer ice and water errors.

TI  - Aseismic Fault Slip During a Shallow Normal-Faulting Seismic Swarm Constrained Using a Physically Informed Geodetic Inversion Method
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Improved imaging of the spatio-temporal growth of fault slip is crucial for understanding the driving mechanisms of earthquakes and faulting. This is especially critical to properly evaluate the evolution of seismic swarms and earthquake precursory phenomena. Fault slip inversion is an ill-posed problem and hence regularization is required to obtain stable and interpretable solutions. An analysis of compiled finite fault slip models shows that slip distributions can be approximated with a generic elliptical shape, particularly well for M <= 7.5 events. Therefore, we introduce a new physically informed regularization to constrain the spatial pattern of slip distribution. Our approach adapts a crack model derived from mechanical laboratory experiments and allows for complex slipping patterns by stacking multiple cracks. The new inversion method successfully recovered different simulated time-dependent patterns of slip propagation, that is, crack-like and pulse-like ruptures, directly using wrapped satellite radar interferometry (InSAR) phase observations. We find that the new method reduces model parameter space, and favors simpler interpretable spatio-temporal fault slip distributions. We apply the proposed method to the 2011 March-September normal-faulting seismic swarm at Hawthorne (Nevada, USA), by computing ENVISAT and RADARSAT-2 interferograms to estimate the spatio-temporal evolution of fault slip distribution. The results show that (a) aseismic slip might play a significant role during the initial stage and (b) this shallow seismic swarm had slip rates consistent with those of slow earthquake processes. The proposed method will be useful in retrieving time-dependent fault slip evolution and is expected to be widely applicable to studying fault mechanics, particularly in slow earthquakes.

TI  - Remote Sensing Monitoring of Ecological-Economic Impacts in the Belt and Road Initiatives Mining Project: A Case Study in Sino Iron and Taldybulak Levoberezhny
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Under the Belt and Road Initiatives, China's overseas cooperation in constructing mining projects has developed rapidly. The development and utilization of mining resources are essential requirements for socio-economic development. At the same time, the ecological impacts of the exploitation and utilization of mining resources have increasingly aroused the widespread concern of the international community. This paper uses Landsat images, high-resolution images, and nighttime light (NTL) data to remotely monitor Sino Iron in Australia and Taldybulak Levoberezhny in Kyrgyzstan in different development periods to provide a reference for the rational development of mineral resources and environmental management. The results show that the Chinese enterprises have achieved good results in the ecological protection of the mining area during the construction period. The development of the mine has caused minor damage to the surrounding environment and has not destroyed the local natural ecological pattern. The different NTL indices show an overall rising trend, indicating that the construction of mines has dramatically promoted the socio-economic development of countries along the Belt and Road in both time and space. Therefore, relevant departments should practice green development in overseas projects, establish a scientific mine governance system, and promote a win-win economic growth and environmental governance situation.

TI  - Susceptibility Analysis of Land Subsidence along the Transmission Line in the Salt Lake Area Based on Remote Sensing Interpretation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As the influence of extreme climate and human engineering activities intensifies, land subsidence frequently occurs in the Salt Lake area of Qinghai Province, China, which seriously threatens the stability of the UHV transmission line crossing the area. Current susceptibility analyses of land subsidence disasters have mostly focused on the classification of land subsidence susceptibility and have ignored the differentiation of susceptibility among different land subsidence intensities. Therefore, the land subsidence susceptibility map does not meet the operation and maintenance management needs of the UHV transmission line, let alone planning and designing of new lines in the Salt Lake area. Therefore, in this study, we proposed a susceptibility analysis of different land subsidence intensities along the transmission line in the Salt Lake area. The small baseline integrated aperture radar interferometry (SBAS-InSAR) method was used to obtain the land subsidence along the transmission line based on 67 Sentinel-1 remote sensing interpretation datasets from 2017 to 2021. Based on a combination of K-means clustering and the transmission line specifications, four annual land subsidence intensity grades were identified as 0 similar to-2 mm/year, -2 similar to-10 mm/year, -10 similar to-20 mm/year, and <-20 mm/year. In addition, eight geological environmental factors were analyzed, and a multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) model was used to calculate the susceptibility of the different land subsidence intensities. The area under the curve (AUC) and practical examples were used to verify the reliability of the different land subsidence intensities susceptibility mapping. The AUC values of the four subsidence intensity grades showed that the results were accurate: the <-20 mm/year grade produced the largest AUC (0.951), with the -10 similar to-20 mm/year, -2 similar to-10 mm/year and 0 similar to-2 mm/year grades producing AUCs of 0.926, 0.812, 0.879, respectively. At the same time, the susceptibility classification results of different land subsidence intensities were consistent with the interpretation and site tower deformation. The results of this study provided the distribution of land subsidence susceptibility along the transmission line, distinguished the susceptibility of different land subsidence intensities, and provided more detailed subsidence information for each transmission tower. The results provide important information for transmission line tower planning, design, protection, and operation management.

TI  - Aerosol Characteristics during the COVID-19 Lockdown in China: Optical Properties, Vertical Distribution, and Potential Source
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The concentration changes of aerosols have attracted wide-ranging attention during the COVID-19 lockdown (CLD) period, but the studies involving aerosol optical properties (AOPs) are relatively insufficient, mainly AOD (fine-mode AOD (AODf) and coarse-mode AOD (AODc)), aerosol absorption optical depth (AAOD), and aerosol extinction coefficient (AEC). Here, the remote-sensing observations, Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) products, backward-trajectory, and potential-source-contribution models are used to assess the impact of AOPs, vertical distribution, and possible sources on the atmosphere environment in North China Plain (NCP), Central China (CC), Yangtze River Delta (YRD), Pearl River Delta (PRD), and Sichuan Basin (SB) during the CLD period. The results demonstrate that both AOD (MODIS) and near-surface AEC (CALIPSO, <2 km) decreased in most areas of China. Compared with previous years (average 2017-2019), the AOD (AEC) of NCP, CC, YRD, PRD, and SB reduced by 3.33% (10.76%), 14.36% (32.48%), 10.80% (29.64%), 31.44% (22.68%), and 15.50% (8.44%), respectively. In addition, MODIS (AODc) and MERRA-2 (AODc) decreased in the five study areas compared with previous years, so the reduction in dust activities also contributed to improving regional air quality during the epidemic. Despite the reduction of anthropogenic emissions (AODf) in most areas of China during the CLD periods, severe haze events (AODf > 0.6) still occurred in some areas. Compared to previous years, there were increases in BC, OC (MERRA-2), and national raw coal consumption during CLD. Therefore, emissions from some key sectors (raw coal heating, thermal power generation, and residential coal) did not decrease, and this may have increased AODf during the CLD. Based on backward -rajectory and potential source contribution models, the study area was mainly influenced by local anthropogenic emissions, but some areas were also influenced by northwestern dust, Southeast Asian biomass burning, and marine aerosol transport. This paper underscores the importance of emissions from the residential sector and thermal power plants for atmospheric pollution in China and suggests that these sources must be taken into account in developing pollution-mitigation plans.

TI  - On Angels, Demons, and Ghosts: Is Justified Belief in Spiritual Entities Possible?
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Belief in the existence of spiritual entities is an integral part of many people's religious worldview. Angels appear, demons possess, ghosts haunt. But is belief that such entities exist justified? If not, are there conditions in which it would be? I will begin by showing why, once one clearly understands how to infer the best explanation, it is obvious that neither stories nor personal encounters can provide sufficient evidence to justify belief in spiritual entities. After responding to objections to similar arguments I have published in the past, I will go on to show that there is at least an imaginable circumstance in which belief in spiritual entities would be justified but then point out that it is not reasonable to think that such conditions will ever be met. In short, if such entities were real, it would be theoretically possible to demonstrate their existence scientifically, and in doing so, one could make belief in their existence justified. But doing so would require and entail a scientific revolution equivalent to proving that the Earth is flat.

TI  - JPSS VIIRS SST Reanalysis Version 3
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The 3rd full-mission reanalysis (RAN3) of global sea surface temperature (SST) with a 750 m resolution at nadir is available from VIIRS instruments flown onboard two JPSS satellites: NPP (February 2012-present) and N20 (January 2018-present). Two SSTs, 'subskin' (sensitive to skin SST) and 'depth' (proxy for in situ SST at depth of 20 cm), were produced from brightness temperatures (BTs) in the VIIRS bands centered at 8.6, 11 and 12 mu m during the daytime and an additional 3.7 mu m band at night, using the NOAA Advanced Clear Sky Processor for Ocean (ACSPO) enterprise SST system. The RAN3 dataset is fully archived at NASA JPL PO.DAAC and NOAA CoastWatch, and routinely supplemented in near real time (NRT) with a latency of a few hours. Delayed mode (DM) processing with a 2 months latency follows NRT, resulting in a more uniform science quality SST record. This paper documents and evaluates the performance of the VIIRS RAN3 dataset. Comparisons with in situ SSTs from drifters and tropical moorings (D+TM) as well as Argo floats (AFs) (both available from the NOAA iQuam system) show good agreement, generally within the NOAA specifications for accuracy (+/- 0.2 K) and precision (0.6 K), in a clear-sky domain covering 18-20% of the global ocean. The nighttime SSTs compare with in situ data more closely, as expected due to the reduced diurnal thermocline. The daytime SSTs are also generally within NOAA specs but show some differences between the (D+TM) and AF validations as well as residual drift on the order of -0.1 K/decade. BT comparisons between two VIIRSs and MODIS-Aqua show good consistency in the 3.7 and 12 mu m bands. The 11 mu m band, while consistent between NPP and N20, shows residual drift with respect to MODIS-Aqua. Similar analyses of the 8.6 mu m band are inconclusive, as the performance of the MODIS band 29 centered at 8.6 mu m is degraded and unstable in time and cannot be used for comparisons.

AB  - Luke constructs the world through a geographic description and invites his audience into a spatial image through the textual world. Here hyperbole plays an important role as an impressionistic way of projecting such an image of the world in the minds of his audience. Through hyperbole, Luke conveys his own image of the world, that is, a mental picture of the world as he wants it to be-a world reigned over by God. In this way, Lukan hyperbole functions as an important literary device through which we can discover his theological preoccupations and emphases.

TI  - Urban Heat Island and Thermal Comfort Assessment in a Medium-Sized Mediterranean City
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the greatest issues nowadays is that of the urban heat island effect on the thermal conditions inside cities. The air temperature inside the city core is warmer than that in suburbs, thus deteriorating the quality of life for citizens and making outdoor spaces uncomfortable in terms of thermal comfort. This phenomenon is usually assessed in large scale cities worldwide and less often in medium-sized towns. The current study aimed to investigate the urban heat island effect and, therefore, to assess the outdoor thermal comfort conditions in a medium-sized city. More specifically, the methodology of the current study includes: (i) the combination of different monitoring techniques to quantify the urban heat island effect in a medium-sized Mediterranean city. Both in situ measurements and remote sensing techniques were applied to assess the urban heat island effect in terms of both the canopy layer (CUHI) and the surface (SUHI); (ii) the identification of the parameters that affect thermal comfort and the identification of the most appropriate bioclimatic indices that determine outdoor thermal comfort in the city of interest. Both questionnaire survey and in situ measurements took place on a sidewalk in the city of Xanthi, Northern Greece, during the summer. The CUHI effect was obvious, especially in the morning and afternoon. Downscaled MODIS satellite images also showed that the intensity of SUHI was higher in the morning and afternoon. Apart from air temperature, important differences in the values of most microclimatic parameters were recorded between the meteorological station placed inside the urban area and those gathered from a nearby meteorological station. The narrow roads, the thermal properties of construction materials, and the absence of greenery characterized the area of interest and may be the key factors creating these differences in climate. Concerning the thermal comfort assessment, the most significant parameters were the air temperature and solar radiation, although, both empirical and direct indices were found to describe the comfort values well. According to the results, downscaling techniques are also important for the SUHI effect to be investigating in detail in medium-sized urban environments.

TI  - Potential of Sentinel-2 MSI data in targeting rare earth element (Nd3+) bearing minerals in Esfordi phosphate deposit, Iran
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Modern-day devices, transport, and green energy require growing supply of rare earth elements (REEs), which subsequently provide the basics for attempts on developing the efficient and innovative methods for their detection and exploration. Remote sensing data / techniques provide great possibilities to quick and non destructive exploration of such deposits, even in relatively unreachable and socially sensitive places. The diagnostic absorption features of REEs are generated in the visible to shortwave infrared (VNIR-SWIR) region of the electromagnetic spectrum, among which, the most prominent absorption fea-tures of neodymium (Nd), which could be a key pathfinder for REEs, are displayed in the VNIR region. This study assesses the capability of the Sentinel-2 MSI data for detecting absorption feature of Nd from space. This process was successfully examined and verified in the Esfordi phosphate deposit, Central Iran, and resulted the direct mapping of REE (Nd). For this purpose, firstly, the potential of the Sentinel-2 MSI data for detecting REEs was theoretically evaluated, and then, the adaptive coherence estimator (ACE) algo-rithm was applied for targeting Nd-bearing zones, using the field spectra of apatite as reference. Field works, X-ray diffraction (XRD), spectroscopy, and the geochemical analyses supported the achievements. The results demonstrated that Sentinel-2 MSI can capably detect the 740 nm absorption band of Nd. Generally, this research attained high overall accuracy of 88.64% for the generated map using in situ col-lected data for verification. (c) 2022 National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science.

TI  - Assessing Machine Learning-Based Prediction under Different Agricultural Practices for Digital Mapping of Soil Organic Carbon and Available Phosphorus
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Predicting soil chemical properties such as soil organic carbon (SOC) and available phosphorus (Ava-P) content is critical in areas where different land uses exist. The distribution of SOC and Ava-P is influenced by both natural and anthropogenic factors. This study aimed at (1) predicting SOC and Ava-P in a piedmont plain of Northeast Iran using the Random Forests (RF) and Cubist mathematical models and hybrid models (Regression Kriging), (2) comparing the models' results, and (3) identifying the key variables that influence the spatial dynamics of soil SOC and Ava-P under different agricultural practices. The machine learning models were trained with 201 composite surface soil samples and 24 ancillary data, including climate (C), organism (O), topography- relief (R), parent material (P) and key soil features (S) according to the SCORPAN digital soil mapping framework, which can predictively represent soil formation factors spatially. Clay, one of the most critical soil properties with a well-known relationship to SOC, was the most important predictor of SOC, followed by open-access multispectral satellite images-based vegetation and soil indices. Ava-P had a similar set of effective variables. Hybrid approaches did not improve model accuracy significantly, but they did reduce map uncertainty. In the validation set, Ava-P was calculated using the RF algorithm with a normalized root mean square (NRMSE) of 96.8, while SOC was calculated using the Cubist algorithm with an NRMSE of 94.2. These values did not change when using the hybrid technique for Ava-P; however, they changed just by 1% for SOC. The management of SOC content and the supply of Ava-P in agricultural activities can be guided by SOC and Ava-P digital distribution maps. Produced digital maps in which the soil scientist plays an active role can be used to identify areas where concentrations are high and need to be protected, where uncertainty is high and sampling is required for further monitoring.

TI  - Analysis of Land Use and Land Cover Changes through the Lens of SDGs in Semarang, Indonesia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land Use and Land Cover Changes (LULCC) are occurring rapidly around the globe, particularly in developing island nations. We use the lens of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) to determine potential policies to address LULCC due to increasing population, suburbia, and rubber plantations in Semarang, Indonesia between 2006 and 2015. Using remote sensing, overlay analysis, optimized hot spot analysis, expert validation, and Continuous Change Detection and Classification, we found that there was a spread of urban landscapes towards the southern and western portions of Semarang that had previously been occupied by forests, plantations, agriculture, and aquaculture. We also witnessed a transition in farming from agriculture to rubber plantations, a cash crop. The implications of this study show that these geospatial analyses and big data can be used to characterize the SDGs, the complex interplay of these goals, and potentially alleviate some of the conflicts between disparate SDGs. We recommend certain policies that can assist in preserving the terrestrial ecosystem of Semarang (SDG 15) while creating a sustainable city (SDG 11, SDG 9) and providing sufficient work for individuals (SDG 1) in a growing economy (SDG 8) while simultaneously maintaining a sufficient food supply (SDG 2).

AB  - Purpose: Evaluation of fluorescein along with blue dye as an affordable tracer for sentinel node biopsy in comparison with technetium + methylene blue. A randomized trial was conducted with the following objectives: (1) to demonstrate that the identification of sentinel lymph node by fluorescein + methylene blue is not inferior to the identification by Tc-99 m sulfur colloid + methylene blue and (2) to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of sentinel node biopsy by above two tracers. Subjects and Methods: One-thirty patients above age 18 years presenting with early breast cancer T1, T2, N0 breast carcinoma were randomized to undergo sentinel node biopsy by either fluorescein + methylene blue or Tc-99 m sulfur colloid + methylene blue. Results: The sentinel lymph nodes were identified in 89% in Fluorescein + methylene blue group and 90.9% with Tc-99 m sulfur colloid + methylene blue group. The trial demonstrated noninferiority of fluorescein + methylene blue as compared to isotope + methylene blue with effect size = 1; 95% confidence interval- 9.54 to + 11.54. The fluorescein + methylene blue was more cost-effective than isotope guided sentinel node biopsy. Conclusion: Fluorescein-guided sentinel node biopsy is noninferior and more cost-effective than isotope-guided sentinel node biopsy.

TI  - A systematic review on hyperspectral imaging technology with a machine and deep learning methodology for agricultural applications
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Review
AB  - The globe's population is increasing day by day, which causes the severe problem of organic food for everyone. Farmers are becoming progressively conscious of the need to control numerous essential factors such as crop health, water or fertilizer use, and harmful diseases in the field. However, it is challenging to monitor agricultural activities. Therefore, precision agriculture is an important decision support system for food production and decision-making. Several methods and approaches have been used to support precision agricultural practices. The present study performs a systematic literature review on hyperspectral imaging technology and the most advanced deep learning and machine learning algorithm used in agriculture applications to extract and synthesize the significant datasets and algorithms. We reviewed legal studies carefully, highlighted hyperspectral datasets, focused on the most methods used for hyperspectral applications in agricultural sectors, and gained insight into the critical problems and challenges in the hyperspectral data processing. According to our study, it has been found that the Hyperion hyperspectral, Landsat-8, and Sentinel 2 multispectral datasets were mainly used for agricultural applications. The most applied machine learning method was support vector machine and random forest. In addition, the deep learning-based Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) model is mainly used for crop classification due to its high performance with hyperspectral datasets. The present review will be helpful to the new researchers working in the field of hyperspectral remote sensing for agricultural applications with a machine and deep learning methods.

TI  - Groundwater in the Arab region: making the invisible visible
T2  - DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 14th Water-Sciences-and-Technology-Association (WSTA) Gulf Water Conference - Water in the GCC... Towards Economic Efficiency and Financial Sustainability
CL  - Riyadh, SAUDI ARABIA
AB  - The Arab region is one of the most water scarce regions in the world with 19 states below the water scarcity threshold including 13 states below the absolute water scarcity. Groundwater is heavily relied upon and it is the primary source of freshwater in more than 11 Arab States, yet the invisible and complex character of groundwater being underground and out of sight has not given it the due attention it deserves. Hence, this report explores the importance of groundwater and the challenges it is facing, with the aim of bolstering its status to a strategic resource for the Arab region. Amid the water scarcity situation, limited renewable groundwater resources continue to be exploited at an unsustainable rate, exceeding the natural recharge rates. Excessive use of groundwater, especially by the agricultural sector combined with low efficiency, has led to the decline in groundwater storage in more than two thirds of the Arab region, where the area of decline has doubled in 2018-2019 compared to 2002. In some countries over 88% of all irrigation water comes from groundwater compared to a global average of just over 37%. Moreover, it is projected that by 2050, available groundwater per capita will have decreased by more than half since the beginning of the century and 17 Arab States, accounting for 79% of the total population, will be below the absolute water scarcity threshold. In addition to their excessive use, groundwater resources are also threatened by anthropo-genic pollution sources, from agricultural and industrial practices and from sea water intrusion in coastal cities. The deterioration in the quality of groundwater resources, both due to overexploita-tion and pollution is aggravating the problem of water scarcity. For example, in Beirut, seawater intrusion has shifted inland between 500 and 1,200 m from 1970 reference point. In Gaza, only 25% of wastewater is treated due the lack of proper wastewater collection and treatment infrastructure, which is further complicated by the occupation that has restricted access to natural resources. This is alarming knowing that groundwater is central to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and targets adopted in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in the region. It is directly linked to SDG6 and central to achieving many other SDGs such as SDG2 for ending hunger. It is also an important component of climate change adaptation, having a high buffer capacity against drought. Accordingly, the projected impacts of climate change on water resources in the region, will further increase dependency on groundwater at a time when groundwater recharge is also projected to decrease, necessitating conjunctive management of surface water and groundwater. The impacts of climate change on groundwater at the aquifer level is showcased by ESCWA on the Beni-Amir aquifer, Morocco and the Eocene aquifer, Palestine. Results from the study on Beni-Amir aquifer indicate that the water table is expected to decrease 10 to 25 m (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively) by end of century, resulting in partial depletion of resources in the top three layers of the aquifer system, particularly in the northern Beni-Amir area. In the case of Palestine, the results on the Eocene aquifer showed that in the 2041-2060 horizon, the average precipitation is expected to decrease in all scenarios between 3% and 12%, whereas the recharge in 5 out of 6 precipitation scenarios showed a reduction by 12%-16%. Consequently, with no decrease in the aquifer pumping, the water levels in all scenarios will drop.The declining availability of groundwater resources due to increased consumption, develop-ment demands, inefficient use and climate change should prompt Arab States to explore innova-tive and integrated governance frameworks to improve groundwater resources management and ensure equitable access for current and future generations to this strategic resource. Groundwater governance has been historically weak in the Arab region, characterized by fragmented legislations and policies, limited funding, lack of coordination and lack of data and knowledge. More recent evaluation of the management of groundwater resources through the SDG indicator 6.5.1 report-ing mechanisms on the degree of implementation of IWRM has unfortunately reinforced some of the main challenges listed above in the Arab region mainly in terms of lack of implementation of management tools and proper financing. In response to the lack or fragmentation of groundwater management policies, ESCWA developed regional groundwater abstraction management guidelines offering a unified approach to deal with uncontrolled groundwater exploitation and use. Groundwater governance is further complicated by transboundary aquifers. In fact, all coun-tries, except for Comoros, share at least one aquifer with their neighboring countries. These trans-boundary aquifers cover almost 58% of the Arab region's total area. Some of these aquifers are directly connected to surface-water hydrological systems and should also be conjunctively man-aged. Other transboundary aquifers contain fossil groundwater reserves requiring specialized legal, policy and management frameworks that consider their non-renewable character. The status of regional transboundary water cooperation is captured in a recent regional report prepared by ESCWA on the progress on SDG indicator 6.5.2 in the Arab region for the year 2021. The report revealed the challenges faced by the Arab states that hinder the establishment of well-developed cooper-ation frameworks which are mainly linked to lack of knowledge and data exchange and financial constraints. However, there are encouraging signs where cooperation on transboundary aquifers has progressed, including a Joint Authority for the Nubian sandstone Aquifer, a cooperation framework for the Senegalo-Mauritanian Aquifer, a signed agreement for the Saq-Ram Aquifer, and a consulta-tion mechanism on the North Western Sahar Aquifer System. These cooperation agreements should be maintained and further developed by holding regular meetings, coordinating objectives and management plans, and regularly exchanging data and information. Regional knowledge exchange around these agreements should be enforced. Advances in technologies provide an opportunity to fill the data and information gap that hin-ders the management of groundwater. Integrated remote sensing data offer a solution to assess the groundwater status. In addition, Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) is one of the most important solutions to consider for securing water supply and for improving groundwater quality where it is deteriorating. MAR is already used in more than 44 sites across the Arab region. Technologies can assist in selection of where MAR can be a potential solution for the region and for improving the water security. Furthermore, in response to the need for availing more data and information on groundwater and improving access to such data as established through the reporting on SDG indicators 6.5.1 and 6.5.2, ESCWA will be initiating an Arab Groundwater Digital Knowledge Platform.This platform aims to increase access to regional knowledge and information on groundwater resources through a dedicated digital interactive platform. Finally, the relation of groundwater to water scarcity, human activity, transboundary water cooperation, climate change, and water governance is highlighted in the following key findings.

TI  - Modeling Spatial Distribution of Carbon Sequestration, CO<sub>2</sub> Absorption, and O<sub>2</sub> Production in an Urban Area: Integrating Ground-Based Data, Remote Sensing Technique, and GWR Model
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The main purpose of this research is to model the spatial distribution of carbon sequestration, CO2 absorption, and oxygen production by trees within Isfahan city, Iran, in 2020. To quantify carbon sequestration, we accessed a sample group of trees with measured biophysical attributes. First, we calculated the biomass and carbon sequestration of a tree using the allometric and photosynthesis equations. Then, to model the spatial distribution of carbon sequestration, we used geographic weighted regression (GWR) method. In this model, the amount of calculated carbon sequestration was the dependent variable, whereas the difference between vegetation indexes of Excess Green Plant Index minus Excess Red Plant Index (Delta ExGR) from the Worldview image was the independent variable. Subsequently, the spatial distribution map of CO2 absorption and oxygen production was generated. The total value of annual carbon sequestration, CO2 absorption, and O-2 production was about 7704.22, 28274.502, and 20570.16 tons, respectively. The results showed that there was a strong correlation between the Delta ExGR index of the canopy with calculated carbon. Integrating the Delta ExGR index from a high-resolution image with calculated carbon can contribute to developing a fast, accurate, and low-cost method in estimating carbon sequestration and modeling its spatial distribution in urban areas. In conclusion, the results of this research can be implemented by land-use planners to integrate urban ecosystem service concept (i.e., carbon sequestration) in planning process toward sustainability of the cities.

TI  - Comparison of Heart and Lung Doses According to Tumor Bed Boost Techniques in Early-Stage Left-Sided Breast Cancer: Simultaneous Integrated Boost versus Sequential Boost
T2  - MEDICINA-LITHUANIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Objectives: The boost dose to the tumor bed after whole breast irradiation (WBI) can be divided into sequential boost (SEQ) and simultaneous integrated boost (SIB). SIB using modern radiation therapy (RT) techniques, such as volumetric modulated arc therapy, allow the delivery of a highly conformal dose to the target volume and has a salient ability to spare at-risk organs. This study aimed to compare the radiation dose delivered to the heart and lungs according to boost technique and tumor bed location. Materials and Methods: RT planning data of 20 patients with early-stage left-sided breast cancer were used in this study. All patients were treated with volumetric modulated arc therapy after breast-conserving surgery with a sentinel lymph node biopsy. For each patient, two different plans, whole breast irradiation with simultaneous integrated boost (WBI-SIB) and sequential boost after WBI (WBI-SEQ), were generated. To compare the dose received by each organ at risk (OAR), dose-volume histogram data were analyzed. The mean dose (D-mean) and volume of each organ that received x Gy (Vx) were calculated and compared. Results: For the heart, the V10 was lower for the WBI-SIB plan than for the WBI-SEQ plan (5.223 +/- 1.947% vs. 6.409 +/- 2.545%, p = 0.008). For the left lung, the V5 was lower in the WBI-SIB plan than for the WBI-SEQ plan (27.385 +/- 3.871% vs. 32.092 +/- 3.545%, p < 0.001). The D-mean for the heart and left lung was lower for the WBI-SIB plan than for the WBI-SEQ plan (heart: 339.745 +/- 46.889 cGy vs. 413.030 +/- 52.456 cGy, p < 0.001; left lung: 550.445 +/- 65.094 cGy vs. 602.270 +/- 55.775 cGy, p < 0.001). Conclusions: The WBI-SIB plan delivered lower radiation doses to the heart and left lung than the WBI-SEQ plan in terms of D-mean and low-dose volume in hypofractionated RT of early-stage left-sided breast cancer patients. Furthermore, a large radiation dose per day may be advantageous, considering the radiobiologic aspects of breast cancer. Long-term follow-up data are needed to determine whether the dosimetric advantages of the WBI-SIB plan can lead to clinically improved patient outcomes and reduced late side effects.

TI  - Land Subsidence Assessment for Wind Turbine Location in the South-Western Part of Madagascar
T2  - ENERGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Finding a suitable location is a key factor for long-term investment in wind turbine energy. It includes understanding the area of interest, such as the subsidence of the land. Land subsidence is a gradual decrease in the surface of the Earth due to natural and/or induced causes. It can cause damage, such as settlement problems in the ground near infrastructure including buildings and wind turbines, thus not being a suitable place for long-term investment. Here, we show a case study of land subsidence prediction and assessment of the Atsimo Andrefana region, the great south-western part of Madagascar, using theoretical simulation and satellite images from the Sentinel-1 mission using D-InSAR method. The predicted land subsidence related to the depletion of groundwater reservoirs in the Atsimo Andrefana region is around 12 mm. We found similar to 5 mm of subsidence related to the growing city of Toliary and with an average subsidence of 124 mm and the highest record of 167 mm in the most southern part of the region for a period of 6 months. The spatial distribution of land subsidence allows us to choose the ideal location for wind turbine settlement, where land subsidence is not that severe, i.e., the areas with subsidence relatively low of equal or less than 10 mm within 6 months of observation, based on the processed data. Such results are essential for future environmentally friendly investments in the affected region, as the demand for green energy will always grow.

TI  - Rice Crop Monitoring Using Sentinel-1 SAR Data: A Case Study in Saku, Japan
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global warming affects rice crop production, causing deterioration of rice grain quality. This study used C-band microwave images taken by the Sentinel-1 satellites to monitor rice crop growth with the aim to understand microwave backscatter behavior, focusing on decreases in panicle water contents with ripening, which affect C-band backscatter. Time-series changes illustrated a similar tendency across all four analysis years, showing that VV/VH ratio at an incidence angle of 45-46 degrees stopped decreasing to be stable over the reproductive and ripening periods due to reductions in the panicle water content that allowed for greater microwave penetration into the canopy, thereby increasing panicle-related backscatter. Furthermore, multivariate regression analysis combined with field observations showed that VV and VH with the shallow incidence angles were significantly negatively correlated with panicle water content, which well demonstrated backscatter increases with plant senescence. Furthermore, it was observed that backscatter behaviors were highly consistent with changes in crop phenology and surface condition. Accordingly, Sentinel-1 images with shallow incidence angles and high revisit observation capabilities offer a strong potential for estimating panicle water content. Therefore, it seems reasonable to conclude that C-band SAR data is capable of retrieving grain filling conditions to estimate proper harvesting time.

TI  - Multi-Variable SWAT Model Calibration Using Satellite-Based Evapotranspiration Data and Streamflow
T2  - HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, monthly streamflow and satellite-based actual evapotranspiration data (AET) were used to evaluate the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model for the calibration of an experimental sub-basin with mixed land-use characteristics in Athens, Greece. Three calibration scenarios were performed using streamflow (i.e., single variable), AET (i.e., single variable), and streamflow-AET data together (i.e., multi-variable) to provide insights into how different calibration scenarios affect the hydrological processes of a catchment with complex land use characteristics. The actual evapotranspiration data were obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The calibration was achieved with the use of the SUFI-2 algorithm in the SWAT-CUP program. The results suggested that the single variable calibrations showed moderately better performance than the multi-variable calibration. However, the multi-variable calibration scenario displayed acceptable outcomes for both streamflow and actual evapotranspiration and indicated reasonably good streamflow estimations (NSE = 0.70; R-2 = 0.86; PBIAS = 6.1%). The model under-predicted AET in all calibration scenarios during the dry season compared to MODIS satellite-based AET. Overall, this study demonstrated that satellite-based AET data, together with streamflow data, can enhance model performance and be a good choice for watersheds lacking sufficient spatial data and observations.

TI  - Quantification of soil erosion in small watersheds on the Loess Plateau based on a modified soil loss model
T2  - WATER SUPPLY
M3  - Article
AB  - The technology of slope vegetation system stability enhancement is an important part of the comprehensive ecological security improvement in small watersheds area of the Loess Plateau. The results of the comprehensive soil erosion improvement in the sub-basin are used to give an evaluation of the effectiveness of the gully slope vegetation restoration project. Soil erosion quantification distribution in the Sheep Sap Gully sub-basin of the Loess Plateau hilly gully area was simulated and explored by combining the modified universal soil loss equation RUSLE model with GIS and RS spatial information technology. The quantitative values of LS factor were extracted using DEM data, the R factor of rainfall erosion force was calculated using meteorological monitoring station data around this region, the K factor of erosion resistance was obtained based on the soil survey database, and the C factor and P factor of soil and water conservation measures were obtained by combining MODIS image data and previous research experience. The study concluded that (1) The erosion area ratio within the study area is 36.33%; (2) The quantitative grading standard of the pattern, the size of the erosion distribution area at all levels is ranked as light>moderate>very strong>strong>intense; (3) Under the conditions of land use and vegetation cover, strong erosion is mostly found in farming areas with sparse vegetation, while weak erosion is found in areas with lush vegetation such as forests and grasslands; (4) In terms of spatial distribution, erosion is greater in the south-western part of the basin than in the north-eastern part, and there is also strong erosion in the south-western part. The results of the study provide a reference for research into integration and synthesis of ecological security technologies for gully and slope management projects. The research content provides the basis and support for watershed governance and soil and water resource management and conservation.

TI  - Migration and Estuarine Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) Change along Ghana's Coast
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Estuaries are among the world's most biologically productive ecosystems and have since generations attracted migrants due to their high biodiversity, natural beauty, and source of livelihood. Growing coastal populations and immigration have led to the deterioration of many coastal ecosystems globally. Overfishing, habitat fragmentation, and degradation have significantly compromised these estuaries' natural environments and subsequently affected their ability to serve as breeding grounds for aquatic organisms. Thus, understanding landscape patterns, changes, and human-nature interactions is critical for long-term monitoring of estuarine ecosystems. This study analysed changes in three major river estuaries (Pra, Ankobra and the Volta Rivers) in Ghana using Landsat satellite data from 1986 to 2020 and population data. The results revealed that coastal flooding and erosion had changed the area of bare land/settlements in both Pra Estuary (-13.7%) and Ankobra Estuary (-18.8%) into water areas, respectively. Likewise, anthropogenic activities resulted in a 12.6% loss in vegetation in the Ankobra Estuary and 42.8% in the Volta Estuary. However, mangrove reforestation interventions at the Pra Estuary increased the vegetation area (10.8%). These observed LULC changes in these areas explain the effect of migration and its impact on long-term resource management and the survival of estuarine communities. Associated with the increased population (immigration) of estuarine communities are mangrove destruction, sand mining, and indiscriminate waste disposal activities, driving the degradation of the estuaries. Consequently, migrant, and local community interests should be harnessed to avoid undesirable LULC dynamics. Thus, an integrated approach to the management of the coastal zone and associated wetlands are paramount for the sustainability of the environment and local livelihoods. (C) 2022 The Author(s).

TI  - A Proposed Link Between Acute Thymic Involution and Late Adverse Effects of Chemotherapy
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Epidemiologic data suggest that cancer survivors tend to develop a protuberant number of adverse late effects, including second primary malignancies (SPM), as a result of cytotoxic chemotherapy. Besides the genotoxic potential of these drugs that directly inflict mutational burden on genomic DNA, the precise mechanisms contributing to SPM development are poorly understood. Cancer is nowadays perceived as a complex process that goes beyond the concept of genetic disease and includes tumor cell interactions with complex stromal and immune cell microenvironments. The cancer immunoediting theory offers an explanation for the development of nascent neoplastic cells. Briefly, the theory suggests that newly emerging tumor cells are mostly eliminated by an effective tissue immunosurveillance, but certain tumor variants may occasionally escape innate and adaptive mechanisms of immunological destruction, entering an equilibrium phase, where immunologic tumor cell death "equals" new tumor cell birth. Subsequent microenvironmental pressures and accumulation of helpful mutations in certain variants may lead to escape from the equilibrium phase, and eventually cause an overt neoplasm. Cancer immunoediting functions as a dedicated sentinel under the auspice of a highly competent immune system. This perspective offers the fresh insight that chemotherapy-induced thymic involution, which is characterized by the extensive obliteration of the sensitive thymic epithelial cell (TEC) compartment, can cause long-term defects in thymopoiesis and in establishment of diverse T cell receptor repertoires and peripheral T cell pools of cancer survivors. Such delayed recovery of T cell adaptive immunity may result in prolonged hijacking of the cancer immunoediting mechanisms, and lead to development of persistent and mortal infections, inflammatory disorders, organ-specific autoimmunity lesions, and SPMs. Acknowledging that chemotherapy-induced thymic involution is a potential risk factor for the emergence of SPM demarcates new avenues for the rationalized development of pharmacologic interventions to promote thymic regeneration in patients receiving cytoreductive chemotherapies.

TI  - Geospatial Modelling for Estimation of PM<sub>2.5</sub> Concentrations in Two Megacities in Peninsular India
T2  - AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Airborne particles finer than 2.5 microns (PM2.5) constitute a major public health risk in India. Therefore, extensive scientific studies must be conducted to assess the PM2.5 exposures of Indians and determine the "exposure-response function" specific to India. While Peninsular India includes three megacities with populations exceeding 10 million each, there are very few studies on air quality modelling in this region compared to North India. In this paper, the authors describe a Linear Mixed Effects (LME) model to estimate monthly-average PM2.5 concentrations at a spatial resolution of 1 km(2) between 2016 and 2019 in the megacities of Bengaluru and Hyderabad with a total population of 23 million. This model is based on covariates such as aerosol optical depth (AOD), meteorological parameters, and Land-use-Land-cover (LULC) variables and is validated with extensive datasets from continuous and manual air quality monitoring stations through a 10-fold cross-validation process. The final LME model can explain more than 60 percent of the variation in the PM2.5 concentrations in Bengaluru and Hyderabad. This model is then used to predict the monthly-average grid-wise PM2.5 concentrations in more than 800 grids in each of these two cities to study the spatial and temporal patterns in PM2.5 concentrations between 2016 and 2019. These spatiotemporal maps of PM2.5 concentration are critical to overcoming the misclassification of exposure and will form a crucial input to much-needed PM exposure-response studies in these two megacities. This paper can serve as a useful framework for similar studies by showing the way to bridge the gaps in the current air quality monitoring network in Peninsular India.

TI  - Investigating the Shallow-Water Bathymetric Capability of Zhuhai-1 Spaceborne Hyperspectral Images Based on ICESat-2 Data and Empirical Approaches: A Case Study in the South China Sea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate bathymetric and topographical information is crucial for coastal and marine applications. In the past decades, owing to its low cost and high efficiency, satellite-derived bathymetry has been widely used to estimate the depth of shallow water in coastal areas. However, insufficient spectral bands and availability of in situ water depths limit the application of satellite-derived bathymetry. Currently, the investigation about the bathymetric potential of hyperspectral imaging is relatively insufficient based on datasets of the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2). In this study, Zhuhai-1 hyperspectral images and ICESat-2 datasets were utilized to perform nearshore bathymetry and explore the bathymetric capability by selecting different bands based on classical empirical models (the band ratio model and the linear band model). Furthermore, experimental results achieved at the South China Sea indicate that the combination of blue (2 and 3 band) and green (9 band) bands and the combination of red (10 and 12 band) and near-infrared (29 band) bands are most suitable to achieve nearshore bathymetry. Correspondingly, the highest accuracy of bathymetry reached root mean square error values of 0.98 m and 1.19 m for different band combinations evaluated through bathymetric results of reference water depth. The bathymetric accuracy of Zhuhai-1 image is similar with that of Sentinel-2 when employing the blue and green bands. The combination of red and near-infrared bands has a higher bathymetric accuracy for Zhuhai-1 image than that for Sentinel-2 image.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Coastal Vegetation Phenology in a Cold Temperate Intertidal System: Implications for Classification of Coastal Habitats
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Intertidal vegetation provides important ecological functions, such as food and shelter for wildlife and ecological services with increased coastline protection from erosion. In cold temperate and subarctic environments, the short growing season has a significant impact on the phenological response of the different vegetation types, which must be considered for their mapping using satellite remote sensing technologies. This study focuses on the effect of the phenology of vegetation in the intertidal ecosystems on remote sensing outputs. The studied sites were dominated by eelgrass (Zostera marina L.), saltmarsh cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora), creeping saltbush (Atriplex prostrata), macroalgae (Ascophyllum nodosum, and Fucus vesiculosus) attached to scattered boulders. In situ data were collected on ten occasions from May through October 2019 and included biophysical properties (e.g., leaf area index) and hyperspectral reflectance spectra (R-rs (lambda)). The results indicate that even when substantial vegetation growth is observed, the variation in R-rs (lambda) is not significant at the beginning of the growing season, limiting the spectral separability using multispectral imagery. The spectral separability between vegetation types was maximum at the beginning of the season (early June) when the vegetation had not reached its maximum growth. Seasonal time series of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values were derived from multispectral sensors (Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument (MSI) and PlanetScope) and were validated using in situ-derived NDVI. The results indicate that the phenology of intertidal vegetation can be monitored by satellite if the number of observations obtained at a low tide is sufficient, which helps to discriminate plant species and, therefore, the mapping of vegetation. The optimal period for vegetation mapping was September for the study area.

TI  - SCRNet: an efficient spatial channel attention residual network for spatiotemporal fusion
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal fusion is a simple, feasible, and economical method for balancing the temporal and spatial resolutions of satellite images. However, the current spatiotemporal fusion methods have some disadvantages, such as their insufficient feature extraction abilities and unsatisfactory fusion image effects. To obtain higher-quality spatiotemporal fusion images, a spatiotemporal data fusion method based on deep learning is proposed. This method combines an attention mechanism and a residual learning strategy to design an asymmetric spatial channel attention residual network (SCRNet). For different input images, the SCRNet extracts rich feature information to fuse high-quality images in a more emphatic and scientific manner than other approaches. Specifically, we design an efficient and flexible spatial channel attention mechanism that not only focuses on spatial information but also takes channel information into account. The optimized residual network can further enhance the ability of the network to extract feature information. In addition, we design a compound loss function and propose an edge loss to further enrich the extracted feature information and improve the resulting image quality. Experimental results on two datasets show that the proposed method outperforms existing fusion methods in subjective and objective evaluations.

TI  - Use of Sentinel-2 Derived Vegetation Indices for Estimating fPAR in Olive Groves
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Olive tree cultivation is currently a dominant agriculture activity in the Mediterranean basin, where the increasing impact of climate change coupled with the inefficient management of olive groves is negatively affecting olive oil production and quality in some marginal areas. In this context, satellite imagery may help to monitor crop growth under different environmental conditions, thus providing useful information for optimizing olive grove management and final production. However, the spatial resolution of freely-available satellite products is not yet adequate to estimate plant biophysical parameters in complex agroecosystems such as olive groves, where both olive trees and grass cover contribute to the vegetation indices (VIs) signal at pixel scale. The aim of this study is therefore to test a disentangling procedure to partition the VIs signal among the different components of the agroecosystem to use this information for the monitoring of olive growth processes during the season. Specifically, five VIs (GEMI, MCARI2, NDVI, OSAVI, MCARI2/OSAVI) as recorded by Sentinel-2 at a spatial resolution of 10 m over five olive groves in the Montalbano area (Tuscany, Central Italy), were tested as a proxy for olive tree intercepted radiation. The olive tree volume per pixel was initially used to linearly rescale the VIs signal into the relevant value for the grass cover and olive trees. The models, describing the relationship between rescaled VIs and observed fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (fPAR), were fitted and then validated against independent datasets. While in the calibration phase, a greater robustness at predicting fPAR was obtained using NDVI (r = 0.96 and RRMSE = 9.86), the validation results demonstrating that GEMI and MCARI2/OSAVI provided the highest performances (GEMI: r = 0.89 and RRMSE = 21.71; MCARI2/OSAVI: r = 0.87 and RRMSE = 25.50), in contrast to MCARI2 that provided the lowest (r = 0.67 and RRMSE = 36.78). These results may be related to the VIs' intrinsic features (e.g., lower sensitivity to atmosphere and background effects), which make some of these indices, compared to others, less sensitive to saturation effects by improving fPAR estimation (e.g., GEMI vs. NDVI). On this basis, this study evidenced the need to improve the current methodologies to reduce inter-row effects and select appropriate VIs for fPAR estimation, especially in complex agroecosystems where inter-row grass growth may affect remote sensed-derived VIs signal at an inadequate pixel resolution.

TI  - Rainstorm-induced large-scale landslides in Northeastern Chongqing, China, August 31 to September 2, 2014
T2  - BULLETIN OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - From August 31 to September 2, 2014, a 50-year heavy rainstorm hit the Northeastern Chongqing area, China, and caused 2340 landslides, including 80 large-scale landslides with volumes greater than 10 x 10(5) m(3). The distribution, characteristics, and conditions contributing to the formation of these large-scale landslides are still unclear. We conducted a comprehensive analysis based on collected rainfall data, field investigations, and remote-sensing data. The results show that the distribution of these large-scale landslides coincided with variations in the rainfall intensity, with the rainfall threshold for landslide formation inferred to be 200 mm. Most of these large-scale landslides occurred in areas with low-angle slopes formed of Mesozoic interbedded sandstones and mudstones. Three representative landslides of different types were selected for detailed assessment: the Laoyaopu landslide, which is a bedding rockslide; the Xianchi Reservoir landslide, which is a bedding rockslide-debris flow; and the Wushanping landslide, which is a rotated bedding rockslide-debris flow. The leading causes of these landslides are the topographical, geological, geotechnical, and rainfall conditions. The dip-slopes with large heights are naturally conducive to the formation of large-scale rockslides. The existence of interbedded sandstones and mudstones, and the presence of extensional tensile cracks at the trailing edges of slopes, facilitates the rock fracturing and separation required to induce landslides. Aided by these conditions, rainstorms are a crucial driver for the formation of regional large-scale landslides. These findings are essential for future disaster prevention and mitigation in this area and other areas that experience similar conditions.

TI  - Temporal Variation and Component Allocation Characteristics of Geometric and Physical Parameters of Maize Canopy for the Entire Growing Season
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate monitoring of crop parameters is important for crop yield prediction and canopy parameter inversion from remote sensing. Process-based and semi-empirical crop models are the main approaches to modeling the temporal changes in crop parameters. However, the former requires too many input parameters and the latter has the problem of poor portability. In this study, new semi-empirical geometric and physical parameters of the maize canopy model (GPMCM) crop model adapted to northeast China were proposed based on a time-series field datasets collected from 11 sites in the Nong'an and Changling Counties of Jilin Province, China, during DOY (day of year) 163 to DOY 278 in 2021. The allocation characteristics of and correlations between each maize canopy parameter were investigated for the whole growing season using the 22 algorithms of crop parameters, and the following conclusions were obtained. (1) The high correlation coefficient (R mean = 0.79) of LAI with other canopy parameters indicated that it was a good indicator for predicting other parameters. (2) Better performance was achieved by the regression method based on the two-stage simulation. The root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of geometric parameters including maize height, stem long radius, and short radius were 12.91 cm, 0.74 mm, and 0.73 mm, respectively, and the RMSE of the physical parameters including the FAGB, AGB, VWC, and RWC of the stems and leaves, ranged from 0.05 kg/m(2) to 4.24 kg/m(2) (2.0% to 12.9% for mean absolute percentage error (MAPE)). (3) The extension of the field-scale GPMCM to the 500 m MODIS-scale still provided a good accuracy (MAPE: 11% to 18.5%) and confirmed the feasibility of the large-scale application of the GPMCM. The proposed CPMCM can predict the temporal dynamics of maize geometric and physical parameters, and it is helpful to establish the forward and reverse models of remote sensing and improve the inversion accuracy of crop parameters.

TI  - Optimization of Sample Construction Based on NDVI for Cultivated Land Quality Prediction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The integrated use of remote sensing technology and machine learning models to evaluate cultivated land quality (CLQ) quickly and efficiently is vital for protecting these lands. The effectiveness of machine-learning methods can be profoundly influenced by training samples. However, in the existing research, samples have mainly been constructed by random point (RPO). Little attention has been devoted to the optimization of sample construction, which may affect the accuracy of evaluation results. In this study, we present two optimization methods for sample construction of random patch (RPA) and area sequence patch (ASP). Differing from RPO samples, it aims to include cultivated land area and its size into sample construction. Based on landsat-8 Operational Land Manager images and agricultural land grading data, the proposed sample construction methods were applied to the machine learning model to predict the CLQ in Dongtai City, Jiangsu Province, China. Four machine learning models (the backpropagation neural network, decision tree, random forest (RF), and support vector machine) were compared based on RPO samples to determine the accurate evaluation model. The best machine learning model was selected to compare RPA and ASP samples with RPO samples. Results determined that the RF model generated the highest accuracy. Meanwhile, a high correlation was noted between the cultivated land area and CLQ. Thus, incorporating cultivated land area in the sample construction attributes can improve the prediction accuracy of the model. Among the three sample construction methods, the ASP yielded the highest prediction accuracy, indicating that the use of a large, cultivated land patch as the sample unit can further elevate the model performance. This study provides a new sample construction method for predicting CLQ using a machine learning model, as well as providing a reference for related research.

TI  - Spatial and temporal variations of drought in Sichuan Province from 2001 to 2020 based on modified temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI)
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought indicators based on remote sensing include the temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) and the crop water stress index (CWSI). The data was processed using TVDI, which was calculated by parameterizing the MODIS EVI and LST data connection. For drought monitoring, we compared the efficiency of TVDI with that of CWSI, which is obtained from the MOD16A2 products. The study's findings revealed that drought conditions measured by TVDI and CWSI had a number of differences and similarities, which indicated that both CWSI and TVDI can be used for drought monitoring, although they had some discrepancies in the spatiotemporal characteristics of drought intensity in this region. High TVDI values were mainly concentrated on the northwestern Sichuan Plateau and mountainous areas of southwestern Sichuan, corresponding to extreme drought. The Panzhihua and the mountainous area of southwestern Sichuan had relatively high CWSI values. Spring had the highest TVDI values, followed by autumn and winter. TVDI and CWSI have different patterns, showing moderate and severe drought conditions in different areas. Overall, CWSI values showed a significant decreasing trend (P < 0.05) from 2001 to 2020. The overall trend change of TVDI was insignificant, mainly based on an insignificant increase and an insignificant decrease. An extremely significant decreasing trend, mainly concentrated in the eastern Sichuan basin plain, accounted for 15.54% of the entire province. Spring, summer, autumn, and winter account for 74.33%, 59.15%, 68.28%, and 64.87% of Sichuan Province, respectively, in total area change. The eastern Sichuan basin plain showed a significant increasing trend, accounting for 1.69% of the province in winter. TVDI correlates positively with Yearly maximum value of daily minimum temperature (TNx), Yearly maximum value of daily maximum temperature (TXx), and Yearly maximum consecutive one-day precipitation (PX1), and negatively with Yearly minimum value of daily maximum temperature (TXn), Yearly minimum value of daily minimum temperature (TNn), and Yearly mean temperature (YMT).

TI  - Standardized NEON organismal data for biodiversity research
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding patterns and drivers of species distribution and abundance, and thus biodiversity, is a core goal of ecology. Despite advances in recent decades, research into these patterns and processes is currently limited by a lack of standardized, high-quality, empirical data that span large spatial scales and long time periods. The NEON fills this gap by providing freely available observational data that are generated during robust and consistent organismal sampling of several sentinel taxonomic groups within 81 sites distributed across the United States and will be collected for at least 30 years. The breadth and scope of these data provide a unique resource for advancing biodiversity research. To maximize the potential of this opportunity, however, it is critical that NEON data be maximally accessible and easily integrated into investigators' workflows and analyses. To facilitate its use for biodiversity research and synthesis, we created a workflow to process and format NEON organismal data into the ecocomDP (ecological community data design pattern) format that were available through the ecocomDP R package; we then provided the standardized data as an R data package (neonDivData). We briefly summarize sampling designs and data wrangling decisions for the major taxonomic groups included in this effort. Our workflows are open-source so the biodiversity community may: add additional taxonomic groups; modify the workflow to produce datasets appropriate for their own analytical needs; and regularly update the data packages as more observations become available. Finally, we provide two simple examples of how the standardized data may be used for biodiversity research. By providing a standardized data package, we hope to enhance the utility of NEON organismal data in advancing biodiversity research and encourage the use of the harmonized ecocomDP data design pattern for community ecology data from other ecological observatory networks.

TI  - Bayesian Estimation of Land Deformation Combining Persistent and Distributed Scatterers
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) has been widely used for monitoring land deformation in urban areas with millimeter accuracy. In natural terrain, combining persistent scatterers (PSs) and distributed scatterers (DSs) to jointly estimate deformation, such as SqueeSAR, can enhance PSI results for denser and better coverage. However, the phase quality of a large number of DSs is far inferior to that of PSs, which deteriorates the deformation measurement accuracy. To solve the contradiction between measurement accuracy and coverage, a Bayesian estimation method of land deformation combining PSs and DSs is proposed in this paper. First, a two-level network is introduced into the traditional PSI to deal with PSs and DSs. In the first-level network, the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) of deformation parameters at PSs and high-quality DSs is obtained accurately. In the secondary-level network, the remaining DSs are connected to the nearest PSs or high-quality DSs, and the deformation parameters are estimated by Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) based on Bayesian theory. Due to the poor phase quality of the remaining DSs, MAP can achieve better estimation results than the MLE based on the spatial correlation of the deformation field. Simulation and Sentinel-1A satellite data results verified the feasibility and reliability of the proposed method. Regularized by the spatial deformation field derived from the high-quality PSs and DSs, the proposed method is expected to achieve robust results even in low-coherence areas, such as rural areas, vegetation coverage areas, or deserts.

TI  - Changes in Vegetation Greenness and Their Influencing Factors in Southern China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the 21st century, China has experienced rapid development, and the spatial and temporal changes in vegetation cover have become increasingly significant. Southern China is a representative region for human activities, climate change, and vegetation change, but the current human understanding of the interactions between vegetation and its influencing factors is still very limited. In our study, we use NDVI as the vegetation greenness data, land cover data, temperature, precipitation, downgradient shortwave radiation, and CO2 data to investigate the interrelationship among vegetation, climate change, and human activities in southern China. The changes and their consistency were studied by trend analysis and Hurst exponent analysis. Then, the contribution of each influencing factor from 2001 to 2020 was quantified by random forest. The results showed that the vegetation in southern China showed an overall rising trend, and areas with a continuous changing trend were concentrated in the Pearl River Delta, western Guangdong, and eastern Guangdong, with a growth rate of 0.02 similar to 0.04%. The vegetation in northern Guangdong did not change significantly. The main factor of NDVI spatial variation in southern China is the land-use factor, accounting for 79.4% of the variation, while climate factors produce further differences. The contributions and lagged effects of NDVI factors on different land-use types and the lagged effects of different climate factors are different and are related to the climate and vegetation background in Sourthern China. Our study is useful in estimating the contribution of NDVI change by each considered factor and formulating environmentally friendly regional development strategies and promoting human-land harmony.

However, there has not been a systematic, comprehensive evaluation of their applicability in cereal crop spike identification in UAV images, especially in sorghum head counting. To this end, this paper conducts a comparative study of the performance of three common DL algorithms, EfficientDet, Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD), and You Only Look Once (YOLOv4), for sorghum head detection based on lightweight UAV remote sensing data. The paper explores the effects of overlap ratio, confidence, and intersection over union (IoU) parameters, using the evaluation metrics of precision P, recall R, average precision AP, F1 score, computational efficiency, and the number of detected positive/negative samples (Objects detected consistent/inconsistent with real samples). The experiment results show the following. (1) The detection results of the three methods under dense coverage conditions were better than those under medium and sparse conditions. YOLOv4 had the most accurate detection under different coverage conditions; on the contrary, EfficientDet was the worst. While SSD obtained better detection results under dense conditions, the number of over-detections was larger. (2) It was concluded that although EfficientDet had a good positive sample detection rate, it detected the fewest samples, had the smallest R and F1, and its actual precision was poor, while its training time, although medium, had the lowest detection efficiency, and the detection time per image was 2.82-times that of SSD. SSD had medium values for P, AP, and the number of detected samples, but had the highest training and detection efficiency. YOLOv4 detected the largest number of positive samples, and its values for R, AP, and F1 were the highest among the three methods. Although the training time was the slowest, the detection efficiency was better than EfficientDet. (3) With an increase in the overlap ratios, both positive and negative samples tended to increase, and when the threshold value was 0.3, all three methods had better detection results. With an increase in the confidence value, the number of positive and negative samples significantly decreased, and when the threshold value was 0.3, it balanced the numbers for sample detection and detection accuracy. An increase in IoU was accompanied by a gradual decrease in the number of positive samples and a gradual increase in the number of negative samples. When the threshold value was 0.3, better detection was achieved. The research findings can provide a methodological basis for accurately detecting and counting sorghum heads using UAV.

TI  - Managing Water Level for Large Migratory Fish at the Poyang Lake Outlet: Implications Based on Habitat Suitability and Connectivity
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - River-lake interaction is important for maintaining biodiversity, yet it is vulnerable to hydrological alteration. The connectivity of the channel connecting Poyang Lake and the Yangtze River not only ensures the regular migration of fish but also makes Poyang Lake a feeding and fattening ground for them. Unfortunately, human activities have dramatically changed the hydrodynamic conditions of Poyang Lake, which is experiencing severe drought due to the obvious decline in the water level in autumn and winter, especially since 2003. However, the possible impacts of the changes in the water level on the habitats of migratory fish remain unclear due to the limitation of traditional techniques in spatiotemporal analysis. Here, we combined a hydrodynamic model and habitat suitability model to simulate variations in the suitable habitat area and their connectivity under different water-level conditions. The conditions for the migration pathway of the target fish were obtained by a hydroacoustic survey using the Simrad EY60 echosounder. The results showed that the change in water level will significantly affect the spatiotemporal change in the suitable habitats and their connectivity. In particular, we found the existence of two thresholds that play a dominant role in illuminating the connectivity of effective suitable habitats (HC). Firstly, the maximum value of the weighted usable area (WUA) and HC can be achieved when the water level is more than 16 m. Secondly, when the water level is between 10 and 16 m, the changes in the HC are sensitive and rapid, and the area flooded at this stage is called the sensitive area. HC is a crucial element in fish migration and habitat conditions. Under the condition of continuous drought in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, our research contributes to clarifying the influence of water level on key habitats for fish and optimizes the practice of river-lake ecological management.

TI  - Risk Assessment of Snow Disasters for Animal Husbandry on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and Influences of Snow Disasters on the Well-Being of Farmers and Pastoralists
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of global warming, meteorological disasters occur more frequently in various regions which exert increasing influences on human life. Snow disasters are some of the natural disasters that most seriously affect the development of husbandry on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP), so it is necessary to explore their spatio-temporal variations and perform comprehensive risk assessment. Based on the daily snow depth data set in China, obtained by inversion of satellite remote sensing data, the spatio-temporal variation characteristics of snow disasters on the QTP from 1980 to 2019 were studied. The regional difference in the comprehensive risks of snow disasters for the husbandry on the QTP was evaluated from four perspectives, i.e., the risk of hazard factors, sensitivity of hazard-inducing environments, vulnerability of hazard-affected bodies, and disaster prevention and mitigation capacity. The farmer and pastoralist well-being (FPWB) index in five typical regions was constructed to discuss the possible influences of snow disasters on the FPWB since the 21st century. Results show that, in the last 40 years, the frequency, duration, average snow depth, and grade of snow disasters on the QTP all exhibited significant interannual and interdecadal variabilities, and they also displayed a declining long-term trend. The comprehensive risk of snow disasters for the husbandry on the QTP is low in the north while high in the south. The high-risk zone accounts for 1.54% of the total and is mainly located in Kashgar City in the north-western end of the QTP; the sub-high-risk and medium-risk zones are mainly found in the south of the plateau and are distributed in a tripole pattern, separately covering 15.96% and 16.32% of the total area of the plateau; the north of the plateau mainly belongs to low-risk and sub-low-risk zones, which separately account for 43.06% and 23.12% of the total area of the plateau. Since the beginning of the 21st century, the FPWB in five typical regions, namely, Kashgar (I), Shigatse (II), Nagqu (III), Qamdo (IV), and Yushu (V), has been increasing, while the risk of snow disasters has gradually decreased. Every 1% decrease in the risk of snow disasters corresponded to 0.186%, 0.768%, 0.378%, 0.109%, and 0.03% increases in the FPWB index in the five regions. Snow disasters affect FPWB mainly by directly or indirectly damaging material resources (livestock inventories and meat production) and social and financial resources.

TI  - Feasibility of sentinel lymph node biopsy omission after integration of <SUP>18</SUP>F-FDG dedicated lymph node PET in early breast cancer: a prospective phase II trial
T2  - CANCER BIOLOGY & MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is currently the standard of care in clinically node negative (cN0) breast cancer. The present study aimed to evaluate the negative predictive value (NPV) of F-18-FDG dedicated lymph node positron emission tomography (LymphPET) in cN0 patients.Methods: This was a prospective phase II trial divided into 2 stages (NCT04072653). In the first stage, cN0 patients underwent axillary LymphPET followed by SLNB. In the second stage, SLNB was omitted in patients with a negative preoperative axillary assessment after integration of LymphPET. Here, we report the results of the first stage. The primary outcome was the NPV of LymphPET to detect macrometastasis of lymph nodes (LN-macro).Results: A total of 189 patients with invasive breast cancer underwent LymphPET followed by surgery with definitive pathological reports. Forty patients had LN-macro, and 16 patients had only lymph node micrometastasis. Of the 131 patients with a negative LymphPET result, 16 patients had LN-macro, and the NPV was 87.8%. After combined axillary imaging evaluation with ultrasound and LymphPET, 100 patients were found to be both LymphPET and ultrasound negative, 9 patients had LN-macro, and the NPV was 91%.Conclusions: LymphPET can be used to screen patients to potentially avoid SLNB, with an NPV > 90%. The second stage of the SOAPET trial is ongoing to confirm the safety of omission of SLNB according to preoperational axillary evaluation integrating LymphPET.

TI  - The initial stage of Russian-Chinese cultural interactions
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The article focuses on the role of cultural exchanges between Russia and China in the 19th century and highlights the following aspects of Russian-Chinese cultural interactions at the initial stage: the first trips of Chinese diplomats abroad, the role of the Orthodox mission in spreading knowledge about China in Russia, literature exchange, the contribution of Russian writers to popularizing Chinese culture and of Chinese writers and revolutionaries to popularizing Russian literature. The author came to the following conclusions. The Chinese diplomatic mission in Russia in the 19th century was not numerous (Bin Chun, Li Hongzhan and some others); visits of official delegations were not frequent either, which had some implications for the negligible outcome of long-term interactions and cultural exchanges. Another opportunity to get acquainted with China and Chinese culture was provided by the establishment of the Russian Orthodox Mission, which played an important role in spreading knowledge about China in Russia, as well as in the birth of Russian Chinese studies and the formation of a pleiad of Orientalists (Bichurin, Vasilyev). Chinese literature in Russia was in demand among not only scholars, but also writers, who contributed greatly to the dissemination of Chinese culture. Russian literature developed an interest in Chinese culture and classical literature, which was reflected in the works of Pushkin and Tolstoy. "Chinese motifs" are heard in Ruslan and Lyudmila, Eugene Onegin, and "To a Friend". Pushkin also researched and edited expedition reports and letters about China. He was a friend of Bichurin and positively evaluated his translation of San Zi Jing (Rus. Troeslovie; En. The Three Character Classic). Tolstoy seriously studied Confucianism and Taoism and was directly involved in the translation of the Tao Te Ching from French and German. China also gradually began to become familiar with Russian literature. Tolstoy' s works had the greatest influence - they were very common in China at the beginning of the twentieth century. Many young people of the time - first of all, revolutionaries and writers, the first leaders of the Communist Party of China (Chen Duxiu, Li Dazhao, Lu Xun and Hu Shih, Mao Dun, Ba Jin, etc.) - liked Tolstoy's works. The worldview of Tolstoy the thinker and the humanistic spirit of his works became an important spiritual nourishment for the development of modern Chinese literature; together with translations of his texts, Russian cultural and philosophical views entered the Chinese spiritual space. Further processes of interaction and exchanges between the two countries took place in various directions, became a link for modern international cooperation and the desire for common development at the beginning of the 21st century.

TI  - A Compensation Method of Saturated Waveform for Space-Borne Laser Altimeter
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the difference in surface reflectivity, the laser measurement waveform data recorded in full waveform have a saturation phenomenon. When the signal is saturated, the echo waveform produces peak clipping and pulse spreading, which seriously restrict the accuracy of laser measurement results and the usability of data. Therefore, we conducted a ranging investigation on the "peak clipping" phenomenon of the saturated waveform and found a nonlinear time delay in the range, which is between the two extreme cases of saturated "dead time" and Gaussian fitting peak time as pulse signal reception time. Subsequently, based on the consistent relationship between the geometric characteristics of the high- and low-gain channels of the space-borne laser altimeter, we constructed a laser waveform saturation compensation model, namely, the laser pulse flight time delay compensation and the laser waveform peak intensity compensation, and carried out the data saturation compensation and validation with the dual-channel measurement data from the GaoFen-7 (GF-7) satellite. The experimental results showed that the saturation compensation model (SCM) proposed in this paper could restore the features of the saturated waveform signal and effectively improve the accuracy of the laser ranging. The accuracy of the laser waveform fitting result after saturation compensation improved from 0.7 ns (0.11 m) to 0.14 ns (0.02 m), which greatly improved the usability of the saturated laser measurement waveform data.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variation of Land Surface Temperature in Henan Province of China from 2003 to 2021
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a key parameter closely related to various land surface processes and surface-atmosphere interactions. Analysis of spatiotemporal variation of time-series LST may provide useful information to understand eco-climatic characteristics. In this study, the spatiotemporal pattern of LST and its trend characteristics in Henan Province were examined based on MODIS LST products from 2003 to 2021. In addition, the influences of land cover types, Nighttime Light data (NTL) and Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) on LST variation were analyzed. The results indicated that: (i) The LST showed slight and rapid decreasing trend for 2004-2010 and 2018-2020, respectively, whereas an obvious increasing and slight increasing trend occurred for 2010-2013 and 2014-2018. In terms of spatial pattern, high-temperature, and sub-high-temperature were mainly distributed in the central part of the province with higher level of industrialization and urbanization at the annual, spring, summer, and daytime scales. While in fall, winter, and the nighttime, the spatial distribution of LST exhibited decreased trend from the southern part to the northern part of the province, the largest Standard Deviation (STD) was observed in summer. (ii) The interannual variation rate of LST was 0.08 degrees C/Y. The increasing trend mainly occurred in urban and built-up areas. At the seasonal scales, the rising rate decreased sequentially in the order of fall, winter, spring, and summer. In addition, the rising rate in the daytime was higher than that in the nighttime. (iii) LST increased along with the expansion of urban and built-up lands, except in winter. At the annual scales, 84.69% of areas with NTL data exhibited a positive correlation with LST, and NDMI in the western part with high elevation presented a significantly positive correlation to LST, while a significantly negative correlation occurred in urban and built-up areas. The cooling effect of NDMI on LST in the daytime was greater than that in the nighttime. In cropland areas, LST showed a non-significant correlation with NDMI at the annual scale, and a significantly negative correlation with NDMI in spring, summer, and fall. The influence mechanism of cropland on the variation of LST at different timescales needs to be further explored. These findings might provide some hints to understand climate change and its causes in the province.

TI  - Extraction and analysis of elevation changes in Antarctic ice sheet from CryoSat-2 and Sentinel-3 radar altimeters
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - New radar altimeters have supported elevation modeling with greater accuracy and extended periods in recent years. Sentinel-3 has been rarely used in previous studies for monitoring the Antarctic ice sheet. The CryoSat-2 and Sentinel-3 satellite radar altimeter data were combined to extract the elevation changes in the Antarctic ice sheet. First, a subregional data filtering method based on a clustering algorithm was proposed to improve the accuracy of the elevation change results for the outliers in the original measurements. Next, an improved model-fitting model that incorporated multiple parameters was used to extract elevation changes, and the results were validated using airborne laser altimetry data and ICESat-2 data. The average changes in the Antarctic ice sheet elevation from 2016 to 2019 were -4.3 +/- 0.9 cm / y. The elevation changes of the ice shelf edges with large slopes and complex topography were much larger than the interior. Some specific areas showed substantial elevation changes. The most significant surface decreases occurred at the Pine Island Glacier and the Totten Glacier, while a pronounced surface heightening existed at the Kamb Ice Stream. We reveal an effective method for combining Antarctic ice sheet data from new radar altimeters. This method supports the long-term monitoring of the Antarctic ice sheet and global climate change in the future. (C) The Authors.

TI  - An Improved Independent Parameter Decomposition Method for Gaofen-3 Surveying and Mapping Calibration
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Gaofen-3 (GF-3) satellite can provide digital elevation model (DEM) data from its interferogram outputs. However, the accuracy of these data cannot be ensured without applying a surveying and mapping (SAM) calibration process, thus necessitating geometric and interferometric calibration technologies. In this paper, we propose an independent parameter decomposition (IPD) method to conduct SAM calibration on GF-3 data and generate high-accuracy DEMs. We resolved the geometric parameters to improve the location accuracy and resolved the interferometric parameters to improve the height accuracy. First, we established a geometric calibration model, analyzed the Range-Doppler (RD) model and resolved the initial imaging time error as well as the initial slant range error. Then, we established a three-dimensional reconstruction (TDR) model to analyze the height error sources. Finally, the interferometric phase error and baseline vector error were precisely estimated to ensure the vertical accuracy of the interferometric results by establishing the interferometric calibration model. We then used the GF-3 interferometric data derived on the same orbit in a north-south distribution to conduct the calibration experiment. The results show that the plane positioning accuracy was 5.09 m following geometric calibration, that the vertical accuracy of the interferometric results was 4.18 m following interferometric calibration and that the average absolute elevation accuracy of the derived DEM product was better than 3.09 m when using the GF-3 SAR data, thus confirming the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed GF-3 IPD calibration method. These results provide a technical basis for SAM calibration using GF-3 interferograms at the 1:50,000 scale in China.

TI  - Step-By-Step Downscaling of Land Surface Temperature Considering Urban Spatial Morphological Parameters
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is one of the most important parameters in urban thermal environmental studies. Compared to natural surfaces, the surface of urban areas is more complex, and the spatial variability of LST is higher. Therefore, it is important to obtain a high-spatial-resolution LST for urban thermal environmental research. At present, downscaling studies are mostly performed from a low spatial resolution directly to another high resolution, which often results in lower accuracy with a larger scale span. First, a step-by-step random forest downscaling LST model (SSRFD) is proposed in this study. In our work, the 900-m resolution Sentinel-3 LST was sequentially downscaled to 450 m, 150 m and 30 m by SSRFD. Then, urban spatial morphological parameters were introduced into SSRFD, abbreviated as SSRFD-M, to compensate for the deficiency of remote-sensing indices as driving factors in urban downscaling LST. The results showed that the RMSE value of the SSRFD results was reduced from 2.6 degrees C to 1.66 degrees C compared to the direct random forest downscaling model (DRFD); the RMSE value of the SSRFD-M results in built-up areas, such as Gulou and Qinhuai District, was reduced by approximately 0.5 degrees C. We also found that the underestimation of LST caused by considering only remote-sensing indices in places such as flowerbeds and streets was improved in the SSRFD-M results.

TI  - Random Forest Estimation and Trend Analysis of PM<sub>2.5</sub> Concentration over the Huaihai Economic Zone, China (2000-2020)
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Consisting of ten cities in four Chinese provinces, the Huaihai Economic Zone has suffered serious air pollution over the last two decades, particularly of fine particulate matter (PM2.5). In this study, we used multi-source data, namely MAIAC AOD (at a 1 km spatial resolution), meteorological, topographic, date, and location (latitude and longitude) data, to construct a regression model using random forest to estimate the daily PM2.5 concentration over the Huaihai Economic Zone from 2000 to 2020. It was found that the variable expressing time (date) had the greatest characteristic importance when estimating PM2.5. By averaging the modeled daily PM2.5 concentration, we produced a yearly PM2.5 concentration dataset, at a 1 km resolution, for the study area from 2000 to 2020. On comparing modeled daily PM2.5 with observational data, the coefficient of determination (R-2) of the modeling was 0.85, the root means square error (RMSE) was 14.63 mu g/m(3), and the mean absolute error (MAE) was 10.03 mu g/m(3). The quality assessment of the synthesized yearly PM2.5 concentration dataset shows that R-2 = 0.77, RMSE = 6.92 mu g/m(3), and MAE = 5.42 mu g/m(3). Despite different trends from 2000-2010 and from 2010-2020, the trend of PM2.5 concentration over the Huaihai Economic Zone during the 21 years was, overall, decreasing. The area of the significantly decreasing trend was small and mainly concentrated in the lake areas of the Zone. It is concluded that PM2.5 can be well-estimated from the MAIAC AOD dataset, when incorporating spatiotemporal variability using random forest, and that the resultant PM2.5 concentration data provide a basis for environmental monitoring over large geographic areas.

TI  - Understanding the Long-Term Vegetation Dynamics of North Korea and Their Impact on the Thermal Environment
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In response to widespread deforestation, North Korea has restored forests through national policy over the past 10 years. Here, the entire process of forest degradation and restoration was evaluated through satellite-based vegetation monitoring, and its effects were also investigated. The vegetation dynamics of North Korea were characterized from 1986 to 2021 using the Landsat satellite 5-7, after which we evaluated the effect of vegetation shifts through changes in surface temperature since the 2000s. Vegetation greenness decreased significantly from the 1980s to the 2000s but increased in recent decades due to forest restoration. During the deforestation period, vegetation in all areas of North Korea tended to decrease, which was particularly noticeable in the provinces of Pyongannam-do and Hamgyongnam-do. During the forest restoration period, increases in vegetation greenness were evident in most regions except for some high-mountainous and developing regions, and the most prominent increase was seen in Pyongyang and Pyongannam-do. According to satellite-based analyses, the land surface temperature exhibited a clear upward trend (average slope = 0.13). However, large regional differences were identified when the analysis was shortened to encompass only the last 10 years. Particularly, the correlation between the area where vegetation improved and the area where the surface temperature decreased was high (-0.32). Moreover, the observed atmospheric temperature increased due to global warming, but only the surface temperature exhibited a decreasing trend, which could be understood by the effect of vegetation restoration. Our results suggest that forest restoration can affect various sectors beyond the thermal environment due to its role as an enhancer of ecosystem services.

TI  - Water Quality Measurement and Modelling Based on Deep Learning Techniques: Case Study for the Parameter of Secchi Disk
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Secchi disk is often used to monitor the transparency of water. However, the results of personal measurement are easily affected by subjective experience and objective environment, and it is time-consuming. With the rapid development of computer technology, using image processing technology is more objective and accurate than personal observation. A transparency measurement algorithm is proposed by combining deep learning, image processing technology, and Secchi disk measurement. The white part of the Secchi disk is cropped by image processing. The classification network based on resnet18 is applied to classify the segmentation results and determine the critical position of the Secchi disk. Then, the semantic segmentation network Deeplabv3+ is used to segment the corresponding water gauge at this position, and subsequently segment the characters on the water gauge. The segmentation results are classified by the classification network based on resnet18. Finally, the transparency value is calculated according to the segmentation and classification results. The results from this algorithm are more accurate and objective than that of personal observation. The experiments show the effectiveness of this algorithm.

TI  - GRACE Combined with WSD to Assess the Change in Drought Severity in Arid Asia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data are widely used in drought studies. In this study, we quantified drought severity based on land terrestrial water storage (TWS) changes in GRACE data. We used the water storage deficit (WSD) and water storage deficit index (WSDI) to identify the drought events and evaluate the drought severity. The WSDI calculated by GRACE provides an effective assessment method when assessing the extent of drought over large areas under a lack of site data. The results show a total of 22 drought events in the central Asian dry zone during the study period. During spring and autumn, the droughts among these incidents occurred more frequently and severely. The longest and most severe drought occurred near the Caspian Sea. In the arid area of central Asia, the north of the region tended to be moist (the WSDI value was 0.04 year(-1)), and the south, east, and Caspian Sea area tended to be drier (the WSDI values were -0.07 year(-1) in the south, -0.11 year(-1) in the east, and -0.19 year(-1) in the Caspian Sea). These study results can provide a key scientific basis for agricultural development, food security, and climate change response in the Asian arid zone.

TI  - SAR Tomography Based on Atomic Norm Minimization in Urban Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) tomography (TomoSAR) is a powerful tool for the three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of buildings in urban areas. At present, the compressed sensing (CS) technique has been widely used in the TomoSAR inversion of urban areas because of the sparsity of the backscattering power of buildings along the elevation direction. However, this algorithm discretizes the elevation and assumes that the scatterers are located on predetermined finite grids. In fact, scatterers can lie anywhere in the elevation direction, regardless of grid point constraints. The phenomenon of scatterer positioning errors due to elevation discretization is called the off-grid effect, which will affect the height estimation accuracy of TomoSAR. To overcome this problem, we proposed a TomoSAR reconstruction algorithm based on atomic norm minimization (Tomo-ANM) in this paper. Tomo-ANM employs ANM, a continuous compressed sensing technique, to obtain scatterer positions on the continuous dictionary, thus eliminating the off-grid effect. Baseline compensation is necessary to obtain the data of virtual uniform baselines or the samples of uniform data during preprocessing. A fast realization of ANM, IVDST, is utilized to accelerate the process. Tomo-ANM was tested through simulation experiments, and the results confirmed the validity of eliminating the influence of off-grid effects and exhibited an improved location accuracy and detection rate in less time compared with the on-grid TomoSAR algorithm SL1MMER. Real data experiments based on eight staring spotlight TerraSAR-X images showed that Tomo-ANM can improve the accuracy of building height estimation by 4.83% relative to its real height.

TI  - Evaluating the Accuracy and Spatial Agreement of Five Global Land Cover Datasets in the Ecologically Vulnerable South China Karst
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and reliable land cover information is vital for ecosystem management and regional sustainable development, especially for ecologically vulnerable areas. The South China Karst, one of the largest and most concentrated karst distribution areas globally, has been undergoing large-scale afforestation projects to combat accelerating land degradation since the turn of the new millennium. Here, we assess five recent and widely used global land cover datasets (i.e., CCI-LC, MCD12Q1, GlobeLand30, GlobCover, and CGLS-LC) for their comparative performances in land dynamics monitoring in the South China Karst during 2000-2020 based on the reference China Land Use/Cover Database. The assessment proceeded from three aspects: areal comparison, spatial agreement, and accuracy metrics. Moreover, divergent responses of overall accuracy with regard to varying terrain and geomorphic conditions have also been quantified. The results reveal that obvious discrepancies exist amongst land cover maps in both area and spatial patterns. The spatial agreement remains low in the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau and heterogeneous mountainous karst areas. Furthermore, the overall accuracy of the five datasets ranges from 40.3% to 52.0%. The CGLS-LC dataset, with the highest accuracy, is the most accurate dataset for mountainous southern China, followed by GlobeLand30 (51.4%), CCI-LC (50.0%), MCD12Q1 (41.4%), and GlobCover (40.3%). Despite the low overall accuracy, MCD12Q1 has the best accuracy in areas with an elevation above 1200 m or a slope greater than 25 degrees. With regard to geomorphic types, accuracy in non-karst areas is evidently higher than in karst areas. Additionally, dataset accuracy declines significantly (p < 0.05) with an increase in landscape heterogeneity in the region. These findings provide useful guidelines for future land cover mapping and dataset fusion.

TI  - Evaluating Effects of Post-Fire Climate and Burn Severity on the Early-Term Regeneration of Forest and Shrub Communities in the San Gabriel Mountains of California from Sentinel-2(MSI) Images
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Studying the early changes in post-fire vegetation communities may improve the overall resilience of forests. The necessity for doing so was demonstrated by the Bobcat Fire, which seriously threatened the central San Gabriel Mountains and the Angeles National Forest in California. This study aimed to monitor and quantify the effects of climatological and topographic conditions along with burn severity on early (within 1 year) post-fire forests and shrubs community regeneration. In this study, we used Sentinel-2(MSI) intensive time-series imagery (July 2020-October 2021) to make a confusion matrix combined with 389 vegetation sample points on Google Earth Pro. The overall accuracy (OA) and the Kappa coefficient, calculated from the confusion matrix, were used as evaluation parameters to validate the classification results. With multiple linear regression models and Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) historical images, we analyzed the effects of climate and slope aspects on the regeneration of post-fire forest and shrub communities. We also quantitatively analyzed the regeneration rates based on five burn severity types. The results show that the normalized burning rate (NBR) was the most accurate vegetation classification indicator in this study (OA: 92.3-99.5%, Kappa: 0.88-0.98). The vegetation classification accuracy based on SVM is about 6.6% higher than K-Means. The overall accuracy of the burn area is 94.87%. Post-fire climate factors had a significant impact on the regeneration of the two vegetation communities (R-2: 0.42-0.88); the optimal regeneration slope was 15-35 degrees; and the fire severity changed the original competition relationship and regeneration rate. The results provide four main insights into the regeneration of post-fire vegetation communities: (1) climate factors in the first regenerating season have important impacts on the regeneration of forest and shrub communities; (2) daytime duration and rainfall are the most significant factors for forests and shrubs regeneration; (3) tolerable low burn severity promotes forests regeneration; and (4) forests have a certain ability to resist fires, while shrubs can better tolerate high-intensity fire ecology. This study could support the implementation of strategies for regionalized forest management and the targeted enhancement of post-fire vegetation community resilience.

TI  - Evaluating Effects of Medium-Resolution Optical Data Availability on Phenology-Based Rice Mapping in China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The phenology-based approach has proven effective for paddy rice mapping due to the unique flooding and transplanting features of rice during the early growing season. However, the method may be greatly affected if no valid observations are available during the flooding and rice transplanting phase. Here, we compare the effects of data availability of different sensors in the critical phenology phase, thereby supporting paddy rice mapping based on phenology-based approaches. Importantly, our study further analyzed the effects of the spatial pattern of the valid observations related to certain factors (i.e., sideslips, clouds, and temporal window lengths of flooding and rice transplanting), which supply the applicable area of the phenology-based approach indications. We first determined the flooding and rice transplanting phase using in situ observational data from agrometeorological stations and remote sensing data, then evaluated the effects of data availability in this phase of 2020 in China using all Landsat-7 and 8 and Sentinel-2 data. The results show that on the country level, the number of average valid observations during the flooding and rice transplanting phase was more than ten for the integration of Landsat and Sentinel images. On the sub-country level, the number of average valid observations was high in the cold temperate zone (17.4 observations), while it was relatively lower in southern China (6.4 observations), especially in Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, which only had three valid observations on average. Based on the multicollinearity test, the three factors are significantly correlated with the absence of valid observations: (R-2 = 0.481) and Std.Coef. (Std. Err.) are 0.306 (0.094), -0.453 (0.003) and -0.547 (0.019), respectively. Overall, these results highlight the substantial spatial heterogeneity of valid observations in China, confirming the reliability of the integration of Landsat-7 and 8 and Sentinel-2 imagery for paddy rice mapping based on phenology-based approaches. This can pave the way for a national-scale effort of rice mapping in China while further indicating potential omission errors in certain cloud-prone regions without sufficient optical observation data, i.e., the Sichuan Basin.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Evolution and Driving Forces of Drying Trends on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau Based on Geomorphological Division
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) is a sensor of global climate change and regional human activities, and drought monitoring will help to achieve its ecological protection and sustainable development. In order to effectively control the geospatial scale effect, we divided the study area into eight geomorphological sub-regions, and calculated the Temperature-Vegetation Drought Index (TVDI) of each geomorphological sub-region based on MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Land Surface Temperature (LST) data, and synthesized the TVDI of the whole region. We employed partial and multiple correlation analyses to identify the relationship between TVDI and temperature and precipitation. The random forest model was further used to study the driving mechanism of TVDI in each geomorphological division. The results of the study were as follows: (1) From 2000 to 2019, the QTP showed a drought trend, with the most significant drought trend in the central region. The spatial pattern of TVDI changes of QTP was consistent with the gradient changes of precipitation and temperature, both showing a gradual trend from southeast to northwest. (2) There was a risk of drought in the four seasons of the QTP, and the seasonal variation of TVDI was significant, which was characterized by being relatively dry in spring and summer and relatively humid in autumn and winter. (3) Drought in the QTP was mainly driven by natural factors, supplemented by human factors. The driving effect of temperature and precipitation factors on TVDI was stable and significant, which mainly determined the spatial distribution and variation of TVDI of the QTP. Geomorphological factors led to regional intensification and local differentiation effects of drought, especially in high mountains, flat slopes, sunny slopes and other places, which had a more significant impact on TVDI. Human activities had local point-like and linear impacts, and grass-land and cultivated land that were closely related to the relatively high impacts on TVDI of human grazing and farming activities. In view of the spatial-temporal patterns of change in TVDI in the study area, it is important to strengthen the monitoring and early warning of changes in natural factors, optimize the spatial distribution of human activities, and scientifically promote ecological protection and restoration.

TI  - Effects of Monocropping on Land Cover Transitions in the Wet Evergreen Agro-Ecological Zone of Ghana
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The wet evergreen forest ecological zone of Ghana is undergoing notable structural changes, although most maps erroneously depict the area to be an intact forest. Several hectares of plantation agriculture such as rubber, oil palm, and cocoa are replacing the natural vegetation and habitats, thereby threatening indigenous biodiversity. This study aimed to assess the effects of tree monocrop proliferation on landscape transitions between 1986 and 2020 in the Wassa East District of Ghana. The ISODATA clustering technique was used to produce land cover category maps from Landsat images of 1986, 2002, and 2020. A post-classification change detection technique resulted in transition matrices which were used for the computation of land cover transition intensities over 34 years. The results showed that the landscape was dominated by forests in 1986. Still, the forest continuously declined by 34% (1% annually) in 2020 while all other land cover types increased in both periods with cocoa covering 23% oil palm covering 14%, and rubber covering 2% of the land area. These conversions in the land area are important, especially since the closed forests usually transition to monocrops through the intermediate process: food crop farming. This information is essential for decision making on land development and biodiversity conservation.

TI  - Accurate Evaluation of Feature Contributions for Sentinel Lymph Node Status Classification in Breast Cancer
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The current guidelines recommend the sentinel lymph node biopsy to evaluate the lymph node involvement for breast cancer patients with clinically negative lymph nodes on clinical or radiological examination. Machine learning (ML) models have significantly improved the prediction of lymph nodes status based on clinical features, thus avoiding expensive, time-consuming and invasive procedures. However, the classification of sentinel lymph node status represents a typical example of an unbalanced classification problem. In this work, we developed a ML framework to explore the effects of unbalanced populations on the performance and stability of feature ranking for sentinel lymph node status classification in breast cancer. Our results indicate state-of-the-art AUC (Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) values on a hold-out set (67%) while providing particularly stable features related to tumor size, histological subtype and estrogen receptor expression, which should therefore be considered as potential biomarkers.

TI  - Deforestation, forest degradation, and land use dynamics in the Northeastern Ecuadorian Amazon
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover transformations throughout the Amazon basin have significantly intensified in recent decades due to increased human activity. Using a land change science approach, combining remotely sensed data, field obser-vations, and multinomial regression analysis, this article evaluates deforestation and forest degradation between 2013 and 2019 in the Northeastern Ecuadorian Amazon. Results show that the likelihood of deforestation is associated with proximity to markets and population centers, distance to main roads and waterways, road density, population density, and terrain conditions. The study suggests that although deforestation rates have remained relatively unchanged, or even decreased in comparison to the early 2000s, the fragmentation of sec-ondary forests due to the expansion of African palm cultivation and other forms of agriculture is an issue of concern. The information presented in this study may assist decision makers in planning local and geolocated interventions that directly respond to the socio-environmental contexts of Amazonian communities.

TI  - Multi-Task Learning of Relative Height Estimation and Semantic Segmentation from Single Airborne RGB Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The generation of topographic classification maps or relative heights from aerial or remote sensing images represents a crucial research tool in remote sensing. On the one hand, from auto-driving, three-dimensional city modeling, road design, and resource statistics to smart cities, each task requires relative height data and classification data of objects. On the other hand, most relative height data acquisition methods currently use multiple images. We find that relative height and geographic classification data can be mutually assisted through data distribution. In recent years, with the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, it has become possible to estimate the relative height from a single image. It learns implicit mapping relationships in a data-driven manner that may not be explicitly available through mathematical modeling. On this basis, we propose a unified, in-depth learning structure that can generate both estimated relative height maps and semantically segmented maps and perform end-to-end training. Compared with the existing methods, our task is to perform both relative height estimation and semantic segmentation tasks simultaneously. We only need one picture to obtain the corresponding semantically segmented images and relative heights simultaneously. The model's performance is much better than that of equivalent computational models. We also designed dynamic weights to enable the model to learn relative height estimation and semantic segmentation simultaneously. At the same time, we have conducted good experiments on existing datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed Transformer-based network architecture is suitable for relative height estimation tasks and vastly outperforms other state-of-the-art DL (Deep Learning) methods.

TI  - Generating Daily Soil Moisture at 16 m Spatial Resolution Using a Spatiotemporal Fusion Model and Modified Perpendicular Drought Index
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) is an important parameter in land surface processes and the global water cycle. Remote sensing technologies are widely used to produce global-scale SM products (e.g., European Space Agency's Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI)). However, the current spatial resolutions of such products are low (e.g., >3 km). In recent years, using auxiliary data to downscale the spatial resolutions of SM products has been a hot research topic in the remote sensing research area. A new method, which spatially downscalesan SM product to generate a daily SM dataset at a 16 m spatial resolution based on a spatiotemporal fusion model (STFM) and modified perpendicular drought index (MPDI), was proposed in this paper. (1) First, a daily surface reflectance dataset with a 16 m spatial resolution was produced based on an STFM. (2) Then, a spatial scale conversion factor (SSCF) dataset was obtained by an MPDI dataset, which was calculated based on the dataset fused in the first step. (3) Third, a downscaled daily SM product with a 16 m spatial resolution was generated by combining the SSCF dataset and the original SM product. Five cities in southern Hebei Province were selected as study areas. Two 16 m GF6 images and nine 500 m MOD09GA images were used as auxiliary data to downscale a timeseries 25 km CCI SM dataset for nine dates from May to June 2019. A total of 151 in situ SM observations collected on 1 May, 21 May, 1 June, and 11 June were used for verification. The results indicated that the downscaled SM data with a 16 m spatial resolution had higher correlation coefficients and lower RMSE values compared with the original CCI SM data. The correlation coefficients between the downscaled SM data and in situ data ranged from 0.45 to 0.67 versus 0.33 to 0.54 for the original CCI SM data; the RMSE values ranged from 0.023 to 0.031 cm(3)/cm(3) versus 0.027 to 0.032 cm(3)/cm(3) for the original CCI SM data. The findings described in this paper can ensure effective farmland management and other practical production applications.

TI  - Semiempirical compensated optimal coherence amplitude method to invert forest height based on InSAR
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) is an important resource for rapidly obtaining forest height information. The coherence amplitude method relies solely on interferometric coherence amplitude information for forest height inversion; however, interferometric data are commonly affected by decorrelation factors including time, baseline, and noise decorrelation, as well as observation geometry errors, leading to errors in estimated forest height. Thus, in this paper, we propose a method to improve the accuracy of forest height estimation by correcting the decorrelation and vertical wave number using a priori forest height knowledge. UAVSAR-L cross-polarization channel HV data from the AfriSAR project are used as interferometric data to invert the forest height using the coherence amplitude method, and the relative height variable RH100 from land, vegetation, and ice sensor light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is used for validation. We optimize the coherence amplitude method by iteratively setting different steps for the nonvolume decorrelation (gamma(d)) and the correction parameter (tau) for the vertical wavenumber (k(z)). The optimal compensation parameter is identified when the root mean square error (RMSE) between the inversion height and LiDAR height is minimized, and the stability of the returned parameter is evaluated through an independent validation sample. Our results indicate that enhancing the coherence amplitude method using a semiempirical iterative approach can effectively improve inversion accuracy. In the validation results, all compensation schemes exhibit a significant improvement in the inversion results compared with those without parameter compensation. The R-2 increases by 0.13 and the RMSE decreases by 9.88 m when compensating only gamma(d), whereas the R-2 value does not change when only compensating k(z), but the RMSE decreases by 19.24 m. When compensating for both gamma(d) and k(z), the R-2 increases by 0.08, and the RMSE decreases by 19.73 m. This changing pattern is consistent with that recorded in the training sample, indicating that our proposed parameter compensation scheme for the coherence amplitude method is effective. With the widespread usage of satellite data, such as ALOS-2 and SAOCOM, as well as the future TanDEM-L and BIOMASS satellites and NISAR program, the combination of ICESat-2 and GEDI forest height data to compensate and optimize inversion results and model parameters is expected to greatly improve the efficiency of forest resource monitoring in the future.

TI  - A modified hydrologic model for examining the capability of global gridded PET products in improving hydrological simulation accuracy of surface runoff, streamflow and baseflow
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET), which links water and energy exchanges between atmosphere, land surface and underground water, significantly affects hydrological modelling. However, accurate ET estimation is still a great challenge for hydrological models. Currently, most hydrological models obtain ET mainly from their builtin potential evapotranspiration (PET) modules due to lack of observations. Note that the ET obtained in this way cannot be verified by observations and inevitably brings large model uncertainty. Fortunately, several PET products have been produced based on satellite remote sensing and/or reanalysis climate model output with global coverage and high spatiotemporal resolution, providing a great opportunity for tunning hydrological models. However, the accuracy of global gridded PET products varies in different regions. It is still unknown whether PET products can improve the accuracy of hydrological simulation, and how different resolutions and input types (lumped/distributed) of PET products affect the performance of hydrological models. The question about how hydrological models will be further developed in combination with PET products is also not well answered, given the complexity in interaction between ET and other water cycle variables. In this study, a modified Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was chosen to examine the capability of PET products in improving hydrological simulation in terms of surface runoff, streamflow and baseflow, together with the Shaying River Basin in China as a case study. Two Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) PET products were employed to form various PET scenarios. Results indicate that PET products are significantly different from the PET simulated by the SWAT built-in PET module in terms of spatial distribution and magnitudes. According to statistical metrics, the use of PET products to replace the SWAT built-in PET module can improve the accuracy of hydrological simulation compared with the original SWAT using its built-in PET module. The distributed input and higher spatial resolution of PET products are more conducive to improve the accuracy of hydrological simulation. Our research shows that both improving the accuracy of PET products and balancing water budget closure are critical for accurate hydrological modeling. These conclusions obtained based on MODIS products were further verified against a hourly PET data product (hPET). This study provides insights into understanding the use of PET products in improving the accuracy of hydrological simulation. The study findings can provide a beneficial reference for the further development of hydrological models in combination with PET products.

TI  - Linkage of Strong Intraseasonal Events of the East Asian Winter Monsoon to the Tropical Convections over the Western Pacific
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) is the most important climate system for transporting Arctic cold air to the tropics in boreal winter. Rapid intensification of the EAWM, such as a cold surge, can lead to increased tropical convection over the western Pacific, but the possible effects from the intraseasonal variation of EAWM is unclear. Using high temporal and spatial resolution satellite data, including Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation, we show that strong intraseasonal EAWM events are associated with increased tropical convection over the western Pacific for about 6-8 days. Our statistical analysis shows that the lifetime of a strong intraseasonal EAWM event is about 2 weeks, with the beginning, peak, and ending phases occurring at days -6, 0, and 6, respectively. During days 0 to 8, increased convection is observed over the western tropical Pacific, due to the anomalous convergence associated with the strengthened northerly winds over the South China Sea. Over land, increased precipitation is observed over Vietnam, northwestern Kalimantan, and the southern Philippines. In addition, the East Asian local Hadley circulation is strengthened during these days, in association with the enhanced tropical convection.

TI  - Seasonal Variability in Chlorophyll and Air-Sea CO<sub>2</sub> Flux in the Sri Lanka Dome: Hydrodynamic Implications
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multiple upwelling systems develop in the Indian Ocean during the summer monsoon. The Sri Lanka dome (SLD), which occurs in the open ocean off the east coast of Sri Lanka from June to September, is distinct from those near the coast. The SLD is characterized by uplifted thermocline and increased chlorophyll concentration. Mechanisms of the upwelling and its biogeochemical response are not well understood. Here, we explored the dynamics of the chlorophyll and sea-to-air CO2 flux in the SLD using ocean color and altimetry remote sensing data, together with other reanalysis products. We found that the occurrence of high chlorophyll concentration and sea-to-air CO2 flux happens along the pathway of the southwest monsoon current (SMC). The annual cycle of chlorophyll in the SLD has a one-month lag relative to that in the southern coast of Sri Lanka. The positive wind stress curl that forms in the SLD during the summer does not fully explain the seasonal chlorophyll maximum. Transport of the SMC, eddy activity, and associated frontal processes also play an important role in regulating the variability in chlorophyll. In the SLD, upwelled subsurface water has excess dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) relative to the conventional Redfield ratio between DIC and nutrients; thus, upwelling and sub-mesoscale processes determine this region to be a net carbon source to the atmosphere.

TI  - The Role of redo-Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Patients With Prior Ipsilateral Breast Cancer Surgery
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - This a retrospective study comparing redo-Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (reSLNB) and Axillary node sample looking at patients with recurrence with history of breast-conserving surgery. Our data shows that 35(72.9%) of reSLNB were successful with node positivity that is comparable to Axillary node sampling. reSLNB success rate was lower amongst patients with previous axillary surgery and previous positive nodes. Background: Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (SLNB) is used to stage the axilla, but there is limited data in patients with prior ipsilateral breast cancer. This study compares redo-SLNB (reSLNB) and Axillary node sample (ANS) in this sub-cohort of patients. Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective study looking at patients with a new ipsilateral primary or recurrence with history of breast-conserving surgery. Planned and performed surgery, patient demographics and previous treatments were recorded. Node positivity and success rate of reSLNB was analyzed. Results: A total of 86 patients were identified that had mastectomy for ipsilateral recurrent disease with radiologically negative axilla. Out of the 48 that had reSLNB, 35(72.9%) were successful. Nineteen percent of the reSLNB had positive axillae and 20% of the ANS patients. reSLNB success rate was significantly lower amongst patients with previous axillary surgery ( P = .014) and previous positive nodes( P = .001). Conclusion: reSLNB should be considered to restage the axilla in patients with previous history of ipsilateral cancer especially that there is growing evidence showing good identification rate.

TI  - Impervious Surface Prediction in Marrakech City using Artificial Neural Network
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Determining an impervious surface is one of the most important topics of remote sensing because of its great role in providing information that benefits decision-makers in urban planning, sustainable development goals, and environmental protection. In recent years, a great development in this field has occurred due to the huge improvement in the algorithms and techniques that are used to map impervious surfaces. In this paper, the deep learning technique has been implemented to investigate the extraction of impervious surfaces in Marrakesh city, based on Landsat images. 9000 polygons and 13840 points have been taken to prepare label data by random forest in Google Earth Engine (GEE). In addition, all preprocessing steps for remote sensing images have been implemented in GEE. An artificial neural network (ANN) has been used to determine impervious surfaces. After training and testing the proposed network on Landsat image datasets, precision, accuracy, recall, and F1-score matrix scores were 0.79, 0.98, 0.87, and 0.82, respectively. The experimental results show that this method is efficient and precise for mapping the impervious surfaces of Marrakesh city.

TI  - Haemodynamic predisposition to acute kidney injury: Shadow and light!
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIOLOGY CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Acute kidney injury (AKI) could well be regarded as a sentinel complication given it is relatively common and associated with a substantial risk of subsequent morbidity and mortality. On the aegis of 'prevention is better than cure', there has been a wide interest in evaluating haemodynamic predisposition to AKI so as to provide a favourable renoprotective haemodynamic milieu to the subset of patients presenting a significant risk of developing AKI. In this context, the last decade has witnessed a series of evaluation of the hypotension value and duration cut-offs associated with risk of AKI across diverse non-operative and operative settings. Nevertheless, a holistic comprehension of the haemodynamic predisposition to AKI has been a laggard with only few reports highlighting the potential of elevated central venous pressure, intra-abdominal hypertension and high mean airway pressures in considerably attenuating the effective renal perfusion, particularly in scenarios where kidneys are highly sensitive to any untoward elevation in the afterload. Despite the inherent autoregulatory mechanisms, the effective renal perfusion pressure (RPP) can be modulated by a number of haemodynamic factors in addition to mean arterial pressure (MAP) as the escalation of renal interstitial pressure, in particular hampers kidney perfusion which in itself is a dynamic interplay of a number of innate pressures. The present article aims to review the subject of haemodynamic predisposition to AKI centralising the focus on effective RPP (over and above the conventional 'tunnel-vision' for MAP) and discuss the relevant literature accumulating in this area of ever-growing clinical interest

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present investigation, various morphotectonic indices were computed through analysis of digital elevation model (DEM) (30 m) in the geographic information system (GIS) to assess the imprints of active tectonics on the evolution of the sedimentary landscape in Lower Right Painganga (LRP) basin of central India. Studies on morphotectonics and their imprints on the evolution of the Painganga basin in Central India were found to be limited to properly understand the tectonics setup and evolution of the fluvial landscape. The LRP basin is characterized by Limestone formations of the Painganga group in the western and dissected outcrops in the central, northern, and eastern parts. Denudational hills, plateau, pediments, pediplain and alluvial plain are the dominant landforms in the basin. The slope of the basin ranges from level to nearly level (0-1%) to steeply sloping (> 30%). Drainage anomalies and well-developed triangular facets facilitates to comprehend the neotectonic activity. Basin shape index (Bs) shows relatively higher neotectonic activity in the LRP basin. Field evidences disclose various sedimentary landscapes like Quaternary alluvium, alluvial fans, anomalies in the stream patterns, river meandering, alluvial terraces, triangular facets, boulder-pebbly beds, natural levees, alluvium, and limestone deposits, which shows that the basin has experienced a neotectonic activity in the recent past. In conjunction with field evidences, morphotectonic indices derived from SRTM DEM 30 m, remote sensing data, and GIS significantly helped in inferring the tectonic imprints on the evolution of the fluvial landscape in the LRP basin.

TI  - Evaluation of SAR and Optical Image Fusion Methods in Oil Palm Crop Cover Classification Using the Random Forest Algorithm
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents an evaluation of land cover accuracy, particularly regarding oil palm crop cover, using optical/synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image fusion methods through the implementation of the random forest (RF) algorithm on cloud computing platforms using Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 optical images. Among the fusion methods evaluated were Brovey (BR), high-frequency modulation (HFM), Gram-Schmidt (GS), and principal components (PC). This work was developed using a cloud computing environment employing R and Python for statistical analysis. It was found that an optical/SAR image stack resulted in the best overall accuracy with 82.14%, which was 11.66% higher than that of the SAR image, and 7.85% higher than that of the optical image. The high-frequency modulation (HFM) and Brovey (BR) image fusion methods showed overall accuracies higher than the Sentinel-2 optical image classification by 3.8% and 3.09%, respectively. This demonstrates the potential of integrating optical imagery with Sentinel SAR imagery to increase land cover classification accuracy. On the other hand, the SAR images obtained very high accuracy results in classifying oil palm crops and forests, reaching 94.29% and 90%, respectively. This demonstrates the ability of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to provide more information when fused with an optical image to improve land cover classification.

AB  - In 2020, Argentina implemented Preventive and Compulsory Social Isolation (ASPO) in the context of the global pandemic caused by the COVID-19 virus. This historical event has led to a decline in economic activities and the movement of the population. Current studies show a decrease in greenhouse gases harmful to health in the atmosphere due to health measures applied to contain the virus. Southwest Buenos Aires (Argentine Republic) is not exempt from these effects. The article aims to analyze the variations of the NO2 levels in pre-pandemic scenarios and during the pandemic. These results indicated a gradual decrease of NO2 related to the decrease in traffic and anthropogenic activities throughout the region, with a significant impact in big cities.

TI  - Investigating Phases of Thermal Unrest at Ambrym (Vanuatu) Volcano through the Normalized Hot Spot Indices Tool and the Integration with the MIROVA System
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ambrym is an active volcanic island, located in the Vanuatu archipelago, consisting of a 12 km-wide summit caldera. This open vent volcano is characterized by an almost persistent degassing activity which occurs in the Benbow and Marum craters, which were also the site of recent lava lakes. On 15 December 2018, about three years after an intense lava effusion, the first recorded since 1989, a small-scale intra-caldera fissure eruption occurred. On 16 December, the eruption stopped, and the lava lakes at the Benbow and Marum craters were drained. In this work, we investigated the thermal activity of the Ambrym volcano, before, during, and after the 15 December 2018 eruption, using daytime Sentinel-2 (S2) Multispectral Instruments (MSI) and Landsat-8 (L8) Operational Land Imager (OLI) data, at a mid-high spatial resolution. The results were integrated with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations. Outputs of the Normalized Hotspot Indices (NHI) tool, retrieved from S2-MSI and L8-OLI data, show that the thermal activity at the Ambrym craters increased about three weeks before the 15 December 2018 lava effusion. This information is consistent with the estimates of volcanic radiative power (VRP), which were performed by the Middle Infrared Observation of Volcanic Activity (MIROVA) system, by analyzing the nighttime MODIS data. The latter revealed a significant increase of VRP, with values above 700 MW at the end of the October-November 2018 period. Moreover, the drastic reduction of thermal emissions at the craters, marked by the NHI tool since the day of the fissure eruption, is consistent with the drop in the lava lake level that was independently suggested in a previous study. These results demonstrate that the S2-MSI and L8-OLI time series, combined with infrared MODIS observations, may contribute to detecting increasing trends in lava lake activity, which may precede effusive eruptions at the open vent volcanoes. This study addresses some challenging scenarios regarding the definition of possible threshold levels (e.g., in terms of VRP and total Short Wave Infrared radiance) from the NHI and MIROVA datasets, which could require special attention from local authorities in terms of the occurrence of possible future eruptions.

M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. As healthcare expenditures continue to rise, identifying mechanisms to reduce unnecessary costs is critical. The objective of this study is to estimate the annual cost of wasted indocyanine green (ICG) used for sentinel lymph node mapping in patients with endometrial cancer.Methods. Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program database and Premier database, we determined the annual number of cases in which sentinel lymph node mapping with ICG would be used and the median cost of ICG to institutions and patients, respectively. We assumed that gynecologic oncologists use 2-4 mL (20-40%) of the currently available ICG vial kit (25 mg per 10 mL) per case. Estimated waste was then calculated using cost as a measure of institutional waste and charge as excess cost transferred to patients or payers.Results. An estimated 45,864 cases of localized endometrial cancer were identified and eligible for sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping. The mean total cost associated with ICG was 99.20 and the mean charge was $483.64. The estimated excess annual cost to hospitals was $2,729,825 to $3,639,767. Similarly, using mean charge data, the annual cost of wasted drug for patients and payers was $13,308,999 to $17,745,332.Conclusions. The annual cost of wasted ICG due to its current manufactured vial size exceeds $2 million for hospitals and $13.3-$17.7 million for patients. We suggest ICG vials should be packaged in a 10 mg vial kit (2-4 mL sterile solution) to avoid drug waste and the financial impact to institutions and patients.(c) 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Change Detection Techniques with Synthetic Aperture Radar Images: Experiments with Random Forests and Sentinel-1 Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This work aims to clarify the potential of incoherent and coherent change detection (CD) approaches for detecting and monitoring ground surface changes using sequences of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Nowadays, the growing availability of remotely sensed data collected by the twin Sentinel-1A/B sensors of the European (EU) Copernicus constellation allows fast mapping of damage after a disastrous event using radar data. In this research, we address the role of SAR (amplitude) backscattered signal variations for CD analyses when a natural (e.g., a fire, a flash flood, etc.) or a human-induced (disastrous) event occurs. Then, we consider the additional pieces of information that can be recovered by comparing interferometric coherence maps related to couples of SAR images collected between a principal disastrous event date. This work is mainly concerned with investigating the capability of different coherent/incoherent change detection indices (CDIs) and their mutual interactions for the rapid mapping of "changed" areas. In this context, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms have been demonstrated to be beneficial for handling the different information coming from coherent/incoherent CDIs in a unique corpus. Specifically, we used CDIs that synthetically describe ground surface changes associated with a disaster event (i.e., the pre-, cross-, and post-disaster phases), based on the generation of sigma nought and InSAR coherence maps. Then, we trained a random forest (RF) to produce CD maps and study the impact on the final binary decision (changed/unchanged) of the different layers representing the available synthetic CDIs. The proposed strategy was effective for quickly assessing damage using SAR data and can be applied in several contexts. Experiments were conducted to monitor wildfire's effects in the 2021 summer season in Italy, considering two case studies in Sardinia and Sicily. Another experiment was also carried out on the coastal city of Houston, Texas, the US, which was affected by a large flood in 2017; thus, demonstrating the validity of the proposed integrated method for fast mapping of flooded zones using SAR data.

TI  - AUnet: A Deep Learning Framework for Surface Water Channel Mapping Using Large-Coverage Remote Sensing Images and Sparse Scribble Annotations from OSM Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water is a vital component of life that exists in a variety of forms, including oceans, rivers, ponds, streams, and canals. The automated methods for detecting, segmenting, and mapping surface water have improved significantly with the advancements in satellite imagery and remote sensing. Many strategies and techniques to segment water resources have been presented in the past. However, due to the variant width and complex appearance, the segmentation of the water channel remains challenging. Moreover, traditional supervised deep learning frameworks have been restricted by the scarcity of water channel datasets that include precise water annotations. With this in mind, this research presents the following three main contributions. Firstly, we curated a new dataset for water channel mapping in the Pakistani region. Instead of employing pixel-level water channel annotations, we used a weakly trained method to extract water channels from VHR pictures, relying only on OpenStreetMap (OSM) waterways to create sparse scribbling annotations. Secondly, we benchmarked the dataset on state-of-the-art semantic segmentation frameworks. We also proposed AUnet, an atrous convolution inspired deep learning network for precise water channel segmentation. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed AUnet model for segmenting using weakly supervised labels, where it achieved a mean intersection over union score of 0.8791 and outperformed state-of-the-art approaches by 5.90% for the extraction of water channels.

TI  - Studying dual-sensor time-series remote sensing data for <i>Dalbergia sissoo</i> mapping in a Lesser Himalayan area
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Information about species mapping is an essential approach for the management of forests and sustainable practices of conservation. Remote sensing data have proven to be an asset for the assessment of the spatial distribution of species over time. We used time-series data from a single sensor (PlanetScope) and dual-sensor (PlanetScope with Sentinel-2) to map Dalbergia sissoo, a timber species, found on both sides of the Jakhan river in Dehradun district of Lesser Himalaya. The dimensionality of the temporal images was reduced by normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and class-based sensor independent NDVI (CBSI-NDVI). Separability analysis was conducted to find optimal dates of the data set using three measures of separability, and Euclidean distance was found to be the best measure of separability for both the indices. Due to limitations of the classifiers in handling mixed pixels, a fuzzy-based modified possibilistic c-means (MPCM) algorithm was tested to extract a single class, i.e., Shisham (Dalbergia sissoo) tree. We used the conventional mean and individual sample as mean (ISM) as training parameter concepts in the MPCM supervised classification approach. We found that the ISM approach was able to handle the heterogeneity within the class for both vegetation indices. It was seen that PlanetScope data were able to spatially map the target class in a better way, whereas combined data of PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 helped to reduce the spectral overlap between target and nontarget classes. An accuracy assessment was performed using mean membership difference, variance, and entropy where variance and entropy showed that NDVI-based ISM approach outperformed the CBSI-NDVI-based approach. Both single-and dual-sensor time-series data showed good classification results for single species extraction. (C) 2022 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Using Deep Learning and Very-High-Resolution Imagery to Map Smallholder Field Boundaries
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The mapping of field boundaries can provide important information for increasing food production and security in agricultural systems across the globe. Remote sensing can provide a viable way to map field boundaries across large geographic extents, yet few studies have used satellite imagery to map boundaries in systems where field sizes are small, heterogeneous, and irregularly shaped. Here we used very-high-resolution WorldView-3 satellite imagery (0.5 m) and a mask region-based convolutional neural network (Mask R-CNN) to delineate smallholder field boundaries in Northeast India. We found that our models had overall moderate accuracy, with average precision values greater than 0.67 and F1 Scores greater than 0.72. We also found that our model performed equally well when applied to another site in India for which no data were used in the calibration step, suggesting that Mask R-CNN may be a generalizable way to map field boundaries at scale. Our results highlight the ability of Mask R-CNN and very-high-resolution imagery to accurately map field boundaries in smallholder systems.

TI  - Retrieving Inland Reservoir Water Quality Parameters Using Landsat 8-9 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI Sensors with Empirical Multivariate Regression
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Improving water quality is one of the top priorities in the global agenda endorsed by the United Nations. To ensure the achievement of this goal, governments have developed plans to continuously monitor the status of inland waters. Remote sensing provides a low-cost, high-frequency, and practical complement to monitoring systems that can cover a large area. However, it is crucial to evaluate the suitability of sensors for retrieving water quality parameters (WQPs), owing to differences in spatial and spectral sampling from different satellites. Taking Shanmei Reservoir in Fuzhou City, Fujian Province as a case study, this study collected and sorted the water quality data measured at the site in 2020 to 2022 and Landsat 8-9 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI images, simulated the chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration, algae density, and turbidity using empirical multivariate regression, and explored the relationship between different WQPs using correlation analysis and principal component analysis (PCA). The results showed that the fitting effect of Landsat OLI data was better than that of the Sentinel-2 MSI data. The coefficient of determination (R-2) values of Chl-a, algal density, and turbidity simulated by Landsat OLI data were 0.70, 0.81, and 0.80, respectively. Furthermore, the parameters of its validation equation were also smaller than those of Sentinel MSI data. The spatial distribution of three key WQPs retrieved from Landsat OLI data shows their values were generally low, with the mean values of the Chl-a concentration, algal density, and turbidity being 4.25 mu g/L, 4.11 x 10(6) cells/L, and 1.86 NTU, respectively. However, from the end of February 2022, the values of the Chl-a concentration and algae density in the reservoir gradually increase, and the risk of water eutrophication also increases. Therefore, it is still necessary to pay continuous attention and formulate corresponding water quality management measures. The correlation analysis shows that the three key WQPs in this study have a high correlation with pH, water temperature (WT), and dissolved oxygen (DO). The results of PCA showed that pH, DO, Chl-a concentration, WT, TN, and CODMn were dominant in PC1, explaining 35.57% of the total variation, and conductivity, algal density, and WT were dominant in PC2, explaining 13.34% of the total variation. Therefore, the water quality of the Shanmei Reservoir can be better evaluated by measuring pH, conductivity, and WT at the monitoring station, or by establishing the regression fitting equations between DO, CODMn, and TN. The regression algorithm used in this study can identify the most important water quality features in the Shanmei Reservoir, which can be used to monitor the nutritional status of the reservoir and provide a reference for other similar inland water bodies.

TI  - Impacts and Implications of Land Use Land Cover Dynamics on Groundwater Recharge and Surface Runoff in East African Watershed
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing the spatiotemporal dynamics of land use land cover (LULC) change on water resources is vital for watershed sustainability and developing proper management strategies. Evaluating LULC scenarios synergistically with hydrologic modeling affords substantial evidence of factors that govern hydrologic processes. Hence, this study assessed the spatiotemporal effects and implications of LULC dynamics on groundwater recharge and surface runoff in Gilgel Gibe, an East African watershed, using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. Three different LULC maps (2000, 2010, and 2020) were derived from Landsat images, and the comparisons pointed out that the land-use pattern had changed significantly. The agricultural land and grassland cover increased by 3.76% and 1.36%, respectively, from 2000 to 2020. The implications acquired for 2000 show that forested land covers decreased by 5.49% in 2020. The SWAT simulation process was executed using a digital elevation model, soil, LULC, and weather data. The model was calibrated and validated using streamflow data to understand the surface runoff and groundwater recharge responses of each Hydrologic Response Units on reference simulation periods using the Calibration and Uncertainty Program (SWAT-CUP), Sequential Uncertainty Fitting (SUFI-2) algorithm. The observed and simulated streamflows were checked for performance indices of coefficient of determination (R-2), Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (NSE), and percent bias (PBIAS) on monthly time steps. The results show that there is good agreement for all LULC simulations, both calibration and validation periods (R-2 & NSE >= 0.84, -15 < PBIAS < +15). This reveals that for the LULC assessment of any hydrological modeling, the simulation of each reference period should be calibrated to have reasonable outputs. The study indicated that surface runoff has increased while groundwater decreased over the last two decades. The temporal variation revealed that the highest recharge and runoff occurred during the wet seasons. Thus, the study can support maximizing water management strategies and reducing adverse driving environmental forces.

TI  - Assessing the Yield of Wheat Using Satellite Remote Sensing-Based Machine Learning Algorithms and Simulation Modeling
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, estimating crop acreage and yield is one of the most critical issues that policy and decision makers need for assessing annual crop productivity and food supply. Nowadays, satellite remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) can enable the estimation of these crop production parameters over large geographic areas. The present work aims to estimate the wheat (Triticum aestivum) acreage and yield of Maharajganj, Uttar Pradesh, India, using satellite-based data products and the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model. Uttar Pradesh is the largest wheat-producing state in India, and this district is well known for its quality organic wheat. India is the leader in wheat grain export, and, hence, its monitoring of growth and yield is one of the top economic priorities of the country. For the calculation of wheat acreage, we performed supervised classification using the Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine classifiers and compared their classification accuracy based on ground-truthing. We found that RF performed a significantly accurate acreage assessment (kappa coefficient 0.84) compared to SVM (0.68). The CASA model was then used to calculate the winter crop (Rabi, winter-sown, and summer harvested) wheat net primary productivity (NPP) in the study area for the 2020-2021 growth season using the RF-based acreage product. The model used for wheat NPP-yield conversion (CASA) showed 3100.27 to 5000.44 kg/ha over 148,866 ha of the total wheat area. The results showed that in the 2020-2021 growing season, all the districts of Uttar Pradesh had similar wheat growth trends. A total of 30 observational data points were used to verify the CASA model-based estimates of wheat yield. Field-based verification shows that the estimated yield correlates well with the observed yield (R-2 = 0.554, RMSE = 3.36 Q/ha, MAE -0.56 t ha(-1), and MRE = -4.61%). Such an accuracy for assessing regional wheat yield can prove to be one of the promising methods for calculating the whole region's agricultural yield. The study concludes that RF classifier-based yield estimation has shown more accurate results and can meet the requirements of a regional-scale wheat grain yield estimation and, thus, can prove highly beneficial in policy and decision making.

TI  - Replacement of the Alpha variant of SARS-CoV-2 by the Delta variant in Lebanon between April and June 2021
T2  - MICROBIAL GENOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic continues to expand globally, with case numbers rising in many areas of the world, including the Eastern Mediterranean Region. Lebanon experienced its largest wave of COVID-19 infections from January to April 2021. Limited genomic surveillance was undertaken, with just 26 SARS-CoV-2 genomes available for this period, nine of which were from travellers from Lebanon detected by other countries. Additional genome sequencing is thus needed to allow surveillance of variants in circulation. In total, 905 SARS-CoV-2 genomes were sequenced using the ARTIC protocol. The genomes were derived from SARS-CoV-2-positive samples, selected retrospectively from the sentinel COVID-19 surveillance network, to capture diversity of location, sampling time, sex, nationality and age. Although 16 PANGO lineages were circulating in Lebanon in January 2021, by February there were just four, with the Alpha variant accounting for 97% of samples. In the following 2 months, all samples contained the Alpha variant. However, this had changed dramatically by June and July 2021, when all samples belonged to the Delta variant. This study documents a ten-fold increase in the number of SARS-CoV-2 genomes available from Lebanon. The Alpha variant, first detected in the UK, rapidly swept through Lebanon, causing the country's largest wave to date, which peaked in January 2021. The Alpha variant was introduced to Lebanon multiple times despite travel restrictions, but the source of these introductions remains uncertain. The Delta variant was detected in Gambia in travellers from Lebanon in mid-May, suggesting community transmission in Lebanon several weeks before this variant was detected in the country. Prospective sequencing in June/July 2021 showed that the Delta variant had completely replaced the Alpha variant in under 6 weeks.

TI  - Digital Mapping of Land Cover Changes Using the Fusion of SAR and MSI Satellite Data
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this article is to choose the most appropriate method for identifying and managing land cover changes over time. These processes intensify due to human activities such as agriculture, urbanisation and deforestation. The study is based in the remote sensing field. The authors used four different methods of satellite image segmentation with different data: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Sentinel-1 data, Multispectral Imagery (MSI) Sentinel-2 images and a fusion of these data. The images were preprocessed under segmentation by special algorithms and the European Space Agency Sentinel Application Platform (ESA SNAP) toolbox. The analysis was performed in the western part of Lithuania, which is characterised by diverse land use. The techniques applied during the study were: the coherence of two SAR images; the method when SAR and MSI images are segmented separately and the results of segmentation are fused; the method when SAR and MSI data are fused before land cover segmentation; and an upgraded method of SAR and MSI data fusion by adding additional formulas and index images. The 2018 and 2019 results obtained for SAR image segmentation differ from the MSI segmentation results. Urban areas are poorly identified because of the similarity of spectre signatures, where urban areas overlap with classes such as nonvegetation and/or sandy territories. Therefore, it is necessary to include the field surveys in the calculations in order to improve the reliability and accuracy of the results. The authors are of the opinion that the calculation of the additional indexes may help to enhance the visibility of vegetation and urban area classes. These indexes, calculated based on two or more different bands of multispectral images, would help to improve the accuracy of the segmentation results.

TI  - Double Effect of Urbanization on Vegetation Growth in China's 35 Cities during 2000-2020
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, the trade-off between urbanization and vegetation dynamics has broken the balance between human activities and social-economic dimensions. Our understanding towards the complex human-nature interactions, particularly the gradient of vegetation growth pattern across different city size, is still limited. Here, we selected 35 typical cities in China and classified them into five categories according to their resident population (e.g., megacities, megapolis, big cities, medium cities, and small cities). The spatial-temporal dynamics of vegetation growth for all 35 cities were inferred from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). We found that averaged NDVI for all cities slightly decreased during 2000 and 2020, at a rate of 1.6 x 10(-4) per year. Most cities were characterized with relatively lower NDVI in urban areas than its surrounding area (determined by a series of buffer zones, i.e., 1-25 km outside of the city boundary). The percentage of greening pixels increased from urban area to the 25 km buffer zone at a rate of 4.7 x 10(-4) per km. We noticed that negative impact of urbanization on vegetation growth reduced as the distance to urban area increased, with an exception for megacities (e.g., Shanghai, Beijing, and Shenzhen). In megacities and megapolis, greening pixels were more concentrated at core urban area, implying that the positive urbanization effect on vegetation growth is much more apparent. We argue that urbanization in China might facilitate vegetation growth to a certain extent, for which an appropriate urban planning such as purposeful selection of city sizes could be a scientific guidance while targeting the city's sustainable development goals in future.

TI  - Isotope-Only Localization for Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy- Medium-Term Oncological Outcomes
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated localization rates and oncological outcomes of single tracer sentinel node localization and biopsy using only radioisotope. Isotope-only SLNB has a comparable localization rate to dual isotope/blue dye SLNB and low axillary recurrence rate, making it a good alternative to dual-tracer SLNB. Aims: Isotope and blue dye dual localization in sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) gives localization rates of over 98% and is the recommended technique. However blue dye risks a range of adverse reactions. Since 2010, for clinically node negative disease, we have only used blue dye if there is no clear isotope signal at surgery. Methods: Electronic records of patients who underwent isotope-only SLN localization between July 2010 and April 2012 were examined. Data were collected on localization and oncological outcomes. Results: 426 patients were included. Isotope-only localization rate was 97.4% (415/426). The median follow-up was 63.5 months (IQR: 60.7-70.9). Median age was 57 (IQR: 48-67). Median SLN yield was 2 (range: 1-5). Axillary recurrence rate was 1.4% with median time to recurrence of 39.3 months. In-breast recurrence, distant disease and contralateral breast cancer rates were 2.8%, 7%, and 1.9% respectively and 15 (3.5%) patients died of metastatic breast cancer. Conclusion: Isotope-only SLNB has a comparable localization rate to dual isotope/blue dye SLNB and can spare the risk of blue dye adverse reactions. The low axillary recurrence rate, maintained to more than 5 years, confirms that isotope-only SLNB is a feasible and safe alternative to dual blue dye/isotope localization.

TI  - SEN2VENμS, a Dataset for the Training of Sentinel-2 Super-Resolution Algorithms
T2  - DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Boosted by the progress in deep learning, Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) has gained a lot of interest in the remote sensing community, who sees it as an opportunity to compensate for satellites' ever-limited spatial resolution with respect to end users' needs. This is especially true for Sentinel-2 because of its unique combination of resolution, revisit time, global coverage and free and open data policy. While there has been a great amount of work on network architectures in recent years, deep-learning-based SISR in remote sensing is still limited by the availability of the large training sets it requires. The lack of publicly available large datasets with the required variability in terms of landscapes and seasons pushes researchers to simulate their own datasets by means of downsampling. This may impair the applicability of the trained model on real-world data at the target input resolution. This paper presents SEN2VEN mu S, an open-data licensed dataset composed of 10 m and 20 m cloud-free surface reflectance patches from Sentinel-2, with their reference spatially registered surface reflectance patches at 5 m resolution acquired on the same day by the VEN mu S satellite. This dataset covers 29 locations on earth with a total of 132,955 patches of 256 x 256 pixels at 5 m resolution and can be used for the training and comparison of super-resolution algorithms to bring the spatial resolution of 8 of the Sentinel-2 bands up to 5 m.

TI  - Sweep Pulse Excitation Method for Enhancing Photoacoustic Elastic Waves at Different Laser Irradiation Parameters
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Laser remote sensing using a sweep pulse excitation method, in which a laser beam is irradiated at the same repetition frequency as the natural frequency, for enhancing photoacoustic elastic waves through resonance effect has been studied. The sweep pulse excitation method, which is based on the principle of detecting natural frequency fluctuations, such as hammering tests, can detect natural frequencies in the audible sound region with low average laser power and contribute to the convenience and low cost of an installation strength diagnosis of fastening bolts. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of the swept excitation method for optimization by evaluating the dependence of the laser irradiation conditions (pulse width, spot size, and average power) on different metal disc samples. We discovered that the magnitude of the photoacoustic elastic wave is proportional to the absorption of laser power, and the spatiotemporal dynamics can be explained through thermal diffusion phenomena. These findings contribute to the development of laser-sensing technology based on photoacoustic elastic waves.

TI  - GEOSPATIAL INTEGRATION IN MAPPING PRE-HISPANIC SETTLEMENTS WITHIN AZTEC EMPIRE LIMITS
T2  - VIRTUAL ARCHAEOLOGY REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Mexico's vast archaeological research tradition has increased with the use of remote sensing technologies; however, this recent approach is still costly in emerging market economies. In addition, the scales of prospection, landscape, and violence affect the type of research that heritage-culture ministries and universities can conduct. In Central Mexico, researchers have studied the pre-Hispanic Settlement Pattern during the Mesoamerican Postclassic (900-1521 AD) within the scope of the Aztec Empire and its conquests. There are settlements indications before and during the rule of the central empire, but the evidence is difficult to identify, particularly in the southwest of the capital, in the transition between the Lerma and Balsas River basins and their political-geographical complexities. This research focuses on a Geographic Information System (GIS)-based processing of multiple source data, the potential prospection of archaeological sites based on spatial data integration from Sentinel-2 optical sensors, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), Digital Terrain Model (DTM), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and field validation. What is revealed is the relationship between terrain morphologies and anthropic modifications. A binary map expresses possible archaeological remnants as a percentage; NDVI pixels and the morphometry values were associated with anthropic features (meso-reliefs with a tendency to regular geometries: slope, orientation, and roughness index); they were then interpreted as probable archaeological evidence. Within archaeological fieldwork, with limited resources (time, funding and staff), this approach proposes a robust method that can be in other mountainous that are covered by vegetation.

TI  - ELULC-10, a 10 m European Land Use and Land Cover Map Using Sentinel and Landsat Data in Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) maps can be effectively produced by cost-effective and frequent satellite observations. Powerful cloud computing platforms are emerging as a growing trend in the high utilization of freely accessible remotely sensed data for LULC mapping over large-scale regions using big geodata. This study proposes a workflow to generate a 10 m LULC map of Europe with nine classes, ELULC-10, using European Sentinel-1/-2 and Landsat-8 images, as well as the LUCAS reference samples. More than 200 K and 300 K of in situ surveys and images, respectively, were employed as inputs in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform to perform classification by an object-based segmentation algorithm and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). A novel ANN-based data preparation was also presented to remove noisy reference samples from the LUCAS dataset. Additionally, the map was improved using several rule-based post-processing steps. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of 2021 ELULC-10 were 95.38% and 0.94, respectively. A detailed report of the classification accuracies was also provided, demonstrating an accurate classification of different classes, such as Woodland and Cropland. Furthermore, rule-based post processing improved LULC class identifications when compared with current studies. The workflow could also supply seasonal, yearly, and change maps considering the proposed integration of complex machine learning algorithms and large satellite and survey data.

TI  - Titaniferous-Vanadiferous, Magnetite-Ilmenite Mineralization in a Mafic Suite within the Chhotanagpur Gneissic Complex, Bihar, India
T2  - MINERALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Titanium or vanadium metals or their alloys are important industrial metals/alloys. Because these resources are in short supply, the investigation of potential titaniferous-vanadiferous deposits needs special attention to bridge the supply-demand gap. The study integrates geological, geochemical, remote sensing, and geophysical data for assessing the potentiality of titaniferous-vanadiferous, magnetite-ilmenite mineralization in and around the Sudamakund and Paharpur areas, Gaya and Jehanabad districts, Bihar, India, and delineation of specific targets for detailed exploration. Field visits for large scale mapping on (1:12,500 scale) were used to conduct a reconnaissance survey for magnetite-ilmenite mineralization in parts of toposheet number 72G/04 in the Gaya and Jehanabad districts of Bihar, as well as the collection of bedrock samples (BRS), pit/trench samples (PTS), petrographic samples (PS), and petrochemical samples (PCS), followed by petrographic and ore microscopic study, and interpretation of chemical results. Signatures of oxidized iron-bearing sulphides (iron-oxides ratio) and other ferrous-iron-bearing minerals surrounded by altered rocks (clay bearing minerals) are visible in remote sensing images. The geological work was followed by ground geophysical gravity and magnetic surveys in selected blocks by the Geophysics Division, eastern region (ER) on a 1:12,500 scale. The magnetite ore is hard, compact, crystalline, and at some places, granular in nature. The analytical value of these magnetite ore bodies indicates average Fe content at 49.53% (range 25.85-60.78%), with a considerable amount of TiO2 (average 15.85%, range 1.47-26.77%), and V (average 144.79 ppm, range 30.00-256.00 ppm, from PTS). The trends of these magnetite ore deposits correspond to the major lineaments (NE-SW and NW-SE). The superimposition of gravity and magnetic contour maps with the geological map (1:12,500 scale) helps explain the observed geophysical anomalies, and the possible subsurface (horizontal and vertical) expansion of magnetite ore deposits in alluvium cover regions warrants further investigation.

M3  - Article
AB  - Continuous monitoring and observing of the earth's environment has become interactive research in the field of remote sensing. Many researchers have provided the Land Use/Land Cover information for the past, present, and future for their study areas around the world. This research work builds the Novel Vision Transformer-based Bidirectional long-short term memory model for predicting the Land Use/Land Cover Changes by using the LISS-III and Landsat bands for the forest- and non-forest-covered regions of Javadi Hills, India. The proposed Vision Transformer model achieves a good classification accuracy, with an average of 98.76%. The impact of the Land Surface Temperature map and the Land Use/Land Cover classification map provides good validation results, with an average accuracy of 98.38%, during the process of bidirectional long short-term memory-based prediction analysis. The authors also introduced an application-based explanation of the predicted results through the Google Earth Engine platform of Google Cloud so that the predicted results will be more informative and trustworthy to the urban planners and forest department to take proper actions in the protection of the environment.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the overuse of the coastal zones, the effect of climatic crises, and the coastal erosion problem the coastal zones across the globe are at great risk. To understand the severity of the coastal erosion by keeping the usability aspect this study has considered the whole Odisha coast as the study area and has studied the effect of coastal erosion as a statistical analysis to evaluate the Net Shoreline Movement (NSM), End Point Rate (EPR), Linear Regression Rate (LRR) with the help of Digital Shoreline Analysis Tool (DSAS) at the blocks level for all the 22 coastal blocks of the 6 coastal districts. The area that has altered in the past has been determined to better comprehend the impact of the erosion process in the state. Furthermore, the future trend for the coastline position for 2030 and 2040 has been forecasted which showed the estuary positions are going to be affected most. Considering the Landsat satellite data to manually delineate the shoreline position from 1973 to 2020, the analysis showed average NSM, EPR, and LRR values of -84.95 m, -1.81 m/year, and -0.36 m/year respectively with 72.47 sq. km of the eroded coastal area against 42.83 sq. km of newly formed landmass by the coastal dynamic process. The study showed that mitigation and preventive measures are of utmost importance for the coast. The construction of different fixed coastal protection structures or some sustainable approach should be taken to prevent this disaster.

TI  - Declining use of inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy in the treatment of clinically negative, pathologic node positive vulvar cancer
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. The management of vulvar cancer with clinically negative groin lymph nodes but with positive sen-tinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is controversial, with options including inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy (IFL) and/or adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy. We used the National Cancer Database (NCDB) to examine trends in the management of clinically node negative, pathologically node positive (cN-/pN+) patients.Methods. The NCDB was used to identify cN-/pN+ vulvar cancer patients. Demographic and clinical data were compared with chi-squared and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. OS was analyzed with the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to determine factors associated with OS.Results. A total of 885 cN-/pN+ vulvar cancer patients were identified between 2012 and 2016, during which the rate of SLNB alone increased from 3.6% to 11.7%, while the rate of IFL +/- SLNB decreased from 89.7% to 78.1% (p < 0.05). Radiation was used in 68.5% and 64.6% of the SLNB-alone and IFL +/- SLNB cohorts, respec-tively, with chemoradiation in 37.1% and 33.6%, respectively. OS was not different between patients who received SLNB-alone vs. IFL +/- SLNB (p = 0.644). Receipt of chemotherapy and radiation was associated with improved OS (p < 0.001).Conclusions. Among cN-/pN+ vulvar cancer patients in the NCDB, the practice of performing IFL decreased over time as SLNB-alone became more common and the majority received radiation +/- chemotherapy. There was no difference in OS between SLNB-alone vs. IFL +/- SLNB. Patients treated with adjuvant chemora-diation had improved survival. Whether the favorable outcomes in the SLNB-alone cohort may be attributed to radiotherapy dose escalation or use of chemotherapy warrants further study.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Pathogens detected using a syndromic molecular diagnostic platform in patients hospitalized with severe respiratory illness in South Africa in 2017
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: We describe the use of a multipathogen platform, TaqMan array card (TAC) real-time polymerase chain reaction, for the detection of pathogens in patients hospitalized with severe respiratory illness (SRI).Methods: Prospective hospital-based syndromic surveillance for acute and chronic SRI was carried out at two sentinel sites in South Africa between January and December 2017. We tested respiratory specimens for 21 respiratory pathogens and blood samples for nine bacteria using TAC. Pathogen detection was compared by age group and HIV status using the chi-square test.Results: During 2017, 956 patients of all ages were enrolled in the SRI surveillance, and of these, 637 (67%) patients were included in this study (637 blood, 487 naso-and oro-pharyngeal swabs, and 411 sputum specimens tested). At least one pathogen was detected in 83% (527/637) of patients. Common pathogens detected included Haemophilus influenzae (225/637; 35%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (224/637; 35%), rhinovirus (144/637; 23%), Staphylococcus aureus (129/637; 20%), Klebseilla pneumoniae (85/637; 13%), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (75/637; 12%), and respiratory syncytial virus (57/637; 9%). Multiple pathogens ( >2) were codetected in 57% (364/637) of patients.Conclusion: Although the use of a multi-pathogen platform improved pathogen yield, pathogen co detections were common and would need clinical assessment for usefulness in individual-level treatment and management decisions.(c) 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Assessing Groundwater Dynamics and Potentiality in the Lower Ganga Plain, India
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study intended to assess groundwater storage dynamics (GWS) and identify potential zones using the Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method and geospatial technology in the Murshidabad district of West Bengal, India. The study district is located in the Ganga-Padma-Bhagirathi rivers' floodplain and covers approximately a 5324 km(2) area, comprising 26 blocks in five sub-divisions. The study portrayed a quantitative investigation of the pre-monsoon and post-monsoon season's variability of GWS from 2000 to 2020, taking Landsat TM/Landsat 8 OLI/SRTM satellite data. The geo-spatio-temporal analysis of groundwater storage variability for 20 years was carried out by such remotely sensed data with the geospatial method to portray the dynamics and uncover the potential zones of GWS using various cartographic and statistical techniques. We determined nine parameters for the study, and the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) method was employed for the computation. The present estimation and assessment include the MCDM method, covering assorted parameters and the variations and aspects of GWS in the pre- and post-monsoon seasons from 2000 to 2020. The outcome illustrates that a decline in water storage has taken place in most of the blocks of Murshidabad district on average during the study period, which indicates a water stress provison in the near future. However, the micro (block)-level scenario of the spatiotemporal dynamics of GWS and the potential zonation in the Murshidabad District were investigated to form a location-specific micro-level arrangement for the sustainable management of water.

TI  - Multiscale Assimilation of Sentinel and Landsat Data for Soil Moisture and Leaf Area Index Predictions Using an Ensemble-Kalman-Filter-Based Assimilation Approach in a Heterogeneous Ecosystem
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Data assimilation techniques allow researchers to optimally merge remote sensing observations in ecohydrological models, guiding them for improving land surface fluxes predictions. Presently, freely available remote sensing products, such as those of Sentinel 1 radar, Landsat 8 sensors, and Sentinel 2 sensors, allow the monitoring of land surface variables (e.g., radar backscatter for soil moisture and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and for leaf area index (LAI)) at unprecedentedly high spatial and time resolutions, appropriate for heterogeneous ecosystems, typical of semiarid ecosystems characterized by contrasting vegetation components (grass and trees) competing for water use. A multiscale assimilation approach that assimilates radar backscatter and grass and tree NDVI in a coupled vegetation dynamic-land surface model is proposed. It is based on the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), and it is not limited to assimilating remote sensing data for model predictions, but it uses assimilated data for dynamically updating key model parameters (the ENKFdc approach), including saturated hydraulic conductivity and grass and tree maintenance respiration coefficients, which are highly sensitive parameters of soil-water balance and biomass budget models, respectively. The proposed EnKFdc assimilation approach facilitated good predictions of soil moisture, grass, and tree LAI in a heterogeneous ecosystem in Sardinia for a 3-year period with contrasting hydrometeorological (dry vs. wet) conditions. Contrary to the EnKF-based approach, the proposed EnKFdc approach performed well for the full range of hydrometeorological conditions and parameters, even assuming extremely biased model conditions with very high or low parameter values compared with the calibrated ("true") values. The EnKFdc approach is crucial for soil moisture and LAI predictions in winter and spring, key seasons for water resources management in Mediterranean water-limited ecosystems. The use of ENKFdc also enabled us to predict evapotranspiration and carbon flux well, with errors of less than 4% and 15%, respectively; such results were obtained even with extremely biased initial model conditions.

TI  - Assessing the Applications of Earth Observation Data for Monitoring Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining (ASGM) in Developing Countries
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper discusses opportunities to use remote sensing (RS) technologies in addressing the persistent global challenges related to the artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) sector. The paper uses a systematic literature review to identify, analyze, and synthesize various uses of RS on the detection and monitoring of ASGM activities across the globe. The study covers the use of spaceborne sensors and available opportunities for data access and processing and emphasizes the important role that freely-available data has played in understanding ASGM activities. It discusses applications and opportunities offered in assessing the geospatial and temporal characteristics of ASGM and its impacts on the surrounding environment. Furthermore, it examines different indicators for the detection of ASGM in the landscape. Finally, technological capabilities described in the study are illustrated with case studies in the Democratic Republic of Congo and in Colombia using cloud computing with the Open Data Cube. The case studies demonstrate the identification and quantification of impacts of ASGM activities on land degradation and water turbidity in remote areas and results are dissiminated using the MapX platform. This facilitates policy development, implementation, and evaluation in the ASGM context.

TI  - The MARECA (national study of management of breast cancer locoregional recurrence and oncological outcomes) study: National practice questionnaire of United Kingdom multi-disciplinary decision making
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Evidence based guidelines for the optimal management of breast cancer locoregional recurrence (LRR) are limited, with potential for variation in clinical practice. This national practice questionnaire (NPQ) was designed to establish the current practice of UK breast multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) regarding LRR management.Methods: UK breast units were invited to take part in the MARECA study MDT NPQ. Scenario-based questions were used to elicit preference in pre-operative staging investigations, surgical management, and adjuvant therapy.Results: 822 MDT members across 42 breast units (out of 144; 29%) participated in the NPQ (February eAugust 2021). Most units (95%) routinely performed staging CT scan, but bone scan was selectively performed (31%).For patients previously treated with breast conserving surgery (BCS) and radiotherapy, few units (7%) always/usually offered repeat BCS. However, in the absence of radiotherapy, most units (90%) always/usually offered repeat BCS. For patients presenting with isolated local recurrence following previous BCS and SLNB (sentinel lymph node biopsy), most units (95%) advocated repeat SLNB. Where SLNs could not be identified, 86% proceeded to a four-node axillary sampling procedure.For ER positive, HER2 negative, node negative local recurrence, 10% of units always/usually offered chemotherapy. For ER positive, HER2 negative, node positive local recurrence, this recommendation increased to 64%. For triple negative breast cancer local recurrence, 90% of units always/usually offered chemotherapy.Conclusion: This survey has highlighted where consistencies and variations exist in the multidisciplinary management of breast cancer LRR. However, further research is required to determine how these management patterns influence patient outcomes, which will further refine optimal treatment pathways. (c) 2022 The Authors.

T2  - UNIVERSUM-REVISTA DE HUMANIDADES Y CIENCIAS SOCIALES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article aims to introduce an epistemic, political and methodical disjunction within the notion of devastation, enabling a bifurcation of the term beyond its purely referential and constative character. We seek to elucidate how this concept allows an outward displacement of the structuring conditions that determine reason as a centralizing and determining faculty of the link between the human and the non-human. This forces a movement linked to an exercise of thinking about the present in the light of a worldview that forces us to recognize the intertwining of thought with the material conditions on which, ultimately, it depends.

TI  - Reconstruction of Sentinel-2 derived time series using robust Gaussian mixture models - Application to the detection of anomalous crop development
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Missing data is a recurrent problem in remote sensing, mainly due to cloud coverage for multispectral images and acquisition problems. This can be a critical issue for crop monitoring, especially for applications relying on machine learning techniques, which generally assume that the feature matrix does not have missing values. This paper proposes a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for the reconstruction of parcel-level features extracted from multispectral images. A robust version of the GMM is also investigated, since datasets can be contaminated by inaccurate samples or features (e.g., wrong crop type reported, inaccurate boundaries, undetected clouds, etc). Additional features extracted from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images using Sentinel-1 data are also used to provide complementary information and improve the imputations. The robust GMM investigated in this work assigns reduced weights to the outliers during the estimation of the GMM parameters, which improves the final reconstruction. These weights are computed at each step of an Expectation???Maximization (EM) algorithm by using outlier scores provided by the isolation forest (IF) algorithm. Experimental validation is conducted on rapeseed and wheat parcels located in the Beauce region (France). Overall, we show that the GMM imputation method outperforms other reconstruction strategies. A mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.013 (resp. 0.019) is obtained for the imputation of the median Normalized Difference Index (NDVI) of the rapeseed (resp. wheat) parcels. Other indicators (e.g., Normalized Difference Water Index) and statistics (for instance the interquartile range, which captures heterogeneity among the parcel indicator) are reconstructed at the same time with good accuracy. In a dataset contaminated by irrelevant samples, using the robust GMM is recommended since the standard GMM imputation can lead to inaccurate imputed values. An application to the monitoring of anomalous crop development in the presence of missing data is finally considered. In this application, using the proposed method leads to the best detection results, especially when SAR data are used jointly with multispectral images. Exploiting the information contained in cloudy multispectral images instead of removing these images is beneficial for this application.

TI  - Spatial Characterisation of Vegetation Diversity in Groundwater-Dependent Ecosystems Using In-Situ and Sentinel-2 MSI Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater-Dependent Ecosystems (GDEs) are under threat from groundwater over-abstraction, which significantly impacts their conservation and sustainable management. Although the socio-economic significance of GDEs is understood, their ecosystem services and ecological significance (e.g., biodiversity hotspots) in arid environments remains understudied. Therefore, under the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 15, characterizing or identifying biodiversity hotspots in GDEs improves their management and conservation. In this study, we present the first attempt towards the spatial characterization of vegetation diversity in GDEs within the Khakea-Bray Transboundary Aquifer. Following the Spectral Variation Hypothesis (SVH), we used multispectral remotely sensed data (i.e., Sentinel-2 MSI) to characterize the vegetation diversity. This involved the use of the Rao's Q to measure spectral diversity from several measures of spectral variation and validating the Rao's Q using field-measured data on vegetation diversity (i.e., effective number of species). We observed that the Rao's Q has the potential of spatially characterizing vegetation diversity of GDEs in the Khakea-Bray Transboundary Aquifer. Specifically, we discovered that the Rao's Q was related to field-measured vegetation diversity (R-2 = 0.61 and p = 0.00), and the coefficient of variation (CV) was the best measure to derive the Rao's Q. Vegetation diversity was also used as a proxy for identifying priority conservation areas and biodiversity hotspots. Vegetation diversity was more concentrated around natural pans and along roads, fence lines, and rivers. In addition, vegetation diversity was observed to decrease with an increasing distance (>35 m) from natural pans and simulated an inverse piosphere (i.e., minimal utilization around the natural water pans). We provide baseline information necessary for identifying priority conservation areas within the Khakea-Bray Transboundary Aquifer. Furthermore, this work provides a pathway for resource managers to achieve SDG 15 as well as national and regional Aichi biodiversity targets.

TI  - SRT: A Spectral Reconstruction Network for GF-1 PMS Data Based on Transformer and ResNet
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The time of acquiring remote sensing data was halved after the joint operation of Gao Fen-6 (GF-6) and Gao Fen-1 (GF-1) satellites. Meanwhile, GF-6 added four bands, including the "red-edge" band that can effectively reflect the unique spectral characteristics of crops. However, GF-1 data do not contain these bands, which greatly limits their application to crop-related joint monitoring. In this paper, we propose a spectral reconstruction network (SRT) based on Transformer and ResNet to reconstruct the missing bands of GF-1. SRT is composed of three modules: (1) The transformer feature extraction module (TFEM) fully extracts the correlation features between spectra. (2) The residual dense module (RDM) reconstructs local features and avoids the vanishing gradient problem. (3) The residual global construction module (RGM) reconstructs global features and preserves texture details. Compared with competing methods, such as AWAN, HRNet, HSCNN-D, and M2HNet, the proposed method proved to have higher accuracy by a margin of the mean relative absolute error (MRAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.022 and 0.009, respectively. It also achieved the best accuracy in supervised classification based on support vector machine (SVM) and spectral angle mapper (SAM).

TI  - Retrieving climate change dependent Sea Surface Temperature (SST) in Southern Turkey by using Landsat thermal imagery
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF GEO-MARINE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea Surface Temperature (SST) is one of the most significant parameters in oceanography. SST data can be used to analyse the ocean and marine environments. SST is required to study Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), identification of invasive species spreading areas, climate change, sea-level rise and pollution predictions. For more than 30 years, satellites have provided images that can assist in understanding changes in marine ecosystems. Remote data can be used as a real-time instrument for creating SST datasets. In this study, Landsat thermal data is used to retrieve sea surface temperatures. The study area of the research includes 1025 points belonging to four cross-sections of Gokova Bay in Southern Turkey. SST values were retrieved using satellite measurements for the first time in Gokova Bay. Landsat 4-5 Thematic Mapper, Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus, and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager/Thermal Infrared Sensor imagery were analysed, covering the period from 1987 to 2017. Using geographical information systems, the satellite images were processed with algorithms, and changes in sea surface temperature were evaluated in spatiotemporal terms. As a result, a temperature anomaly of about 3 degrees C above average was observed in 2011 and 2015. Climate change has been shown to cause fishing losses in Gokova Bay. A relationship was identified between invasive species entering Gokova Bay and sea surface temperature data. The study method has become a useful alternative method in cases where there is a lack of in-situ data.

TI  - Modeling Spatiotemporal Patterns of Land Use/Land Cover Change in Central Malawi Using a Neural Network Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We examine Land Use Land Cover Change (LULCC) in the Dedza and Ntcheu districts of Central Malawi and model anthropogenic and environmental drivers. We present an integrative approach to understanding heterogenous landscape interactions and short- to long-term shocks and how they inform future land management and policy in Malawi. Landsat 30-m satellite imagery for 2001, 2009, and 2019 was used to identify and quantify LULCC outcomes based on eight input classes: agriculture, built-up areas, barren, water, wetlands, forest-mixed vegetation, shrub-woodland, and other. A Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network was developed to examine land-cover transitions based on the drivers; elevation, slope, soil texture, population density and distance from roads and rivers. Agriculture is projected to dominate the landscape by 2050. Dedza has a higher probability of future land conversion to agriculture (0.45 to 0.70) than Ntcheu (0.30 to 0.45). These findings suggest that future land management initiatives should focus on spatiotemporal patterns in land cover and develop multidimensional policies that promote land conservation in the local context.

TI  - Indications for Adjuvant Radiation Therapy in Patients With pN0(i +) Adenocarcinoma of the Endometrium
T2  - PRACTICAL RADIATION ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy has led to an increase in the detection of isolated tumor cells (ITCs) in up to 10% of early stage endometrioid endometrial cancer patients. In addition, the risk of nonsentinel lymph node involvement is approximately 10% or lower in patients with ITCs. In most studies, approximately 60% to 70% of patients with ITCs either underwent completion lymphadenectomy or received adjuvant therapy. Therefore, although multiple studies have shown that the effect of ITCs on disease outcomes is favorable, the true effect of ITCs without additional treatment is not known. In this report we describe our philosophy of relying on extent of surgical nodal staging and presence or absence of adverse intrauterine pathologic factors at the time of adjuvant therapy decision making for endometrioid endometrial carcinoma patients with ITCs.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Assessment of Remotely Sensed Land Surface Temperature Variability in Afghanistan during 2000-2021
T2  - CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The dynamics of land surface temperature (LST) in Afghanistan in the period 2000-2021 were investigated, and the impact of the factors such as soil moisture, precipitation, and vegetation coverage on LST was assessed. The remotely sensed soil moisture data from Land Data Assimilation System (FLDAS), precipitation data from Climate Hazards Group Infra-Red Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS), and NDVI and LST from Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were used. The correlations between these data were analyzed using the regression method. The result shows that the LST in Afghanistan has a slightly decreasing but insignificant trend during the study period (R = 0.2, p-value = 0.25), while vegetation coverage, precipitation, and soil moisture had an increasing trend. It was revealed that soil moisture has the highest impact on LST (R = -0.71, p-value = 0.0007), and the soil moisture, precipitation, and vegetation coverage explain almost 80% of spring (R-2 = 0.73) and summer (R-2 = 0.76) LST variability in Afghanistan. The LST variability analysis performed separately for Afghanistan's river subbasins shows that the LST of the Amu Darya subbasin had an upward trend in the study period, while for the Kabul subbasin, the trend was downward.

TI  - Effect of Restoration on Plant Greenness and Water Use in Relation to Drought in the Riparian Corridor of the Colorado River Delta
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Revitalization of the Colorado River delta riparian corridor and increasing riparian plant greenness and water use may be accomplished by added water and restoration efforts to offset declines measured since 2000 by Landsat. We use the two-band Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI2; a proxy for greenness) and evapotranspiration (ET, mm/day) using EVI2 and potential ET(ETo) from Yuma Valley. We assess if restoration with only 7.5% landcover had an impact on the unrestored reach-level landcover by measuring these two metrics, EVI2 and ET(EVI2) by comparing restored and unrestored areas. A key finding is that over 21-years EVI2 in the unrestored corridor decreased by 23.6% and ET(EVI2) decreased by 32% (0.87 mm/day). Since 2011, the unrestored reaches lost EVI2 (11%) and -0.73 mm/day ET(EVI2) (28%), but restored sites increased in EVI2 (36%) and 0.58 mm/day ET(EVI2) (20%). Water delivered to restored sites increased EVI2 by 33.6% and 1.29 mm/day ET(EVI2) (58%). EVI2 and ET(EVI2) as a function of the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index for drought periods highlight that restored and unrestored sites respond differently. Unrestored reaches are in decline; restored sites show increases in EVI2 and ET(EVI2). Restored sites do not have a significant impact on unrestored adjacent area, but smaller surface flows, a greater reliance on directed agricultural return flows, and deliveries of water to active restoration sites have revitalized habitat and increased ecosystem services in the delta.

TI  - Time Series of Remote Sensing Data for Interaction Analysis of the Vegetation Coverage and Dust Activity in the Middle East
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Motivated by the lack of research on land cover and dust activity in the Middle East, this study seeks to increase the understanding of the sensitivity of dust centers to climatic and surface conditions in this specific region. In this regard, we explore vegetation cover and dust emission interactions using 16-day long-term Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data and daily Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and conduct spatiotemporal and statistical analyses. Eight major dust hotspots were identified based on long-term AOD data (2000-2019). Despite the relatively uniform climate conditions prevailing throughout the region during the study period, there is considerable spatial variability in interannual relationships between AOD and NDVI. Three subsets of periods (2000-2006, 2007-2013, 2014-2019) were examined to assess periodic spatiotemporal changes. In the second period (2007-2013), AOD increased significantly (6% to 32%) across the studied hotspots, simultaneously with a decrease in NDVI (-0.9% to -14.3%) except in Yemen-Oman. Interannual changes over 20 years showed a strong relationship between reduced vegetation cover and increased dust intensity. The correlation between NDVI and AOD (-0.63) for the cumulative region confirms the significant effect of vegetation canopy on annual dust fluctuations. According to the results, changes in vegetation cover have an essential role in dust storm fluctuations. Therefore, this factor must be regarded along with wind speed and other climate factors in Middle East dust hotspots related to research and management efforts.

TI  - Evaluation of Artificial Neural Networks with Satellite Data Inputs for Daily, Monthly, and Yearly Solar Irradiation Prediction for Pakistan
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar irradiation is the most critical parameter to consider when designing solar energy systems. The high cost and difficulty of measuring solar irradiation makes it impractical in every location. This study's primary objective was to develop an artificial neural network (ANN) model for global horizontal irradiation (GHI) prediction using satellite data inputs. Three types of ANN, namely, the feed forward neural network (FFNN), cascaded forward neural network (CFNN), and Elman neural network (EMNN), were tested. The findings revealed that altitude, relative humidity, and satellite GHI are the most effective parameters, as they are present in all the best-performing models. The best model for daily GHI prediction was FFNN, which decreased daily MAPE, RMSE, and MBE by 25.4%, 0.11 kWh/m(2)/d, and 0.01 kWh/m(2)/d.

M3  - Article
AB  - In the present work, a study of the current environmental state of the municipality of Pinar del Rio was carried out through integrated geoprocessing techniques. Sentinel 2A satellite images and QGIS V-3.23 software were used. For this study, various calculations were carried out such as: normalized differential vegetation index, soil adjusted vegetation index, normalized moisture difference index, chlorophyll index, which yielded the quality from the area by popular advice. The amount of vegetation was determined by popular councils, showing that the popular council Cap. San Luis is the one with the smallest area, but the one with the largest population and the least amount of vegetation, so it is expected that it is the one with the least environmental quality and the lowest quality of life for its population.

TI  - The Nature, Causes and Extent of Land cover Changes in Gamtoos River Estuary, Eastern Cape Province, South Africa: 1991-2017
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-date remotely sensed SPOT images of 1991, 2000, 2009 and 2017 were used to reconstruct changes in land cover in the Gamtoos River Estuary, Eastern Cape province, South Africa. These images were complemented by near-anniversary aerial photographs and Google Earth images that were used as ancillary sources of ground truth. The long-term trend direction of change was determined by calculating percentage changes and performing linear trend analysis. The magnitude of change was established by calculating Sen Slope estimates (SSE) and the influence of climate change on changes in land cover tested by correlating changes in rainfall and different cover types. The greatest and lowest changes were for noncultivated land and surface water (-7.94%, y = -1.2032x + 21.275, SSE = -0.292, and 0.44%, y = -0.4261x + 9.657, SSE = 0.007, respectively). Correlations between rainfall and all cover types were weak and ranged between 0.453816 and -0.643962. Rainfall exhibited a significant decrease (p = 0.0411, sigma 0.05; y = -7.175x + 734.55, SSE = -11.130) that was highly correlated with changes in surface water distribution (0.813709, Critical R = 0.805). Overall, the results of this investigation point to the combined influence of climate change and human agency, with the latter tending to play a more prominent role by exerting increasing pressure on the environment's natural supporting potentials. We therefore urge the scientific community to continue exploring actionable interventions that can be used to enhance the sustainability of this ecosystem and others elsewhere.

TI  - GPCNet: global-context pyramidal and class-balanced network for high-resolution SAR remote sensing image classification
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The description of context information affected by speckle and class imbalance under labeled data makes the pixelwise classification for high-resolution (HR) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image a challenging task. To address these issues, we propose a global-context pyramidal and class-balanced network (GPCNet) for HR SAR image classification. The proposed structure follows an encoder-decoder architecture. In the encoder module, the multiscale convolutional and global-local cross-channel attention (GCA) blocks are employed to capture the global-context and distinguishable deep feature statistics, while reducing the impacts of the random fluctuation in the homogeneous region. The channel information of different scale convolutional layers is efficiently learned by local cross-channel interaction in the GCA block. Besides, a sampled class-balanced loss, associating with the effective number, is utilized for alleviating the class imbalance of HR SAR images. The experiments carried out on a TerraSAR-X image classification dataset demonstrate GPCNet is able to yield superior performance when compared with other related networks.

T2  - CULTURA Y RELIGION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ceremonia de la Pedida de la Lluvia is a Mayan ritual that has its origins in the pre-Hispanic culture of Mesoamerica. The ceremonial ritual is analysed; an ancestral tradition that has survived over the years, despite the acculturation brought about by European colonisation. The methodology adopted is based on qualitative research, especially interviews, fieldwork and bibliographical information that allows us to understand the context of this Mayan society. The worldview of this spirituality is studied, as well as the elements that jeopardise the survival of this intangible heritage. It is concluded that the ceremony is complex, with many identifying elements in terms of rituals and ancestral beliefs that deserve protection as intangible heritage, which is threatened by the irruption of the Christian religion and the change in the model of agricultural exploitation, which affects the rituals related to the cycles of the different crops.

TI  - SENTINEL LYMPH NODES DETECTION METHOD IN BREAST CANCER.
T2  - Georgian medical news
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - In 2020 more than 2.2 million cases of breast cancer were registered, and these figures indicate that this disease is very widespread. Lymphatic metastasis is one of the most important causes of local recurrence of breast cancer and is unfavorable factor of prognosis. The purpose of the work is to improve the algorithm of intraoperative diagnosis of the sentinel lymph node in patients with breast cancer. Between 2009 and 2016, 400 patients with T1-T3N0M0 breast cancer were operated at the Odesa Regional Clinical Hospital. Two types of dyes - Patent Blue and ICG were used. The patients who had mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy as a rule had a clinical diagnosis of T2-T3N0M0 breast cancer. In group 1, 100 patients had sentinel lymph node biopsy. Staining of lymph nodes was performed using Patent Blue. In group 2, sentinel lymph nodes biopsy was conducted using Patent Blue and another fluorescent dye ICG, which was also administered subdermally. A total five-year survival rate after axillary lymph dissection and sentinel lymph node biopsy was 91% and 92%, respectively. A five-year recurrence-free survival rate after axillary lymph dissection was approximately 82.2%, and after sentinel lymph node biopsy - 83.9%. Regional recurrence in the sentinel lymph nodes on the affected side were found in only 1.1% of cases. The sentinel lymph nodes were intact in 58% of patients, so, the next lymph dissection was not performed. The affected lymph nodes were observed in 42% of patients. The time of follow-up ranged from 60 to 180 months. The recurrence was registered in 0.2%. The study revealed no difference in total and recurrence-free survival rate between the groups. With detected mts lesions of the inguinal (sentinel) lymph nodes, the operation should be continued with an obligatory determination of the second and third order lymph nodes. The extent of surgical intervention is determined on the operating table based on the results of intraoperative histological examination. The fluorescent lymphography method has a high accuracy - 99%, which allows to recommend it for implementation into clinical practice.

TI  - Effects of Direct Assimilation of FY-4A AGRI Water Vapor Channels on the Meiyu Heavy-Rainfall Quantitative Precipitation Forecasts
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the regional Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF)-based quantitative precipitation forecasts (QPFs) are conducted for an extreme Meiyu rainfall event over East Asia in 2020. The data of water vapor channels 9 and 10 from the Advanced Geosynchronous Radiation Imager (AGRI) onboard the Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) satellite are assimilated through the Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) system. It shows that a reasonable amount of assimilated AGRI data can produce reasonable water vapor increments, compared to the too sparse or dense assimilated AGRI observations. In addition, the critical success indexes (CSIs) of the precipitation forecasts within 72 h are obviously improved. The enhanced variational bias correction (VarBC) scheme is applied to remove the air-mass and scan-angle biases, and the mean observation-minus-background (O - B) values before and after the VarBC of channel 9 are -1.185 and 0.02 K, respectively, and those of channel 10 are -0.559 and -0.01 K, respectively. Assimilating the upper-level channel 9 data of AGRI (EXP_WV9) lead to a neutral-to-positive effect on QPFs, compared to the control run (CTL), which is based on the assimilation of Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-A (AMSU-A) data. In particular, the CSIs from 42 to 72 h are significantly improved. However, the assimilation of the AGRI channel 10 (EXP_WV10) shows a neutral-to-negative effect on QPFs in this study, probably due to the complicated surface situations. This study confirms the feasibility of assimilating the water vapor channel data of FY4A AGRI in the GSI system and highlights the importance of assimilating AGRI channel 9 data to improve the QPFs of the Meiyu rainfall event.

AB  - The current article attempts to analyze the concept of "wolf " and its conceptualisations by native Kazakh people through the study of Kazakh idioms, set expressions, proverbs, sayings, and quotations with this component. The objective was to conduct the conceptual analysis in order to discern figurative-associative and evaluative meaning of the concept "wolf ". By presenting the cognitive model of this concept in the linguistic consciousness of the Kazakhs, its conceptualisation is demonstrated, the associative nature of the concept "wolf " and its universal, ideological and ethnocultural features are manifested. It was found that the concept "wolf " has various conceptualisations, reflecting the Kazakhs' naive national-linguistic picture of the world and evokes interpretations with positive and negative connotations as well.

M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, DEMs are inputs in multiple geoscience applications. Ecuador presents three regions with topographic characteristics that influence the performance of the DEM on altimetric precision. The main objective has been to analyze the precision of five global models and the official local model of the country, using GPS points to determine the level of adjustment of the DEM in the regions of Ecuador. The cities of Macas (Amazonian basin), Quito (Highlands) and Guayaquil (Coastal lowlands) were considered as study areas for each region. Statistics and spatial correlation / disper- sion graphs were obtained with the R software, also with QGIS longitudinal profiles of the models were performed. According to the statistics calculated, the local SIG- TIERRAS model presents more auspicious results in the Highlands and Coast of the country, with an RMSE of 2,498, 1,556 meters, while in the Amazon the ALOS model is slightly better than the local DEM, with 5,792 meters of RMSE.

TI  - Retrieval of Fractional Snow Cover over High Mountain Asia Using 1 km and 5 km AVHRR/2 with Simulated Mid-Infrared Reflective Band
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate long-term snow-covered-area mapping is essential for climate change studies and water resource management. The NOAA AVHRR/2 provides a unique data source for long-term, large-spatial-scale monitoring of snow-covered areas at a daily scale. However, the value of AVHRR/2 in mapping snow-covered areas is limited, due to its lack of a shortwave infrared band for snow/cloud discrimination. We simulated the reflectance in the 3.75 mu m mid-infrared band with a radiative transfer model and then developed three fractional-snow-cover retrieval algorithms for AVHRR/2 imagery at 1 km and 5 km resolutions. These algorithms are based on the multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis algorithm (MESMA), snow index (SI) algorithm, and non-snow/snow two endmember model (TEM) algorithm. Evaluation and comparison of these algorithms were performed using 313 scenarios that referenced snow-cover maps from Landsat-5/TM imagery at 30 m resolution. For all the evaluation data, the MESMA algorithm outperformed the other two algorithms, with an overall accuracy of 0.84 (0.85) and an RMSE of 0.23 (0.21) at the 1 km (5 km) scale. Regarding the effect of land cover type, we found that the three AVHRR/2 fractional-snow-cover retrieval algorithms have good accuracy in bare land, grassland, and Himalayan areas; however, the accuracy decreases in forest areas due to the shading of snow by the canopy. Regarding the topographic effect, the accuracy evaluation indices showed a decreasing and then increasing trend as the elevation increased. The accuracy was worst in the 4000-5000 m range, which was due to the severe snow fragmentation in the High Mountain Asia region; the early AVHRR/2 sensors could not effectively monitor the snow cover in this region. In this study, by increasing the number of bands of AVHRR/2 1 km data for fractional-snow-cover retrieval, a good foundation for subsequent long time series kilometre- resolution snow-cover monitoring has been laid.

TI  - Evaluation of Atmospheric Correction Algorithms over Lakes for High-Resolution Multispectral Imagery: Implications of Adjacency Effect
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric correction of satellite optical imagery over inland waters is a key remaining challenge in aquatic remote sensing. This is due to numerous confounding factors such as the complexity of water optical properties, the surface glint, the heterogeneous nature of atmospheric aerosols, and the proximity of bright land surfaces. This combination of factors makes it difficult to retrieve accurate information about the system observed. Moreover, the impact of radiance coming from adjacent land (adjacency effects) in complex geometries further adds to this challenge, especially for small lakes. In this study, ten atmospheric correction algorithms were evaluated for high-resolution multispectral imagery of Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager and Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument using in situ optical measurements from -300 lakes across Canada. The results of the validation show that the performance of the algorithms varies by spectral band and evaluation metrics. The dark spectrum fitting algorithm had the best performance in terms of similarity angle (spectral shape), while the neural network-based models showed the lowest errors and bias per band. However, none of the tested atmospheric correction algorithms meet a 30% retrieval accuracy target across all the visible bands, likely due to uncorrected adjacency effects. To quantify this process, three-dimensional radiative transfer simulations were performed and compared to satellite observations. These simulations show that up to 60% of the top of atmosphere reflectance in the near-infrared bands over the lake was from the adjacent lands covered with green vegetation. The significance of these adjacency effects on atmospheric correction has been analyzed qualitatively, and potential efforts to improve the atmospheric correction algorithms are discussed.

AB  - <bold>Background:</bold> Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is one of the most important parasitic infections in subgroup seven common neglected diseases of humans and animals. It is in the list of 18 neglected tropical diseases of the WHO. We aimed to analyze the situation of the disease in Iran using Geographical Information System (GIS) and satellite data analysis.<bold>Methods:</bold> The data obtained from the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, Tehran, Iran and other related centers from 2009 to 2018 were analyzed using GIS. Then, the spatial distribution maps of the disease were generated, and the hot spots of the disease in Iran were determined using spatial analysis of ArcGIS10.5 software. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) analysis in ArcGIS10.5 was used to correlate the variables affecting the disease including temperature, relative humidity, normalized different vegetation index (NDVI) and incidence of hydatidosis. Data analysis was performed by Linear regression analysis and SPSS 21 software using descriptive statistics and chi-square test.<bold>Results:</bold> Zanjan, Khorasan Razavi, North Khorasan, Chaharmahal Bakhtiari, Hamedan, Semnan, and Ardabil provinces were the hot spots of CE. The results of geographical weighted regression analysis showed that in Khorasan Razavi, North Khorasan, Chaharmahal Bakhtiari, Hamedan, Semnan, Ardabil, Zanjan, Qazvin, and Ilam provinces, the highest correlation between temperature, humidity, vegetation density and the incidence of hydatidosis was observed (P < 0.001).<bold>Conclusion:</bold> The use of maps could provide reliable estimates of at-risk populations. Climatic factors of temperature, humidity, NDVI had a greater impact on the probability of hydatidosis. These factors can be an indicator used to predict the presence of disease. Environmental and climatic factors were associated with echinococcosis.

TI  - A Machine Learning Algorithm for Himawari-8 Total Suspended Solids Retrievals in the Great Barrier Reef
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing of ocean colour has been fundamental to the synoptic-scale monitoring of marine water quality in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). However, ocean colour sensors onboard low orbit satellites, such as the Sentinel-3 constellation, have insufficient revisit capability to fully resolve diurnal variability in highly dynamic coastal environments. To overcome this limitation, this work presents a physics-based coastal ocean colour algorithm for the Advanced Himawari Imager onboard the Himawari-8 geostationary satellite. Despite being designed for meteorological applications, Himawari-8 offers the opportunity to estimate ocean colour features every 10 min, in four broad visible and near-infrared spectral bands, and at 1 km(2) spatial resolution. Coupled ocean-atmosphere radiative transfer simulations of the Himawari-8 bands were carried out for a realistic range of in-water and atmospheric optical properties of the GBR and for a wide range of solar and observation geometries. The simulated data were used to develop an inverse model based on artificial neural network techniques to estimate total suspended solids (TSS) concentrations directly from the Himawari-8 top-of-atmosphere spectral reflectance observations. The algorithm was validated with concurrent in situ data across the coastal GBR and its detection limits were assessed. TSS retrievals presented relative errors up to 75% and absolute errors of 2 mg L-1 within the validation range of 0.14 to 24 mg L-1, with a detection limit of 0.25 mg L-1. We discuss potential applications of Himawari-8 diurnal TSS products for improved monitoring and management of water quality in the GBR.

TI  - Geostationary operational environmental satellite-R advanced baseline imager reflective solar band absolute validation using Sonoran desert scenes
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The advanced baseline imagers (ABIs) on board the geostationary operational environmental satellite (GOES)-R series, GOES-16 and GOES-17 satellites, have accumulated long data series that have been updated throughout their missions to enhance their utility for imaging the Earth's weather, oceans, and environment. In preparing for a reprocessing effort aimed at improving the consistency and image quality and reducing radiometric uncertainties necessary for some Earth science applications, we developed a vicarious validation technique for five of the six reflective solar bands. This technique uses Sonoran desert surface reflectance data derived from the moderate resolution imaging spectrometer bidirectional reflectance distribution function parameters product along with other atmospheric products to generate a predicted at-sensor radiance for both GOES-16 and GOES-17 for comparison with ABI observations and to enable ABI intercomparisons. This technique identified known instrument biases and demonstrated absolute validation over the course of a year, showing its capability to detect changes, monitor stability, and assess radiometric uncertainties for operational data applications and future reprocessed data sets.

Natural phenomena have caused the loss of crop areas, which endangers food security, destruction of the habitat of species of flora and fauna, and flooding of populations, among others. To help in the solution, it is necessary to develop strategies that maximize agricultural production as well as reduce land wear, environmental impact, and contamination of water resources. The generation of crop and land-use maps is advantageous for identifying suitable crop areas and collecting precise information about the produce. In this work, a strategy is proposed to identify and map sorghum and corn crops as well as land use and land cover. Our approach uses Sentinel-2 satellite images, spectral indices for the phenological detection of vegetation and water bodies, and automatic learning methods: support vector machine, random forest, and classification and regression trees. The study area is a tropical agricultural area with water bodies located in southeastern Mexico. The study was carried out from 2017 to 2019, and considering the climate and growing seasons of the site, two seasons were created for each year. Land use was identified as: water bodies, land in recovery, urban areas, sandy areas, and tropical rainforest. The results in overall accuracy were: 0.99% for the support vector machine, 0.95% for the random forest, and 0.92% for classification and regression trees. The kappa index was: 0.99% for the support vector machine, 0.97% for the random forest, and 0.94% for classification and regression trees. The support vector machine obtained the lowest percentage of false positives and margin of error. It also acquired better results in the classification of soil types and identification of crops.

TI  - Satellite-Observed Thermal Anomalies and Deformation Patterns Associated to the 2021, Central Crete Seismic Sequence
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays, there has been a growing interest in understanding earthquake forerunners, i.e., anomalous variations that are possibly associated with the complex process of earthquake evolution. In this context, the Robust Satellite Technique was coupled with 10 years (2012-2021) of daily night-time MODIS-Land Surface Temperature remote sensing data to detect thermal anomalies likely related to the 27 September 2021, strong onshore earthquake of magnitude Mw6.0 occurring near the Arkalochori village in Central Crete, Greece. Eight intense (signal-to-noise ratio > 3) and infrequent, quite extensive, and temporally persistent thermal signal transients were detected and characterized as pre-seismic anomalies, while one thermal signal transient was identified as a co-seismic effect on the day of the main tectonic event. The thermal anomalies dataset was combined with tectonic parameters of Central Crete, such as active faults and fault density, seismogenic zones and ground displacement maps produced using Sentinel-1 satellite imagery and the Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar technique. Regarding the thermal anomaly of 27 September, its greatest portion was observed over the footwall part of the fault where a significant subsidence up to 20 cm exists. We suggest that the thermal anomalies are possibly connected with gas release which happens due to stress changes and is controlled by the existence of tectonic lines and the density of the faults, even if alternative explanations could not be excluded.

TI  - A New Method for Estimating Soil Fertility Using Extreme Gradient Boosting and a Backpropagation Neural Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil fertility affects crop yield and quality. A quick, accurate evaluation of soil fertility is crucial for agricultural production. Few satellite image-based evaluation studies have quantified soil fertility during the crop growth period. Therefore, this study proposes a new approach to the quantitative evaluation of soil fertility. Firstly, the optimal crop spectral variables were selected using the integration of an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm with variance inflation factor (VIF). Then, based on the optimal crop spectral variables where the red-edge indices were introduced for the first time, the estimation models were developed using the backpropagation neural network (BPNN) algorithm to assess soil fertility. The model was finally adopted to map the soil fertility using Sentinel-2 imagery. This study was performed in the Conghua District of Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China. The results of our research are as follows: (1) five crop spectral variables (inverted red-edge chlorophyll index (IRECI), chlorophyll vegetation index (CVI), normalized green-red difference index (NGRDI), red-edge position (REP), and triangular greenness index (TGI)) were the optimal variables. (2) The BPNN model established with optimal variables provided reliable estimates of soil fertility, with the determination coefficient (R-2) of 0.66 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.17. A nonlinear relation was found between soil fertility and the optimal crop spectral variables. (3) The BPNN model provides the potential for soil fertility mapping using Sentinel-2 images, with an R-2 of 0.62 and an RMSE of 0.09 for the measured and estimated results. This study suggests that the proposed method is suitable for the estimation of soil fertility in paddy fields.

AB  - Objective: To know the current status of the technique of radioguided localisation of non-palpable breast lesions with or without indication for selective sentinel node biopsy -ROLL, SNOLL and I-125 seeds- by conducting a national survey developed by the Working Group on Radioguided Surgery (GTCRG) of the Spanish Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (SEMNIM). Material and methods: In October 2020, the form was sent in digital format to the different nuclear medicine services in Spain. A response time of 2 months with an overtime of 15 days was given. The number of ROLL/SNOLL procedures in each centre and the methodology used were obtained, including important technical details. In addition, a specific section on I-125 seeds was included. The results were automatically downloaded into an Excel 2007 spreadsheet for subsequent analysis with the same program. Results: The survey was answered by 55 centres; 21 use wire-guided localisation while the remaining 34 use different radioguided surgery techniques (RGS) for the localisation of non-palpable breast lesions, with the results itemized into thirteen sections. The commonly used tracer dose is 111 MBq for the ROLL technique and 222 MBq for the SNOLL technique, with a volume of 0.2 ml. The most common protocol is the two-day protocol. 26% of centres performing CRG use I-125 seeds for both breast lesion and suspicious/pathological node detection, with the time between implantation and removal being about 3 days, with subsequent radiological control in most cases. Conclusion: The survey shows the relevance of radioguided surgery in the management of breast cancer patients at different stages of the disease, with disparity in the implementation of new techniques and tools, which responds to the multiple healthcare realities of Nuclear Medicine services.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Biomass and Growth for Grain Crops Using NDVI Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing from optical radiometers in space offers a nondestructive approach to estimating above ground biomass (AGB) with high spatial and temporal resolution, but the application is challenged by cloud cover and differences in soil background and crop phenology. We present a framework based on Sentinel-2 imagery for relating the adjusted summed NDVI measurements to the AGB. The resulting R-2 values for the measured and estimated AGB ranged from 0.79 to 0.98 for individual paddocks, and the R-2 from a pooled dataset (multiple crops, years, and locations) was 0.86. Application of the pooled dataset model to a separate validation dataset resulted in an R-2 of 0.88; however, there was a bias that resulted in the underestimation of the measured biomass. Analysis of the impacts of the gaps in the time series showed a decrease of 0.43% per gap day for the summed NDVI values. To address the impacts of clouds, we demonstrate the use of active optical and additional satellite imagery to fill the gaps due to clouds in the Sentinel-2 imagery. The framework presented results of the spatial daily estimates of the AGB and crop growth rates.

TI  - AVHRR GAC Sea Surface Temperature Reanalysis Version 2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The 40+ years-long sea surface temperature (SST) dataset from 4 km Global Area Coverage (GAC) data of the Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometers (AVHRR/2s and/3s) flown onboard ten NOAA satellites (N07/09/11/12/14/15/16/17/18/19) has been created under the NOAA AVHRR GAC SST Reanalysis 2 (RAN2) Project. The data were reprocessed with the NOAA Advanced Clear Sky Processor for Ocean (ACSPO) enterprise SST system. Two SST products are reported in the full --3000 km AVHRR swath: 'subskin' (highly sensitive to true skin SST, but debiased with respect to in situ SST) and 'depth' (a closer proxy for in situ data, but with reduced sensitivity). The reprocessing methodology aims at close consistency of satellite SSTs with in situ SSTs, in an optimal retrieval domain. Long-term orbital and calibration trends were compensated by daily recalculation of regression coefficients using matchups with drifters and tropical moored buoys (supplemented by ships for N07/09), collected within limited time windows centered at the processed day. The nighttime Sun impingements on the sensor black body were mitigated by correcting the L1b calibration coefficients. The Earth view pixels contaminated with a stray light were excluded. Massive cold SST outliers caused by volcanic aerosols following three major eruptions were filtered out by a modified, more conservative ACSPO clear-sky mask. The RAN2 SSTs are available in three formats: swath L2P (144 10-min granules per 24 h interval) and two 0.02 degrees gridded (uncollated L3U, also 144 granules/24 h; and collated L3C, two global maps per 24 h, one for day and one for the night). This paper evaluates the RAN2 SST dataset, with a focus on the L3C product and compares it with two other available AVHRR GAC L3C SST datasets, NOAA Pathfinder v5.3 and ESA Climate Change Initiative v2.1. Among the three datasets, the RAN2 covers the global ocean more completely and shows reduced regional and temporal biases, improved stability and consistency between different satellites, and in situ SSTs.

T2  - REVISTA FORESTAL MESOAMERICA KURU-RFMK
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed knowledge of teak stand structure is necessary for sustainable management plans. The integration of remote sensing variables with geostatistical modeling in teak forest stands has not been sufficiently studied and, therefore, the aim was to model the spatial distribution of teak stand variables, adding covariables. The study was carried out on 19-year-old teak stand in Brazil with 213 hectares in the initial spatial of 3 m x 3 m. Geo-referenced plots of 900 m(2) were allocated, and forest variables were obtained after thinning. Vegetation indices were calculated from arithmetic operations conducted between the Landsat image bands. The interpolation of forest variables was performed by the geostatistical univariate method of ordinary kriging, as well as by the multivariate method of kriging with external drift, considering the remote sensing variables as covariables. Statistical analysis of remote sensing variables shows a weak linear correlation with teak variables, which tends to make them unviable to use as covariables in geostatistical modeling. However, kriging with external drift predicts spatial patterns of forest variables with greater detail, which results in lower possible smoothing errors than those obtained by ordinary kriging and provides more accurate recommendations for localized management in teak stand. The integration of remote sensing variables in forest inventory through geostatistics is advantageous for mapping the spatial distribution of teak stand variables.

TI  - CloudSatNet-1: FPGA-Based Hardware-Accelerated Quantized CNN for Satellite On-Board Cloud Coverage Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - CubeSats, the nanosatellites and microsatellites with a wet mass up to 60 kg, accompanied by the cost decrease of accessing the space, amplified the rapid development of the Earth Observation industry. Acquired image data serve as an essential source of information in various disciplines like environmental protection, geosciences, or the military. As the quantity of remote sensing data grows, the bandwidth resources for the data transmission (downlink) are exhausted. Therefore, new techniques that reduce the downlink utilization of the satellites must be investigated and developed. For that reason, we are presenting CloudSatNet-1: an FPGA-based hardware-accelerated quantized convolutional neural network (CNN) for satellite on-board cloud coverage classification. We aim to explore the effects of the quantization process on the proposed CNN architecture. Additionally, the performance of cloud coverage classification by biomes diversity is investigated, and the hardware architecture design space is explored to identify the optimal FPGA resource utilization. Results of this study showed that the weights and activations quantization adds a minor effect on the model performance. Nevertheless, the memory footprint reduction allows the model deployment on low-cost FPGA Xilinx Zynq-7020. Using the RGB bands only, up to 90% of accuracy was achieved, and when omitting the tiles with snow and ice, the performance increased up to 94.4% of accuracy with a low false-positive rate of 2.23% for the 4-bit width model. With the maximum parallelization settings, the hardware accelerator achieved 15 FPS with 2.5 W of average power consumption (0.2 W increase over the idle state).

TI  - Entomological Surveillance of <i>Aedes</i> Mosquitoes: Comparison of Different Collection Methods in an Endemic Area in RIO de Janeiro, Brazil
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - Using collection methods for Aedes adults as surveillance tools provides reliable indices and arbovirus detection possibilities. This study compared the effectiveness of different methods for collecting Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus and detecting arboviruses circulating in field-caught female specimens. Collection sites were defined in urban, peri-urban, and rural landscapes in two Brazilian cities. Collections were performed using Adultraps (ADT), BG-Sentinel (BGS), CDC-like traps (CDC), and indoor (ASP-I) and outdoor (ASP-O) aspiration during the rainy and dry seasons of 2015 and 2016. Generalized linear mixed models were used to model the effectiveness of each collection method. A total of 434 Ae. aegypti and 393 Ae. albopictus were collected. In total, 64 Ae. aegypti and sixteen Ae. albopictus female pools were tested for DENV, CHIKV, ZIKV, or YFV; none were positive. Positivity and density were linear at low densities (<1 specimen); thereafter, the relationship became non-linear. For Ae. aegypti, ADT and CDC were less effective, and ASP-I and ASP-O were as effective as BGS. For Ae. albopictus, all collection methods were less effective than BGS. This study highlights the need for an integrated surveillance method as an effective tool for monitoring Aedes vectors.

TI  - Rainfall Variability and Tidal Inundation Influences on Mangrove Greenness in Karimunjawa National Park, Indonesia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves, which are vulnerable to natural threats and human activities on small islands in the tropics, play an essential role as carbon sinks, helping to mitigate climate change. In this study, we discussed the effect of natural factors on mangrove sustainability by analyzing the impact of rainfall, land surface temperature (LST), and tidal inundation on the greenness of mangroves in Karimunjawa National Park (KNP), Indonesia. We used Sentinel-2 image data to obtain the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) during the dry season to determine the effect of inundation on mangrove greenness and soil moisture. The tidal inundation area was calculated using topographic data from the KNP and tidal observations from the area adjacent to it. Unmanned autonomous vehicles and topographic data were used to estimate mangrove canopy height. We also calculated mangrove greenness phenology and compared it to rainfall from satellite data from 2019-2021. Results show that the intertidal area is dominated by taller mangroves and has higher NDVI and NDMI values than non-intertidal areas. We also observed that mangroves in intertidal areas are mostly evergreen, and optimum greenness in KNP occurs from February to October, with maximum greenness in July. Cross-correlation analysis suggests that high rainfall affects NDVI, with peak greenness occurring three months after high rainfall. The LST and NDVI cross-correlation showed no time lag. This suggests that LST was not the main factor controlling mangrove greenness, suggesting tides and rainfall influence mangrove greenness. The mangroves are also vulnerable to climate variability and change, which limits rainfall. However, sea-level rise due to climate change might positively impact mangrove greenness.

T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The ecological environment in alpine regions is fragile and sensitive to land-use and land-cover (LULC) change and climate warming. However, there are limited studies on the response of LULC and vegetation activity to climate change and human interference in mountainous permafrost regions. Based on in-situ meteorological and multi-source remote sensing data, we performed time trend and partial correlation analyses to investigate the spatial and temporal variation of LULC, landscape pattern, and vegetation growth under the impact of climate change and human activities in the source region of the Datong River from 2000 to 2019. Our results showed that the alpine desert area decreased significantly at a rate of -13.1 km(2) yr(-1) (p < 0.05), while the alpine meadow area increased at a rate of 8.3 km2 yr 1 (p < 0.1). Mining and road areas showed a significant increasing trend at a rate of 3.2 km(2) yr(-1) and 1.2 km(2) yr(-1), respectively. The increasing alpine meadow and mining areas were mainly derived from alpine deserts and alpine wetlands, respectively. The number of alpine wetland patches increased significantly along with a significant decrease in the landscape shape index of the rivers. Vegetation growth, as indicated by the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) was positively correlated with temperature but negatively correlated with precipitation and solar radiation in 59.6%, 52.3%, and 56.5% of the vegetated areas, respectively (p < 0.05). Temperature was the dominant climate factor controlling vegetation dynamics, and the recent warming hiatus resulted in a significant increase in EVI for alpine deserts, but no significant changes in EVI for alpine wetlands and alpine meadows. Increasing risk of negative impacts from human activities, including mineral exploration and grazing, on vegetation distribution and growth was observed. This study provides clear evidence of the upward invasion of alpine meadows into alpine desert areas under warm and humid climatic conditions. As climate warming intensifies, alpine meadow expansion may be impeded by extreme precipitation and permafrost thawing.

TI  - Remote Sensing Data Fusion to Evaluate Patterns of Regional Evapotranspiration: A Case Study for Dynamics of Film-Mulched Drip-Irrigated Cotton in China's Manas River Basin over 20 Years
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate quantification of evapotranspiration (ET) is critical to the sustainable management of irrigated agriculture. In this study, we proposed a remote sensing data fusion method for predicting ET, coupling a surface energy balance system model with an enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model utilizing remote sensing inversion with satellite data from Landsat and MODIS. The method was tested for a case study with cotton fields under film-mulched drip irrigation (FMDI) in the Manas River Basin. Areas under FMDI were identified, and ET patterns were evaluated for a 21-year period spanning from 2000 to 2020. A field experiment, a regional survey, and data retrieved from the literature provided results demonstrating that the method allowed reliable estimation of ET distribution with simultaneously, relatively high spatial and temporal resolutions at both field and regional scales. ET was found to decline from upstream to downstream in the basin, with the difference gradually diminishing over time. Supported by the promotion of FMDI technology, the area under cotton production in the basin increased by an average of 4.9% annually. Limited irrigation quotas to farmers and, therefore, water application per area led to a decreasing ratio of relative water supply for potential ET and, thus, to a reduction in average actual ET of 7.5 mm year(-1). The average ET in the basin declined to about 415.7 mm in 2020, 287.2 mm lower than its water demand. The dynamics of fused ET provide a reliable scientific basis for agricultural water resources planning and management and for the sustainable utilization of water and soil resources in the basin. The method, with simultaneously high temporal and spatial resolutions, should have both local and global practical potential.

TI  - Mapping the Recent Vertical Crustal Deformation of the Weihe Basin (China) Using Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2 ScanSAR Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Weihe Basin, located in central China, is a Cenozoic rift basin that is characterized by a complicated geological background, with intense tectonic movement and relatively significant seismic activity. The faulting behaviors, slip rates, geometrical structures, and possible surface traces of the active faults in the Weihe Basin are still not well known. The goal of this work is to provide a more complete picture of recent vertical ground deformation of the basin and to identify active faults. We derived two basin-wide average InSAR deformation maps during 2015-2019 using C-band Sentinel-1A/B and L-band ALOS PALSAR2 ScanSAR imagery. The basin-wide vertical and east-west deformation components decomposed from ascending and descending InSAR measurements show that vertical movement dominates the deformation of the Weihe Basin. Subsidence and uplift maxima both occurred over the Xi'an region at rates of about -146 and 20 mm/y, respectively. A subsidence of similar to 38 mm/y was found at Sanyuan, Fuping, Weinan, Lantian, Qianxian, and Xingping while an uplift of similar to 11 mm/y was found at Fufeng, Huxian, Jingyang, Fuping, Pucheng, and Huaxian. The significant vertical deformation in these regions is spatially linked to previously identified or unmapped faults. A slip rate of similar to 13.7 mm/y on faults F20, F6, F10, and F7 explained the observed uplift of up to 5 mm/y in the Fufeng and Wugong areas. Furthermore, surface fault traces were clearly identified for faults F7-1, F8-1, F20, F25, and F26 based on discontinuities in the InSAR-derived vertical deformation measurements. Our results provide an accurate and economical way to delineate the surface deformation and fault movement and the associated geohazards over the Weihe Basin, and offer independent unprecedented data for further geological and geophysical interpretation.

TI  - Rapid environmental assessment in the South China Sea: Improved inversion of sound speed profile using remote sensing data
T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Complex perturbations in the profile and the sparsity of samples often limit the validity of rapid environmental assessment (REA) in the South China Sea (SCS). In this paper, the remote sensing data were used to estimate sound speed profile (SSP) with the self-organizing map (SOM) method in the SCS. First, the consistency of the empirical orthogonal functions was examined by using k-means clustering. The clustering results indicated that SSPs in the SCS have a similar perturbation nature, which means the inverted grid could be expanded to the entire SCS to deal with the problem of sparsity of the samples without statistical improbability. Second, a machine learning method was proposed that took advantage of the topological structure of SOM to significantly improve their accuracy. Validation revealed promising results, with a mean reconstruction error of 1.26 m/s, which is 1.16 m/s smaller than the traditional single empirical orthogonal function regression (sEOF-r) method. By violating the constraints of linear inversion, the topological structure of the SOM method showed a smaller error and better robustness in the SSP estimation. The improvements to enhance the accuracy and robustness of REA in the SCS were offered. These results suggested a potential utilization of REA in the SCS based on satellite data and provided a new approach for SSP estimation derived from sea surface data.

TI  - Machine Learning for Determining Interactions between Air Pollutants and Environmental Parameters in Three Cities of Iran
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Air pollution, as one of the most significant environmental challenges, has adversely affected the global economy, human health, and ecosystems. Consequently, comprehensive research is being conducted to provide solutions to air quality management. Recently, it has been demonstrated that environmental parameters, including temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, air pressure, and vegetation, interact with air pollutants, such as particulate matter (PM), NO<INF>2</INF>, SO<INF>2</INF>, O<INF>3</INF>, and CO, contributing to frameworks for forecasting air quality. The objective of the present study is to explore these interactions in three Iranian metropolises of Tehran, Tabriz, and Shiraz from 2015 to 2019 and develop a machine learning-based model to predict daily air pollution. Three distinct assessment criteria were used to assess the proposed XGBoost model, including R squared (R<SUP>2</SUP>), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Preliminary results showed that although air pollutants were significantly associated with meteorological factors and vegetation, the formulated model had low accuracy in predicting (R<SUP>2</SUP><INF>PM<INF>2.5</INF></INF> = 0.36, R<SUP>2</SUP><INF>PM<INF>10</INF></INF> = 0.27, R<SUP>2</SUP><INF>NO<INF>2</INF></INF> = 0.46, R<SUP>2</SUP><INF>SO<INF>2</INF></INF> = 0.41, R<SUP>2</SUP><INF>O<INF>3</INF></INF> = 0.52, and R<SUP>2</SUP><INF>CO</INF> = 0.38). Accordingly, future studies should consider more variables, including emission data from manufactories and traffic, as well as sunlight and wind direction. It is also suggested that strategies be applied to minimize the lack of observational data by considering second-and third-order interactions between parameters, increasing the number of simultaneous air pollution and meteorological monitoring stations, as well as hybrid machine learning models based on proximal and satellite data.

TI  - Hybrid Software Deployment Strategy for Complex Industrial Systems
T2  - ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Complex industrial systems run the different pieces of software in several interconnected physical layers. The software update in such an environment must be performed in the shortest possible period with the lowest possible resource usage. Namely, it is critical to minimize the data traffic, decrease software downtime, and reduce the impact of the transitional stage during the update process. To meet these requirements and to unify the update process, the common software node structure along with a hybrid software deployment strategy is proposed. The hybrid strategy is defined as a combination of the existing and well-tested techniques-blue/green, canary, and feature flags. The main aim was to utilize their positive sides and to obtain a better overall effect. The approach was tested in the simulation environment, based on the realistic factory layout, and running the software related to the enterprise resource planning (ERP) level. For successful updates, the proposed hybrid deployment method reduced downtime on server nodes to less than 5% and on client nodes to a half compared with the standard approach. The volume of data traffic reduction in a configuration with sentinel nodes is reduced by one-third. The presented results look promising, especially in cases of erroneous updates when a roll back is needed, where the downtime on the server nodes is reduced to the level of 3%. Achieved results are used to define the set of recommendations that could be extended for the other software layers, followed by a discussion about further potential problems and strategy variations.

TI  - Cover classifications in wetlands using Sentinel-1 data (Band C): a case study in the Parana river delta, Argentina
T2  - REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION
M3  - Article
AB  - With the launch of the Sentinel-1 mission, for the first time, multitemporal and dual-polarization C-band SAR data with a short revisit time is freely available. How can we use this data to generate accurate vegetation cover maps on a local scale? Our main objective was to assess the use of multitemporal C-Band Sentinel-1 data to generate wetland vegetation maps. We considered a portion of the Lower Delta of the Parana River wetland (Argentina). Seventy-four images were acquired and 90 datasets were created with them, each one addressing a combination of seasons (spring, autumn, winter, summer, complete set), polarization (VV, HV, both), and texture measures (included or not). For each dataset, a Random Forest classifier was trained. Then, the kappa index values (kappa) obtained by the 90 classifications made were compared. Considering the datasets formed by the intensity values, for the winter dates the achieved kappa index values (kappa) were higher than 0.8, while all summer datasets achieved. up to 0.76. Including feature textures based on the GLCM showed improvements in the classifications: for the summer datasets, the. improvements were between 9% and 22% and for winter datasets improvements were up to 15%. Our results suggest that for the analyzed context, winter is the most informative season. Moreover, for dates associated with high biomass, the textures provide complementary information.

TI  - Spatio-temporal modelling of particulate matter concentrations using satellite derived aerosol optical depth over coastal region of Chennai in India
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study primarily focuses on describing aerosol optical depth (AOD), its distribution pattern and seasonal variation, and modelling Particulate Matter Concentrations in Chennai. The frequency distribution of AOD and PM2.5 demonstrates that AOD can be used as a proxy for estimating PM2.5 in the study region as the occurrence of AOD almost resonates with that of PM2.5. The seasonal variation of AOD and PM2.5 revealed that during the winter (October-January) and summer (February-May) seasons, AOD reasonably followed the trend of PM2.5. However, during the monsoon period, AOD showed random variations. Different models like linear and non-linear regression models and machine learning models such as random forest (RF) have been developed for PM2.5 estimation. The model's performance in different stations and seasons has been assessed. The effect of meteorology and other factors in the model has also been assessed. From linear and non-linear model analysis, AOD was a significant parameter in estimating PM2.5. The Random Forest model was the stable model for the study region, with a model R-2 of 0.53 and an RMSE of 15.89 mu g/m(3). The inclusion of meteorological parameters like relative humidity, wind speed, and wind direction decreased the error in prediction by 17.45 mu g/m(3). The seasonal and spatial analysis indicates that the prediction capability of models varies with stations and seasons. The best performing model was found to be Model RF, and the model could explain about 53.14% of the variability in PM2.5 concentration occurrence in the study region with a prediction error of 15.89 mu g/m(3).

TI  - Damaged Area Mapping and Ground Displacement Estimation using Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Interferometry: January 12, 2020, Taal Volcano Eruption Case Study, Philippines
T2  - MINDANAO JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The availability of damage assessment maps and ground displacement information is essential in the Philippines, which experiences various types of climate-induced and naturally-driven geohazards. The emergence of freely accessible space-borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data has led to interferometric SAR (InSAR) applications in the Philippines. However, most InSAR studies only focused on ground displacement detection, monitoring, and modeling and not on damages resulting from geohazards. This work used pre- and co-eruption Sentinel-1 interferometric pair datasets and the SeNtinel-1 Application Platform tool to create a pixel-based damage proxy map (DPM) for the 2020 Taal Volcano eruption in the Philippines, employing a coherence difference analysis. The pre-eruption coherence difference data stack mean and standard deviation were exploited to achieve a coherence difference threshold that reasonably created the DPM that delineated damaged areas, which included buildings and roads. The DPM was qualitatively evaluated through comparison with the field investigation and reports obtained from the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) and showed significant agreement with 89% overall accuracy. The decomposition of the line-of-sight displacement field map revealed the dynamic geological activities due to the phreatomagmatic eruption. The vertical displacements from InSAR and in-situ measurements obtained from field inspection and PHIVOLCS reports showed excellent agreement with root-mean-squared less than 2 cm and coefficient of determination (R-2) close to unity. Overall, the application of InSAR to Sentinel-1 SAR images successfully mapped damaged areas and estimated ground displacements associated with the Taal Volcano phreatomagmatic eruption on January 12, 2020.

TI  - Metastasis of melanoma in non-sentinel nodes in patients with metastatic sentinel node. Can we avoid complementary lymphadenectomy?
T2  - CIRUGIA Y CIRUJANOS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Lymph mapping with sentinel node biopsy is the standard procedure for lymph node staging in patients with cutane-ous melanoma with a tumor thickness of 1 mm or greater. Patients who have metastases in sentinel node must undergo comple-mentary lymphadenectomy; however, it has not been shown to improve survival. Objective: To know the prevalence in our setting of metastases in the product of complementary lymphadenectomy in patients with metastatic sentinel node. Method: Evaluation of a descriptive, retrospective, observational and analytical cohort of patients with metastatic sentinel node submitted to lymphad-enectomy. Multivariate analysis of tumor thickness, neural invasion, location, sentinel node number, serum DHL level, lymph nodes dissected and extracapsular spread. Results: 67 patients, 35 women and 32 men with a mean of 66 years, 22% had metastases in lymph nodes from complementary lymphadenectomy, 19% of them with extracapsular spread; no relationship with the Breslow level. Extracapsular spread in the sentinel node, lymphadenectomy time, and perineural invasion in the primary tumor were prog-nostic factors for non-sentinel node metastasis. Conclusions: In this series, 22% of the patients with a sentinel node-positive have metastases in the non-sentinel nodes, 19% of them with extracapsular spread, which justifies complementary lymphadenectomy.

TI  - Does Residual Invasive Disease in Wide Local Excision after Diagnosis with Partial Biopsy Technique Influence Survival in Melanoma? Matched-Pair Analysis of Multicenter Selective Lymphadenectomy Trial I and II
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF SURGEONS
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Current guidelines recommend excisional/complete biopsy for melanoma diagnosis, owing to high rates of residual disease found at wide local excision (WLE) after partial biopsy techniques. We sought to determine any survival disadvantage associated with the presence of residual invasive melanoma in the WLE after diagnosis with a partial biopsy technique.STUDY DESIGN: Data were examined from Multicenter Selective Lymphadenectomy Trials I and II (MSLT-I and -II), 2 large melanoma trials. Patients diagnosed with excisional/complete biopsy were excluded. Clinicopathologic characteristics, melanoma-specific survival (MSS), distant disease-free survival (DDFS), and disease-free survival (DFS) of those with residual invasive melanoma in the definitive WLE and those with no residual melanoma were compared. Matched pairing was used to reduce variability between groups.RESULTS: From 1994 through 2014, 3,939 patients were enrolled in these trials and 874 (22%) were diagnosed using partial biopsy techniques. Of these, 399 (46%) had residual tumor in the WLE. Only 6 patients had residual tumor in their WLE resulting in T-upstaging of their tumor. Match-pairing formed two cohorts (1:1) of patients with and without residual invasive tumor after WLE. A total of 514 patients were paired; 288 (56%) males, 148 (28.8%) aged 60 or older, 192 (37.4%) with truncal melanomas, 214 (41.6%) had Breslow thickness 2 mm or greater, and 376 (73.2%) had positive sentinel nodes. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed no statistical difference in 10-year MSS (73.6% +/- 3.3% vs 73.9% +/- 3.7%, p = 0.891), DDFS (68.7% +/- 3.4% vs 65.3% +/- 4.0%, p = 0.548), or DFS (59.6% +/- 3.7% vs 59.4% +/- 3.9%, p = 0.783).CONCLUSIONS: Survival in patients with primary melanoma does not appear to be worse in patients who undergo a partial biopsy technique and are later found to have residual invasive tumor in the WLE specimen.

TI  - Analyzing the Benefit-Cost Ratio of Sediment Resources by Remote Sensing Data in the Ping River Basin, Thailand
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Sediment is one of the important natural resources on the Earth. Information on sediment resources is key to making decisions regarding soil resources management and mitigation during sediment hazard events. Thus, this research analyzed and mapped the benefit-cost ratio (BCR) of sediment in the Ping River using a Geographic Information System (GIS). Furthermore, the benefit of sediment was analyzed using a new application of the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) with a spatial resolution of 1 km(2). The results reveal that the potential of annual soil loss and sediment deposition in the Ping River Basin (PRB) were approximately 825 and 530 m(3)/km(2)center dot y, respectively. In addition, the results indicated that there was a higher BCR in the upstream area of the PRB where there was greater sediment deposition. The average benefit of sediment in the PRB is USD 4280/km(2)center dot y. It is expected that the BCR of the sediment resources map analyzed in this research will help policy-makers for decision-making on the benefits of sediment resources in Thailand.

T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES

AB  - The present study estimates spatial and temporal (seasonal/annual) trends in daytime land surface tem-perature (LST) and its drivers (elevation, cloud fraction (CF), atmospheric water vapor (AWV), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and snow cover area (SCA)) over the High Mountain Asia (HMA) dur-ing 2001-2019 using MODIS remote sensing data. The findings of the study showed mixed trends in LST in the region with intra-regional variations. Overall, the warming in the region is attributed to increasing AWV and NDVI and declining CF and SCA. The study also found evidence of elevation-dependent warm-ing (EDW) (4500-5500 m AMSL) in some regions. However, the same conclusion cannot be drawn in all the sub-regions of HMA, suggesting the need to explore the effects of additional natural and anthro-pogenic factors on LST with fine resolution data to improve the understanding of its spatio-temporal dynamics.(c) 2022 National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science.

TI  - Reconstruction of GRACE Mass Change Time Series Using a Bayesian Framework
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment and its Follow On (GRACE (-FO)) missions have resulted in a paradigm shift in understanding the temporal changes in the Earth's gravity field and its drivers. To provide continuous observations to the user community, missing monthly solutions within and between GRACE (-FO) missions (33 solutions) need to be imputed. Here, we modeled GRACE (-FO) data (196 solutions) between 04/2002-04/2021 to infer missing solutions and derive uncertainties in the existing and missing observations using Bayesian inference. First, we parametrized the GRACE (-FO) time series using an additive generative model comprising long-term variability (secular trend + interannual to decadal variations), annual, and semi-annual cycles. Informative priors for each component were used and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) was applied to generate 2,000 samples for each component to quantify the posterior distributions. Second, we reconstructed the new data (229 solutions) by joining medians of posterior distributions of all components and adding back the residuals to secure the variability of the original data. Results show that the reconstructed solutions explain 99% of the variability of the original data at the basin scale and 78% at the one-degree grid scale. The results outperform other reconstructed data in terms of accuracy relative to land surface modeling. Our data-driven approach relies only on GRACE (-FO) observations and provides a total uncertainty over GRACE (-FO) data from the data-generation process perspective. Moreover, the predictive posterior distribution can be potentially used for "nowcasting" in GRACE (-FO) near-real-time applications (e.g., data assimilations), which minimize the current mission data latency (40-60 days).Plain Language Summary A complete-time series of Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment and its Follow On (GRACE (-FO)) satellite data without gaps is critical for learning about the impact of climate change and human interventions on the Earth's systems. However, maintaining operational satellites is challenging. The GRACE (-FO) record has 33 missing monthly solutions. To develop estimates of these missing solutions, we evaluated the processes that generate these data using probability and the information we knew about these processes, such as distributions, ranges of intercepts, slopes, frequencies, and variability. We then used Markov Chain Monte Carlo to generate 2,000 samples for each of these processes. These samples were then used to infer the complete time series using their medians. We added a level of uncertainty around these medians using these samples. We compared these results with land surface modeling and other reconstructed data. Our method compared favorably with the model outputs and the original data. Then, we estimated a similar probability of the near future as surrogates for unseen or undelivered GRACE (-FO) data. We recommend to researchers interested in GRACE's near real-time data application (e.g., data assimilation) to incorporate these surrogates to overcome the GRACE data latency.

TI  - Monitoring of Multi-Aspect Drought Severity and Socio-Economic Status in the Semi-Arid Regions of Eastern Tamil Nadu, India
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - A framework was set up to monitor drought in the semi-arid regions of eastern Tamil Nadu, southern India, for the period of 2014-2018 CE with the application of the standardized precipitation index (SPI), the scaled drought-condition index (SDCI), and the standardized water-level index (SWI). The results emphasized that this region had a negative precipitation anomaly and vegetative stress, both of which triggered meteorological and agricultural droughts and caused significant losses in the farming sector. The distributions of extreme and high-level hydrological droughts were at their maximum in 2017 CE. The multi-drought severity index (MDSI), implemented to assess the combined impact and highlighting the gradient of affected areas, illustrated that the eastern region (i.e., Jayankondam block) was the most extremely affected, followed by the northern and southern regions (i.e., T.Palur and Andimadam), which were moderately affected by droughts. The extremely affected eastern region has less of an ability to overcome droughts due to its socio-economic vulnerability, with its greater population and household density leading to the over-exploitation of potential resources. Therefore, the focus of this study is on the monitoring of drought severity in micro-administrative units to suggest an appropriate management plan. Hence, the extreme-drought-prone block (Jayankondam) should be given high priority in monitoring and implementing long-term management practices for its conservation and resilience against the effects of severe droughts.

TI  - Empirical Models for Estimating Air Temperature Using MODIS Land Surface Temperature (and Spatiotemporal Variables) in the Hurd Peninsula of Livingston Island, Antarctica, between 2000 and 2016
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we present empirical models for estimating daily mean air temperature (T-a) in the Hurd Peninsula of Livingston Island (Antarctica) using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Land Surface Temperature (LST) data and spatiotemporal variables. The models were obtained and validated using the daily mean T-a from three Spanish in situ meteorological stations (AEMET stations), Juan Carlos I (JCI), Johnsons Glacier (JG), and Hurd Glacier (HG), and three stations in our team's monitoring sites, Incinerador (INC), Reina Sofia (SOF), and Collado Ramos (CR), as well as daytime and nighttime Terra-MODIS LST and Aqua-MODIS LST data between 2000 and 2016. Two types of multiple linear regression (MLR) models were obtained: models for each individual station (for JCI, INC, SOF, and CR-not for JG and HG due to a lack of data) and global models using all stations. In the study period, the JCI and INC stations were relocated, so we analyzed the data from both locations separately (JCI1 and JCI2; INC1 and INC2). In general, the best individual T-a models were obtained using daytime Terra LST data, the best results for CR being followed by JCI2, SOF, and INC2 (R-2 = 0.5-0.7 and RSE = 2 degrees C). Model cross validation (CV) yielded results similar to those of the models (for the daytime Terra LST data: R-CV(2) = 0.4-0.6, RMSECV = 2.5-2.7 degrees C, and bias = -0.1 to 0.1 degrees C). The best global T-a model was also obtained using daytime Terra LST data (R-2 = 0.6 and RSE = 2 degrees C; in its validation: R-CV(2) = 0.5, RMSECV = 3, and bias = -0.03), along with the significant (p < 0.05) variables: linear time (t) and two time harmonics (sine-cosine), distance to the coast (d), slope (s), curvature (c), and hour of LST observation (H). T-a and LST data were carefully corrected and filtered, respectively, prior to its analysis and comparison. The analysis of the T-a time series revealed different cooling/warming trends in the locations, indicating a complex climatic variability at a spatial scale in the Hurd Peninsula. The variation of T-a in each station was obtained by the Locally Weighted Regression (LOESS) method. LST data that was not "good quality" usually underestimated T-a and were filtered, which drastically reduced the LST data (<5% of the studied days). Despite the shortage of "good" MODIS LST data in these cold environments, all months were represented in the final dataset, demonstrating that the MODIS LST data, through the models obtained in this article, are useful for estimating long-term trends in T-a and generating mean T-a maps at a global level (1 km(2) spatial resolution) in the Hurd Peninsula of Livingston Island.

TI  - Modeling forest cover dynamics in Bangladesh using multilayer perceptron neural network with Markov chain
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Raghunandan Hills Reserve is an important protected area in Bangladesh that supports some remnant patches of natural forest and is the habitat of several globally threatened primates including Western Hoolock Gibbon, Northern Pig-tailed Macaque, and Capped Langur. However, deforestation and forest degradation due to anthropogenic factors, such as illegal logging and fuelwood collection are age-old problems at Raghunandan. The areas of the reserve vulnerable to future conversions due to the possible proximate or underlaying causes were unknown. This study analyzed the historical trend of forest and land-use/landcover transitions at Raghunandan Hills Reserve from 1995 until 2015 at a 10-year interval using Monte Carlo spectral unmixing and knowledge-based classification approaches to Landsat satellite images in Claslite and ArcGIS software. Based on the past trend, it then predicted the future trend of forest land-use/landcover transitions for 2025 and 2035 using an artificial multi-layer perceptron neural network with Markov Chain machine learning algorithm integrated into the land change modeler module of IDRISI/TerrSet software. Results indicated that similar to 30 % to 35% of the total area of the reserve was covered by forest, which included patches of natural forest and plantations, whereas the remaining area was occupied by non-forest categories like scattered degraded forests, grasses, and shrubs. Forest cover declined during 1995-2005, and then increased slightly during 2005-2015 due to afforestation activities. This trend is likely to continue in the future with forest cover occupying nearly 40% of the reserve by 2025 and 2035. Along with identifying the areas where the forest is likely to be expanded, the areas of the reserve vulnerable to deforestation (hotspots) were also highlighted and quantified in the form of maps and statistics. The findings have useful implications for any forest conservation initiatives including the global climate change mitigation program reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation+, which requires identifying at-risk areas of planned and unplanned deforestation.

TI  - Modelling of Land Use/Cover and LST Variations by Using GIS and Remote Sensing: A Case Study of the Northern Pakhtunkhwa Mountainous Region, Pakistan
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Alteration in Land Use/Cover (LULC) considered a major challenge over the recent decades, as it plays an important role in diminishing biodiversity, altering the macro and microclimate. Therefore, the current study was designed to examine the past 30 years (1987-2017) changes in LULC and Land Surface Temperature (LST) and also simulated for next 30 years (2047). The LULC maps were developed based on maximum probability classification while the LST was retrieved from Landsat thermal bands and Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE) method for the respective years. Different approaches were used, such as Weighted Evidence (WE), Cellular Automata (CA) and regression prediction model for the year 2047. Resultantly, the LULC classification showed increasing trend in built-up and bare soil classes (13 km(2) and 89 km(2)), and the decreasing trend in vegetation class (-144 km(2)) in the study area. In the next 30 years, the built-up and bare soil classes would further rise with same speed (25 km(2) and 36.53 km(2)), and the vegetation class would further decline (-147 km(2)) until 2047. Similarly for LST, the temperature range for higher classes (27 -< 30 degrees C) increased by about 140 km(2) during 1987-2017, which would further enlarge (409 km(2)) until 2047. The lower LST range (15 degrees C to <21 degrees C) showed a decreasing trend (-54.94 km(2)) and would further decline to (-20 km(2)) until 2047 if it remained at the same speed. Prospective findings will be helpful for land use planners, climatologists and other scientists in reducing the increasing LST associated with LULC changes.

TI  - A Coupled Evaluation of Operational MODIS and Model Aerosol Products for Maritime Environments Using Sun Photometry: Evaluation of the Fine and Coarse Mode
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although satellite retrievals and data assimilation have progressed to where there is a good skill for monitoring maritime Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), there remains uncertainty in achieving further degrees of freedom, such as distinguishing fine and coarse mode dominated species in maritime environments (e.g., coarse mode sea salt and dust versus fine mode terrestrial anthropogenic emissions, biomass burning, and maritime secondary production). For the years 2016 through 2019, we performed an analysis of 550 nm total AOD(550), fine mode AOD (FAOD(550); also known as FM AOD in the literature), coarse mode AOD (CAOD(550)), and fine mode fraction (eta(550)) between Moderate Resolution Spectral Imaging Radiometer (MODIS) V6.1 MOD/MYD04 dark target aerosol retrievals and the International Cooperative for Aerosol Prediction (ICAP) core four multi-model consensus (C4C) of analyses/short term forecasts that assimilate total MODIS AOD(550). Differences were adjudicated by the global shipboard Maritime Aerosol Network (MAN) and selected island AERONET sun photometer observations with the application of the spectral deconvolution algorithm (SDA). Through a series of conditional and regional analyses, we found divergence included regions of terrestrial influence and latitudinal dependencies in the remote oceans. Notably, MODIS and the C4C and its members, while having good correlations overall, have a persistent +0.04 to +0.02 biases relative to MAN and AERONET for typical AOD(550) values (84th% < 0.28), with the C4C underestimating significant events thereafter. Second, high biases in AOD(550) are largely associated with the attribution of the fine mode in satellites and models alike. Thus, both MODIS and C4C members are systematically overestimating AOD(550) and FAOD(550) but perform better in characterizing the CAOD(550). Third, for MODIS, findings are consistent with previous reports of a high bias in the retrieved angstrom ngstrom Exponent, and we diagnosed both the optical model and cloud masking as likely causal factors for the AOD(550) and FAOD(550) high bias, whereas for the C4C, it is likely from secondary overproduction and perhaps numerical diffusion. Fourth, while there is no wind-speed-dependent bias for surface winds <12 m s(-1), the C4C and MODIS AOD(550)s also overestimate CAOD(550) and FAOD(550), respectively, for wind speeds above 12 m/s. Finally, sampling bias inherent in MAN, as well as other circumstantial evidence, suggests biases in MODIS are likely even larger than what was diagnosed here. We conclude with a discussion on how MODIS and the C4C products have their own strengths and challenges for a given climate application and discuss needed research.

TI  - PolSAR Scene Classification via Low-Rank Constrained Multimodal Tensor Representation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) data can be acquired at all times and are not impacted by weather conditions. They can efficiently capture geometrical and geographical structures on the ground. However, due to the complexity of the data and the difficulty of data availability, PolSAR image scene classification remains a challenging task. To this end, in this paper, a low-rank constrained multimodal tensor representation method (LR-MTR) is proposed to integrate PolSAR data in multimodal representations. To preserve the multimodal polarimetric information simultaneously, the target decompositions in a scene from multiple spaces (e.g., Freeman, H/A/alpha, Pauli, etc.) are exploited to provide multiple pseudo-color images. Furthermore, a representation tensor is constructed via the representation matrices and constrained by the low-rank norm to keep the cross-information from multiple spaces. A projection matrix is also calculated by minimizing the differences between the whole cascaded data set and the features in the corresponding space. It also reduces the redundancy of those multiple spaces and solves the out-of-sample problem in the large-scale data set. To support the experiments, two new PolSAR image data sets are built via ALOS-2 full polarization data, covering the areas of Shanghai, China, and Tokyo, Japan. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) dimension reduction algorithms, the proposed method achieves the best quantitative performance and demonstrates superiority in fusing multimodal PolSAR features for image scene classification.

TI  - Does It Really Pay-Off? Comparison of Lymphadenectomy versus Observational Approach in Skin Melanoma with Positive Sentinel Node Biopsy: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - The aim of this meta-analysis was to answer the question as to whether performing CLND (complete lymph node dissection) is necessary in every case of the melanoma patient after the positive SNB (sentinel node biopsy). To resolve doubts the authors reanalyzed previous articles and systematized the knowledge about the concerning medical problem. The databases such as PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science were screened to find articles that will be helpful to answer the controversial question if performing lymphadenectomy is crucial. The inclusion criteria consisted of randomized clinical trials, comparison of lymphadenectomy versus observation and positive sentinel node biopsy. After which, seven articles were examined. Authors analyzed parameters such as: recurrence, 3-year survival and 5-year survival. There was no relationship between the performance of CLND and melanoma recurrence (OR 1.04; 95% CI: 0.82-1.31; p = 0.75). However, no CLND group had higher 3-year survival (OR 1.22; 95% CI: 1.03-1.44; p = 0.02) and 5-year survival (OR 1.30; 95% CI: 1.19-1.85; p = 0.008). In conclusion, the observational approach to the melanoma patients with positive sentinel node biopsy is associated with comparable or slightly improved 3- and 5-year survival, then in case of routine lymphadenectomy. Although, in each melanoma patient a decision to perform or withhold lymphadenectomy should always be considered individually. Patients with low perioperative risk could be considered for surgical approach. The study was registered in PROSPERO and was assigned with the unique identifying number "CRD42021241272".

TI  - Comparing PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 Imagery for Mapping Mountain Pines in the Sarntal Alps, Italy
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The mountain pine (Pinus mugo ssp. Mugo Turra) is an important component of the alpine treeline ecotone and fulfills numerous ecosystem functions. To understand and quantify the impacts of increasing logging activities and climatic changes in the European Alps, accurate information on the occurrence and distribution of mountain pine stands is needed. While Earth observation provides up-to-date information on land cover, space-borne mapping of mountain pines is challenging as different coniferous species are spectrally similar, and small-structured patches may remain undetected due to the sensor's spatial resolution. This study uses multi-temporal optical imagery from PlanetScope (3 m) and Sentinel-2 (10 m) and combines them with additional features (e.g., textural statistics (homogeneity, contrast, entropy, spatial mean and spatial variance) from gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), topographic features (elevation, slope and aspect) and canopy height information) to overcome the present challenges in mapping mountain pine stands. Specifically, we assessed the influence of spatial resolution and feature space composition including the GLCM window size for textural features. The study site is covering the Sarntal Alps, Italy, a region known for large stands of mountain pine. Our results show that mountain pines can be accurately mapped (PlanetScope (90.96%) and Sentinel-2 (90.65%)) by combining all features. In general, Sentinel-2 can achieve comparable results to PlanetScope independent of the feature set composition, despite the lower spatial resolution. In particular, the inclusion of textural features improved the accuracy by +8% (PlanetScope) and +3% (Sentinel-2), whereas accuracy improvements of topographic features and canopy height were low. The derived map of mountain pines in the Sarntal Alps supports local forest management to monitor and assess recent and ongoing anthropogenic and climatic changes at the treeline. Furthermore, our study highlights the importance of freely available Sentinel-2 data and image-derived textural features to accurately map mountain pines in Alpine environments.

TI  - Nationwide, Operational Sentinel-1 Based InSAR Monitoring System in the Cloud for Strategic Water Facilities in Hungary
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The intensive development of both interferometric technology and sensors in recent years allows Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR)-based applications to be accessible to a growing number of users. InSAR-based services now cover entire countries and soon even the whole of Europe. These InSAR systems require massive amounts of computer processing power and significant time to generate a final product. Most, if not all, of these projects have a limited "monitoring component", aimed at historical analysis but are rarely, if ever, updated. Consequently, the results do not necessarily meet every purpose or specific user requirement. It is now clear that the increasing computing capacity and big data provided by the sensors have initiated the development of new InSAR services. However, these systems are only useful when linked to specific real-world operational problems. Continuous monitoring of a country's ageing water management infrastructure has become an increasingly critical issue in recent years, in addition to the threats posed by climate change. Our article provides a comprehensive overview of a nationwide, dedicated, operational InSAR application, which was developed to support the operational work of the Hungarian Disaster Management Service (HDMS). The objective was to provide monthly monitoring of 63 water facilities, including 83 individual objects, distributed throughout Hungary, in combination with the development of a near real-time warning system. Our work involved the compilation of a completely new InSAR System as a Service (SaaS) which incorporates user requirements, preparatory work, the compilation of the Sentinel-1 automatic processing pipeline, the installation of corner reflectors, a special early warning system, and a dedicated user interface. The developed system can automatically start to evaluate the S1 measurements within 24 h of downloading the data into the system storage forward the results toward the warning system before the next image arrives. Users are provided with detailed information on the stability of 70% of the 83 water facility objects monitored through the dedicated user interface. The additional early warning system currently operates as a preliminary "spatial decision support system", but the HDMS is willing to make it fully operational over the next few years.

TI  - Remote sea-surface temperature variations (2001-2019) in Kuwait Bay: Time series analysis in frequency and time domains
T2  - KUWAIT JOURNAL OF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Because of the direct link between sea temperature and aquatic biodiversity, there is a need to analyze the temporal changes in sea surface temperature in various water bodies, especially the semi-enclosed ones. There has been substantial research undertaken on time series analysis as a powerful technique for studying the characteristics of long-term SST changes at regular time intervals. The present paper aimed to examine the monthly-averaged MODIS SST data (2001-2019) over Kuwait Bay, i.e., the northwestern corner of the Arabian Gulf. Because different approaches can yield different results, the analysis of the SST time series was conducted using time and frequency domains. The preliminary analysis of the time series reported a significant SST peak in August 2010 that reached nearly 34.2 degrees C (SD = 0.17 degrees C) due to the moderate-intensity El Nino event in 2010. However, in the preceding year, we observed a cool SST anomaly in the range of -0.5 degrees C to -2.4 degrees C. The SMK trend test found that monthly climatological SST in September exhibited a significant upward trend (S-9 = 103, tau = 0.6, P = 0.0004). Pettitt's change-point test indicated a significant change in the central tendency of SST data after April 2012. The annual periodicity of the SST in Kuwait Bay was constant over the 19 years. Furthermore, a very weak periodicity of 6-month has been barely noticed. Our present results provide large-scale guidance that affirms the importance of highlighting the severe SST fluctuations in Kuwait's water to understand and improve its marine environmental status.

TI  - Evaluation of the role of indocyanine green in mapping of axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundAxillary lymph nodes (LNs) are known to be the most important prognostic factor for recurrence and survival in the management of patients with early breast cancer. Blue dye and radioactive isotopes are the most widely used tracers in the mapping of axillary sentinel node (SN) biopsy. These tracers still have several drawbacks. Indocyanine green (ICG) has the potential for guiding SN biopsy.Patients and methodsA total of 35 patients with early breast cancer, clinically and radiologically node negative, underwent SN biopsy with combined ICG and patent blue (PB) dye for localization of SNs. The obtained lymph nodes were histopathologically investigated.OutcomesThis study aimed to assess the feasibility of using ICG for SN biopsy, to calculate the detection rate, and to assess the safety of ICG dye.ResultsThe mean age of the patients was 51.94 years. The detection rate of SN depending on ICG was 100 and 91% depending on the PB dye visualization. Of 129 SNs dissected from the 35 recruited patients, a mean of 2.31 +/- 1.23 nodes/patient were seen in case of SN detection by the PB dye and a mean of 3.69 +/- 0.72 nodes/patient in case of SN detection by ICG (P<0.001). No complications or adverse actions were recorded in all patients.ConclusionThis study demonstrated that ICG is a feasible technique for SN biopsy with a high detection rate and can be used safely.

TI  - Influence of environmental predispositions on temperate mountain forest damage at different spatial scales during alternating drought and flood periods: case study in HrubATIN SMALL LETTER Y WITH ACUTE Jesenik Mts. (Czech Republic)
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mountain forests are more prone to environmental predispositions (EPs) than submountain ones. While remote sensing of mountain forests enables instantaneous damage mapping, the investigation of the causes requires field data. However, a local field or regionally modeled environmental characteristics influence remote data evaluation differently. This study focused on the evaluation of EPs effects damaging mountain forests between various spatial resolutions during environmental change. The evaluation was divided into managed and natural forests in the HrubATIN SMALL LETTER Y WITH ACUTE Jesenik Mts. (Czech Republic; 240-1491 m a.s.l.; 50.082 degrees N, 17.231 degrees E). Damage was assessed through the discrimination analysis of the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) by MODIS VI during alternating drought and flood periods 2003-2014. The local environmental influence was assessed using the discrimination function (DF) separability of forest damage in the training sets. The regional influence was assessed through map algebra estimated via the DF and a forest decline spatial model based on EPs from differences between risk growth conditions and biomass fuzzy sets. Management, EPs and soil influenced forest NDVI at different levels. The management afflicted the NDVI more than the EPs. The EPs afflicted the NDVI more than the soil groups. Strong winters and droughts had a greater influence on the NDVI than the flood events, with the winter of 2005/2006 inverting the DF direction, and the 2003 drought increasing differences in managed forest biomass and decreasing differences in natural forest biomasses. More than 50% of declining managed forests in the training sets occurred on Leptosols, Podzols and Histosols. On a regional scale, the soil influence was eliminated by multiple predispositions. The EPs influenced 96% of natural forest and 65% of managed forest, though managed forest damage was more evident. The mountain forest NDVI decline was dependent on both management and risk predispositions.

TI  - Multi-Decadal Assessment of Soil Loss in a Mediterranean Region Characterized by Contrasting Local Climates
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion is one of the most widespread soil degradation phenomena worldwide. Mediterranean landscapes, due to some peculiar characteristics, such as fragility of soils, steep slopes, and rainfall distribution during the year, are particularly subject to this phenomenon, with severe and complex issues for agricultural production and biodiversity protection. In this paper, we present a diachronic approach to the analysis of soil loss, which aims to account for climate variability and land cover dynamics by using remote data about rainfall and land cover to guarantee sufficient observational continuity. The study area (Basilicata, Southern Italy) is characterized by different local climates and ecosystems (temperate, Csa and Csb; arid steppic, Bsk; and cold, Dsb and Dsc), and is particularly suited to represent the biogeographical complexity of the Mediterranean Italy. The well-known Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) was applied by integrating information from remote sensing to carry out decadal assessments (1994, 2004, 2014, and 2021) of the annual soil loss. Changes in the rainfall regime and vegetation cover activity were derived from CHIRPS and Landsat data, respectively, to obtain updated information useful for dynamical studies. For the analyzed region, soil loss shows a slight reduction (albeit always remarkable) over the whole period, and distinct spatial patterns between lowland Bsk and Mediterranean mountain Dsb and Dsc climate areas. The most alarming fact is that most of the study area showed soil erosion rates in 2021 greater than 11 t/ha*y, which is considered by the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) the threshold for identifying severe erosion phenomena. A final comparison with local studies shows, on average, differences of about 5 t ha(-1) y(-1) (minimum 2.5 and maximum 7) with respect to the local estimates obtained with the RUSLE model. The assessment at a regional scale provided an average 9.5% of soil loss difference for the arable lands and about 10% for all cultivated areas. The spatial-temporal patterns enhance the relevance of using the cover management factor C derived from satellite data rather than land cover maps, as remote observations are able to highlight the heterogeneity in vegetation density within the same vegetation cover class, which is particularly relevant for agricultural areas. For mountain areas, the adoption of a satellite-gridded rainfall dataset allowed the detection of erosion rate fluctuations due to rainfall variability, also in the case of sparse or absent ground pluviometric stations. The use of remote data represents a precious added value to obtain a dynamic picture of the spatial-temporal variability of soil loss and new insights into the sustainability of soil use in a region whose economy is mostly based on agriculture and the exploitation of natural resources.

TI  - A Socio-Ecological Approach to Understanding How Land Use Challenges Human-Elephant Coexistence in Northern Tanzania
T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - A globally rapid land use/land cover change (LULC) in human-transformed landscapes alters the interface of human-wildlife interactions due to shifting socio-ecological and environmental pressures. Understanding these shifts is crucial for mitigating repeated negative interactions that escalate conflict states between people and wildlife. This study aimed to understand LULC changes over 30 years (1989-2019), with more recent spatio-temporal patterns of high pressure at the human-elephant interface, and potentially underlying environmental and human-driven factors that affect elephant movement patterns. We analyzed a dataset of 923 human-elephant conflict occurrences, mainly crop foraging incidents, in the Enduimet Wildlife Management Area (EWMA) between the years 2016 and 2020 and combined these data with LULC for year 2019 to understand potential drivers of conflict and assess how agricultural land and settlement have increased over time. We further used GPS datasets of elephants collared between 2019 to 2020 to understand elephant movement patterns in changing land use types. Landsat image analysis revealed that 41% of the area had been converted into farmlands and settlements within the last three decades, which creates elephant-intolerant habitats and the potential to increase pressure at the human-elephant interface. Collared elephants using EWMA moved through all land use types and did not avoid settlements, although they moved through these at higher speeds, reflecting perception of risk. Elephants travelled slightly more slowly in farmland, likely reflecting the availability of foraging opportunities. Our analysis shows that human-induced LULC changes and the encroachment into elephant habitats have resulted in spatially and temporally predictable increases in HEC in EWMA, driven by the proximity of farmlands and protected areas (PAs), so that incompatible land uses are the principal drivers of damage to human livelihoods and increased risks to Tanzanian (and Kenyan) natural capital. Communities in Enduimet urgently need support to increase the effective distance between their farming activities and the PAs. Village-level crop protection and small-scale land-use planning around PAs are important first steps to halt an escalating conflict situation but need to be supported with longer-range strategies that separate incompatible land-use types and encourage the cultivation of alternative crops and livelihood diversification.

TI  - Interactions of Environmental Variables and Water Use Efficiency in the Matopiba Region via Multivariate Analysis
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the interaction of environmental variables and Water Use Efficiency (WUE) via multivariate analysis to understand the importance of each variable in the carbon-water balance in MATOPIBA. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce spatial dimensionality and to identify patterns by using the following data: (i) LST (MOD11A2) and WUE (ratio between GPP-MOD17A2 and ET-MOD16A2), based on MODIS orbital products; (ii) Rainfall based on CHIRPS precipitation product; (iii) slope, roughness, and elevation from the GMTED and SRTM version 4.1 products; and (iv) geographic data, Latitude, and Longitude. All calculations were performed in R version 3.6.3 and Quantum GIS (QGIS) version 3.4.6. Eight variables were initially used. After applying the PCA, only four were suitable: Elevation, LST, Rainfall, and WUE, with values greater than 0.7. A positive correlation (>= 0.78) between the variables (Elevation, LST, and Rainfall) and vegetation was identified. According to the KMO test, a series-considered medium was obtained (0.7 < KMO < 0.8), and it was explained by one PC (PC1). PC1 was explained by four variables (Elevation, LST, Rainfall, and WUE), among which WUE (0.8 < KMO < 0.9) was responsible for detailing 65.77% of the total explained variance. Positive scores were found in the states of Maranhao and Tocantins and negative scores in Piaui and Bahia. The positive scores show areas with greater Rainfall, GPP, and ET availability, while the negative scores show areas with greater water demand and LST. It was concluded that variations in variables such as Rainfall, LST, GPP, and ET can influence the local behavior of the carbon-water cycle of the vegetation, impacting the WUE in MATOPIBA.

T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Flooding is one of the most challenging and important natural disasters to predict, it is becoming more frequent and more intense. The study area is badly damaged by devastating flood in 2015. We assessed the flood susceptibility to northern coastal area of Tamil Nadu using various machine learning algorithms such as Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), XGBoost (XGB), Rotation Forest (RTF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes (NB). Google Earth Engine (GEE) is used to demarcate flooded areas using Sentinel-l and other multi-source geospatial data to generate influential factors. Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) removes weak factors in this study. The flood susceptibility resultant map is classified into five classes: very low, low, moderate, high, and very high. The GBM algorithm attained high classification accuracy with an area under the curve (AUC) value of 92%. The study area is urbanized and vulnerable identifying flood inundation useful for effective planning and implementation.

TI  - Validating local drivers influencing land use cover change in Southwestern Ghana: a mixed-method approach
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Addressing undesirable changes associated with the driving forces of land use cover change are critical to sustainable land management, and the future modeling of land use systems in developing countries. The study accentuates local drivers of land use cover change in Southwestern Ghana using a mixed-method approach. The approach aided in identifying key land-use drivers, using different research strategies for comparisons through confidence level analysis and Analytic Hierarchy Process. We used expert interviews, existing literature and geostatistical tools to ascertain the driving forces triggering such unprecedented changes. Landsat imagery 5 MSS, 4 and 5 TM, 7 ETM + and 8 OLI/TIRS were acquired from the United States Geological Survey's website. Land-use analysis revealed a decline in forests (- 82.41%) and areas covered by waterbodies (- 27.39%). A fundamental drift in built-up (+ 1288.36%) and farmlands/shrubs (+ 369.81%) areas were also observed. The contribution rate of change analysis revealed built-environment and increasing population contributed the most to surface temperature and land-use change. A steady increase in surface temperature can be attributed to the undesirable changes associated with land-use systems over the past 50 years. Socio-economic development in Southwestern Ghana is fuelling interest in studies related to land use cover change. Biophysical, cultural and technological factors are considered key drivers despite the "medium-to-very low confidence" in results generated. They could potentially impact climate-sensitive sectors that significantly modify land-use systems from the pessimists' and optimists' perspectives. Standpoints established through this study will enrich basic datasets for further studies at the continental level.

TI  - Remote Sensing Application for Landslide Detection, Monitoring along Eastern Lake Michigan (Miami Park, MI)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We assessed the nature and spatial and temporal patterns of deformation over the Miami Park bluffs on the eastern margin of Lake Michigan and investigated the factors controlling its observed deformation. Our approach involved the following steps: (1) extracting bluff deformation rates (velocities along the line of sight of the satellite) using a stack of Sentinel-1A radar imagery in ascending acquisition geometry acquired between 2017 and 2021 and applying the Intermittent Small Baseline Subset (ISBAS) InSAR time series analysis method; (2) generating high-resolution (5 cm) elevation models and orthophotos from temporal unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) surveys acquired in 2017, 2019, and 2021; and (3) comparing the temporal variations in mass wasting events to other relevant datasets including the ISBAS-based bluff deformation time series, lake level (LL) variations, and local glacial stratigraphy. We identified areas witnessing high line-of-sight (LOS) deformation rates (up to -21 mm/year) along the bluff from the ISBAS analysis and seasonal deformation patterns associated with freeze-thaw cycles, suggesting a causal effect. The acceleration of slope failures detected from field and UAV acquisitions correlated with high LLs and intensified onshore wave energy in 2020. The adopted methodology successfully predicts landslides caused by freezes and thaws of the slope face by identifying prolonged slow deformation preceding slope failures, but it does not predict the catastrophic landslides preceded by short-lived LOS deformation related to LL rise.

TI  - Ask the shark: blackmouth catshark (<i>Galeus melastomus</i>) as a sentinel of plastic waste on the seabed
T2  - MARINE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The presence of plastic waste in the marine environment has driven the scientific community to make significant efforts to study and mitigate its possible effects. One of the critical aspects is to determine if and how an increase in ingestion events may occur as a result of the accumulation of plastic waste on the seabed. In this study, G. melastomus is examined for its ability to indirectly provide information on the amount of macroplastics accumulating on the seafloor. Plastic ingestion is explored by describing the feeding habits of the species, which have the potential to provide very useful information regarding biological or ecological issues. The diet of G. melastomus mainly consisted of cephalopods, bathypelagic fishes, and decapod crustaceans, increasing in diversity during growth. The generalist-opportunistic feeding behaviour of this species leads to the incidental ingestion of plastic particles (N = 47, with a mean (+/- SD) of 1.47 +/- 0.28 per specimen) which can be indirectly associated to the presence of macroplastics on the seafloor. Indeed, our results indicate a significant relationship between the amount of macroplastics present on the seabed and the frequency of ingestion of plastic particles by blackmouth catshark. We propose G. melastomus as an excellent candidate for developing a valid monitoring strategy for the presence of plastics on the seabed, as requested by the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive.

TI  - Towards an Integrated Observational System to Investigate Sediment Transport in the Tidal Inlets of the Lagoon of Venice
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An observation system integrating satellite images, in situ water parameters and hydrodynamic measurements was implemented in a tidal inlet of the Venice Lagoon (Northern Adriatic Sea, Italy). The experimental infrastructure was developed to autonomously investigate suspended sediment dynamics in the two channels of the Lido inlet in relation to the longshore currents in the littoral zone and the tidal circulation along the lagoon channel network. It provided time series of turbidity at the surface, water flow and acoustic backscatter, which was converted into turbidity along the vertical column during different tidal phases and meteo-marine conditions. Accurate turbidity maps were derived from Sentinel-2 (Copernicus) and Landsat 8 (NASA) satellites. Long-term in situ data from field surveys enabled the calibration and intercalibration of the instrumental setup and validation of satellite-derived products. Time series from the instrumental network were analyzed in order to evaluate the temporal variability of suspended sediment in relation to tidal phases and the different meteo-marine conditions. The integration of available datasets with satellite images also permitted the testing of the methodology for a 3-D reconstruction of the suspended sediment pattern in calm sea conditions, under the effect of the sole hydrodynamical forcing. Remotely sensed data provide a synoptic distribution of turbidity in the inlet area allowing the analysis of the surficial patterns of suspended sediment and the inferring of information on the transport processes at different spatial scales. In calm sea conditions, the results show that the transport is driven by tidal currents with a net seaward transport related to a larger export of materials from the northern basin of the Lagoon of Venice. During typical northeasterly storms, materials mobilized on the beaches and in the shoreface are transported into the inlet and distributed into the lagoon channel network, following the flood tidal currents and determining net import of materials. The multitude of information provided by this system can support research on aquatic science (i.e., numerical simulations) and address end-user community practices. The ecosystem management will also benefit operational purposes, such as the monitoring of morphological transformations, erosion processes and planning of coastal defense in the future scenarios of sea level rise. The developed approach will also help to understand how the regulation of the inlet flow introduced by the operation of the flood barriers will affect the fluxes of particles and, in the long term, the lagoon morphodynamics.

TI  - Collegiate musicians' experiences with democratic rehearsal procedures
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MUSIC EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore collegiate musicians' lived experiences with democratic rehearsal procedures in a concert band setting. A constructivist worldview and phenomenological framework were used to examine participants' experiences using their own words through weekly written reflections, pre- and post- questionnaires, rehearsal interactions, and semi-structured interviews. Participants (N = 42) were members of a co-directed, non-auditioned university concert band at a large midwestern university. Data collection took place during an eight-week concert cycle which included scaffolded democratic experiences such as (a) selecting music for performance, (b) participating in collaborative score study/preparation during rehearsal, (c) identifying and selecting music segments for rehearsal, (d) identifying and describing opportunities for individual and ensemble performance improvement, (e) analyzing, discussing, and making decisions regarding how the music should be performed, (f) participating in student-led sectionals, and (g) participating in student-led full ensemble rehearsal. Themes associated with participants' experiences included (a) the value of multiple perspectives, (b) ownership and musical agency, (c) engagement, and (d) providing feedback. Participants indicated that the democratic rehearsal cycle was generally a positive experience. Application of democratic rehearsal procedures may aid students in developing their agency, musicianship, and musical independence.

TI  - Formation of Nano- and Micro-Scale Surface Features Induced by Long-Range Femtosecond Filament Laser Ablation
T2  - NANOMATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, we study the characteristics of femtosecond-filament-laser-matter interactions and laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) at a beam-propagation distance up to 55 m. The quantification of the periodicity of filament-induced self-organized surface structures was accomplished by SEM and AFM measurements combined with the use of discrete two-dimensional fast Fourier transform (2D-FFT) analysis, at different filament propagation distances. The results show that the size of the nano-scale surface features increased with ongoing laser filament processing and, further, periodic ripples started to form in the ablation-spot center after irradiation with five spatially overlapping pulses. The effective number of irradiating filament pulses per spot area affected the developing surface texture, with the period of the low spatial frequency LIPSS reducing notably at a high pulse number. The high regularity of the filament-induced ripples was verified by the demonstration of the angle-of-incidence-dependent diffraction of sunlight. This work underlines the potential of long-range femtosecond filamentation for energy delivery at remote distances, with suppressed diffraction and long depth focus, which can be used in biomimetic laser surface engineering and remote-sensing applications.

T2  - REVISTA PERUANA DE GINECOLOGIA Y OBSTETRICIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To determine the usefulness of intraoperative palpation and macroscopic characteristics of the sentinel lymph node in breast cancer in predicting its involvement on microscopic examination. Methods: Descriptive cross-sectional study with secondary analysis of a surgeon's personal registry between May 1, 2018, and October 31, 2020, at a referral center in Medellin, Colombia. Women with breast cancer without clinical axillary involvement taken to surgery for sentinel node biopsy were included. Demographic, clinical and paraclinical data were collected and analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: Of 355 patients who underwent sentinel node biopsy for breast cancer, the sentinel node detection rate was 98.3 % (n= 347). A higher probability of being affected was found in patients who underwent mastectomy (ORa= 4.61; 95% CI: 1.07-19.81), when the consistency of the node was hard or semi-hard (ORa= 3.90; 95% CI: 2.00-7.62) and when the shape of the node was lobulated or irregular (ORa= 12.98; 95% CI: 2.10-80.19). In contrast, it was less likely to be affected when it had received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (ORa= 0.11; 95% CI: 0.02-0.57). Conclusion: The evaluation of macroscopic features during sentinel node technique for axillary staging can predict its involvement on microscopic examination.

TI  - The Interplay between Spatial Urban Expansion and Morphologic Landscapes East of Cairo, Egypt Using Time Series Satellite Imagery
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to monitor the magnitudes, rates, and directions of spatial urban expansions east of Cairo and their interactions with the initial morphologic landscapes. The approach relies on using CORONA satellite images acquired in 1969 with fine spatial resolution and time series images of Landsat and ASTER from 1984 to 2020. The CORONA images enable retrieval of the initial morphologic components, whereas the Landsat and ASTER images enable the spatial urban expansions to be mapped. The magnitudes of spatial urban expansions have been massive, in the order of 165 km(2). These expansions have occurred through four main temporal phases with different spatial extents, rates, and directions in response to common urban policies and socioeconomic settings. Assessing the interactions between urban expansions and the morphology of watersheds in the study area indicates that the directions of urban expansion have been opposite to the geospatial orientations of the watersheds. In addition, significant urban areas in the order of similar to 8 km(2) are under the direct threat of flash floods because they are misplaced within the valley floors of the studied watersheds. The study concludes that successful spatial urban expansion should consider the morphologic characteristics of the initial landscape for the purpose of maximizing interests and avoiding or reducing potential hazards against urban settlements.

TI  - Assessments of ground subsidence along the railway in the Kashan plain, Iran, using Sentinel-1 data and NSBAS algorithm
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The 110-kilometer-long Qom-Kashan railway is one of the busiest lines in Iran, passing through the Kashan plain. The majority of Iran's plains have subsided in recent years as a result of uncontrolled groundwater extraction, and the Kashan plain is no exception. In this study, ground surface displacement in the Kashan plain region and its impact on the railway were investigated using New Small Baseline Subset (NSBAS) in up-down and east-west directions using descending and ascending Sentinel-1 data collected between 2015 and 2021. Our results indicate that the Kashan plain is subsiding more than 90 mm/year. The study of the local areas around the railway which passes through the study area revealed that the rate of vertical velocity in some locations reaches -23 mm/year, while the rate of east-west velocity is insignificant and is approximately & PLUSMN;2 mm/year. Additionally, a method for analyzing the railway's stability based on longitudinal profiles along the railway is presented. Our findings suggest that more than 60% of the railway line is subject to variable amounts of subsidence. Additionally, a region of approximately one kilometer of the railway has been classified as a risk zone due to relatively fast local deformation. After examining the effect of various factors, it was determined that uncontrolled groundwater extraction in agricultural areas contributed to the subsidence in this area. Our results show that the presented stability control approach in this study is highly reliable for creating hazard profiles for linear structures, such as railways.

TI  - Mapping the Thermal State of Permafrost in Northeast China Based on the Surface Frost Number Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Under the influence of climate change and human activities, the southern boundary of the permafrost region in Northeast China, which is located at the southern edge of the permafrost area of Eurasia, has moved north, the surface temperature has increased, and the thickness of the frozen layer has decreased. At present, there is a lack of classification standards or a map of the thermal state of permafrost that can reflect the dynamic change characteristics of permafrost in Northeast China. A vegetation impact factor consisting of normalized difference vegetation index and forest canopy closure was introduced into MODIS LST products, in order to improve the applicability of products in Northeast China. Based on the improved MODIS LST data, this study analyzed the distribution and change of the mean annual surface temperature and the surface frost number (SFnc) from 2003 to 2019. SFnc was used as the standard to classify the thermal state of permafrost, and a map of the thermal state distribution and changes of permafrost in Northeast China, with a spatial resolution of 1 km, was produced. Compared with the observation data of meteorological stations and field monitoring data, the reliability of classification results was nearly 95%. The map showed that there was no area of extremely stable permafrost (SFnc >= 0.667), the area of stable permafrost (0.55 <= SFnc < 0.667) changed from 14.9 x 10(4) km(2) to 6.5 x 10(4) km(2), the SFnc reduced from 0.564 to 0.557, the area of semi-stable permafrost (0.51 < SFnc < 0.55) changed from 17.68 x 10(4) km(2) to 17.77 x 10(4) km(2), the SFNc reduced from 0.529 to 0.528, and the area of transitional or unstable permafrost (0.49 <= SFnc <= 0.51) changed from 8.67 x 10(4) km(2) to 9.56 x 10(4) km(2). The thermal state of permafrost decreased and the distribution of stable permafrost shrank, due to continuous rising air temperature. The overall change characteristics of the thermal state distribution of permafrost were that the southern boundary of the permafrost region moved northward, the regional permafrost thermal state decreased, and there was an increased region of semi-stable, transitional or unstable permafrost from the frozen soil thawed at the edge of the permafrost region with higher stability. The permafrost region in Northeast China has lush vegetation, and the continuous degradation of permafrost will change the vegetation growth environment and affect the global carbon cycle process. This work will provide important data support for climate change feedback, natural disaster process research, and an early warning and prevention of terrestrial ecosystem response in the permafrost region of Eurasia.

TI  - Spatial Distribution and Variation Characteristics of Permafrost Temperature in Northeast China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Frozen soil is an important environmental factor in cold regions. Warming climate will increase the risk of permafrost thawing, i.e., accelerated carbon release, reduced super-frozen soil water, intensified desertification and destruction of infrastructure. Based on MOD11A2 and MYD11A2 products of MODIS Terra/Aqua, the distribution and change of surface frost number under the influence of normalized difference vegetation index and forest canopy closure in Northeast China from 2003 to 2019 were produced. From 2012 to 2015, the area of the regions where the surface frost number was higher than 0.5 continued to decrease in Northeast China. Taking 2013 as the time turning point, two periods of changes in the distribution of surface frost number in Northeast China were divided, namely, into 2003-2013 and 2014-2014. The spatial distribution of permafrost temperature is simulated by establishing the numerical relationship between the surface frost number and the annual average ground temperature of permafrost. From 2003 to 2019, the area of permafrost changed from 32.77 x 10(4) to 27.10 x 10(4) km(2). The distribution characteristics show that the area with permafrost temperature below -4 degrees C accounts for 0.1%, and below -3.0 degrees C accounts for 3.45%. The permafrost with lower temperature is mainly distributed in the Greater Khingan Mountains, from the northernmost Mohe to the Aershan in the middle of the ridge. The area where the permafrost temperature ranges from -2 to 0 degrees C is the largest, accounting for 73.81% of the total area. The distribution of permafrost temperatures in the Greater Khingan Mountains is mainly between -1.5 and -3 degrees C, while that in the Lesser Khingan Mountains is mainly between -2.0 and 0 degrees C. The altitude is the main factor controlling the permafrost temperature distributed at high latitudes in Northeast China. This work will provide more detailed basic data for regional research on frozen soil and the environment in Northeast China.

TI  - A Novel Polarimetric Channel Imbalance Phase Estimation Method Based on the Rotated Double-Bounce Backscatters in Urban Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Polarization calibration without artificial calibrators has been one of the focuses of research and discussion for PolSAR communities. However, there is limited research on the treatment of dual-polarization systems and the calibration methods for getting rid of distributed targets. In this paper, we contribute to proposing a new and convenient method for estimating the polarimetric channel imbalance phase at the transmitter and receiver, which can be used for both quad-pol and dual-pol SAR systems. We found a brand-new reference object in the urban area scene, namely the effective dihedrals. A statistical calculation method was proposed correspondingly, which obtained an effective estimation of the channel imbalance phases. The theoretical explanation of the proposed method was consistent with the statistical phenomena presented in the experiments. The technique was illustrated and verified through C-band SAR images, including GaoFen-3 (GF-3) data and Sentinel-1 data. The technique was also validated and successfully applied in airborne SAR data of P, L, S, C, and X bands. The estimation error could be within 7 degrees when crosstalk items were less than -30 dB. The method realizes a fast and low-cost dual-polarization phase imbalance estimation and provides a new technical approach to supplement the traditional tropical-rainforest-based quad-pol system calibration. The method can be conveniently applied to the monitoring of polarization distortion parameters, ensuring good polarization SAR data quality.

TI  - Countrywide Mapping of Plant Ecological Communities with 101 Legends including Land Cover Types for the First Time at 10 m Resolution through Convolutional Learning of Satellite Images
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents next-generation mapping of plant ecological communities including land cover and agricultural types at 10 m spatial resolution countrywide. This research introduces modelling and mapping of land cover and ecological communities separately in small regions-of-interest (prefecture level), and later integrating the outputs into a large scale (country level) for dealing with regional distribution characteristics of plant ecological communities effectively. The Sentinel-2 satellite images were processed for cloud masking and half-monthly median composite images consisting of ten multi-spectral bands and seven spectral indexes were generated. The reliable ground truth data were prepared from extant multi-source survey databases through the procedure of stratified sampling, cross-checking, and noisy-labels pruning. Deep convolutional learning of the time-series of the satellite data was employed for prefecture-wise classification and mapping of 29-62 classes. The classification accuracy computed with the 10-fold cross-validation method varied from 71.1-87.5% in terms of F1-score and 70.9-87.4% in terms of Kappa coefficient across 48 prefectural regions. This research produced seamless maps of 101 ecological communities including land cover and agricultural types for the first time at a country scale with an average accuracy of 80.5% F1-score.

TI  - An Ultra-Resolution Features Extraction Suite for Community-Level Vegetation Differentiation and Mapping at a Sub-Meter Resolution
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents two categories of features extraction and mapping suite, a very high-resolution suite and an ultra-resolution suite at 2 m and 0.5 m resolutions, respectively, for the differentiation and mapping of land cover and community-level vegetation types. The features extraction flow of the ultra-resolution suite involves pan-sharpening of the multispectral image, color-transformation of the pan-sharpened image, and the generation of panchromatic textural features. The performance of the ultra-resolution features extraction suite was compared with the very high-resolution features extraction suite that involves the calculation of radiometric indices and color-transformation of the multi-spectral image. This research was implemented in three mountainous ecosystems located in a cool temperate region. Three machine learning classifiers, Random Forests, XGBoost, and SoftVoting, were employed with a 10-fold cross-validation method for quantitatively evaluating the performance of the two suites. The ultra-resolution suite provided 5.3% more accuracy than the very high-resolution suite using single-date autumn images. Addition of summer images gained 12.8% accuracy for the ultra-resolution suite and 13.2% accuracy for the very high-resolution suite across all sites, while the ultra-resolution suite showed 4.9% more accuracy than the very high-resolution suite. The features extraction and mapping suites presented in this research are expected to meet the growing need for differentiating land cover and community-level vegetation types at a large scale.

TI  - Asymmetric Impacts of Diurnal Warming on Vegetation Carbon Sequestration of Marshes in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau
T2  - GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES
M3  - Article
AB  - As the world's Third Pole, the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau has a large area of marshes, which plays an important role in global carbon cycle. The net primary productivity (NPP) of vegetation is a crucial index for measuring the carbon flux of marsh ecosystems. Understanding the change in marsh NPP and its response to climatic change is important for assessing carbon sequestration of marsh ecosystems. Based on MODIS NPP data and climate data from 2000 to 2020, this study analyzed the spatiotemporal change in marsh NPP and determined its relationship with climate factors on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The results showed that the average annual NPP of marshes on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau increased significantly by 11.70 +/- 1.07 g C center dot m(-2)/10a during 2000-2020, with an average value of about 184.37 +/- 11.12 g C center dot m(-2). Spatially, the annual marsh NPP showed obviously increasing trend in the northeast but decreasing trend in the southwest regions. Daytime maximum and nighttime minimum temperatures had asymmetric effects on marsh NPP, with a larger positive effect of minimum temperature. Warmed minimum temperatures in winter and spring significantly increased the annual marsh NPP on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The increasing maximum and minimum temperatures in the summer obviously promoted the vegetation growth in marshes. Additionally, the increasing spring precipitation could significantly increase the marsh NPP. Our results highlight that the asymmetric impacts of daytime and nighttime temperatures on marsh vegetation should be adequately considered in predicting marsh carbon sequestration on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, especially in the context of global asymmetric diurnal warming.

TI  - Characteristics and changes of the Himalayas glacial area in China during 1990-2015
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, the continuously changed glaciers in the Himalayas not only affected process of atmospheric flow and water cycle in the plateau but also increased the frequency of secondary disasters, such as ice collapse and outburst floods. Therefore, the monitoring of Himalayas glacial change is of great significance in the aspects of climate change and disaster prevention and reduction. The Himalayas glacier outlines in China were extracted by ratio threshold and visual interpretation based on the Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI data and glacier catalogue data. Based on the ASTER GDEM data, the distribution and change characteristics at different altitudes were studied, and the surface moraine was identified to study the influence of glacial area variations. In addition, Glaciers were divided into marine and continental glaciers in this study, and the distribution and changes of the two types of glaciers were analyzed. Also, a comprehensive analysis of a long time series was performed. The results showed that: (1) From 1990 to 2015, the glaciers in the study area showed an overall trend of melting; the annual melting speed gradually accelerated from 0.48%/a to 0.75%/a. The total melting glacial area was 828.16 km(2), and the melting rate of the glaciers in the western section was the highest, at 0.63%. (2) The total area of continental glaciers was larger than that of marine glaciers, and its reduction was relatively larger, too. (3) The average size of debris-covered glaciers was 10 times that of debris-free glaciers, but their rate of change (8.1%) was 1/2 of that of debris-free glaciers (17.8%). (4) The number of glaciers gradually decreased as the size of glaciers increased. The glaciers with grades of >50 km(2), 0.5 similar to 1 km(2), and 1 similar to 2 km(2) had large change rates, which were 20.1%, 19.1%, and 18.5%, respectively. In summary, the Himalayas glaciers in China were melting at an accelerated rate and their numbers were gradually decreasing from 1990 to 2015. The location, type, elevation, size and debris cover of a glacier are all important factors influencing glacier change. It has been found that the lower the elevation or the smaller the size of the glacier, the greater the likelihood of glacier ablation, and the debris can inhibit the melting of glaciers to a certain extent.

TI  - Exploring Methods for Developing Local Climate Zones to Support Climate Research
T2  - CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Meteorological and climate prediction models at the urban scale increasingly require more accurate and high-resolution data. The Local Climate Zone (LCZ) system is an initiative to standardize a classification scheme of the urban landscape, based mainly on the properties of surface structure (e.g., building, tree height, density) and surface cover (pervious vs. impervious). This approach is especially useful for studying the influence of urban morphology and fabric on the surface urban heat island (SUHI) effect and to evaluate how changes in land use and structures affect thermal regulation in the city. This article will demonstrate three different methodologies of creating LCZs: first, the World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools (WUDAPT); second, using Copernicus Urban Atlas (UA) data via a geographic information system (GIS) client directly; and third via Google Earth Engine (GEE) using Oslo, Norway as the case study. The WUDAPT and GEE methods incorporate a machine learning (random forest) procedure using Landsat 8 imagery, and offer the most precision while requiring the most time and familiarity with GIS usage and satellite imagery processing. The WUDAPT method is performed principally using multiple GIS clients and image processing tools. The GEE method is somewhat quicker to perform, with work performed entirely on Google's sites. The UA or GIS method is performed solely via a GIS client and is a conversion of pre-existing vector data to LCZ classes via scripting. This is the quickest method of the three; however, the reclassification of the vector data determines the accuracy of the LCZs produced. Finally, as an illustration of a practical use of LCZs and to further compare the results of the three methods, we map the distribution of the temperature according to the LCZs of each method, correlating to the land surface temperature (LST) from a Landsat 8 image pertaining to a heat wave episode that occurred in Oslo in 2018. These results show, in addition to a clear LCZ-LST correspondence, that the three methods produce accurate and similar results and are all viable options.

TI  - Green-up selection by red deer in heterogeneous, human-dominated landscapes of Central Europe
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The forage maturation hypothesis (FMH) assumes that herbivores cope with the trade-off between digestibility and biomass in forage by selecting vegetation at intermediate growth. The green wave hypothesis (GWH) extends the FMH to suggest how spatiotemporal heterogeneity in plant quality shapes migratory movements of herbivores. Growing empirical support for these hypotheses mainly comes from studies in vast landscapes with large-scale habitat heterogeneity. It is unclear, however, to what extent ungulates surf green waves in human-altered landscapes with small-scale heterogeneity in terms of land use and topography. We used plant phenological proxies derived from Sentinel 2 satellite data to analyze the habitat selection of 93 collared red deer (Cervus elaphus) in montane and alpine habitats. Using a step selection analysis, we investigated how plant phenology, that is, the instantaneous rate of green-up (IRG) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and a set of variables describing topography and human presence influenced red deer resource selection in open habitats. We learned that red deer selected areas with high biomass at green-up and avoided habitats with possible exposure to human activity. Additionally, landscape structure and topography strongly influenced spatial behavior of red deer. We further compared cumulative access to high-quality forage across migrant strategies and found migrants gained better access than residents. Many migratory individuals surfed the green wave, and their surfing behavior, however, became less pronounced with decreasing distance to settlements. Within the constraints of topography and human land use, red deer track spring green-up on a fine spatiotemporal scale and follow the green wave across landscapes in migration movements. Thus, they benefit from high-quality forage even in human-dominated landscapes with small-scale heterogeneity and vegetation emerging in a heterogenic, dynamic mosaic.

TI  - Fusing Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 Satellite Images Using a Model-Based Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Copernicus Sentinel-2 (S2) constellation comprises of two satellites in a sun-synchronous orbit. The S2 sensors have three spatial resolutions: 10, 20, and 60 m. The Landsat 8 (L8) satellite has sensors that provide seasonal coverage at spatial resolutions of 15, 30, and 60 m. Many remote sensing applications require the spatial resolutions of all data to be at the highest resolution possible, i.e., 10 m for S2. To address this demand, researchers have proposed various methods that exploit the spectral and spatial correlations within multispectral data to sharpen the S2 bands to 10 m. In this study, we combined S2 and L8 data. An S2 sharpening method called Sentinel-2 Sharpening (S2Sharp) was modified to include the 30 m and 15 m spectral bands from L8 and to sharpen all bands (S2 and L8) to the highest resolution of the data, which was 10 m. The method was evaluated using both real and simulated data.

TI  - Non-Linear 3D Satellite Gravity Inversion for Depth to the Basement Estimation in a Mexican Semi-Arid Agricultural Region
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - In Mexico, agriculture in semi-arid regions is highly dependent on groundwater resources, where most of the aquifers' characterization is a pending task. In particular, the depth to the basement is unknown for most of the Mexican territory. Hence, the development and performance of new techniques for the basement relief estimation is imperative for further hydrogeological studies. In this paper, we present a depth to the basement estimation using non-linear gravimetric inversion employing satellite data. Gravity forward modeling was implemented using both gravitational attraction due to juxtapositioned blocks and gravimetric non-linear inversion using conjugate gradient least squares to minimize the objective function in terms of a depth model. All of this took place under the sparse system framework. We present a synthetic result using the SEG-Bishop depth model taken for calibration purposes. Then, we recollected gravity data from The Satellite Geodesy group from SCRIPPS for the depth to the basement estimation of an unconfined aquifer in the northern-central semi-arid region of Zacatecas, Mexico. Both synthetic and satellite data were recovered, consistent depth models for both cases were presented, and a comparison with conventional gravimetric linear inversion for density estimation was performed.

TI  - Evaluating a New Relative Phenological Correction and the Effect of Sentinel-Based Earth Engine Compositing Approaches to Map Fire Severity and Burned Area
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The remote sensing of fire severity and burned area is fundamental in the evaluation of fire impacts. The current study aimed to: (i) compare Sentinel-2 (S2) spectral indices to predict field-observed fire severity in Durango, Mexico; (ii) evaluate the effect of the compositing period (1 or 3 months), techniques (average or minimum), and phenological correction (constant offset, c, against a novel relative phenological correction, rc) on fire severity mapping, and (iii) determine fire perimeter accuracy. The Relative Burn Ratio (RBR), using S2 bands 8a and 12, provided the best correspondence with field-based fire severity (FBS). One-month rc minimum composites showed the highest correspondence with FBS (R-2 = 0.83). The decrease in R-2 using 3 months rather than 1 month was >= 0.05 (0.05-0.15) for c composites and <0.05 (0.02-0.03) for rc composites. Furthermore, using rc increased the R-2 by 0.05-0.09 and 0.10-0.15 for the 3-month RBR and dNBR compared to the corresponding c composites. Rc composites also showed increases of up to 0.16-0.22 and 0.08-0.11 in kappa values and overall accuracy, respectively, in mapping fire perimeters against c composites. These results suggest a promising potential of the novel relative phenological correction to be systematically applied with automated algorithms to improve the accuracy and robustness of fire severity and perimeter evaluations.

TI  - Imaging Assessment of Interval Metastasis from Melanoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF PERSONALIZED MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Interval metastasis is a particular metastatic category of metastatic localizations in the lymph nodes in patients with melanoma. Interval nodes are generally located at nonregional lymphatic stations placed along the pathway of the spread of melanoma, such as the epitrochlear lymph node station, the popliteal fossa, and the retroareolar station. Imaging techniques for evaluation of patients with interval metastasis from melanoma diseases include ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), lymphoscintigraphy (LS), and positron emission tomography (PET). A literature review was conducted through a methodical search on the Pubmed and Embase databases. The evaluation of lymph node metastases represents a critical phase in the staging and follow-up of melanoma patients. Therefore, a thorough knowledge of the imaging methods available and the interactions between the clinician and the radiologist are essential for making the correct choice for individual patients, for a better management, and to improve treatment and survival.

TI  - Ecosystem services in Sahelian village landscapes 1952-2016: estimating change in a data scarce region
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Burkina Faso and the wider Sahel region have experienced substantial changes in rainfall, population, and landscape use. These changes have altered ecosystem services, the benefits that people receive from ecosystems, and rural livelihoods. However, it is difficult to assess the magnitude of these changes because of missing and fragmented social, agricultural, and ecological data. We estimated changes in 10 key provisioning ecosystem services in rural Burkina Faso between 1952 and 2016. We used a simple model of plausible social-ecological changes to make a historical extrapolation that bridges these data gaps, and assessed historical changes. Our approach combined the interpretation of historic aerial photographs and satellite images, with field observations and interviews. We applied the approach for six villages in two administrative regions for six points in time. We modeled the use of historic ecosystems by analyzing a range of estimates of changes in the generation of each service and its value to people. We found that cultivated ecosystem services have increased 1.5-23 times over the study period, while the non-cultivated ecosystem services firewood, construction material, and medicine have decreased to 66-20% of their previous values. Per capita production of cultivated ecosystem services has remained relatively stable, while the per capita production of all other ecosystem services has decreased, to 54-11% of their 1952 values. Although alternatives are available for some ecosystem services, such as medicine and construction material, there are currently limited alternatives available for other services, such as firewood. Decline in wild food availability and consumption is likely to reduce the nutritional value of rural people's food. Our analysis of changes demonstrates that shrubs and trees on fields generate many ecosystem services that are key to rural livelihoods, and that efforts to enhance crop yields should maintain shrubs and trees. Our approach for estimating historical ecosystem services may also be useful to apply in other data scarce regions.

TI  - Drainage congestion due to road network on the Kosi alluvial Fan, Himalayan Foreland
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - We use surface soil moisture content as a proxy to assess the effect of drainage congestion due to structural barriers on the alluvial Fan of the Kosi River on the Himalayan Foreland. We used Sentinel-1 satellite images to evaluate the spatial distribution of soil moisture in the proximity of structural barriers (i.e., road network). We applied modified Dubois and a fully connected feed-forward artificial neural network (FC-FF-ANN) models to estimate soil moisture. We observed that the FC-FF-ANN predicts soil moisture more accurately (R = 0.85, RMSE = 0.05 m(3)/m(3), and bias = 0) as compared to the modified Dubois model. Therefore, we have used the soil moisture from the FC-FF-ANN model for further analysis. We identified the road network that traverses on the Kosi Fan horizontally, vertically, and with inclination. We create a buffer of 1 km along either side of the road. Within this, we assessed the spatial distribution of soil moisture. We observed a high concentration of soil moisture near the structural barrier, and decreases gradually as we move farther in either direction across the orientation of the road. The impact of structural barriers on the spatial distribution of soil moisture is prominent in a range between 300 to 750 m within the road buffer. This study is a step towards assessing the effect of structural interventions on drainage congestion and flood inundation.

TI  - Use of methylene blue dye for sentinel lymph node mapping in early-stage gynecological cancers - An option for low resource settings
T2  - JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH AND THERAPEUTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Context: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping is a standard of care in gynecological cancers but with limited resources and equipment, intraoperative use of methylene blue for SLN mapping may be more useful. Aims: To authenticate the use of methylene blue dye for intraoperative SLN mapping in cases of early-stage gynecological cancers. Settings and Design: This pilot study was conducted in a tertiary care teaching hospital. Subjects and Methods: The cases included 14 cervical, 4 endometrial, 1 vulvar, and 1 synchronous cervical-vulvar cancer wherein 21 SLN mappings were done. Four ml of methylene blue was injected submucosally in the cervix in cervical and endometrial cancer. It was injected around the tumor in vulvar cancer. The pelvic lymphatic drainage area was examined in cervical and endometrial cancer while inguinofemoral area was examined in vulvar cancer for any blue LNs. Histopathological examination results were compared for the presence of metastasis in stained and unstained LNs. Statistical Analysis Used: The observations were presented as numbers and percentages. Results: The SLN mappings showed a detection rate of 76%. The mean number of LNs removed in each case was 10.3 with an average of 2.4 stained and 7.6 unstained LNs. SLN was most commonly found among right external iliac nodes. All stained and unstained nodes among the 16 SLN detections did not show any histological evidence of metastasis suggesting a negative predictive value of 100%. Conclusions: Methylene blue is an efficient, feasible, and safe dye for SLN mapping in early-stage gynecological cancer.

TI  - Lithium Potential of the Indian Granitic Pegmatites
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a progressively increasing demand for lithium (Li) due to its growing applications in the Li-ion batteries for electric vehicles. Accordingly, to take stock of the situation with respect to lithium potentiality of the Indian granitic pegmatites, a critical synthesis is presented here. India's exploration programme for lithium was not sustained due to fluctuating domestic demand and its availability in the world market. Data reveals that the Indian Li-pegmatites belong to the Lithium-Caesium-Tantalum (LCT) family, and occur manly in parts of Bihar-Jharkhand, Bastar-Odisha and Karnataka, with some in Rajasthan, Maharashtra, West Bengal and Assam. Major mineral phases of Li are lepidolite, amblygonite and spodumene, the last one being dominant in Karnataka. Bulk of the Li-pegmatites have been derived from the peraluminous, geochemically-evolved S-type granites. During fractionation, wherever saturation was attained, precipitation of independent minerals of Li took place. Lithium minerals are largely restricted to the replacement zones of pegmatites, and, at places, in the greisenised pockets within the pegmatites and parent granite margins. Pegmatites from Karnataka appear to have more potential relative to those from Bihar-Jharkhand and Rajasthan. Systematic exploration of Li-pegmatites may prove rewarding in establishing their Li-potential. Li-pegmatite fields may be mapped by applications of remote sensing, using various methods and sensors through spectral angle mapper (SAM) classification on 'HyMap' data. SAM classification may be used to assess the efficacy of advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer (ASTER), and Landsat-8 operational land imager (OLI) data, including new combinations of red, green and blue (RGB). By combined use of ASTER imagery and spectro-radiometric analysis, mapping of pegmatite veins may be carried out. As the LCT-type pegmatites are sourced mostly from previously un-melted, mica-enriched metamorphic rocks, muscovite and biotite groups of mica host bulk of the trace elements and thus fingerprint for the LCT-type pegmatites. Also, P- and Cs-enriched Li-pegmatites lend further support to the S-type sources for the LCT-type pegmatites. Accordingly, all the LCT-type pegmatites in India should form the first order target for Li-exploration. Characteristic replacement mineral assemblages like cleavelandite, topaz, greisen, schorl and lithian muscovite may also serve as guides for lithium exploration.

TI  - Extending the National Burned Area Composite Time Series of Wildfires in Canada
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires are a major natural disturbance in Canada that are postulated to increase under a warming climate. To derive accurate trends in burned area and to quantify the effects of fire frequency, duration, and extent, a sufficiently long time series of reliable burned area maps is required. With that in mind, we extended Canada's National Burned Area Composite (NBAC) dataset from its previous start year (2004) back to 1986. NBAC consists of annual maps in polygon format where the area burned in each fire event is represented by the best available delineation among various mapping methods and data sources of varying quality. Ordered from more to less reliability, in the new 35-year time series (1986 to 2020), 10% of the total burned area was derived from airborne and high-resolution (<5 m) satellite imagery, 81% from change detection methods using 30 m Landsat satellite imagery, and the remaining 9% was largely from aerial surveys. Total (Canada-wide) annual burned area estimates ranged from 215,797 ha in 2020 to 6.7 million ha (Mha) in 1989. We computed 95% confidence intervals for the estimate of each year from 1986 to 2020 based on the accuracy and relative contribution in that year of the different data sources, for both the new NBAC time series and the polygon version of the Canadian National Fire Database (CNFDB), a commonly used source of spatially explicit data on burned area in Canada. NBAC confidence intervals were on average +/- 9.7% of the annual figure, about one-third the width of the confidence intervals derived for CNFDB. The NBAC time series also included nearly 5000 fire events (totalling 4 Mha, with the largest event being 120,661 ha in size) that are missing in the CNFDB. In a regional analysis for the Northwest Territories, retroactive fire mapping from Landsat imagery reduced historical estimates by 3 Mha (16%), which would result in a 1.6 Mha increase in the reported undisturbed critical habitat for threatened woodland caribou. The NBAC dataset is freely downloadable from the Canadian Wildland Fire Information System.

T2  - INVESTIGACIONES GEOGRAFICAS-SPAIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The study of water level fluctuations in wetlands in response to rainfall variability represents a starting point for their conservation and/or use as a sustainable resource. In this respect, by using Google Earth Engine, this contribution constitutes a case study of the spatio-temporal variation of the surface area of the subtropical wetlands in northeastern Argentina from 1990 to 2020 in five-year periods. For this purpose, we processed 931 Landsat scenes, generating cloud masks, and quality composites based on water indices, and extracted water covers using thresholding techniques. For climate analysis, we correlated direct pluviometric data, precipitation indices and the effects of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation. The results obtained accurately indicate a large difference between wet and dry times, with maximums exceeding 60% of the area covered with water and minimums of less than 5%. The findings also show that there is a direct relationship between rainfall amounts and surface water expanses and the system's elasticity. The results are considered to be highly valuable for integrated water resources and risk management.

TI  - A CHEOPS Search for Massive, Long-period Companions to the Warm Jupiter K2-139 b
T2  - ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - K2-139 b is a warm Jupiter with an orbital period of 28.4 days, but only three transits of this system have previously been observed-in the long-cadence mode of K2-limiting the precision with which the orbital period can be determined and future transits predicted. We report photometric observations of four transits of K2-139 b with ESA's CHaracterising ExOPlanet Satellite (CHEOPS), conducted with the goal of measuring the orbital obliquity via spot-crossing events. We jointly fit these CHEOPS data alongside the three previously-published transits from the K2 mission, considerably increasing the precision of the ephemeris of K2-139 b. The transit times for this system can now be predicted for the next decade with a 1 sigma precision less than 10 minutes, compared to over one hour previously, allowing the efficient scheduling of observations with Ariel. We detect no significant deviation from a linear ephemeris, allowing us to exclude the presence of a massive outer planet orbiting with a period less than 150 days, or a brown dwarf with a period less than one year. We also determine the scaled semimajor axis, the impact parameter, and the stellar limb darkening with improved precision. This is driven by the shorter cadence of the CHEOPS observations compared to that of K2, and validates the subexposure technique used for analyzing long-cadence photometry. Finally, we note that the stellar spot configuration has changed from the epoch of the K2 observations; unlike the K2 transits, we detect no evidence of spot-crossing events in the CHEOPS data.

TI  - Spatial variability and uncertainty of soil nitrogen across the conterminous United States at different depths
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil nitrogen (N) is an important driver of plant productivity and ecosystem functioning; consequently, it is critical to understand its spatial variability from local-to-global scales. Here, we provide a quantitative assessment of the three-dimensional spatial distribution of soil N across the United States (CONUS) using a digital soil mapping approach. We used a random forest-regression kriging algorithm to predict soil N concentrations and associated uncertainty across six soil depths (0-5, 5-15, 15-30, 30-60, 60-100, and 100-200 cm) at 5-km spatial grids. Across CONUS, there is a strong spatial dependence of soil N, where soil N concentrations decrease but uncertainty increases with soil depth. Soil N was higher in Pacific Northwest, Northeast, and Great Lakes National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) ecoclimatic domains. Model uncertainty was higher in Atlantic Neotropical, Southern Rockies/Colorado Plateau, and Southeast NEON domains. We also compared our soil N predictions with satellite-derived gross primary production and forest biomass from the National Biomass and Carbon Dataset. Finally, we used uncertainty information to propose optimized locations for designing future soil surveys and found that the Atlantic Neotropical, Pacific Northwest, Pacific Southwest, and Appalachian/Cumberland Plateau NEON domains may require larger survey efforts. We highlight the need to increase knowledge of biophysical factors regulating soil processes at deeper depths to better characterize the three-dimensional space of soils. Our results provide a national benchmark regarding the spatial variability and uncertainty of soil N and reveal areas in need of a better representation.

TI  - Modelling habitat suitability for a potential flagship species, the hooded capuchin, of the Paraguayan Upper Parana Atlantic Forest
T2  - ECOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS AND EVIDENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The hooded capuchin (Sapajus cay) is an adaptable, generalist primate species found throughout eastern Paraguay with preferences for the Paraguayan Upper Parana Atlantic Forest (BAAPA). BAAPA is one of the world's most critically endangered terrestrial habitats with more than 90% of its original cover lost to industrial agriculture. Given its charismatic characteristics, the capuchin species is a candidate flagship species for this ecoregion; however, its habitat preferences in BAAPA degraded fragments are unknown. We develop a species distribution model using MAXENT to determine the remotely sensed microhabitat features associated with habitat suitability in forests that had experienced different levels of degradation. The model was fitted to presence-only observations at two sites, Rancho Laguna Blanca and Nueva Gambach, to determine how hooded capuchin distribution is associated with remotely sensed habitat features in BAAPA fragments. Wetness (mean and standard deviation), a measure of soil moisture and canopy closure, was found to be the most important driver at both sites. The capuchins showed a preference for more mature forest, bamboo dominated forest and flooded forest (that has experienced little selective logging in the past). The capuchin was a forest obligate species and avoided crop fields. The monkeys were less likely to be found in degraded areas, even though they were still forested. As Paraguayan deforestation involves the creation of large crop fields separating BAAPA fragments, the probability that the hooded capuchin can move between those fragments is low. The hooded capuchin is a candidate flagship species for an agroforestry reforestation programme to reconnect BAAPA fragments. We propose that combining native tree corridors with shade grown yerba mate and slash pine plantations would create habitat for the capuchin and other wildlife while helping to alleviate poverty in the area and the pressure that this causes on the forests' natural resources.

TI  - Beyond the lockdowns: satellite observations of aerosol optical depth through 2020, the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Anticipated future reductions in aerosol emissions are expected to accelerate warming and substantially change precipitation characteristics. Therefore, it is vital to identify the existing patterns and possible future pathways of anthropogenic aerosol reductions. The COVID-19 pandemic prompted abrupt, global declines in transportation and industrial activities, providing opportunities to study the aerosol effects of pandemic-driven emissions changes. Here, measurements of aerosol optical depth (AOD) from two satellite instruments were used to characterize aerosol burdens throughout 2020 in four Northern Hemisphere source regions (Eastern & Central China, the United States, India, and Europe). In most regions, record-low measures of AOD persisted beyond the earliest clockdown' periods of the pandemic. Record-low values were most concentrated during the boreal spring and summer months, when 56% to 72% of sampled months showed record-low AOD values for their respective regions. However, in India and Eastern & Central China, the COVID-19 AOD signature was eclipsed by sources of natural variability (dust) and a multi-year trend, respectively. In the United States and Europe, a likely COVID-19 signal peaks in the summer of 2020, contributing as much as -.01 to -.03 AOD units to observed anomalies.

M3  - Article
AB  - Background Disease surveillance using adequate case definitions is very important. The objective of the study was to compare the performance of influenza case definitions and influenza symptoms in the first two epidemic weeks with respect to other epidemic weeks.Methods We analysed cases of acute respiratory infection detected by the network of sentinel primary care physicians of Catalonia for 10 seasons. We calculated the diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the first two epidemic weeks and for other epidemic weeks.Results A total of 4,338 samples were collected in the epidemic weeks, of which 2,446 (56.4%) were positive for influenza. The most predictive case definition for laboratory-confirmed influenza was the WHO case definition for influenza-like illness (ILI) in the first two epidemic weeks (DOR 2.10; 95% CI 1.57-2.81) and in other epidemic weeks (DOR 2.31; 95% CI 1.96-2.72). The most predictive symptom was fever. After knowing that epidemic threshold had been reached, the DOR of the ILI WHO case definition in children aged <5 years and cough and fever in this group increased (190%, 170% and 213%, respectively).Conclusions During influenza epidemics, differences in the performance of the case definition and the discriminative ability of symptoms were found according to whether it was known that the epidemic threshold had been reached or not. This suggests that sentinel physicians are stricter in selecting samples to send to the laboratory from patients who present symptoms more specific to influenza after rather than before an influenza epidemic has been declared.

TI  - Hybrid representation based on dictionaries for hyperspectral image classification
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In real-world applications, the hyperspectral image (HSI) classification faces two critical problems: one is the Hughes phenomenon and the other is the large spatial and spectral variabilities among the pixels of the HSI, especially for the case where only few labeled pixels per class are available. To address these problems, we propose a united framework for the hybrid representation model based on two dictionaries in this paper, where the input pixel (or its feature) is explicitly decomposed into the class-specific component and the variation component via the Bayesian approach. Based on the proposed framework, two hybrid representation-based classification approaches, named as the sparse and dense hybrid representation-based classification and the hybrid sparse representation-based classification, are proposed based on different priors on the separate components over the associated dictionaries. Moreover, the techniques for designing the associated dictionaries and estimating the hyperparameters are also present so the practicality of the proposed approaches is further improved. Experimental results show that the proposed two approaches outperform the conventional classifiers and are robust to the spatial and spectral variabilities, based on four real hyperspectral datasets.

TI  - Distinguishing the Impacts of Human Activities and Climate Change on the Livelihood Environment of Pastoralists in the Qinghai Lake Basin
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Grassland vegetation is the largest terrestrial ecosystem in the Qinghai Lake Basin (QLB), and it is also the most important means of production for herders' livelihoods. Quantifying the impact of climate change and human activities on grassland vegetation changes is an essential task for ensuring the sustainable livelihood of pastoralists. To this end, we investigated vegetation cover changes in the QLB from 2000 to 2020 using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), meteorological raster data, and digital elevation and used residual analysis of multiple linear regression to evaluate the residuals of human activities. The residual analysis of partial derivatives was used to quantify the contribution of climate change and human activities to changes in vegetation cover. The results showed that: (1) The vegetation coverage of the QLB increased significantly (0.002/a, p < 0.01), with 91.38% of the area showing a greening trend, and 8.62% of the area suffering a degrading trend. The NDVI decreased substantially along the altitude gradient (-0.02/a, p < 0.01), with the highest vegetation coverage at 3600-3700 m (0.37/a). The vegetation degraded from 3200-3300 m, vegetation greening accelerated from 3300-3500 m, and vegetation greening slowed above 3500 m. (2) The contribution of climate change, temperature (T), and precipitation (P) to vegetation cover change were 1.62/a, 0.005/a, and 1.615/a, respectively. Below 3500 m, the vegetation greening was more limited by P. Above 3500 m, the vegetation greening was mainly limited by T. (3) Residual analysis showed that the contribution of human activities to vegetation cover was -1.618/a. Regarding the altitude gradient, at 3300-3500 m, human activities had the highest negative contribution to vegetation coverage (-2.389/a), and at 3200-3300 m, they had the highest positive contribution (0.389/a). In the past 21 years, the impact of human activities on vegetation coverage changed from negative to positive. Before 2009, the annual average NDVIres value was negative; after 2010, the average yearly NDVIres value turned positive. In general, the vegetation greening of the QLB depends on climate warming and humidification. The positive impact of human activities over the past decade was also essential for vegetation greening. These findings deepen our understanding of the QLB vegetation changes under climate change and human activities.

TI  - Mapping Arable Land and Permanent Agriculture Extent and Change in Southern Greece Using the European Union LUCAS Survey and a 35-Year Landsat Time Series Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural land extent and change information is needed to assess food security, the effectiveness of land use policy, and both environmental and societal impacts. This information is especially valuable in biodiversity hotspots such as the Mediterranean region, where agricultural land expansion can result in detrimental effects such as soil erosion and the loss of native species. There has also been a growing concern that changing agricultural extent in fire-prone regions of the Mediterranean may increase fire risk due to accumulation of fuel in abandoned areas. In this study, we assessed the extent and change of agricultural land in Southern Greece from 1986 to 2020 using a combined European Land Use/Cover Area frame Survey (LUCAS) and Landsat time series approach. The LUCAS data and Landsat spectral-temporal metrics were used to train a random forest classifier, which was used to classify arable land and permanent agriculture (e.g., olive orchards, vineyards) at annual time steps. A post-processing step was taken to reduce spurious landcover class transitions using transition likelihoods and annual class membership likelihoods. A validation dataset consisting of 2666 samples, identified via a stratified random sampling approach and high-resolution imagery and time series analysis, were used to evaluate stable and change strata accuracies. Overall accuracies were greater than 70% and strata-specific accuracies were highly variable between stable and change strata. The results show that southern Greece has experienced a recent gain in arable land (similar to 12,000 ha from -2009-2020) and a much larger gain in permanent agriculture (>115,000 ha from similar to 1993-2020). Arable land loss mainly occurred from 1987 to similar to 2002 when extent decreased by 15,000 ha, of which 66% was abandoned. The semi-automated approach described in this paper provides a promising approach for monitoring agricultural land change and enabling assessments of agriculture policy effectiveness and environmental impacts.

TI  - Impact of COVID-19 Lockdown on Vegetation Indices and Heat Island Effect: A Remote Sensing Study of Dhaka City, Bangladesh
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - It is predicted that the COVID-19 lockdown decreased environmental pollutants and, hence, urban heat island. Using the hypothesis as a guide, the objective of this research is to observe the change in vegetation pattern and heat-island effect zones in Dhaka, Bangladesh, before and after COVID-19 lockdown in relation to different forms of land use and land cover. Landsat-8 images were gathered to determine the vegetation pattern and the heat island zones. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the modified soil-adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI12) were derived for analyzing the vegetation pattern. According to the results of the NDVI, after one month of lockdown, the health of the vegetation improved. In the context of the MSAVI12, the highest MSAVI12 coverages in March of 2019, 2020, and 2021 (0.45 to 0.70) were 22.15%, 21.8%, and 20.4%, respectively. In May 2019, 2020, and 2021, dense MSAVI12 values accounted for 23.8%, 25.5%, and 18.4%, respectively. At the beginning of lockdown, the calculated LST for March 2020 was higher than March 2019 and March 2021. However, after more than a month of lockdown, the LST reduced (in May 2020). After the lockdown in May 2020, the highest UHI values ranging from 3.80 to 5.00 covered smaller land-cover regions and reduced from 22.5% to 19.13%. After the end of the lockdown period, however, industries, markets, and transportation resumed, resulting in the expansion of heat island zones. In conclusion, strong negative correlations were observed between the LST and vegetation indices. The methodology of this research has potential for scholarly and practical implications. Secondly, urban policymakers can use the methodology of this paper for the low-cost monitoring of urban heat island zones, and thus take appropriate spatial counter measures.

TI  - Can Remote Sensing Fill the United States' Monitoring Gap for Watershed Management?
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing has been heralded as the silver bullet in water quality modeling and watershed management, and yet a quantitative mapping of where its applicability is likely and most useful has not been undertaken so far. Here, we combine geospatial models of cloud cover as a proxy for the likelihood of acquiring remote scenes and the shortest time of travel to population centers as a proxy for accessibility to ground-truth remote sensing data for water quality monitoring and produce maps of the potential of remote sensing in watershed management in the United States. We generate several maps with different cost-payoff relationships to help stakeholders plan and incentivize remote sensing-based monitoring campaigns. Additionally, we combine these remote sensing potential maps with spatial indices of population, water demand, ecosystem services, pollution risk, and monitoring coverage deficits to identify where remote sensing likely has the greatest role to play. We find that the Southwestern United States and the Central plains regions are generally suitable for remote sensing for watershed management even under the most stringent costing projections, but that the potential for using remote sensing can extend further North and East as constraints are relaxed. We also find large areas in the Southern United States and sporadic watersheds in the Northeast and Northwest seaboards and the Midwest would likely benefit most from using remote sensing for watershed monitoring. Although developed herein for watershed decision support in the United States, our approach is readily generalizable to other environmental domains and across the world.

TI  - Environmental Epigenetics in Soil Ecosystems: Earthworms as Model Organisms
T2  - TOXICS
M3  - Review
AB  - One of the major emerging concerns within ecotoxicology is the effect of environmental pollutants on epigenetic changes, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs. Epigenetic mechanisms regulate gene expression, meaning that the alterations of epigenetic marks can induce long-term physiological effects that can even be inherited across generations. Many invertebrate species have been used as models in environmental epigenetics, with a special focus on DNA methylation changes caused by environmental perturbations (e.g., pollution). Among soil organisms, earthworms are considered the most relevant sentinel organisms for anthropogenic stress assessment and are widely used as standard models in ecotoxicological testing of soil toxicity. In the last decade, several research groups have focused on assessing the impact of environmental stress on earthworm epigenetic mechanisms and tried to link these mechanisms to the physiological effects. The aim of this review is to give an overview and to critically examine the available literature covering this topic. The high level of earthworm genome methylation for an invertebrate species, responsiveness of epigenome to environmental stimuli, availability of molecular resources, and the possibility to study epigenetic inheritance make earthworms adequate models in environmental epigenomics. However, there are still many knowledge gaps that need to be filled in, before we can fully explore earthworms as models in this field. These include detailed characterization of the methylome using next-generation sequencing tools, exploration of multigenerational and transgenerational effects of pollutants, and information about other epigenetic mechanisms apart from DNA methylation. Moreover, the connection between epigenetic effects and phenotype has to be further explored.

TI  - Geotechnical Measurements for the Investigation and Assessment of Arctic Coastal Erosion-A Review and Outlook
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Review
AB  - Geotechnical data are increasingly utilized to aid investigations of coastal erosion and the development of coastal morphological models; however, measurement techniques are still challenged by environmental conditions and accessibility in coastal areas, and particularly, by nearshore conditions. These challenges are exacerbated for Arctic coastal environments. This article reviews existing and emerging data collection methods in the context of geotechnical investigations of Arctic coastal erosion and nearshore change. Specifically, the use of cone penetration testing (CPT), which can provide key data for the mapping of soil and ice layers as well as for the assessment of slope and block failures, and the use of free-fall penetrometers (FFPs) for rapid mapping of seabed surface conditions, are discussed. Because of limitations in the spatial coverage and number of available in situ point measurements by penetrometers, data fusion with geophysical and remotely sensed data is considered. Offshore and nearshore, the combination of acoustic surveying with geotechnical testing can optimize large-scale seabed characterization, while onshore most recent developments in satellite-based and unmanned-aerial-vehicle-based data collection offer new opportunities to enhance spatial coverage and collect information on bathymetry and topography, amongst others. Emphasis is given to easily deployable and rugged techniques and strategies that can offer near-term opportunities to fill current gaps in data availability. This review suggests that data fusion of geotechnical in situ testing, using CPT to provide soil information at deeper depths and even in the presence of ice and using FFPs to offer rapid and large-coverage geotechnical testing of surface sediments (i.e., in the upper tens of centimeters to meters of sediment depth), combined with acoustic seabed surveying and emerging remote sensing tools, has the potential to provide essential data to improve the prediction of Arctic coastal erosion, particularly where climate-driven changes in soil conditions may bias the use of historic observations of erosion for future prediction.

TI  - Evaluation of Snow and Streamflows Using Noah-MP and WRF-Hydro Models in Aroostook River Basin, Maine
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow influences land-atmosphere interactions in snow-dominated areas, and snow melt contributes to basin streamflows. However, estimating snowpack properties such as the snow depth (SD) and snow water equivalent (SWE) from land surface model simulations remains a challenge. This is, in part, due to uncertainties in the atmospheric forcing variables, which propagate into hydrological model predictions. This study implements the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF)-Hydro framework with the Noah-Multiparameterization (Noah-MP) land surface model in the NOAA's National Water Model (NWM) version 2.0 configuration to estimate snow in a single column and subsequently the streamflow across the Aroostook River's sub-basins in Maine for water years (WY) 2014-2016. This study evaluates how differences between two atmospheric forcing datasets, the North American Land Data Assimilation version 2 (NLDAS-2) and in situ (Station), translate into differences in the simulation of snow. NLDAS-2 was used as the meteorological forcing in the retrospective NWM 2.0 simulations. The results from the single-column study showed that differences in the simulated SWE and SD were linked to differences in the 2 m air temperature (T2m), which influenced the precipitation partitioning of rain and snow, as parameterized in Noah-MP. The negative mean bias of -0.7 K (during the accumulation period) in T2m for NLDAS-2, compared to the Station forcing, was a major factor that contributed to the positive mean bias of +52 mm on average in the peak SWE in the NLDAS-2-forced Noah-MP simulation during the study period. The higher T2m values at the Station led to higher sensible heat fluxes towards the snowpack, which led to a higher amount of net energy at the snow's surface and melt events during the accumulation season in Station-forced Noah-MP simulations. The results from the retrospective NWM version 2.0 ' s simulation in the basin showed that the streamflow estimates were closer to the United States Geological Survey gage observations at the two larger sub-basins (NSE = 0.9), which were mostly forested, compared to the two smaller sub-basins (NSE >= 0.4), which had more agricultural land-use. This study also showed that the spring snowmelt timing was captured quite well by the timing of the decline in the simulated SWE and SD, providing an early indication of melt in most sub-basins. The simulated fractional snow cover area (fSCA) however provided less information about the changes in snow or onset of snowmelt as it was mostly binary (full snow cover in winter), which differed from the more realistic fSCA values shown by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer.

TI  - Pushbroom Photogrammetric Heights Enhance State-Level Forest Attribute Mapping with Landsat and Environmental Gradients
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We demonstrate the potential for pushbroom Digital Aerial Photogrammetry (DAP) to enhance forest modeling (and mapping) over large areas, especially when combined with multitemporal Landsat derivatives. As part of the National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP), high resolution (30-60 cm) photogrammetric forest structure measurements can be acquired at low cost (as low as $0.23/km(2) when acquired for entire states), repeatedly (2-3 years), over the entire conterminous USA. Our three objectives for this study are to: (1) characterize agreement between DAP measurements with Landsat and biophysical variables, (2) quantify the separate and combined explanatory power of the three auxiliary data sources for 19 separate forest attributes (e.g., age, biomass, trees per hectare, and down dead woody from 2015 USFS Forest Inventory and Analysis plot measurements in Washington state, USA) and (3) assess local biases in mapped predictions. DAP showed the greatest explanatory power for the widest range of forest attributes, but performance was appreciably improved with the addition of Landsat predictors. Biophysical variables contribute little explanatory power to our models with DAP or Landsat variables present. There is need for further investigation, however, as we observed spatial correlation in the coarse single-year grid (approximate to 1 plot/25,000 ha), which suggests local biases at typical scales of mapped inferences (e.g., county, watershed or stand). DAP, in combination with Landsat, provides an unparalleled opportunity for high-to-medium resolution forest structure measurements and mapping, which makes this auxiliary data source immediately viable to enhance large-scale forest mapping projects.

TI  - Subsurface Temperature Reconstruction for the Global Ocean from 1993 to 2020 Using Satellite Observations and Deep Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The reconstruction of the ocean's 3D thermal structure is essential to the study of ocean interior processes and global climate change. Satellite remote sensing technology can collect large-scale, high-resolution ocean observation data, but only at the surface layer. Based on empirical statistical and artificial intelligence models, deep ocean remote sensing techniques allow us to retrieve and reconstruct the 3D ocean temperature structure by combining surface remote sensing observations with in situ float observations. This study proposed a new deep learning method, Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) neural networks, which combines multisource remote sensing observations and Argo gridded data to reconstruct and produce a new long-time-series global ocean subsurface temperature (ST) dataset for the upper 2000 m from 1993 to 2020, which is named the Deep Ocean Remote Sensing (DORS) product. The data-driven ConvLSTM model can learn the spatiotemporal features of ocean observation data, significantly improves the model's robustness and generalization ability, and outperforms the LighGBM model for the data reconstruction. The validation results show our DORS dataset has high accuracy with an average R-2 and RMSE of 0.99/0.34 degrees C compared to the Argo gridded dataset, and the average R-2 and NRMSE validated by the EN4-Profile dataset over the time series are 0.94/0.05 degrees C. Furthermore, the ST structure between DORS and Argo has good consistency in the 3D spatial morphology and distribution pattern, indicating that the DORS dataset has high quality and strong reliability, and well fills the pre-Argo data gaps. We effectively track the global ocean warming in the upper 2000 m from 1993 to 2020 based on the DORS dataset, and we further examine and understand the spatial patterns, evolution trends, and vertical characteristics of global ST changes. From 1993 to 2020, the average global ocean temperature warming trend is 0.063 degrees C/decade for the upper 2000 m. The 3D temperature trends revealed significant spatial heterogeneity across different ocean basins. Since 2005, the warming signal has become more significant in the subsurface and deeper ocean. From a remote sensing standpoint, the DORS product can provide new and robust data support for ocean interior process and climate change studies.

TI  - Analyzing the coastline changes and its influencing factors in the Greater Bay Area from 1980 to 2020
T2  - Journal of Tropical Oceanography
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastline dynamic change is a common reflection of global change and human activities. Based on seven Landsat remote sensing images and Google Earth high-resolution images of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, Tokyo Bay and San Francisco Bay from 1980 to 2020, this paper used threshold segmentation combined with water index method and Sobel operator method to extract the coastline of each analysis period. In addition, this study also analyzed the changes of coastline in terms of length, spatial morphology, structure and utilization degree, and analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively the influencing factors with the help of geographic detectors. The results show that: (1) from 1980 to 2020, the intensity of annual average length change in the Tokyo Bay is the largest, which is 0.37%, and the coastline tends to be straight; (2) in the past 40 years, the depth of coastlines in all analyzed bay areas has remained stable, and the structures tend to be complex and the morphology tends to be dispersed. Among them, the difference of fractal dimension of coastlines in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area is the smallest and the morphology is the most dispersed; ( 3) during the past 40 years, the natural coastline of each bay area decreased, while the length of port wharf coastline and other artificial coastline increased significantly, and the biological coastline of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area fluctuated, and the coastline utilization index increased the most. The results show that temperature, wave height, tide, area and port throughput are the main factors that affect the coastline change, the interaction of any two factors is greater than the single factor.

TI  - An Impervious Surface Spectral Index on Multispectral Imagery Using Visible and Near-Infrared Bands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate mapping of urban impervious surfaces from remote sensing images is crucial for understanding urban land-cover change and addressing impervious-surface-change-related environment issues. To date, the authors of most studies have built indices to map impervious surfaces based on shortwave infrared (SWIR) or thermal infrared (TIR) bands from middle-low-spatial-resolution remote sensing images. However, this limits the use of high-spatial-resolution remote sensing data (e.g., GaoFen-2, Quickbird, and IKONOS). In addition, the separation of bare soil and impervious surfaces has not been effectively solved. In this article, on the basis of the spectra analysis of impervious surface and non-impervious surface (vegetation, water, soil and non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV)) data acquired from world-recognized spectral libraries and Sentinel-2 MSI images in different regions and seasons, a novel spectral index named the Normalized Impervious Surface Index (NISI) was proposed for extracting impervious area information by using blue, green, red and near-infrared (NIR) bands. We performed comprehensive assessments for the NISI, and the results demonstrated that the NISI provided the best studied performance in separating the soil and impervious surfaces from Sentinel-2 MSI images. Furthermore, regarding impervious surfaces mapping accuracy, the NISI had an overall accuracy (OA) of 89.28% (+/- 0.258), a producer's accuracy (PA) of 89.76% (+/- 1.754), and a user's accuracy (UA) of 90.68% (+/- 1.309), which were higher than those of machine learning algorithms, thus supporting the NISI as an effective measurement for urban impervious surfaces mapping and analysis. The results indicate the NISI has a high robustness and a good applicability.

TI  - Exploring Built-Up Indices and Machine Learning Regressions for Multi-Temporal Building Density Monitoring Based on Landsat Series
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Uncontrolled built-up area expansion and building densification could bring some detrimental problems in social and economic aspects such as social inequality, urban heat islands, and disturbance in urban environments. This study monitored multi-decadal building density (1991-2019) in the Yogyakarta urban area, Indonesia consisting of two stages, i.e., built-up area classification and building density estimation, therefore, both built-up expansion and the densification were quantified. Multi sensors of the Landsat series including Landsat 5, 7, and 8 were utilized with some prior corrections to harmonize the reflectance values. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier was used to distinguish between built-up and non built-up areas. Regression algorithms, i.e., linear regression (LR), support vector regression (SVR), and random forest regression (RFR) were explored to obtain the best model to estimate building density using the inputs of built-up indices: Urban Index (UI), Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), Index-based Built-up Index (IBI), and NIR-based built-up index based on the red (VrNIR-BI) and green band (VgNIR-BI). The best models were revealed by SVR with the inputs of UI-NDBI-IBI and LR with a single predictor of UI, for Landsat 8 (2013-2019) and Landsat 5/7 (1991-2009), respectively, using separate training samples. We found that machine learning regressions (SVM and RF) could perform best when the sample size is abundant, whereas LR could predict better for a limited sample size if a linear positive relationship was identified between the predictor(s) and building density. We conclude that expansion in the study area occurred first, followed by rapid building development in the subsequent years leading to an increase in building density.

TI  - Rice Mapping in a Subtropical Hilly Region Based on Sentinel-1 Time Series Feature Analysis and the Dual Branch BiLSTM Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurate information on rice cultivation makes important contributions to the profound reform of the global food and agricultural system, and promotes the development of global sustainable agriculture. With all-day and all-weather observing ability, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can monitor the distribution of rice in tropical and subtropical areas. To solve the problem of misclassification of rice with no marked signal during the flooding period in subtropical hilly areas, this paper proposes a new feature combination and dual branch bi-directional long short-term memory (DB-BiLSTM) model to achieve high-precision rice mapping using Sentinel-1 time series data. Based on field investigation data, the backscatter time series curves of the rice area were analyzed, and a characteristic index (VV - VH)/(VV + VH) (VV: vertical emission and vertical receipt of polarization, VH: vertical emission and horizontal receipt of polarization) for small areas of hilly land was proposed to effectively distinguish rice and non-rice crops with no marked flooding period. The DB-BiLSTM model was designed, ensuring the independent learning of multiple features and effectively combining the time series information of both (VV - VH)/(VV + VH) and VH features. The city of Shanwei, Guangdong Province, China, was selected as the study area. Experimental results showed that the overall accuracy of the rice mapping results was 97.29%, and the kappa coefficient reached 0.9424. Compared to other methods, the rice mapping results obtained by the proposed method maintained good integrity and had less misclassification, which demonstrated the proposed method's practical value in accurate and effective rice mapping tasks.

TI  - Deep Learning-Based Super-Resolution Reconstruction and Algorithm Acceleration of Mars Hyperspectral CRISM Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In Mars exploration, hyper-spectrometry plays an important role due to its high spectral resolution. However, due to the technical difficulty and the data size, the spatial resolution or the coverage of hyperspectral data is often limited. This limitation can be alleviated by deep learning-based super-resolution (SR) reconstruction. But the spatial size and batch size of the input training data is limited due to the large number of spectral channels. To improve the efficiency of model training and SR reconstruction, a dataset based on CRISM hyperspectral data is created in this paper, and its redundancy is analyzed in both spectral and spatial spital dimensions. Compression algorithms based on data selection and PCA are used to reduce the size of the input training data. A network that can perform spatial SR and spectral enhancement is also proposed to make the network can be trained with the compressed data. With these compression algorithms and network, high-resolution data with 235 bands can be reconstructed from the low-resolution data with only 40 bands. Compared with the network trained on the original low-resolution data with 235 bands, the model training time and the SR reconstruction runtime can be reduced to 30% and 23% with practically no accuracy loss. The effectiveness of compression algorithms based on data selection also indicates that maybe not all the bands need to be transmitted from the Mars probes or be collected. Furthermore, it would, in principle, help improve the efficiency of satellite data transmission and simplify the design of the hyper-spectrometer. Additionally, a method for spatial dimension correlation evaluation is also proposed in this paper. The spatial compression shows that the proposed method can reflect the correlation of spatial texture between patches, and the model can be acceptably trained with only half of the original data.

TI  - Using InSAR and PolSAR to Assess Ground Displacement and Building Damage after a Seismic Event: Case Study of the 2021 Baicheng Earthquake
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - During unexpected earthquake catastrophes, timely identification of damaged areas is critical for disaster management. On the 24 March 2021, Baicheng county was afflicted by a Mw 5.3 earthquake. The disaster resulted in three deaths and many human injuries. As an active remote sensing technology independent of light and weather, the increasingly accessible Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is an attractive data for assessing building damage. This paper aims to use Sentinel-1A radar images to rapidly assess seismic damage in the early phases after the disaster. A simple and robust method is used to complete the task of surface displacement analysis and building disaster monitoring. In order to obtain the coseismic deformation field, differential interferometry, filtering and phase unwrapping are performed on images before and after the earthquake. In order to detect the damage area of buildings, the Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) techniques are used. A simple and fast method combining coherent change detection and polarimetric decomposition is proposed, and the complete workflow is introduced in detail. In our experiment, we compare the detection results with the ground survey data using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) after the earthquake to verify the performance of the proposed method. The results indicate that the experiment can accurately obtain the coseismic deformation field and identify the damaged and undamaged areas of the buildings. The correct identification accuracy of collapsed and severely damaged areas is 86%, and that of slightly damaged and undamaged areas is 84%. Therefore, the proposed method is extremely effective in monitoring seismic-affected areas and immediately assessing post-earthquake building damage. It provides a considerable prospect for the application of SAR technology.

TI  - MODELING OF SHORELINE CHANGES IN WEST KALIMANTAN USING REMOTE SENSING AND HISTORICAL MAPS
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSERVATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping of potential site for nuclear reactors in Indonesia's coastal areas is a part of the national program. The coast of West Kalimantan is selected as a potential location for nuclear site, it needs understanding of shoreline changes. The main requirement for determining nuclear site location must be built in minimum abrasion and accretion. This study aimed to analyse the shoreline changes based on remote sensing and historical maps data. We used historical maps for 1945, whereas Landsat imagery for 1990, 2005, and 2020. These imageries are analysed to determine total suspended soilid (TSS) as the main driver. Shoreline changes analysed using Digital Shoreline Analysis System' (DSAS), including linear regression rate (LRR), net shoreline movement (NEVI), End Point Rate (EPR), and predicted model in 2030 and 2040. Shoreline in West Kalimantan is separated into 7 (seven) segments. The result study shows that period 1945-1990 has a highest acretion which reach 209.84km(2). It different to 1990-2005 period, the shoreline was decreased reach 56.56km(2). In 2040, the shoreline will reduce up to 4 percent. The segment 3 (Bengkayang) is most stable area with a change rate of 0.0036m per year and relatively balanced in gain/loss perspective. TSS had correlation with the shoreline changes in 1990 and 2020. This research is expected as reference in coastal protection efforts for the first National Nuclear Energy's contrcuction in Indonesia.

TI  - A New Clustering Method to Generate Training Samples for Supervised Monitoring of Long-Term Water Surface Dynamics Using Landsat Data through Google Earth Engine
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Water resources are vital to the survival of living organisms and contribute substantially to the development of various sectors. Climatic diversity, topographic conditions, and uneven distribution of surface water flows have made reservoirs one of the primary water supply resources in Iran. This study used Landsat 5, 7, and 8 data in Google Earth Engine (GEE) for supervised monitoring of surface water dynamics in the reservoir of eight Iranian dams (Karkheh, Karun-1, Karun-3, Karun-4, Dez, UpperGotvand, Zayanderud, and Golpayegan). A novel automated method was proposed for providing training samples based on an iterative K-means refinement procedure. The proposed method used the Function of the Mask (Fmask) initial water map to generate final training samples. Then, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) models were trained with the generated samples and used for water mapping. Results demonstrated the satisfactory performance of the trained RF model with the samples of the proposed refinement procedure (with overall accuracies of 95.13%) in comparison to the trained RF with direct samples of Fmask initial water map (with overall accuracies of 78.91%), indicating the proposed approach's success in producing training samples. The performance of three feature sets was also evaluated. Tasseled-Cap (TC) achieved higher overall accuracies than Spectral Indices (SI) and Principal Component Transformation of Image Bands (PCA). However, simultaneous use of all features (TC, SI, and PCA) boosted classification overall accuracy. Moreover, long-term surface water changes showed a downward trend in five study sites. Comparing the latest year's water surface area (2021) with the maximum long-term extent showed that all study sites experienced a significant reduction (16-62%). Analysis of climate factors' impacts also revealed that precipitation (0.51 <= R-2 <= 0.79) was more correlated than the temperature (0.22 <= R-2 <= 0.39) with water surface area changes.

TI  - Mapping the Spatial Distribution of Fern Thickets and Vine-Laden Forests in the Landscape of Bornean Logged-Over Tropical Secondary Rainforests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest degradation has been most frequently defined as an anthropogenic reduction in biomass compared with reference biomass in extant forests. However, so-defined "degraded forests" may widely vary in terms of recoverability. A prolonged loss of recoverability, commonly described as a loss of resilience, poses a true threat to global environments. In Bornean logged-over forests, dense thickets of ferns and vines have been observed to cause arrested secondary succession, and their area may indicate the extent of slow biomass recovery. Therefore, we aimed to discriminate the fern thickets and vine-laden forests from those logged-over forests without dense ferns and vines, as well as mapping their distributions, with the aid of Landsat-8 satellite imagery and machine learning modeling. During the process, we tested whether the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) textures of Landsat data and Sentinel-1 C-band SAR data were helpful for this classification. Our study sites were Deramakot and Tangkulap Forest Reserves-commercial production forests in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. First, we flew drones and obtained aerial images that were used as ground truth for the supervised classification. Subsequently, a machine-learning model with a gradient-boosting decision tree was iteratively tested in order to derive the best model for the classification of the vegetation. Finally, the best model was extrapolated to the entire forest reserve and used to map three classes of vegetation (fern thickets, vine-laden forests, and logged-over forests without ferns and vines) and two non-vegetation classes (bare soil and open water). The overall classification accuracy of the best model was 86.6%; however, by combining the fern and vine classes into the same category, the accuracy was improved to 91.5%. The GLCM texture variables were especially effective at separating fern/vine vegetation from the non-degraded forest, but the SAR data showed a limited effect. Our final vegetation map showed that 30.7% of the reserves were occupied by ferns or vines, which may lead to arrested succession. Considering that our study site was once certified as a well-managed forest, the area of degraded forests with a high risk of loss of resilience is expected to be much broader in other Bornean production forests.

TI  - Sentinel-2 Satellite Image Time-Series Land Cover Classification with Bernstein Copula Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A variety of remote sensing applications call for automatic optical classification of satellite images. Recently, satellite missions, such as Sentinel-2, allow us to capture images in real-time of the Earth's scenario. The classification of this large amount of data requires increasingly precise and fast methods, which must take into account not only the spectral features dependence of each individual image but also that of the temporal ones. Copulas are an excellent statistical tool, able to model joint distributions between even random variables. In this paper, we propose a new approach for Satellite Image Time-Series (SITS) land cover classification, which combines the matrix factorization to reduce the dimensionality of the data and the use of copulas distribution to model the dependencies. We will show how the use of particular copulas can improve the accuracy of classification compared to the latest methodologies used for the classification task, such as those using Neural Networks. Experiments were conducted at a study site located on Reunion Island, using Sentinel-2 SITS data. Results are compared to those achieved by several approaches commonly used to address SITS-based land cover mapping and show that the use of copulas, in combination with the matrix factorization, achieved the highest classification yield compared to competing approaches.

TI  - Remote Estimation of Water Clarity and Suspended Particulate Matter in Qinghai Lake from 2001 to 2020 Using MODIS Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change and human activities have been heavily affecting oceanic and inland waters, and it is critical to have a comprehensive understanding of the aquatic optical properties of lakes. Since many key watercolor parameters of Qinghai Lake are not yet available, this paper aims to study the spatial and temporal variations of the water clarity (i.e., Secchi-disk depth, Z(SD)) and suspended particulate matter concentration (CSPM) in Qinghai Lake from 2001 to 2020 using MODIS images. First, the four atmospheric correction models, including the NIR-SWIR, MUMM, POLYMER, and C2RCC were tested. The NIR-SWIR with decent accuracy in all bands was chosen for the experiment. Then, four existing models for Z(SD) and six models for C-SPM were evaluated. Two semi-analytical models proposed by Lee (2015) and Jiang (2021) were selected for Z(SD) (R-2 = 0.74) and C-SPM (R-2 = 0.73), respectively. Finally, the distribution and variation of the Z(SD) and C-SPM were derived over the past 20 years. Overall, the water of Qinghai Lake is quite clear: the monthly mean Z(SD) is 5.34 +/- 1.33 m, and C-SPM is 2.05 +/- 1.22 mg/L. Further analytical results reveal that the Z(SD) and C-SPM are highly correlated, and the relationship can be formulated with Z(SD)=8.072e(-0.212)C(SPM) (R-2 = 0.65). Moreover, turbid water mainly exists along the edge of Qinghai Lake, especially on the northwestern and northeastern shores. The variation in the lakeshore exhibits some irregularity, while the main area of the lake experiences mild water quality deterioration. Statistically, 81.67% of the total area is dominated by constantly increased C-SPM, and the area with decreased C-SPM occupies 4.56%. There has been distinct seasonal water quality deterioration in the non-frozen period (from May to October). The water quality broadly deteriorated from 2001 to 2008. The year 2008 witnessed a sudden distinct improvement, and after that, the water quality experienced an extremely inconspicuous degradation. This study can fill the gap regarding the long-time monitoring of water clarity and total suspended matter in Qinghai Lake and is expected to provide a scientific reference for the protection and management of the lake.

TI  - Time-series metrics applied to land use and land cover mapping with focus on landslide detection
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are a recurring phenomenon in Brazil and have caused many socioeconomic losses and casualties. To monitor them, land use and land cover (LULC) and landslide inventory maps are essential to identifying high susceptibility areas. In this sense, the main aim of this study is to produce LULC classification focused on landslide detection via semi-automatic methods, using data mining techniques with remote sensing time-series imagery. For that, different indices, such as the normalized difference vegetation index, the normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), and the soil adjusted vegetation index were extracted from Sentinel-2 imagery. Basic, polar, and fractal metrics were extracted from the time series. From the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission digital elevation model, six geomorphometric features were extracted. Then, classification was performed with random forest with four different approaches: mono-temporal, bi-temporal, metrical, and all. In every approach, the NDBI index or metric derived from it presented the highest importance, and the slope was ranked among the six first predictors. The all approach showed the highest overall accuracy (OA) (88.96%), followed by metrical (87.90%), bi-temporal (82.59%), and mono-temporal (74.95%). Briefly, the metrical approach presented the most beneficial result, presenting high OA and low levels of commission and omission errors. (C) The Authors.

TI  - Segmenting water and shadow regions within WorldView imagery using local binary patterns
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Many shadow detection algorithms pertaining to remotely sensed imagery exist. Several of these algorithms exploit the spectral characteristics of shadows within imagery to identify shaded regions. However, these algorithms can have problems when water is also present within the imagery because water shares similar spectral characteristics with shadows. Many of these algorithms are applied to small image subsets instead of the image as a whole and frequently are applied to urban environments that require additional use of the normalized difference water index or other features to affect the removal of water from the shadow mask. This diversity of the image scene content coupled with the complexity and wide variety of environmental conditions that satellite imagery can acquire makes reliably separating shadow and water within larger images a complex problem. Thresholding various spectral indices to produce segmentation maps can be challenging when large, complex, and often imbalanced scenes are captured, which may require manual adjustment of algorithmic parameters for different image areas. We present a methodology that makes use of the near-infrared channel using a watershed segmentation algorithm, local binary pattern measurements, and a support vector machine to classify shadow and water within a full WorldView scene. Results are promising with initial accuracies above 97% for both shadow and water. (C) 2022 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Quantification of methane emitted by ruminants: a review of methods
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - The contribution of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ruminant production systems varies from country to country, and CH4 emissions from animals and their manure are highly variable. Variance in quantification methodologies for CH4 has also raised questions about the accuracy of current GHG emissions coefficients for national and international inventories and, perhaps more importantly, how best to mitigate CH4 emissions.Lay Summary There is a need to accurately and precisely quantify greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, specifically methane (CH4), to ensure correct reporting of GHG inventories and, perhaps more importantly, determine how to best mitigate CH4 emissions. The objective of this study was to review existing methods and methodologies to quantify and estimate CH4 emissions from ruminants. Historically, most techniques were developed for specific purposes that may limit their widespread use on commercial farms and for inventory purposes and typically required frequent calibration and equipment maintenance. Whole animal and head respiration chambers, spot sampling techniques, and tracer gas methods can be used to measure enteric CH4 from individual animals, but each technique has its own inherent limitations. The measurement of CH4 emissions from manure depends on the type of storage, animal housing, CH4 concentration inside and outside the boundaries of the area of interest, and ventilation rate, which is likely the most complex variable creating many uncertainties. For large-scale areas, aircraft, drones, and satellites have been used in association with the tracer flux method, inverse modeling, imagery, and LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), but research is lagging in validating these methods. Bottom-up approaches to estimating CH4 emissions rely on empirical or mechanistic modeling to quantify the contribution of individual sources. Top-down approaches estimate the amount of CH4 in the atmosphere using spatial and temporal models to account for transportation from an emitter to an observation point.The contribution of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ruminant production systems varies between countries and between regions within individual countries. The appropriate quantification of GHG emissions, specifically methane (CH4), has raised questions about the correct reporting of GHG inventories and, perhaps more importantly, how best to mitigate CH4 emissions. This review documents existing methods and methodologies to measure and estimate CH4 emissions from ruminant animals and the manure produced therein over various scales and conditions. Measurements of CH4 have frequently been conducted in research settings using classical methodologies developed for bioenergetic purposes, such as gas exchange techniques (respiration chambers, headboxes). While very precise, these techniques are limited to research settings as they are expensive, labor-intensive, and applicable only to a few animals. Head-stalls, such as the GreenFeed system, have been used to measure expired CH4 for individual animals housed alone or in groups in confinement or grazing. This technique requires frequent animal visitation over the diurnal measurement period and an adequate number of collection days. The tracer gas technique can be used to measure CH4 from individual animals housed outdoors, as there is a need to ensure low background concentrations. Micrometeorological techniques (e.g., open-path lasers) can measure CH4 emissions over larger areas and many animals, but limitations exist, including the need to measure over more extended periods. Measurement of CH4 emissions from manure depends on the type of storage, animal housing, CH4 concentration inside and outside the boundaries of the area of interest, and ventilation rate, which is likely the variable that contributes the greatest to measurement uncertainty. For large-scale areas, aircraft, drones, and satellites have been used in association with the tracer flux method, inverse modeling, imagery, and LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), but research is lagging in validating these methods. Bottom-up approaches to estimating CH4 emissions rely on empirical or mechanistic modeling to quantify the contribution of individual sources (enteric and manure). In contrast, top-down approaches estimate the amount of CH4 in the atmosphere using spatial and temporal models to account for transportation from an emitter to an observation point. While these two estimation approaches rarely agree, they help identify knowledge gaps and research requirements in practice.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has affected many aspects of human life around the world, due to its tremendous outcomes on public health and socio-economic activities. Policy makers have tried to develop efficient responses based on technologies and advanced pandemic control methodologies, to limit the wide spreading of the virus in urban areas. However, techniques such as social isolation and lockdown are short-term solutions that minimize the spread of the pandemic in cities and do not invert long-term issues that derive from climate change, air pollution and urban planning challenges that enhance the spreading ability. Thus, it seems crucial to understand what kind of factors assist or prevent the wide spreading of the virus. Although AI frameworks have a very efficient predictive ability as data-driven procedures, they often struggle to identify strong correlations among multidimensional data and provide robust explanations. In this paper, we propose the fusion of a heterogeneous, spatio-temporal dataset that combine data from eight European cities spanning from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2021 and describe atmospheric, socio-economic, health, mobility and environmental factors all related to potential links with COVID-19. Remote sensing data are the key solution to monitor the availability on public green spaces between cities in the study period. So, we evaluate the benefits of NIR and RED bands of satellite images to calculate the NDVI and locate the percentage in vegetation cover on each city for each week of our 2-year study. This novel dataset is evaluated by a tree-based machine learning algorithm that utilizes ensemble learning and is trained to make robust predictions on daily cases and deaths. Comparisons with other machine learning techniques justify its robustness on the regression metrics RMSE and MAE. Furthermore, the explainable frameworks SHAP and LIME are utilized to locate potential positive or negative influence of the factors on global and local level, with respect to our model's predictive ability. A variation of SHAP, namely treeSHAP, is utilized for our tree-based algorithm to make fast and accurate explanations.

TI  - Rapid Extreme Tropical Precipitation and Flood Inundation Mapping Framework (RETRACE): Initial Testing for the 2021-2022 Malaysia Flood
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2021-2022 flood is one of the most serious flood events in Malaysian history, with approximately 70,000 victims evacuated daily, 54 killed and total losses up to MYR 6.1 billion. From this devastating event, we realized the lack of extreme precipitation and flood inundation information, which is a common problem in tropical regions. Therefore, we developed a Rapid Extreme TRopicAl preCipitation and flood inundation mapping framEwork (RETRACE) by utilizing: (1) a cloud computing platform, the Google Earth Engine (GEE); (2) open-source satellite images from missions such as Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM), Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 optical satellites; and (3) flood victim information. The framework was demonstrated with the 2021-2022 Malaysia flood. The preliminary results were satisfactory with an optimal threshold of five for flood inundation mapping using the Sentinel-1 SAR data, as the accuracy of inundated floods was up to 70%. Extreme daily precipitation of up to 230 mm/day was observed and resulted in an inundated area of 77.43 km(2) in Peninsular Malaysia. This framework can act as a useful tool for local authorities and scientists to retrace the extreme precipitation and flood information in a relatively short period for flood management and mitigation strategy development.

TI  - Assessment of Riverbank Erosion Hotspots along the Mekong River in Cambodia Using Remote Sensing and Hazard Exposure Mapping
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The large-scale monitoring of riverbank erosion is challenging because of human, equipment, and financial limitations, particularly in developing countries. This study aims to detect riverbank erosion and identify riverbank erosion hotspots along the Mekong River in Cambodia. A riverbank erosion rate map was developed using satellite images from Landsat 5, 7, and 8 (1990-2020) using the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) at a resolution of 30 m and Sentinel-2 (2016-2021) using the normalized difference water index (NDWI) at a resolution of 10 m. Detecting riverbanks in satellite images using a water index depends greatly on image resolution and water threshold. The riverbank lines were validated using Google Earth images. In the data used in December 2017, the root mean square error (RMSE) of Sentinel-2 was 6.00 m, while the RMSE of Landsat was 6.04 m. In the data used in January 2019, the RMSE of Sentinel-2 was 4.12 m, while the RMSE of Landsat was 5.90 m. The hotspots were identified by overlaying the riverbank erosion rate map and the exposure map of population density and land cover. Field surveys and interviews were conducted to verify riverbank erosion hotspots in the Ruessei Srok and Kaoh Soutin communes. The results showed that within the last 30 years (1990-2020), the riverbank eroded more than 1 km in a direction perpendicular to the river in some segments of the Mekong River in Cambodia. The highest average annual erosion rate was in the Ruessei Srok Commune in Kampong Cham Province, at approximately 43 m/yr. Most eroded areas were farmland and rural residential areas. The riverbank hotspots are situated mainly in the lower part of the Mekong River, where the population is dense, and the erosion rate is high. Riverbank erosion hotspots with a very high impact level and ongoing active erosion include the Peam Kaoh Sna, Kampong Reab, Kaoh Soutin, and Ruessei Srok communes in Kampong Cham Province. This study provides an efficient tool for using satellite images to identify riverbank erosion hotpots in a large river basin. The riverbank erosion hotspot map is essential for decision-makers to prioritize interventions to reduce the risk of riverbank erosion and to improve the livelihood of the people residing along the Mekong River.

TI  - Small-scale field assessment against the dengue vector <i>Aedes aegypti</i> using the auto-dissemination approach in an urban area of Vientiane, Lao PDR
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundIn Lao PDR, dengue fever is the most important vector borne disease and vector control remains the principal method to fight against Aedes aegypti the primary transmitter mosquito species. Vector control management programs need new strategies in addition to conventional larviciding and adulticiding interventions in the country. In this study, we examined the In2Care (R) Mosquito Trap's efficacy using insecticide auto-dissemination strategy. The insecticide pyriproxyfen, present in powder form inside the trap station, contaminates the body of gravid female mosquitoes visiting the traps and is later on disseminated via the mosquitoes in breeding sites surrounding the traps. We tested the attractiveness of the Traps, their efficacy to reduce the larval and adult abundance, and the impact on emergence rates. Specifically, we tested if the servicing interval of the In2Care (R) Mosquito Trap could be extended to 12 weeks.MethodsTwo black plastic ovitrap buckets and two BG (R) sentinel traps were placed in the premises of the Science campus of Vientiane Capital located in an urban area to measure weekly the larval and adult relative abundance of Aedes mosquitoes from 2017 to 2019. Twenty-five In2Care (R) Mosquito Traps were evenly distributed in this area and two studies of 12 weeks were implemented during January and April 2018 and, July to October 2018 (dry and rainy season, respectively). Every 2 weeks, water samples from 5 In2Care (R) Traps were randomly selected and tested at the laboratory with Ae. aegypti larvae to measure the larval and pupal mortality. The relative abundance of Aedes mosquitoes in the BG traps (R) with the presence of In2Care (R) Traps in 2018, was compared with the surveillance results obtained in 2017 and 2019 without In2Care (R) Traps. Every week, water samples from the ovitrap buckets were tested for Emergence Inhibition (EI).ResultsThe In2Care (R) Traps were very attractive to gravid Ae. aegypti mosquitoes specifically during the rainy seasons with 96% of the traps colonized with larvae/pupae within four weeks. The bioassays showed 100% mortality in the water samples from the traps during the twelve weeks studies showing the good efficacy over time of the pyriproxyfen without additional servicing in the 12 week period. In addition, the larvicide was successfully disseminated into the ovitrap buckets placed in the treated area where 100% of EI during all weeks of intervention was measured. There was no significant effect of the treatment on adult abundance reduction in the treated area, probably due to recolonization of adult mosquitoes surrounding the field experiment.ConclusionsThe observed potential of the In2Care (R) Mosquito Trap using the auto-dissemination strategy could lead to the use of this new tool in combination with conventional control methods against Dengue vectors in urban tropical areas. Large scale field trials should be implemented in Lao PDR to prove its efficacy for Public Health programs.

TI  - Early Prediction of Coffee Yield in the Central Highlands of Vietnam Using a Statistical Approach and Satellite Remote Sensing Vegetation Biophysical Variables
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Given the present climate change context, accurate and timely coffee yield prediction is critical to all farmers who work in the coffee industry worldwide. The aim of this study is to develop and assess a coffee yield forecasting method at the regional scale in Dak Lak province in the central highlands of Vietnam using the Crop Growth Monitoring System Statistical Tool (CGMSstatTool-CST) software and vegetation biophysical variables (NDVI, LAI, and FAPAR) derived from satellite remote sensing (SPOT-VEGETATION and PROBA-V). There has been no research to date applying this approach to this specific crop, which is the main contribution of this study. The findings of this research reveal that the elaboration of multiple linear regression models based on a combination of information from satellite-derived vegetation biophysical variables (LAI, NDVI, and FAPAR) corresponding to the first six months of the years 2000-2019 resulted in coffee yield forecast models presenting satisfactory accuracy (Adj.R-2 = 64 to 69%, RMSEp = 0.155 to 0.158 ton/ha and MAPE = 3.9 to 4.7%). These results demonstrate that the CST may efficiently predict coffee yields on a regional scale by using only satellite-derived vegetation biophysical variables. This study findings are likely to aid local governments and decision makers in precisely forecasting coffee production early and promptly, as well as in recommending relevant local agricultural policies.

TI  - An adaptive scalloping suppression method for spaceborne ScanSAR images based on pre-estimation and weighted filtering
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spaceborne scanning synthetic aperture radar (ScanSAR) is widely used in global observations due to its ability to perform wide-swath mapping in the range direction. However, its special working mode causes scalloping, which reduces the quality of images and affects subsequent applications. According to its characteristics, an adaptive method based on pre-estimation and weighted filtering is proposed in this paper to suppress scalloping in the image domain. First, the azimuth intensity distribution of the image after scalloping suppression is estimated, which is used for scene stationarity test. Then, the images that cannot meet the stationary standard are segmented into subimages using maximum entropy principle and mathematical morphology. Finally, an algorithm based on adaptive weighted filtering is introduced to suppress scalloping, and the suppressed subimages are fused to obtain final results. The performance of the proposed method is tested with real ScanSAR data from the Gaofen-3 (GF-3) satellite. The experimental results indicate that the effect of scalloping suppression is excellent, since the depth of scalloping can be suppressed to approximately 0.3 dB. Notably, the proposed system is efficient in processing large-area images, such as GF-3 ScanSAR images whose actual width is more than 300 km. The entire process requires no parameter adjustment, and the proposed method is suitable for various complex scenes. The effectiveness, high efficiency, adaptability and robustness of the proposed system are verified.

TI  - Comprehensive comparison performances of Landsat-8 atmospheric correction methods for inland and coastal waters
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric correction (AC) is a crucial step in the quantitative analysis of inland and coastal waters. In this study, the performances of six water-based AC methods (SeaDAS, ACOLITE-DSF/EXP, C2RCC, iCOR) were evaluated by using multiple global datasets (N = 139). Four evaluation strategies were applied including spectral similarity and Chlorophyll-a retrieval. The results showed that SeaDAS and ACOLITE-DSF performed the best in terms of analytical match, band ratios, Chlorophyll-a retrieval, and spectral similarity. SeaDAS had the lowest RMSE in the blue-green bands and showed good consistency across the spectral with the lowest median spectral angle of 7 degrees. It should be noted that ACOLITE-DSF outperforms SeaDAS in high turbidity waters. SeaDAS coupled with Chlorophyll-a retrieval algorithms of OC3 and Clark had the lowest RMSE, which showed the advantage of SeaDAS in Chlorophyll-a retrieval. This study provides scientific basis for choosing AC methods of Landsat-8 data for aquatic environment monitoring.

TI  - Soil Loss Estimation Coupling a Modified USLE Model with a Runoff Correction Factor Based on Rainfall and Satellite Soil Moisture Data
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite observations (Copernicus Sentinell-1) can supply antecedent soil moisture data, which helps to predict thresholds triggering runoff and runoff volume. In the paper, we developed a runoff correction factor to the USLE, using rainfall and satellite antecedent soil moisture data, following the approach of the modified USLE models such as the USLE-M and USLE-MM. The runoff and soil loss estimations accuracy are validated by plot-scale measurements (2008-2020 period) provided by SERLAB (Soil Erosion Laboratory) of the University of Perugia. The results show that the event rainfall depth added to the antecedent soil moisture is a fairly suitable predictor of the runoff. Using the simulated runoff in a USLE-MM model, the capability to predict event soil losses is enhanced with an RMSE = 0.57 Mg/ha lower than the RMSE approximate to 3.1 Mg/ha obtained by the USLE model. Using a modified USLE model, albeit with remote estimated runoff data, is still more advantageous at the event scale than the USLE model, which does not consider the runoff. These results are particularly significant for the estimation of runoff and soil losses. Satellite data shows the potential of applying the modified USLE models for large-scale monitoring and quantification of event soil erosion and runoff.

T2  - ASSISTENZA INFERMIERISTICA E RICERCA
M3  - Article
AB  - A recent editorial note in a journal which is certainly culturally and not only scientifically relevant as The Lancet, underlines how statistics, a discipline and methodology expected to be highly reliable and needed to produce critical evidences for programming and evaluating health issues and interventions, has become in various scenarios a misleading tool, by its capacity of using data to manipulate epidemiological information which coincides with the specific cancellation of situations of violation of human and health rights. As we live in a time and in contexts where data are becoming the protagonists of the decision-making processes from the digitalisation of all information, to the uncontrollable dependence from algorithms in deciding priorities and `personalised' care the alarm raised deserves attention: not exclusively to avoid misled behaviour, but more importantly to assure better and truly innovative practices. In the present challenging situation, which sees the nursing profession planned to acquire more substantial autonomy in the production of knowledge, the alarm could and should be interpreted as a `sentinel provocation' (and concrete model scenarios are proposed) to manage and utilise data which focus and made better targeted populations more exposed to conditions of fragility and marginalisation: the dominance of administrative data directed mainly to monitor economic sustainability, must be integrated and re-directed to a care where the human rights to health are the indicators and the measure of outcomes.

TI  - Differentiating Fissure-Fed Lava Flow Types and Facies Using RADAR and LiDAR: An Example From the 2014-2015 Holuhraun Lava Flow-Field
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Distinguishing between lava types and facies using remote sensing data is important for interpreting the emplacement history of lava flow-fields on Earth and other planetary bodies. Lava facies typically include a mixture of lava types and record the collective emplacement history of material preserved at a particular location. We seek to determine if lava facies in the 2014-2015 Holuhraun lava flow-field are discernible using radar roughness analysis. Furthermore, we also seek to distinguish between lava types using high resolution Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data. We extracted circular polarization ratios (CPR) from the Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar and cross-polarization (VH/VV) data from the Sentinel-1 satellite to analyze the surface roughness of three previously mapped lava facies: rubbly, spiny, and undifferentiated rubbly-spiny. Using the Kruskal-Wallis test, we reveal that all but one pair of the facies are statistically separable. However, the populations overlap by 88%-89% for CPR and 64%-67% for VH/VV. Therefore, owing to large sample populations (n > 2 x 10(5)), slight differences in radar data may be used to probabilistically infer the presence of a particular facies, but not directly map them. We also calculated the root-mean-square slope and Hurst exponents of five different lava types using LiDAR topography (5 cm/pixel). Our results show minute differences between most of the lava types, with the exception of the rubbly pahoehoe, which is discernible at 1 sigma. In brief, the presence of "transitional" lava types (e.g., rubbly pahoehoe) within fissure-fed lava flow-fields complicates remote sensing-based mapping.

T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary This manuscript aims to investigate the features of patients with metastatic sentinel lymph node (SLN), evaluated by OSNA, and to predict which patients have a high risk of positive ALND. The finding of the present study suggests a new cut-off of CK19 mRNA copy number in the sentinel lymph node useful to personalize surgical treatments and avoid unnecessary axillary surgical treatments. (1) Background: The main discriminant in breast cancer prognosis is axillary lymph node status. In a select cohort of patients, axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) may be safely spared. This study aimed to determine a new possible cut-off of cytokeratin (CK) 19 mRNA copy number in the SLN to predict cases at high risk of positive ALND. (2) Methods: Clinical records of 1339 patients were retrospectively reviewed and were separated into two groups according to the axillary status (negative: ALNs- and positive ALNs+). Receiver operative characteristic (ROC) curves were used to identify a new optimal cut-off of CK19 mRNA copy number in SLN; (3) Results: Large tumor size and high grade were found mostly in ALNs+. Results from the ROC analyses, with an AUC of 82.1%, identified a new cut-off (9150 CK19 mRNA copies) showing 94% sensitivity, 67.3% specificity, 61.2% positive, and 95.3% negative predictive values; (4) OSNA remains the most-important intra-operative tool to identify patients who can benefit from ALND but with the traditional cut-off, many patients undergo needless ALND. The results of the present study suggest a new cut-off helpful to personalize surgical treatment and avoid unnecessary invasive procedures.

TI  - Inter-Annual Climate Variability Impact on Oil Palm Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The contribution of oil palm plantations to the economic growth of tropical developing countries makes it essential to monitor their expansion into the tropical forest; consequently, most studies focus on improving mapping accuracy while using satellite imagery. However, accuracy can be hampered by atmospheric phenomena that can drastically change climatic conditions in tropical regions, affecting the spectral properties of the vegetation. In this sense, we studied the accuracy of palm plantation mapping by using features from different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum and a data fusion approach, and then compared the changes in accuracy over the years 2016, 2017, and 2018 (two of them with reported climatic anomalies). Optical-based maps obtained higher accuracy than thermal- and microwave-based maps, but they were the most affected by inter-annual climate variability (error margin between 5 and 10%), while thermal-based maps were the least affected (error margin between 8 and 9%). Data fusion combinations improved accuracy and reduced dissimilarities between years (e.g., phenology-based map accuracy changed by up to 20.8%, while phenology fused with microwave features changed by up to 6.8%). We conclude that inter-annual climate variability on land-cover mapping should be considered, especially if the outputs will be used as input in future studies.

TI  - Land surface temperature downscaling in the karst mountain urban area considering the topographic characteristics
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To obtain high-spatial-resolution land surface temperature (LST) in karst areas, it is necessary to select a downscale regression model with a better simulation effect and the scale factors that can best represent the topographic characteristics of karst mountainous areas. In Guiyang, a typical karst mountain city, two areas are selected as the study area, which is dominated by natural surface and construction land. Based on the data of Landsat-8 Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS), Sentinel-2, Advanced Land Observing Satellite Digital Elevation Model (ALOS DEM), and meteorological stations, the scale factors representing bare land: bare soil index and topographic relief: mountain shadow (hillshade), relief degree of land surface (RDLS), solar incident angle, and sky view factor (SVF) are added on the basis of the conventional factors. At the same time, random forest (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) models are used to construct an LST downscaling method that is more suitable for karst mountain cities. After the above steps, the LST product with a spatial resolution of 10 m is finally estimated. The results show that, due to the characteristics of large elevation variation, fragmentation, and high heterogeneity of surface landscape in karst areas, digital elevation model (DEM), RDLS, and SVF factors need to be considered in the downscaling of surface temperature, and the contribution rates of these factors are all more than 6% in the model. In terms of accuracy evaluation of ground temperature, XGBoost model has the highest accuracy with an average absolute error of 1.67K, RF model has an average error of 1.90K, and thermal image sharpening has the worst accuracy with an average error of 2.41K. In terms of accuracy evaluation of ascending scale, the XGBoost model also shows higher accuracy and richer texture details. The research results can provide basic data for the acquisition of high-resolution LST and its intermediate parameters in this area and also provide a method reference for the reduction of high-resolution LST in similar areas.

TI  - High-Resolution Wide-Swath Ambiguous Synthetic Aperture Radar Modes for Ship Monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes two high-resolution, wide-swath synthetic aperture radar (SAR) acquisition modes for ship monitoring that tolerate ambiguities and do not require digital beamforming. Both modes, referred to as the low pulse repetition frequency (PRF) and the staggered (high PRF) ambiguous modes, make use of a wide elevation beam, which can be obtained by phase tapering. The first mode is a conventional stripmap mode with a PRF much lower than the nominal Doppler bandwidth, allowing for the imaging of a large swath, because the ships' azimuth ambiguities can be recognized as they appear at known positions. The second mode exploits a continuous variation of the pulse repetition interval, with a mean PRF greater than the nominal Doppler bandwidth as the range ambiguities of the ships are smeared and are unlikely to determine false alarms. Both modes are thought to operate in open sea surveillance, monitoring Exclusive Economic Zones or international waters. Examples of implementation of both modes for TerraSAR-X show that ground swaths of 120 km or 240 km can be mapped with 2 m(2) resolution, ensuring outstanding detection performance even for small ships. The importance of resolution over noise and ambiguity level was highlighted by a comparison with ScanSAR modes that image comparable swaths with better noise and ambiguity levels but coarser resolutions.

TI  - PARALLELS IN THE WORKS OF NIZAMI GANJAVI AND HAJI BEKTASH VELI
T2  - REVISTA UNIVERSIDAD Y SOCIEDAD
M3  - Article
AB  - Azerbaijani poets Nizami Ganjavi and Haji Veli Bektashi are important master of words who have left their mark on the art of speech and whose influence is felt to this day through his indelible poetic set are given. This article analyzes through examples from the works of these writers, different concepts in the minds of our great compatriots, which were sensitive to all areas of life and tried to explore the most subtle issues, and their impact on the artistic and poetic creativity. In the examples, which can serve as an example of the artistic expression of even the most realistic, in accordance with the literary, artistic and aesthetic requirements of the time, along with Sufism, the influence of folklore is felt. It can be seen how Sufi worldview has a parallel place with folk literature in the approach to the creation of the world, the relationship between man and the God, and even the political and social events of the time. The theme of love for God is approached with special interest, finding parallels in the works of these two great writers who, although they gave great importance to humanity, always highlighted the importance of the divine.

TI  - Local delivery of low-dose anti-CTLA-4 to the melanoma lymphatic basin leads to systemic T<sub>reg</sub> reduction and effector T cell activation
T2  - SCIENCE IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Preclinical studies show that locoregional CTLA-4 blockade is equally effective in inducing tumor eradication as systemic delivery, without the added risk of immune-related side effects. This efficacy is related to access of the CTLA-4 blocking antibodies to tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs). Local delivery of anti-CTLA-4 after surgical removal of primary melanoma, before sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), provides a unique setting to clinically assess the role of TDLN in the biological efficacy of locoregional CTLA-4 blockade. Here, we have evaluated the safety, tolerability, and immunomodulatory effects in the SLN and peripheral blood of a single dose of tremelimumab [a fully human immunoglobulin gamma-2 (IgG2) mAb directed against CTLA-4] in a dose range of 2 to 20 mg, injected intradermally at the tumor excision site 1 week before SLNB in 13 patients with early-stage melanoma (phase 1 trial; NCT04274816). Intradermal delivery was safe and well tolerated and induced activation of migratory dendritic cell (DC) subsets in the SLN. It also induced profound and durable decreases in regulatory T cell (T-reg) frequencies and activation of effector T cells in both SLN and peripheral blood. Moreover, systemic T cell responses against NY-ESO-1 or MART-1 were primed or boosted (N = 7), in association with T cell activation and central memory T cell differentiation. These findings indicate that local administration of anti-CTLA-4 may offer a safe and promising adjuvant treatment strategy for patients with early-stage melanoma. Moreover, our data demonstrate a central role for TDLN in the biological efficacy of CTLA-4 blockade and support TDLN-targeted delivery methods.

TI  - Evaluation of Water Vapor Product from TROPOMI and GOME-2 Satellites against Ground-Based GNSS Data over Europe
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel integrated water vapor (IWV) product from TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) is validated together with a Global Ozone Monitoring Instrument-2 (GOME-2) standard product. As reference, ground-based Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) IWV data in 235 European stations from May 2018 to May 2019 are used. Under cloud free situations, a general comparison is carried out. It suggests that TROPOMI IWV exhibits less bias than GOME-2 and better results in the dispersion and regression parameters. Moreover, TROPOMI presents more homogeneous results along the different stations. However, TROPOMI is found to be overestimating the IWV uncertainties and being, therefore, too conservative in the confidence interval considered. The dependence of satellite product performance on several variables is also discussed. TROPOMI IWV shows wet bias of 5.7% or less for IWV < 10 mm (TROPOMI) and dry bias of up to -3% (TROPOMI). In contrast, GOME-2 shows wet bias of 30% or less for IWV < 25 mm (GOME-2) and dry bias of -12.3% for IWV > 25 mm. In addition, relative standard deviation (rSD) increases as IWV increases. In addition, the dependence on solar zenith angle (SZA) was also analyzed, as solar radiation bands are used in the retrieval algorithm of both instruments. Relative mean bias error (rMBE) shows positive values for GOME-2, slightly increasing with SZA, while TROPOMI shows more stable values. However, under high SZA, GOME-2 IWV exhibits a steep increase in rMBE (overestimation), while TROPOMI IWV exhibits a moderate decrease (underestimation). rSD is slightly increasing with SZA. The influence of cloudiness on satellite IWV observations is such that TROPOMI tends to overestimate IWV more as cloudiness increases, especially for high IWV. In the case of GOME-2, the rSD slightly increases with cloudiness, but TROPOMI rSD has a marked increase with increasing cloudiness. TROPOMI IWV is an important source of information about moisture, but its algorithm could still benefit from further improvement to respond better to cloudy situations.

TI  - Using Sterile Flocked Swabs as an Alternative Method for Rodent Health Monitoring
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR LABORATORY ANIMAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Routine health monitoring is an integral part of managing SPF rodent colonies. In recent years, rack-level environmental sampling has been introduced as an adjunct method or replacement for exposure of sentinel rodents to soiled bedding. However, rack-level environmental monitoring is not compatible with rodent housing systems that have cage-level filtration. The current study investigated whether exposure of sterile flocked swabs to soiled bedding can be an alternative sampling method for routine health monitoring in mice, thus replacing the use of sentinels in soiled-bedding cages. Flocked swabs were placed in cages containing pooled samples of soiled bedding but no mice; swabs remained there for 90 d, with weekly agitation and biweekly swabbing of the cage floor to mimic the agitation of soiled bedding by sentinel mice and facilitate the collection of dust particles. Fecal samples were collected from both colony and sentinel mice. For environmental samples, exhaust debris was collected from the rack plenum, and dust samples were collected from the exhaust hose. All samples were collected on days 88 through 91 and were tested for multiple pathogens by using real-time PCR assays. To determine the diagnostic agreement of flocked swab sampling with the other methods, we used. statistics to compare the test results from flocked swabs with those from sentinel feces, exhaust debris, and colony animal feces; we found excellent agreement between the colony feces and the flocked swab methods. The sterile flocked swab method detected all enzootic pathogens in the colonies tested. Results from flocked swab samples had the least agreement with sentinel feces, which also failed to detect the presence of fur mites. This study supports the use of sterile flocked swabs as alternative to using sentinel mice, thus conforming to the guiding principles of replacement and reduction in the use of animals for routine colony health monitoring.

T2  - COMPARATIVE PHILOSOPHY-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT OF DISTINCT APPROACHES TOWARD WORLD PHILOSOPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Attention to the details of putatively obvious examples of philosophy-as-worldview within Latin America give us reasons to be skeptical about the taxonomy that gives us the category of philosophy-as-worldview. Among the examples that suggest difficulties for this way of thinking about the philosophical enterprise are 19th century Mexican ethnolinguistics, contemporary efforts to reconstruct historical and contemporary Indigenous thought, and 20th century efforts to articulate regional ontologies within Latin America. However, reflection on these cases also point to a different project worth considering, namely, a taxonomy of wisdom- and knowledge-focused practices that might allow a different way of drawing distinctions between kinds of "philosophies".

TI  - Lidar-Based Aboveground Biomass Estimations for the Maya Archaeological Site of Yaxnohcah, Campeche, Mexico
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to provide a technique applied to archaeology to estimate lidar-based aboveground biomass (AGB) in contemporary tropical forests surrounding archaeological sites. Accurate AGB estimations are important to serve as a baseline to evaluate the wood resources that the ancient Maya could have used for the development of their cities. A lidar processing model is proposed to study the contemporary forest surrounding the Yaxnohcah archaeological site. As tropical forests are highly diverse environments where species are not uniformly distributed, it was necessary to consider the variation within the forest to obtain accurate AGB. Four vegetation communities were defined from a supervised classification of a Sentinel-2 satellite image. A stratified sample was then selected for the field survey that comprised 73 transects of 500 m(2) each. To estimate the transect AGB, we used an allometric equation that requires diameter, height, and wood density measurements for identified species. Linear-derived models provided the relationship between field data with lidar statistics for each vegetation type. Predicted average AGB values agreed with those obtained in the field. However, they significantly differed between vegetation types, averaging 83 Mg/ha for lowland forest, 178 for transition forest, and 215 for upland forest communities. From those results, we created a map with wall-to-wall AGB estimates following the distribution of vegetation classes that could complement archaeological research of past land use. Vegetation classification also helped determine that there is a spatial relationship between vegetation communities and the distribution of archaeological settlement features for the ancient city of Yaxnohcah.

TI  - Kinematic and Geometric Characterization of the Vogelsberg Rockslide (Tyrol, Austria) by Means of MT-InSAR Data
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper focuses on the study of the Vogelsberg landslide located in the municipality of Wattens (Tyrol, Austria), which reactivated in 2016, causing damages to nearby buildings and infrastructures. Since the date of reactivation, a modern monitoring system has been implemented with the installation of in-situ geodetic automated tracking total stations (ATTS), an inclinometer and two piezometers. Here, we describe two distinctive methods, the Breaks for Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST) and the Vector Inclination Method (VIM) used to characterize the landslide from the kinematic and geometrical point of view. The main input data, used for both methods, derive from processing a stack of several Sentinel-1 differential interferograms with the Multiple Small Baseline Subset (MSBAS) 2D and 3D algorithms. BFAST allowed highlighting the seasonality of the phenomenon from the analysis of the time series as well as the trend and the breakpoints that identify the landslide reactivation phases. These latter were then correlated with the main triggering factors such as rain and snow melting. The application of the VIM through the exploitation of the MSBAS displacement vectors allowed the reconstruction of the depth of the landslide slip surface along both the longitudinal and transversal direction and, in turn, the evaluation of the volumes of material mobilized by the landslide. The results obtained further prove that procedures for the in-depth analysis of Multi-Temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (MT-InSAR) data can contribute to slow-moving landslide characterization, which represents a fundamental step for landslide hazard assessment within quantitative risk analyses.

TI  - Assessment of Deep Convective Systems in the Colombian Andean Region
T2  - HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In tropical regions, deep convective systems are associated with extreme rainfall storms that usually detonate flash floods and landslides in the Andean Colombian region. Several studies have used satellite data to address the structure and formation of tropical convective storms. However, there is a local gap in the characterization, which is essential for a better understanding of flash floods and preparedness, filling a gap in a region with scarce information regarding extreme events. In this work, we assess the deep convective storms in a mountainous region of Colombia using meteorological radar observations between 2014 and 2017. We start by identifying convective and stratiform formations. We refine the convective identification by classifying convective systems into enveloped (contained in a stratiform system) and unenveloped (not contained). Then, we analyze the systems' temporal and spatial distributions and contrast them with the watersheds' features. According to our results, unenveloped convective systems have higher reflectivity and hence higher rainfall intensities. Moreover, they also have a well-defined spatial and temporal distribution and are likely to occur in watersheds with elevation gradients of around 2000 m and an aspect contrary to the wind direction. Our assessment of the convective storms is of significant value for the hydrologic community working on flash floods. Moreover, the spatiotemporal description is highly relevant for stakeholders and future local analysis.

TI  - Analysis of an extreme precipitation event in the Atacama desert in January 2020 and its relationship to humidity advection along the Southeast Pacific
T2  - ATMOSFERA
M3  - Article
AB  - An extreme precipitation event took place during the second half of January 2020 in the Atacama Desert. From Tacna, Peru to Iquique, Chile (18-21S) rainfall extended for several days producing floods, major damage to infrastructure, and affecting population in one of the driest deserts of the world. Analysis of surface-weather stations and reanalysis suggests that the most intense precipitation occurred in the Precordillera (2000 to 3600 m.a.s.l) on the western foothills of the Andes. The analysis based on surface observations, upper-air sounding, reanalysis and satellite data, suggests that at least four major factors were present to produce record-breaking precipitation: (i) a low-level circulation off-shore the Atacama Desert, potentially generated by the southward displacement of the Bolivian High and a trough located to the west over subtropical southeast Pacific, (ii) humidity advection via an atmospheric river-like structure, trapped along the coast ahead of the low-level cyclonic circulation, leading to increases in precipitable water vapor over the Atacama Desert, (iii) above-normal sea surface temperatures favoring moist conditions in the boundary layer and (iv) a strengthened local circulation, with low-level eastward moisture advection leading to forced orographic ascent along the Precordillera. These factors triggered thunderstorm development and precipitation mostly in the Precordillera, but also in the Lowlands, Pampas and Altiplano regions. Analysis of days with extreme precipitation in previous austral summers over the period (2008-2020) suggests that this combined thermodynamic-dynamic mechanism is present in the majority of such events in Southern Peru and Northern Chile, providing valuable guidance to predict future extreme precipitation events in the Atacama Desert.

TI  - Dispersive forces and resisting spot welds by alternative homolog conjunction govern chromosome shape in <i>Drosophila</i> spermatocytes during prophase
T2  - PLOS GENETICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The bivalent chromosomes that are generated during prophase of meiosis I comprise a pair of homologous chromosomes. Homolog pairing during prophase I must include mechanisms that avoid or eliminate entanglements between non-homologous chromosomes. In Drosophila spermatocytes, non-homologous associations are disrupted by chromosome territory formation, while linkages between homologous chromosomes are maintained by special conjunction proteins. These proteins function as alternative for crossovers that link homologs during canonical meiosis but are absent during the achiasmate Drosophila male meiosis. How and where within bivalents the alternative homolog conjunction proteins function is still poorly understood. To clarify the rules that govern territory formation and alternative homolog conjunction, we have analyzed spermatocytes with chromosomal aberrations. We examined territory formation after acute chromosome cleavage by Cas9, targeted to the dodeca satellite adjacent to the centromere of chromosome 3 specifically in spermatocytes. Moreover, we studied territory organization, as well as the eventual orientation of chromosomes during meiosis I, in spermatocytes with stable structural aberrations, including heterozygous reciprocal autosomal translocations. Our observations indicate that alternative homolog conjunction is applied in a spatially confined manner. Comparable to crossovers, only a single conjunction spot per chromosome arm appears to be applied usually. These conjunction spots resist separation by the dispersing forces that drive apart homologous pericentromeric heterochromatin and embedded centromeres within territories, as well as the distinct chromosomal entities into peripheral, maximally separated territories within the spermatocyte nucleus.

TI  - Dispersive forces and resisting spot welds by alternative homolog conjunction govern chromosome shape in <i>Drosophila</i> spermatocytes during prophase I
T2  - PLOS GENETICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Author summaryAlready the primordial eukaryote appears to have used meiosis for sexual reproduction, because this sophisticated process follows a canonical program in lineages ranging from unicellular organisms to plants and animals. The maternal and paternal copies of a particular chromosome, i.e., the homologs, are first physically linked into a bivalent before the first meiotic division. Linkage is essential for error-free chromosome segregation. In canonical meiosis, linkage is achieved by crossovers. These are regulated so that each chromosome pair is linked, but only by very few crossovers. Surprisingly, crossovers are absent during meiosis in males of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Instead, an alternative homolog conjunction system is used. It is not yet clear how this functions. Here, we demonstrate that the alternative chromosome glue appears to be applied in a locally restricted manner rather than all along the paired homologs. Just two spots of glue appear to conjoin the two homologous chromosomes usually, with one spot linking the left and another the right chromosome arm. Thus, number and location of linkages appear to be similar as crossovers, raising the possibility of mechanistic similarities in the establishment of the two distinct types of homolog linkage.The bivalent chromosomes that are generated during prophase of meiosis I comprise a pair of homologous chromosomes. Homolog pairing during prophase I must include mechanisms that avoid or eliminate entanglements between non-homologous chromosomes. In Drosophila spermatocytes, non-homologous associations are disrupted by chromosome territory formation, while linkages between homologous chromosomes are maintained by special conjunction proteins. These proteins function as alternative for crossovers that link homologs during canonical meiosis but are absent during the achiasmate Drosophila male meiosis. How and where within bivalents the alternative homolog conjunction proteins function is still poorly understood. To clarify the rules that govern territory formation and alternative homolog conjunction, we have analyzed spermatocytes with chromosomal aberrations. We examined territory formation after acute chromosome cleavage by Cas9, targeted to the dodeca satellite adjacent to the centromere of chromosome 3 specifically in spermatocytes. Moreover, we studied territory organization, as well as the eventual orientation of chromosomes during meiosis I, in spermatocytes with stable structural aberrations, including heterozygous reciprocal autosomal translocations. Our observations indicate that alternative homolog conjunction is applied in a spatially confined manner. Comparable to crossovers, only a single conjunction spot per chromosome arm appears to be applied usually. These conjunction spots resist separation by the dispersing forces that drive apart homologous pericentromeric heterochromatin and embedded centromeres within territories, as well as the distinct chromosomal entities into peripheral, maximally separated territories within the spermatocyte nucleus.

TI  - Assessment of Forest Cover Changes in Vavuniya District, Sri Lanka: Implications for the Establishment of Subnational Forest Reference Emission Level
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessment of forest cover changes is required to establish the forest reference emission level (FREL) at any scale. Due to civil conflict, such assessments have not yet been undertaken in Sri Lanka, especially in the conflict zone. Here, we assessed the forest cover changes in Vavuniya District, Sri Lanka, from 2001 to 2020, using a combination of the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform and the phenology-based threshold classification (PBTC) method. Landsat 5 TM data for 2001, 2006, and 2010, and Landsat 8 OLI data for 2016 and 2020 were used to classify forest cover by categories, and their related changes could be assessed by four categories, namely dry monsoon forest, open forest, other lands, and water bodies. With an overall average accuracy of 87% and an average kappa coefficient of 0.83, forest cover was estimated at 57.6% of the total land area in 2020. There was an increase of 0.46% per annum for the entire district between 2001 and 2010, but a drastic loss of 0.60% per year was observed between 2010 and 2020. Specifically, the dry monsoon forest lost 0.30%, but open forest gained 3.62% annually over the same period. Loss and gain of forest cover resulted in carbon emissions and removals of 165,306.6 MgCO2 and 24,064.5 MgCO2 annually, respectively, over the same period. Our findings could be used to set the baseline trend of deforestation, based on which, a subnational forest reference emission level can be established as an emission benchmark, against which comparisons of carbon emissions following the implementation of REDD+ activities can be made, and result-based payment can be claimed under the Paris Agreement.

TI  - Improved rainfall and temperature satellite dataset in areas with scarce weather stations data: case study in Ancash, Peru
T2  - REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION
M3  - Article
AB  - Rainfall and temperature variables play an important role in understanding meteorology at global and regional scales. However, the availability of meteorological information in areas of complex topography is difficult, as the density of weather stations is often very low. In this study, we focused on improving existing satellite products for these areas, using Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) data for rainfall and Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications Version 2 (MERRA-2) data for air temperature. Our objective was to propose a model that improves the accuracy and correlation of satellite data with observed data on a monthly scale during 2012-2017. The improvement of rainfall satellite data was performed using 4 regions: region 1 Santa (R1Sn), region 2 Maranon (R2Mr), region 3 Pativilca (R3Pt) and region 4 Pacific (R4Pc). For temperature, a model based on the use of the slope obtained between temperature and altitude data was used. In addition, the reliability of the TRMM, GPM and MERRA-2 data was analyzed based on the ratio of the mean square error, PBIAS, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and correlation coefficient. The final products obtained from the model for temperature are reliable with R-2 ranging from 0.72 to 0.95 for the months of February and August respectively, while the improved rainfall products obtained are shown to be acceptable (NSE >= 0.6) for the regions R1Sn, R2Mr and R3Pt. However, in R4Pc it is unacceptable (NSE < 0.4), reflecting that the additive model is not suitable in regions with low rainfall values.

TI  - Experimental work on the implementation of the methodological model of fostering personal intellectual culture in undergraduate pedagogical students by means of foreign-language education
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The article deals with the problem of education intellectualization at higher education institutions. The aim of the article is to present the analysis of the results of the experimental work on the practical implementation of the model of the methodical system for fostering personal intellectual culture in undergraduate pedagogical students by means of foreign-language education. The main process of the experimental teaching of foreign languages was focused on the integrated fostering of the components of the personal intellectual culture of future teachers: (a) cognitive culture (skills, abilities and experience associated with the understanding of meaning, systematization, transformation of foreign-language information); (b) communicative culture (detailed, logical and meaningful verbal communication in a foreign language); (c) the culture of reflective thinking (goal-setting, self-motivation, self-determination, introspection, self-regulation, self-organization, self-esteem and self-control of one's activities in the process of learning a foreign language); (d) the culture of creativity (the disclosure and development of creative abilities and readiness for innovation); (e) the worldview culture (the formation of a wide range of manifestations of education; the gained knowledge, mastered skills and abilities allow one to think, to reason, to strive for the best, to comprehend the phenomena of one's own spiritual life and to form the integral picture of the world, to be responsible, to evaluate the consequences of one's actions in accordance with the socio-ethical norms and spiritual values. The diagnostic tools such as surveys, questionnaires, diagnostic techniques, the method of participant observation in practical classes, analysis of the products of the educational, cognitive, creative and research activities performed by students during the practical classes and the extracurricular events, test papers, test tasks, creative projects, presentation of project and research work, self-assessment and mutual assessment, external expert assessment of university teachers and representatives of the employer (secondary schools teachers), etc. were used. At the transformative and control-evaluative stages of the experimental work, the positive dynamics of the development of indicators of cognitive, analytical, speech-thinking, communicative, regulatory, reflexive, axiological and creative aspects of intellectual and personal improvement in the students of the experimental group was revealed. The author concludes that the process and the result of the carried out activities reveal the effectiveness of the designed conceptual and methodological model of foreign-language education that presupposes the systemic development of a complex of abilities and personal qualities of the cognitive-semantic, motivational-value, organizational-active and creative spheres in pedagogical students' personalities.

TI  - Was the Reduction in Seasonal Influenza Transmission during 2020 Attributable to Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions to Contain Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Japan?
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - We quantified the effects of adherence to various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on the seasonal influenza epidemic dynamics in Japan during 2020. The total monthly number of seasonal influenza cases per sentinel site (seasonal influenza activity) reported to the National Epidemiological Surveillance of Infectious Diseases and alternative NPI indicators (retail sales of hand hygiene products and number of airline passenger arrivals) from 2014-2020 were collected. The average number of monthly seasonal influenza cases in 2020 had decreased by approximately 66.0% (p < 0.001) compared to those in the preceding six years. An increase in retail sales of hand hygiene products of yen 1 billion over a 3-month period led to a 15.5% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 10.9-20.0%; p < 0.001) reduction in seasonal influenza activity. An increase in the average of one million domestic and international airline passenger arrivals had a significant association with seasonal influenza activity by 11.6% at lag 0-2 months (95% CI: 6.70-16.5%; p < 0.001) and 30.9% at lag 0-2 months (95% CI: 20.9-40.9%; p < 0.001). NPI adherence was associated with decreased seasonal influenza activity during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan, which has crucial implications for planning public health interventions to minimize the health consequences of adverse seasonal influenza epidemics.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Variability of Suspended Particulate Matter in a High-Arctic Estuary (Adventfjorden, Svalbard) Using Sentinel-2 Time-Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Arctic coasts, which feature land-ocean transport of freshwater, sediments, and other terrestrial material, are impacted by climate change, including increased temperatures, melting glaciers, changes in precipitation and runoff. These trends are assumed to affect productivity in fjordic estuaries. However, the spatial extent and temporal variation of the freshwater-driven darkening of fjords remain unresolved. The present study illustrates the spatio-temporal variability of suspended particulate matter (SPM) in the Adventfjorden estuary, Svalbard, using in-situ field campaigns and ocean colour remote sensing (OCRS) via high-resolution Sentinel-2 imagery. To compute SPM concentration (C-SPMsat), a semi-analytical algorithm was regionally calibrated using local in-situ data, which improved the accuracy of satellite-derived SPM concentration by similar to 20% (MRD). Analysis of SPM concentration for two consecutive years (2019, 2020) revealed strong seasonality of SPM in Adventfjorden. Highest estimated SPM concentrations and river plume extent (% of fjord with C-SPMsat > 30 mg L-1) occurred during June, July, and August. Concurrently, we observed a strong relationship between river plume extent and average air temperature over the 24 h prior to the observation (R-2 = 0.69). Considering predicted changes to environmental conditions in the Arctic region, this study highlights the importance of the rapidly changing environmental parameters and the significance of remote sensing in analysing fluxes in light attenuating particles, especially in the coastal Arctic Ocean.

TI  - Evolution of Ecological Patterns of Poyang Lake Wetland Landscape over the Last One Hundred Years Based on Historical Topographic Maps and Landsat Images
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological pattern evolution of Poyang Lake wetland, the largest freshwater lake in China, is critical for regional ecological protection and sustainable development of migratory bird habitats; however, this information is still not fully explored. In this study, we quantitatively reconstructed the spatial distribution and landscape ecological pattern of Poyang Lake wetlands in three periods in the past 100 years based on the military topographic map in the 1930s and the Landsat satellite remote sensing image data in 1979 and 2021. Further, use the Fragstats software to analyze the ecological pattern index of wetland reconstruction results. The results show that the wetland area in the Poyang Lake region has experienced a continuous reduction process over the past 100 years, and it decreased from 3857 km(2) in the 1930s to 3673 km(2) in the 1970s, and then to 3624 km(2) in the 2020s. The current wetland area has decreased by about 6.04% compared with the 1930s. The general trend of changes in the spatial pattern of Poyang Lake wetlands is that the surface water decreases and the open land increases. Nevertheless, the trend has certain spatial differences as a large area of wetlands disappeared in the southwest and west of Poyang Lake and the areas with enlarged wetland density values mainly appeared in the northeastern and northern parts of the study area. The NP (number of patches) in the wetlands of Poyang Lake over the past 100 years showed a downward trend during the 1930s-1970s, and an increasing trend during the 1970s-2010s. Due to the increases of constructed wetlands, the number and density of patches also increased, and PD (patch density) reached a maximum value of 0.142 in 2020s. The LPI (largest patch index) has shown a gradual downward trend in the past 100 years. Compared with the 1930s, the wetlands in 2020s dropped by about 26.64%, and the wetlands further showed a trend of fragmentation. The AI index, which indicates the concentration of wetland patches, reached the maximum value in 2020s, but the LSI (landscape shape index) showed a downward trend in general, indicating that the shape of wetland patches has been simplified over the past 100 years. The research results can provide basic data and decision-making basis for Poyang Lake wetland protection, construction of migratory bird reserve and regional sustainable development.

TI  - Rice Phenology Retrieval Based on Growth Curve Simulation and Multi-Temporal Sentinel-1 Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate estimation and monitoring of phenology is necessary for modern agricultural industries. For crops with short phenology occurrence times, such as rice, Sentinel-1 can be used to effectively monitor the growth status in different phenology periods within a short time interval. Therefore, this study proposes a method to monitor rice phenology based on growth curve simulation by constructing a polarized growth index (PGI) and obtaining a polarized growth curve. A recursive neural network is used to realize the classification of phenology and use it as prior knowledge of rice phenology to divide and extract the phenological interval and date of rice in 2021. The experimental results show that the average accuracy of neural network phenological interval division reaches 93.5%, and the average error between the extracted and measured phenological date is 3.08 days, which proves the application potential of the method. This study will contribute to the technical development of planning, management and maintenance of renewable energy infrastructure related to phenology.

TI  - Satellite-Based Monitoring on Green-Up Date for Optimizing the Rest-Grazing Period in Xilin Gol Grassland
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological degradation has occurred in global grasslands and has impaired their ecosystem services severely, so ecological conservation of grasslands should be focused more on the effectiveness of management measures. The green-up process decides the year-round forage yield and ecological conditions of grasslands. Adopting rest-grazing during the green-up process can guarantee a successful green-up, thus realizing more economic benefits without grassland degradation. Therefore, studies should pay more attention to whether the green-up process is really covered by the rest-grazing period or not. We analyze the spatiotemporal variations and the stability of the annual green-up date in Xilin Gol Grassland from 2000 to 2018 based on MODIS time series images and compare the green-up date with the rest-grazing period to assess the effectiveness of the rest-grazing policy. The results show that the green-up date of Xilin Gol Grassland had advanced 15 days on average because of the increasing trend of both temperature and precipitation during 2000 similar to 2018. The green-up date is mostly 120 similar to 130 d in the east, about 10 days earlier than the west (130 similar to 140 d) and 20 days earlier than in the central areas (140 similar to 150 d), also because of the spatial variations of temperature and precipitation. The coefficient of variation (CV) of the green-up date showed a significant negative correlation with precipitation, so the green-up date is more unstable in the arid areas. The rest-grazing period started more than 45 days earlier than the green-up date and failed to cover it in several years, which occurred more frequently in southern counties. The average green-up date appeared after rest-grazing started in over 98% of areas, and the time gap is 15 similar to 45 days in 88% of areas, which not only could not avoid grassland degradation effectively but also increased herdsmen's life burden. This study aims to accurately grasp the temporal and spatial variations of the green-up date in order to provide references for adjusting a more proper rest-grazing period, thus promoting ecological conservation and sustainable development of animal husbandry.

TI  - Shoreline Dynamics of Chongming Island and Driving Factor Analysis Based on Landsat Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Chongming Island, the third largest island in China, has experienced dramatic shoreline changes due to erosion, river deposits, and human activities. While previous studies have shown the capacity of Landsat series images to extract shoreline dynamics, the spatial variation of shoreline dynamics and their corresponding driving factors remain unclear. Therefore, we established a method to monitor the shoreline dynamics of Chongming Island from 1984 to 2020 and to evaluate the driving factors of shoreline changes using a novel approach to Landsat image analysis. The method, based on the LISA (local indicator of spatial autocorrelation) concept, automatically extracted the shoreline from Landsat imagery. The results show that the LISA method, based on the SWIR1 band, has a high capacity for shoreline extraction in Chongming Island. By distinguishing the responses of the eastern and northern shorelines to upstream sediment loads and comprehensively analyzing the driving factors of eastern and northern dynamics, we found that: (i) although upstream sediment loads decreased dramatically, the shoreline of Chongming Island is still expanding due to human activities (i.e., reclamation and an estuary project) and sediment re-suspension from near-shore or cross-shore currents; (ii) the expansion of Chongming Island was initially due to the dynamics at the eastern shoreline, but the expansion of the eastern shoreline slowed after 2008 as upstream sedimentation slowed, less construction of cofferdams took place, and the Qingcaosha Reservoir was constructed; (iii) the northern shoreline of Chongming Island expanded rapidly after 1999, due to the merger of Xinlongsha, Xincunsha, and Chongming Island, and the transport of coastal and offshore sediments by hydrodynamic processes; and (iv) the main driving factors of eastern shoreline movement on Chongming Island are cofferdam reclamation and coastal engineering, and the changes at the northern shoreline are mainly affected by reclamation projects, offshore sediment supplies, and upstream sediment inflow. The results of this study provide theoretical fundamentals for land reclamation and future urban planning for Chongming Island.

TI  - Investigation of Long-Term Forest Dynamics in Protected Areas of Northeast China Using Landsat Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest dynamics, including forest loss and gain, are long-term complex ecological processes affected by nature and human activities. It is particularly important to understand the long-term forest dynamics of protected areas to evaluate their conservation efforts. This study adopted the Landsat tree-canopy cover (TCC) method to derive annual TCC data for the period 1984-2020 for the protected areas of northeast China, where protection policies have been carried out since the end of the 20th century, e.g., the Natural Forest Conversion Program (NFCP). A strong correlation was found between the TCC estimates derived from Landsat and LiDAR observations, suggesting the high accuracy of TCC. Forest loss and gain events were also identified from the time series of TCC estimates. High correlations were reported for both forest loss (Producer's accuracy = 85.21%; User's accuracy = 84.26%) and gain (Producer's accuracy = 87.74%; User's accuracy = 88.31%), suggesting that the approach can be used for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of the NFCP and other forest conservation efforts. The results revealed a fluctuating upward trend of the TCC of the protected area from 1986 to 2018. The increased area of TCC was much larger than the decreased area, accounting for 59.68% and 40.34%, respectively, suggesting the effectiveness of protection policies. Since the NFCP was officially implemented in 1998, deforestation was effectively curbed, the area of forest loss was significantly reduced (slope: -14.24%/year), and the area of forest gain significantly increased (slope: 4.13%/year). We found that regional forest changes were mainly manifested in "forest gain after loss (forest recovery)" and "forest gain with no loss (forest newborn)", accounting for 40.29% and 37.28% of the total area of forest change, respectively. Moreover, the forest gain area far exceeds the forest loss area, reaching 11.24 million hectares, suggesting a successful forest recovery due to forest protection.

TI  - A new object-class based gap-filling method for PlanetScope satellite image time series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - PlanetScope CubeSats data with a 3-m resolution, frequent revisits, and global coverage have provided an unprecedented opportunity to advance land surface monitoring over the recent years. Similar to other optical satellites, cloud-induced data missing in PlanetScope satellites substantially hinders its use for broad applications. However, effective gap-filling in PlanetScope image time series remains challenging and is subject to whether it can 1) consistently generate high accuracy results regardless of different gap sizes, especially for heterogeneous landscapes, and 2) effectively recover the missing pixels associated with rapid land cover changes. To address these challenges, we proposed an object-class based gap-filling ('OCBGF') method. Two major novelties of OCBGF include 1) adopting an object-based segmentation method in conjunction with an unsupervised classification method to help characterize the landscape heterogeneity and facilitate the search of neighboring valid pixels for gap-filling, improving its applicability regardless of the gap size; 2) employing a scenario-specific gap-filling approach that enables effective gap-filling of areas with rapid land cover change. We tested OCBGF at four sites representative of different land cover types (plantation, cropland, urban, and forest). For each site, we evaluated the performance of OCBGF on both simulated and real cloud-contaminated scenarios, and compared our results with three state-of-the-art methods, namely Neighborhood Similar Pixel Interpolator (NSPI), AutoRegression to Remove Clouds (ARRC), and Spectral-Angle-Mapper Based Spatio-Temporal Similarity (SAMSTS). Our results show that across all four sites, OCBGF consistently obtains the highest accuracy in gap-filling when applied to scenarios with various gap sizes (RMSE = 0.0065, 0.0090, 0.0092, and 0.0113 for OCBGF, SAMSTS, ARRC, and NSPI, respectively) and with/without rapid land cover changes (RMSE = 0.0082, 0.0112, 0.0119, and 0.0120 for OCBGF, SAMSTS, ARRC, and NSPI, respectively). These results demonstrate the effectiveness of OCBGF for gap-filling PlanetScope image time series, with potential to be extended to other satellites.

TI  - A New Line Matching Approach for High-Resolution Line Array Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, a new line matching approach for high-resolution line array remote sensing images is presented. This approach establishes the correspondence of straight lines on two images by combining multiple constraints. Firstly, three geometric constraints, epipolar, direction and the point-line geometric relationship, are used in turn to reduce the number of matching candidates. After this, two similarity constraints, the double line descriptor and point-line distance, are used to determine the optimal matches. Finally, the co-linearity constraint is used to check the one-to-many and many-to-one correspondences in the results. The proposed approach is tested on eight representative image patches selected from the ZY-3 line array satellite images, and the results are compared with those of two state-of-the-art approaches. Experiments demonstrate the superiority and potential of the proposed approach due to its higher accuracy and greater number of matches in most cases.

TI  - Quantifying the Impacts of the 2020 Flood on Crop Production and Food Security in the Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study uses satellite imagery and geospatial data to examine the impact of floods over the main planting areas for double-cropping rice and grain crops in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River. During summer 2020, a long-lasting 62-day heavy rainfall caused record-breaking floods over large areas of China, especially the Yangtze basin. Through close examination of Sentinel-1/2 satellite imagery and Copernicus Global Land Cover, between July and August 2020, the inundation area reached 21,941 and 23,063 km(2), and the crop-affected area reached 11,649 and 11,346 km(2), respectively. We estimated that approximately 4.66 million metric tons of grain crops were seriously affected in these two months. While the PRC government denied that food security existed, the number of Grains and Feeds imported from the U.S. between January to July 2021 increased by 316%. This study shows that with modern remote sensing techniques, stakeholders can obtain critical estimates of large-scale disaster events much earlier than other indicators, such as disaster field surveys or crop price statistics. Potential use could include but is not limited to monitoring floods and land use coverage changes.

TI  - Mapping urban land dynamics by automatic generation of ground samples from Globeland30 and random forest classification on the Google Earth Engine<SUP>†</SUP>
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Long time series urban mapping using Landsat images remains challenging due to the difficulty of collecting representative ground samples. We proposed a mapping approach integrating a sample-transferring scheme, multiple-feature fusion classification, and temporal filtering to generate annual urban land maps in Zhengzhou during 1986 to 2021 with the aid of the Google Earth Engine (GEE). The training and validation samples for each historical year were obtained by a proposed sample transfer scheme based on stable areas derived from the GlobeLand30 datasets. Thirteen variables, such as spectral indices, spectral bands, and terrain factors, were combined to form the feature vector. Annual classification was conducted yearly using the random forest algorithm on GEE to obtain annual impervious surface (ISs) maps. Finally, the IS classification maps were postprocessed to obtain the final urban land maps. Zhengzhou was selected as the study area due to its dramatic urbanization in recent decades. The results showed that the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of the IS classification maps ranged from 0.8888 to 0.9578 and 0.6548 to 0.8331, respectively. Compared with other 30-m land-cover products, our urban land maps showed higher accuracy and more reliable spatial details. The proposed approach can generate massive ground samples for long time series urban mapping and is helpful for updating regional and global land-cover products. Zhengzhou's urban area increased by 1423.24 km(2) with an average expansion area of 40.66 km(2) / year from 1986 to 2021. The urban expansion in Zhengzhou showed significant stage characteristics and spatial variations. The expansion intensity indices were 0.204, 0.404, 0.736, and 2.018, respectively, at four time periods and varied across the 12 regions in Zhengzhou.

TI  - Extraction of Aquaculture Pond Region in Coastal Waters of Southeast China Based on Spectral Features and Spatial Convolution
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - To control the negative effects resulting from the disorderly development of aquaculture ponds and promote the development of the aquaculture industry, rapid and accurate identification and extraction techniques are essential. An aquaculture pond is a special net-like water body divided by complex roads and dikes. Simple spectral features or spatial texture features are not sufficient to accurately extract it, and the mixed feature rule set is more demanding on computer performance. Supported by the GEE platform, and using the Landsat satellite data set and corresponding DEM combined with field survey data, we constructed a decision-making model for the extraction of aquaculture ponds in the coastal waters, and applied this method to the coastal waters of Southeast China. This method combined the image spectral information, spatial features, and morphological operations. The results showed that the total accuracy of this method was 93%, and the Kappa coefficient was 0.86. The overlapping proportions of results between the automated extraction and visual interpretation for test areas were all more than 90%, and the average was 92.5%, which reflected the high precision and reliability of this extraction method. Furthermore, in 2020, the total area of coastal aquaculture ponds in the study area was 6348.51 km(2), which was distributed primarily in the cities of Guangdong and Jiangsu. Kernel density analysis suggested that aquaculture ponds in Guangdong and Jiangsu had the highest degree of concentration, which means that they face higher regulatory pressure in the management of aquaculture ponds than other provinces. Therefore, this method can be used to extract aquaculture ponds in coastal waters of the world, and holds great significance to promote the orderly management and scientific development of fishery aquaculture.

TI  - Regional Contributions and Climate Attributions to Interannual Variation of Global Net Ecosystems Production by an ECOSYSTEM Processed Model Driven by Remote Sensing Data over the Past 35 Years
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global climate change has significantly affected terrestrial carbon sinks. Net ecosystem production (NEP) plays a critical role in the global carbon cycle. However, interannual variability (IAV) of the NEP and its regional contributions and climate attributions are not well-understood on a global scale. This study used a diagnostic model driven by remote sensing leaf area index (LAI) to investigate the NEP IAV and analyze regional and climate contributions on a global scale from 1982 to 2016. We found large NEP IAV during the study period, with the NEP detrended anomaly ranging from -2.3 Pg C in 1998 to 1.6 Pg C in 2013 at a global scale. Furthermore, 63.7% and 34.1% of the areas showed positive and negative contributions to NEP IAVs globally, respectively. Evergreen broadleaf forest (EBF) contributed the most (31.1%) to NEP IAV, followed by cropland (21.7%) and grassland (20.8%). Temperature played the most critical roles in the global NEP IAV, with a contribution of 45.5%. However, the partial correlation between NEP and temperature was negative, and the correlation with precipitation was positive in most areas of the globe, indicating that global warming is not conducive to the global carbon sink, but abundant rainfall is important for the global carbon cycle. This study suggests that, to increase the global carbon sink, we should pay more attention to tropical forests (EBFs) and highlight the importance of water availability.

TI  - Annual Wetland Mapping in Metropolis by Temporal Sample Migration and Random Forest Classification with Time Series Landsat Data and Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands provide various ecosystem services to urban areas, which are crucial for sustainable urban management. With intensified urbanization, there has been marked loss of urban natural wetland, degradation, and related urban disasters in the past several decades. Rapid and accurate mapping of urban wetland extent and change is thus critical for improving urban planning toward sustainability. Here, we have developed a rapid method for continuous mapping of urban wetlands (MUW) by combining automatic sample migration and the random forest algorithm (SM&RF), the so-called MUW_SM&RF. Using time series Landsat images, annual training samples were generated through spectral angular distance (SAD) and time series analysis. Combined with the RF algorithm, annual wetland maps in urban areas were derived. Employing the Google Earth Engine platform (GEE), the MUW_SM&RF was evaluated in four metropolitan areas in different geographical and climatic regions of China from 1990 to 2020, including Tianjin, Hangzhou, Guangzhou, and Wuhan. In all four study areas, the generated annual wetland maps had an overall accuracy of over 87% and a Kappa coefficient above 0.815. Compared with previously published datasets, the urban wetland areas derived using the MUW_SM&RF approach achieved improved accuracy and thus demonstrated its robustness for rapid mapping of urban wetlands. Urban wetlands in all four cities had variable distribution patterns and showed significantly decreased trends in the past three decades. The annual urban wetland data product generated by the MUW_SM&RF can provide invaluable information for sustainable urban planning and management, so as for assessment related to the United Nation's sustainable development goals.

TI  - Exploring the Optimal Feature Combination of Tree Species Classification by Fusing Multi-Feature and Multi-Temporal Sentinel-2 Data in Changbai Mountain
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tree species classification is crucial for forest resource investigation and management. Remote sensing images can provide monitoring information on the spatial distribution of tree species and multi-feature fusion can improve the classification accuracy of tree species. However, different features will play their own unique role. Therefore, considering various related factors about the growth of tree species such as spectrum information, texture structure, vegetation phenology, and topography environment, we fused multi-feature and multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data, which combines spectral features with three other types of features. We combined different feature-combinations with the random forest method to classify Changbai Mountain tree species. Results indicate that topographic features participate in tree species classification with higher accuracy and more efficiency than phenological features and texture features, and the elevation factor possesses the highest importance through the Mean Decrease in Gini (MDG) method. Finally, we estimated the area of the target tree species and analyzed the spatial distribution characteristics by overlay analysis of the Classification 3 result and topographic features (elevation, slope, and aspect). Our findings emphasize that topographic factors have a great influence on the distribution of forest resources and provide the basis for forest resource investigation.

TI  - Random Forest Winter Wheat Extraction Algorithm Based on Spatial Features of Neighborhood Samples
T2  - MATHEMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to effectively obtain the winter wheat growing area in a large part of the Guanzhong plain, this paper proposes a random forest Guanzhong plain winter wheat extraction algorithm based on spatial features of neighborhood samples using the 250 m resolution spectral imager (MERSI) of the FY-3 satellite as the data source. In this paper, first, the training and validation samples were obtained by constructing a neighborhood sample space sampling model, then the study area was classified using an integrated learning random forest Classifier, and finally the classification data obtained from different time phases were fused using voting game theory to obtain the final classification result map. The land use change and winter wheat distribution change from 2011 to 2014 were also analyzed. The experimental results showed that the overall accuracy of winter wheat obtained after random forest fusion processing was the highest compared with the traditional algorithm, reaching 98.63%. At the same time, LANDSAT 8 images were used to obtain the distribution of winter wheat, and the distribution areas obtained from MERSI data and LANDSAT 8 images were generally consistent in terms of spatial distribution as shown by the distribution areas at the county scale.

TI  - Monitoring Extractive Activity-Induced Surface Subsidence in Highland and Alpine Opencast Coal Mining Areas with Multi-Source Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mining developments in alpine coal mining areas result in slow or rapid ground subsidence, which can lead to melting and collapse of permafrost. This paper integrated unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images and satellite-based SAR interferometry images to monitor intensive surface mining subsidence during reclamation. Digital Surface Model (DSM) acquired from UAV images was first used to evaluate the changes of the reclamation scheme on the microtopography carried out by slope and the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of difference (DoD). The monitoring results showed that the slope had been reduced from over 30 degrees to under 15 degrees after the terrain had been reshaped. The DoD map revealed the distribution of main extraction areas and landfill areas. To further monitor the surface subsidence after local terrain adjustment, the Permanent Scatterer Interferometry (PS-InSAR) method was used to reveal the surface subsidence characteristics of the mine site before and after reclamation. The maximum cumulative subsidence ranged from -772.3 to 1183 mm based on 21 Sentinel-1A images in three years. Within a year of terrain reshaping, uplift and subsidence still occurred at hills and pit side slopes, following the nearly equal subsidence rate. The experimental results showed that the slope reshaping and vegetation recovery had a limited impact on the reduction of the ground subsidence in a short period. Therefore, on this basis, a combination of UAV and PS-InSAR methods can be used to continue monitoring time series subsidence in alpine mines.

TI  - Multi-Scale LBP Texture Feature Learning Network for Remote Sensing Interpretation of Land Desertification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land desertification is a major challenge to global sustainable development. Therefore, the timely and accurate monitoring of the land desertification status can provide scientific decision support for desertification control. The existing automatic interpretation methods are affected by factors such as "same spectrum different matter", "different spectrum same object", staggered distribution of desertification areas, and wide ranges of ground objects. We propose an automatic interpretation method for the remote sensing of land desertification that incorporates multi-scale local binary pattern (MSLBP) and spectral features based on the above issues. First, a multi-scale convolutional LBP feature extraction network is designed to obtain the spatial texture features of remote sensing images and fuse them with spectral features to enhance the feature representation capability of the model. Then, considering the continuity of the distribution of the same kind of ground objects in local space, we designed an adaptive median filtering method to process the probability map of the extreme learning machine (ELM) classifier output to improve the classification accuracy. Four typical datasets were developed using GF-1 multispectral imagery with the Horqin Left Wing Rear Banner as the study area. Experimental results on four datasets show that the proposed method solves the problem of ill classification and omission in classifying the remote sensing images of desertification, effectively suppresses the effects of "homospectrum" and "heterospectrum", and significantly improves the accuracy of the remote sensing interpretation of land desertification.

T2  - ANNALS OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Imageology uses high-throughput and automatic computing methods to transform medical image data into quantitative data with feature space, and then makes accurate quantitative analysis, extracts features and builds models, which can intuitively observe the overall features of lesions and the surrounding tissues, and provide rich invisible information. At present, the research on the imaging features of dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) to predict the molecular typing value has achieved results, but the imaging model based on DWI and DCE-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is not enough to predict the molecular subtypes, and the prediction value of the prediction model based on the three-dimensional volume of interest of the lesion to the four molecular subtypes of breast cancer has not been fully studied.Methods: The clinical data of 202 breast cancer patients at our hospital from October 2020 to November 2021 were collected. All patients were examined with multimodal MRI before surgery. Base on immunohistochemical recombinant Ki-67 protein (Ki-67), estrogen receptor (ER), human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) and progesterone receptor (PR) results, the tumors were divided into four types According to the results of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsies, the patients were divided into SLN (+) and SLN (-) groups. 3-dimensional (3D) Slicer software was used to outline the region of interest (ROI), and AMni-Kinetics software was used for feature extraction. The imaging characteristics were screened using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)-Logistic regression model using R statistical software, and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was drawn using "pROC" software package to evaluate the prediction efficiency of the model.Results: The most efficacious model at predicting SLN (+) in breast cancer patients with different molecular subtypes and SLN metastasis was the model based on the imageological characteristics of fat inhibition, and T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), T1-weighted imaging + C (T1WI-C), and DWI combined sequences at the tumor + 2 mm periphery. AUC (sensitivity, specificity) of the validation group were 0.831 (0.856, 0.891), 0.832 (0.660, 0.877), 0.801 (0.772, 0.765), 0.904 (0.769, 0.873), and 0.819 (0.810, 0.500) respectively when the tumor was 2 mm around the tumor.Conclusions: The imaging features extracted from multi-parameter DWI, T1WI+C, and T2WI in breast cancer have certain value at predicting different molecular types and SLNs of breast cancer.

TI  - Inversion of Leaf Area Index Based on GF-6 WFV Spectral Vegetation Index Model
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Agriculture is not only the basic pillar of national economic development but also the basic social development industry. With the progress and development of agricultural remote sensing technology in China, many remote sensing satellites, such as Gaofen-1, 2 and 6, have been launched, providing important technical support for agricultural situation monitoring, crop growth and agricultural industrial structure adjustment in China. Agricultural remote sensing has become an important means of agricultural science and technology innovation and precision agriculture. LAI is an important key index that can be used to measure vegetation canopy's physiological and biochemical characteristics. LAI can not only be used to evaluate the initial energy exchange on the surface of the vegetation canopy but also provide corresponding quantitative structural data and reflect the spectral energy information of the vegetation canopy. At the same time, the leaf area index is a key input to the production model of the terrestrial ecosystem and land use process in the context of terrestrial climate change. In addition, when it is found that the vegetation canopy is directly or indirectly affected by human activities and climate change, LAI is also a very important measurement standard for terrestrial ecosystems to cope with climate change. There are few kinds of researches on leaf area index inversion of GF-6 WFV remote sensing image, and the traditional spectral vegetation index model has a weak mechanism and stability. This article is based on GF-6 WFV remote sensing image in the Luancheng county as the experimental zone. Through spectral vegetation index and the measured leaf area index structure of 5 kinds of traditional spectral vegetation index model and 15 kinds of red edge of ratooning buds to participate in the spectrum of the vegetation index model inversion leaf area index, evaluating model using R2 and RMSE. At the same time, using the actual leaf area index was not involved in the modeling, model and using the MODIS LAI product authentication model. The experimental results showed that: (1) Correlation analysis showed that, on the whole, 20 spectral vegetation indexes were significantly correlated with LAI, with the correlation coefficient above 0. 4, and the spectral index correlation of red-edge participating structures was higher than that of non-red-edge participating structures, among which NDSI had the best correlation. (2) Fitting analysis showed that, on the whole, 20 spectral vegetation indexes had a better fitting effect with LAI, among which NDS13 had the highest fitting accuracy, R2 was 0. 803, and RMSE were 0. 301 2. R2 and RMSE was 0. 803 and 0. 301 2, respectively. (3) As seen from the spatial distribution of inversion maps, the inversion results were in line with the actual local situation. (4) The verified model of measured LAI showed that the overall LAI fitting of measured LAI and NDSI3 model inversion is good, with R2 and RMSE of 0. 804 and 0. 312 5 respectively, indicating that this model can effectively invert the growth status of maize at the milk stage. (5) The verification model of MODIS LAI products indicated that the LAI of MODIS mean it is higher than the LAI of GF-6, mainly due to the serious mixing of MODIS image pixels and the low spatial resolution. In summary, GF-6 WFV has a strong ability to invert LAI, and the spectral vegetation index model with red edges in its image can effectively invert LAI at the milk stage, providing a basis for maize growth potential monitoring.

AB  - With the continuous improvement of living standards, residents' requirements for urban vegetation are also increasing. Urban vegetation has become one of the important criteria to measure the livability of cities and plays a very important role in assessing and protecting urban biodiversity. Therefore, rational planning of urban vegetation is an important means of solving environmental problems and improve the quality of life. To sum up, monitoring urban vegetation becomes the main task, and the extraction of urban vegetation becomes the top priority. At present, the problems of urban vegetation extraction mainly focus on two aspects. Vegetation extraction is affected by region and species. On the other hand, Vegetation extraction is affected by topography and the shadow of buildings. In order to solve the above problems, this paper proposes a red edge-near infrared vegetation index model based on DEM. In this experiment, worldView-3 remote sensing images with red-edge bands and high spectral and spatial resolution after radiation calibration and atmospheric correction were first selected. Then, according to the high sensitivity of the Red Edge band to vegetation and the good correlation between the spectral data within the red edge and the parameters reflecting vegetation growth, the DEM model and the spectral difference between the red edge were adopted to remove the shadow of terrain and buildings effectively. Finally, the red-border spectrum-near-infrared spectrum is constructed based on the feature space within the visible band, and the red-border near-infrared vegetation Index model is constructed. At the same time, the urban vegetation extraction is compared and analyzed with NDVI and EVI. The analysis methods are qualitative and quantitative. The former is to extract vegetation images for visual analysis by using a real vegetation image reference map and model. The latter is a quantitative analysis using user accuracy, producer accuracy, overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient. The result of the qualitative experiment shows that the DEM model can effectively remove the shadow of buildings and terrain by combining with the different information of the red edge band between shadow and vegetation. After removing the shadows, NDVI and EVI were used to extract urban vegetation from the images, which made the buildings and road pixels confused in the vegetation, resulting in the problem of misclassification and omission. However, RENVI can effectively eliminate the confusion between shadow pixels and vegetation pixels, accurately extract urban vegetation, reduce redundancy, and increase vegetation index information. The quantitative experimental results show that the RENVI model can accurately extract urban vegetation compared with NDVI and RVI. The overall accuracy of the 3 images is 89% 81. 4% and 91. 8% respectively, and the Kappa coefficient is 0. 852 8, 0. 791 3 and 0. 905 2 respectively. In summer, this method can effectively improve the extraction precision of urban vegetation and obtain a better visual effect of extraction.

TI  - Response of Land Use and Net Primary Productivity to Coal Mining: A Case Study of Huainan City and Its Mining Areas
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The terrestrial ecosystem carbon cycle is essential to the global carbon cycle. Mining activities have seriously damaged the terrestrial ecosystem and destroyed the carbon sequestration ability of vegetation, which is of great significance to studying the effect of coal mining on land structure change and carbon sink function in cities and mining areas. However, the existing research lacks the targeted analysis of the carbon sink level of the mining area combined with the mining data. Based on the coal-mining information, land-use data, and MODIS NPP data, this study analyzed the spatio-temporal change characteristics of land use and NPP in Huainan City and its mining areas from 2001 to 2020. The results showed that: (1) 22.5% of the land types in the mining area have changed, much higher than 3.2% in Huainan; 40.08 km(2) of the cropland in the mining area has been transformed into waterbodies, seriously affecting regional food security. (2) NPP fluctuates with rainfall, has a weak correlation with temperature, and is restricted by coal-mining factors. The average NPP of most coal mines is significantly lower than that of non-mining areas. The NPP of Huainan City showed an overall growth trend of 2.20 g/(m(2) x a), which was much higher than the average value of 0.43 g/(m(2) x a) in the mining area. Especially in the Guqiao mine, the difference in NPPslope before and after mining was as high as 16.92 g/(m(2) x a). (3) The probability integral method was used to estimate that 195.16 km(2) of land in Huainan would be damaged by mining in 2020. The distribution of damage degree was negatively correlated with NPPslope, slope, which meant the more serious the damage was, the less NPPslope was. This study revealed the characteristics of land-use change and NPP spatio-temporal response in resource-based cities and mining-disturbed areas. It quantitatively estimated the impact of mining activities on regional carbon sink function. It can provide theory and data support for mining areas to carry out ecological protection and restoration, improve the environmental service function of resource-based cities, and formulate sustainable development strategies.

TI  - Variation characteristics of normalized difference vegetation index in Northwestern Sichuan Plateau and its response to extreme climate during 2001-2020
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - The northwestern Sichuan Plateau is a typical eco-climate sensitive area, where vegetation condition is closely related to climate change. We used the MODIS-NDVI and the meteorological data during 2001 -2020 to investigate the change trend of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the mechanism underlying its responses to climate factors in the growing season of northwestern Sichuan Plateau by using the methods of maximum value composite, geodetector model, trend analysis, and correlation analysis. The results showed that vegetation coverage in northwestern Sichuan Plateau was overall good during the study period. 86.8% of the regional vegetation was stable, 12.6% of the regional NDVI was weakly and continuously increasing, and 0.6% of the regional NDVI was decreasing. The ecological environment of the whole region exhibited a steady and good development trend. The vegetation coverage in the study area exhibited apparent spatial variation with a general tendency of increase from southwest to northeast, as well as obvious variation with elevation. The NDVI rose with elevation below 1350 m, varied slightly from 1350 to 3650 m, dropped from 3650 to 5900 m, with a rapid drop between 4750 to 5900 m. There was almost no vegetation above 5900 m. The NDVI of northwestern Sichuan Plateau was affected by the interactions of natural factors. Thermal factors were the dominant climate factors, including monthly maximum value of daily maximum temperature, monthly minimum value of daily minimum temperature, growing season length, annual mean temperature, mean temperature over the growing season. All these factors were positively correlated with ND VI excepted for monthly maximum value of daily maximum temperature. The response of NDVI to temperature index was higher than that of precipitation index. Under the background of climate warming, extreme temperature warming index played a major role in promoting the growth and improvement of vegetation in northwestern Sichuan Plateau, especially in high-altitude areas.

TI  - Deformation monitoring and evaluation of unstable slope based on ground-based and spaceborne SAR images
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground-based and spaceborne interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) were combined to monitor slope deformation and analyze the main influencing factors of an unstable slope on the right bank of the Dajinchuan River in Danba County, Sichuan Province, China. We applied the small baseline subset time series strategy with 656 ground-based radar scenes acquired in September 13 to 17, 2019, and 62 Sentinel-1 InSAR scenes from July, 2018, to October, 2020. The qualitative and quantitative deformation features of the unstable slope were studied, and the possible influencing factors contributing to slope instability, including the geological structure, topography, external environment, and human activities, were discussed. The area of maximum deformation detected by the ground-based radar is located in the bedrock above the target area with a maximum cumulative deformation of more than 30 mm during the observation period, whereas the maximum deformation rate detected by spaceborne InSAR exceeds 40 mm/year. The differences between these results were analyzed, and the reasons were discussed. We provide references and suggestions for investigating potential landslide risks by combining ground-based with spaceborne InSAR. (C) 2022 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Monitoring Surface Water Inundation of Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake in China Using Sentinel-1 SAR Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-temporal-resolution inundation maps play an important role in surface water monitoring, especially in lake sites where water bodies change tremendously. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) that guarantees a full time-series in monitoring surface water due to its cloud-penetrating capability is preferred in practice. To date, the methods of extracting and analyzing inundation maps of lake sites have been widely discussed, but the method of extracting surface water maps refined by inundation frequency map and the distinction of inundation frequency map from different datasets have not been fully explored. In this study, we leveraged the Google Earth Engine platform to compare and evaluate the effects of a method combining a histogram-based algorithm with a temporal-filtering algorithm in order to obtain high-quality surface water maps. Both algorithms were conducted on Sentinel-1 images over Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake, the two largest lakes in China, respectively. High spatiotemporal time-series analyses of both lakes were implemented between 2017 and 2021, while the inundation frequency maps extracted from Sentinel-1 data were compared with those extracted from Landsat images. It was found that Sentinel-1 can monitor water inundation with a substantially higher accuracy, although minor differences were found between the two sites, with the overall accuracy for Poyang Lake (95.38-98.69%) being higher than that of Dongting Lake (95.05-97.5%). The minimum and maximum water areas for five years were 1232.96 km(2) and 3828.36 km(2) in Poyang Lake, and 624.7 km(2) and 2189.17 km(2) in Dongting Lake. Poyang Lake was frequently inundated with 553.03 km(2) of permanent water and 3361.39 km(2) of seasonal water while Dongting Lake was less frequently inundated with 320.09 km(2) of permanent water and 2224.53 km(2) of seasonal water. The inundation frequency maps from different data sources had R-2 values higher than 0.8, but there were still significant differences between them. The overall inundation frequency values of the Sentinel-1 inundation frequency maps were lower than those of the Landsat inundation frequency maps due to the severe contamination from cloud cover in Landsat imagery, which should be paid attention in practical application.

TI  - Temporal and Spatial Changes in Vegetation Ecological Quality and Driving Mechanism in Kokyar Project Area from 2000 to 2021
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The "Kokyar Greening Project" in the suburb of Aksu, Xinjiang, is a model of large-area artificial afforestation in an environment of drought and water scarcity. As an important part of the "3-North Shelter Forest Program", it plays an important role in promoting the economic development and the environmentally friendly construction of Aksu and even of the whole Xinjiang region. Based on multisource remote-sensing data and meteorological observation data, this study explored the temporal and spatial changes in the vegetation parameters (FVC, NPP, and VEQI) and the ecological parameters (RSEI and LULC) in the Kokyar Project Area from 2000 to 2021. Based on the Theil-Sen median and TSS-RESTREND, this study investigated the path of mutual influence among the FVC, NPP, VEQI, and RSEI, as well as their responses to climate change and human activities. The results show that: (1) from 2000 to 2021, the FVC, NPP, VEQI, and RSEI in the Kokyar Project Area showed a significant upward trend and showed the distribution characteristics of "high in the south and low in the north". (2) Over the past 22 years, the RSEI has shown a significant increase with the FVC, NPP and VEQI (p < 0.001), indicating that the "Kokyar Greening Project" has achieved significant ecological benefits. (3) The changes in the vegetation parameters and RSEI in the Kokyar Project Area were dominated by human activities. (4) The Kokyar Project Area has caused great changes to the ecosystem pattern of the region, and the vegetation parameters and RSEI in the Kokyar Project Area have increased, mainly in the form of cropland and grassland expansion over the past 22 years.

TI  - Dynamics of the stream-lake transitional zone affect littoral lake metabolism
T2  - AQUATIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake ecosystems, as integrators of watershed and climate stressors, are sentinels of change. However, there is an inherent time-lag between stressors and whole-lake response. Aquatic metabolism, including gross primary production (GPP) and respiration (R), of stream-lake transitional zones may bridge the time-lag of lake response to allochthonous inputs. In this study, we used high-frequency dissolved oxygen data and inverse modeling to estimate daily rates of summer epilimnetic GPP and R in a nutrient-limited oligotrophic lake at two littoral sites located near different major inflows and at a pelagic site. We examined the relative importance of stream variables in comparison to meteorological and in-lake predictors of GPP and R. One of the inflow streams was substantially warmer than the other and primarily entered the lake's epilimnion, whereas the colder stream primarily mixed into the metalimnion or hypolimnion. Maximum GPP and R rates were 0.2-2.5 mg O-2 L-1 day(-1) (9-670%) higher at littoral sites than the pelagic site. Ensemble machine learning analyses revealed that > 30% of variability in daily littoral zone GPP and R was attributable to stream depth and stream-lake transitional zone mixing metrics. The warm-stream inflow likely stimulated littoral GPP and R, while the cold-stream inflow only stimulated littoral zone GPP and R when mixing with the epilimnion. The higher GPP and R observed near inflows in our study may provide a sentinel-of-the-sentinel signal, bridging the time-lag between stream inputs and in-lake processing, enabling an earlier indication of whole-lake response to upstream stressors.

TI  - Enhancing the Accuracy of Land Cover Classification by Airborne LiDAR Data and WorldView-2 Satellite Imagery
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Full Waveform LiDAR system has been developed and used commercially all over the world. It acts to record the complete time of a laser pulse and has a high-resolution sampling interval compared to the traditional multiple-echo LiDAR, which only provides signals within a single target range. This study area mainly collects data from Riegl LMS-Q680i Full Waveform LiDAR and WorldView-2 satellite imagery, which focuses on buildings, vegetation, grassland, asphalt roads and other ground types as the surface objects. The amplitude and pulse width are selected as waveform basic parameters. The parameter of topography is slope, and the height classification parameters of the test ground are 0-0.5 m, 0.5-2.5 m, and 2.5 m. To eliminate noise, the neighborhood average is applied on the LiDAR parameter values and analyzed as the classification accuracy comparison. This survey uses Decision Tree as the classification method. Comparing the data between neighborhood average and non-neighborhood average, the data classification accuracy improves by 7%, and Kappa improves by 5.92%. NDVI image data are utilized to distinguish the artificial from natural ground. The results show that the neighborhood average with previous data can improve the classification accuracy by 5%, and Kappa improves by 4.25%. By adding NIR-2 of WorldView-2 satellite imagery to the neighborhood average analysis, the overall classification accuracy is improved by 2%, and the Kappa value by 1.21%. This article shows that utilizing the analysis of neighborhood average and image parameters can effectively improve the classification accuracy of land covers.

TI  - Estimating Irrigation Water Consumption Using Machine Learning and Remote Sensing Data in Kansas High Plains
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater-based irrigation has dramatically expanded over the past decades. It has important implications for terrestrial water, energy fluxes, and food production, as well as local to regional climates. However, irrigation water use is hard to monitor at large scales due to various constraints, including the high cost of metering equipment installation and maintenance, privacy issues, and the presence of illegal or unregistered wells. This study estimates irrigation water amounts using machine learning to integrate in situ pumping records, remote sensing products, and climate data in the Kansas High Plains. We use a random forest regression to estimate the annual irrigation water amount at a reprojected spatial resolution of 6 km based on various data, including remotely sensed vegetation indices and evapotranspiration (ET), land cover, near-surface meteorological forcing, and a satellite-derived irrigation map. In addition, we assess the value of ECOSTRESS ET products for irrigation water use estimation and compare with the baseline results by using MODIS ET. The random forest regression model can capture the temporal and spatial variability of irrigation amounts with a satisfactory accuracy (R-2 = 0.82). It performs reasonably well when it is calibrated on the western portion of the study area and tested on the eastern portion that receives more rain than the western one, suggesting its potential transferability to other regions. ECSOTRESS ET and MODIS ET yield a similar irrigation estimation accuracy.

TI  - Mapping Dominant Tree Species of German Forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The knowledge of tree species distribution at a national scale provides benefits for forest management practices and decision making for site-adapted tree species selection. An accurate assignment of tree species in relation to their location allows conclusions about potential resilience or vulnerability to biotic and abiotic factors. Identifying areas at risk helps the long-term strategy of forest conversion towards a natural, diverse, and climate-resilient forest. In the framework of the national forest inventory (NFI) in Germany, data on forest tree species are collected in sample plots, but there is a lack of a full coverage map of the tree species distribution. The NFI data were used to train and test a machine-learning approach that classifies a dense Sentinel-2 time series with the result of a dominant tree species map of German forests with seven main tree species classes. The test of the model's accuracy for the forest type classification showed a weighted average F1-score for deciduous tree species (Beech, Oak, Larch, and Other Broadleaf) between 0.77 and 0.91 and for non-deciduous tree species (Spruce, Pine, and Douglas fir) between 0.85 and 0.94. Two additional plausibility checks with independent forest stand inventories and statistics from the NFI show conclusive agreement. The results are provided to the public via a web-based interactive map, in order to initiate a broad discussion about the potential and limitations of satellite-supported forest management.

TI  - Using Filter Media and Soiled Bedding in Disposable Individually Ventilated Cages as a Refinement to Specific Pathogen-free Mouse Health Monitoring Programs
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR LABORATORY ANIMAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Molecular-based methods have shown potential for improving pathogen detection and reducing animal use. While increasing evidence supports rodent-free environmental health PCR pathogen detection, limited information is available regarding efficacy for disposable individually ventilated caging systems. In such systems, testing of plenum exhaust air dust is ineffective, and the use of collection media is optimal. We performed a series of studies to compare PCR infectious agent detection with dust collected on media placed in a mouse-free soiled bedding cage, the cage exhaust filter of an occupied sentinel cage, and direct sampling from colony and sentinel mice with traditional soiled bedding mouse sentinels. We hypothesized that after a 3-mo period, testing of filter media agitated in a soiled bedding cage would be equal to or more sensitive than more traditional methods. Agitated media detected Astrovirus-1, segmented filamentous bacteria and Helicobacter ganmani to a degree comparable to testing lid exhaust filter PCR from a sentinel mouse cage, but opportunists such as Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus mirabilis were not detected consistently, and H. hepaticus was not detected at all. Direct sampling of pooled fecal pellets and body swabs from sentinel mice and testing using PCR also failed to reliably detect opportunists and Helicobacter spp. While further work is needed to refine use of filter media in soiled bedding for detection of lower prevalence opportunists, this report provides evidence that a rodent-free method of reliably detecting murine agents in a disposable individually ventilated cage system with cage-level filtration outperforms direct sampling of soiled bedding sentinel mice.

TI  - Dense Oil Tank Detection and Classification via YOLOX-TR Network in Large-Scale SAR Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil storage tank detection and classification in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images play a vital role in monitoring energy distribution and consumption. Due to the SAR side-looking imaging geometry and multibouncing scattering mechanism, dense oil tank detection and classification tasks have faced more challenges, such as overlapping, blurred contours, and geometric distortion, especially for small-sized tanks. To address the above issues, this paper proposes YOLOX-TR, an improved YOLOX based on the Transformer encoder and structural reparameterized VGG-like (RepVGG) blocks, to achieve end-to-end oil tank detection and classification in densely arranged areas of large-scale SAR images. Based on YOLOX, the Transformer encoder, a self-attention-based architecture, is integrated to enhance the representation of feature maps and capture the region of interest of oil tanks in densely distributed scenarios. Furthermore, RepVGG blocks are employed to reparameterize the backbone with multibranch typologies to strengthen the distinguishable feature extraction of multi-scale oil tanks without increasing computation in inference time. Eventually, comprehensive experiments based on a Gaofen-3 1 m oil tank dataset (OTD) demonstrated the effectiveness of the Transformer encoder and RepVGG blocks, as well as the performance superiority of YOLOX-TR with a mAP and mAP(0.5) of 60.8% and 94.8%, respectively.

TI  - An Advanced Framework for Multi-Scale Forest Structural Parameter Estimations Based on UAS-LiDAR and Sentinel-2 Satellite Imagery in Forest Plantations of Northern China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Regarded as a marked category of global forests, forest plantations not only have great significance for the development of the global economy, but also contribute ecological and social benefits. The accurate acquisition of the multi-scale (from individual tree to landscape level) and near-real-time information of structural parameters in plantations is the premise of decision-making in sustainable management for the whole forest farm, and it is also the basis for the evaluation of forest productivity in stands. The development and synergetic applications of multi-source and multi-platform remote sensing technology provide a technical basis for the highly accurate estimation of multi-scale forest structural parameters. In this study, we developed an advanced framework for estimating these parameters of forest plantations in multiple scales (individual tree, plot and landscape levels) based on the Unmanned Aircraft System Light Detection and Ranging (UAS-LiDAR) transects and wall-to-wall Sentinel-2 imagery, combined with the sample plot data in a typical forest farm plantation (mainly Larch, Chinese pine) of Northern China. The position and height of individual trees within the plots were extracted by the LiDAR-based point cloud segmentation (PCS) algorithm, and then different approaches to the extrapolation of forest structural parameters from the plot to landscape level were assessed. The results demonstrate that, firstly, the individual tree height obtained by PCS was of relatively high accuracy (rRMSE = 1.5-3.3%); secondly, the accuracy of the forest structure parameters of the sample plot scale estimated by UAS-LiDAR is rRMSE = 4.4-10.6%; and thirdly, the accuracy of the two-stage upscaling approach by UAS-LiDAR transects as an intermediate stage (rRMSE = 14.5-20.2%) performed better than the direct usage of Sentinel-2 data (rRMSE = 22.9-27.3%). This study demonstrated an advanced framework for creating datasets of multi-scale forest structural parameters in a forest plantation, and proved that the synergetic usage of UAS-LiDAR transects and full coverage medium-resolution satellite imagery can provide a high-precision and low-cost technical basis for the multi-level estimation of forest structural parameters.

TI  - Investigation of the Sensitivity of Microwave Land Surface Emissivity to Soil Texture in MLEM
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyzes the spectral characteristics of desert surface emissivity according to soil classification and the influence of mineral materials and soil texture information using simulation results from the microwave land emissivity model (MLEM). It also aims at exploring the feasibility of reducing the simulation error in MLEM by refining the soil classification characteristic parameters (such as soil composition content, distribution of particle size, etc.). The surface emissivity of the Taklimakan Desert is derived, to our knowledge for the first time, from FY-3B/MWRI (FengYun-3B Microwave Radiation Imager), and then the spectral characteristics of the study area for different soil types are further analyzed according to soil classification. In addition, emissivity spectra of the four most widely mineral materials in the desert area are reproduced using an MLEM under different conditions. Results showed that microwave land emissivity is highly correlated with the soil type and changes are markedly affected by the soil water content, soil texture, mineral composition, and soil particle size. For the desert soil, the emissivity of horizontal/vertical polarization is affected by the frequency in those soils dominated by large-size particles. However, for those dominated by smaller particles, the surface emissivity is almost constant or appears to be somehow dependent on the frequency. Moreover, the season effect on emissivity characteristics is clear, especially for soils composed of small-size particles. The emissivity of horizontal polarization shows stronger seasonal variation than that of vertical polarization. The study findings also showed that refining soil texture information (soil component content, distribution of particle size) improves the simulation accuracy in desert areas. For example, for the soil dominated by clay and clay loam, the simulation error is reduced from 6-9% to less than 6%. The latter is evident, especially for soil types containing a large number of small particles, such as clay and clay loam, for which the simulation error is reduced. All in all, our study contributes to a better understanding of the influencing factors of soil texture and stratification of the near-surface soil, helping to improve microwave land surface emissivity prediction by the studied here model. As MLEM consists of an important part of the global meteorological data assimilation and weather forecast system, results can also help towards increasing the use of satellite data in desert areas and in improving the accuracy of numerical weather forecast models.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Evolution of a Typical Sandstorm Event in an Arid Area of Northwest China in April 2018 Based on Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Northwest China is significantly affected by sandstorm disasters. To mitigate the negative impacts of sandstorm events, it is critical to understand the spatio-temporal variations in typical sand and dust storms and their influencing factors. In this work, using ground-based measurements of particulate matter and remote sensing data such as MODIS, OMI, and CALIPSO data, the sources of aerosol pollution and aerosol optical properties of a typical sandstorm event that occurred in Northwest China in 2018 was studied. In addition, the HYSPLIT model was used to explore the air mass trajectories in order to analyze the sand and dust migration process during the sandstorm event. Furthermore, the wind erosion sensitivity of Northwest China was analyzed via single factor analysis and multi-factor superposition of wind field intensity, soil drought index, vegetation coverage, and relief amplitude. Finally, the region of the study area having a high comprehensive wind erosion sensitivity was identified. The results showed that the PM10 concentrations exceeded 400 mu g/m(3) and the PM2.5/PM10 ratio did not exceeded 0.6 during the sandstorm event, indicating that natural particulate matter was dominant in the ambient air. At the epicenter of pollution, the aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 550 nm was 0.75-1. By combining AOD data with wind speed and direction data from field observation stations, it was found that the sandstorm event in 2018 mainly occurred between 1 April and 3 April, and affected all of Northwest China on 2 April and 3 April. The absorbed aerosol index (AAI) ranged between 2.5 and 4, indicating that the Taklimakan Desert was the main source of sandstorm events in Northwest China. The CALIPSO total attenuated backscatter coefficient at 532 nm indicated that the main component of tropospheric aerosol in this region was distributed in the range of 0-12.5 km. The simulated airflow track showed that it had the same dust source regions as AAI index studies. Moreover, investigation of wind erosion sensitivity in the study areas indicated that the Taklimakan Desert and other desert regions were the main ecologically sensitive areas. These conclusions can provide references and suggestions for the mitigation of damage caused by sandstorm events, in addition to the enhancement of ecological governance.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Changes in Ecological Quality and Its Associated Driving Factors in Central Asia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Maintaining the ecological security of arid Central Asia (CA) is essential for the sustainable development of arid CA. Based on the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data stored on the Google Earth Engine (GEE), this paper investigated the spatiotemporal changes and factors related to ecological environment quality (EEQ) in CA from 2000 to 2020 using the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI). The RSEI values in CA during 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020 were 0.379, 0.376, 0.349, 0.360, and 0.327, respectively; the unchanged/improved/deteriorated areas during 2000-2005, 2005-2010, 2010-2015, and 2015-2020 were about 83.21/7.66%/9.13%, 77.28/6.68%/16.04%, 79.03/11.99%/8.98%, and 81.29/2.16%/16.55%, respectively, which indicated that the EEQ of CA was poor and presented a trend of gradual deterioration. Consistent with the RSEI trend, Moran's I index values in 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020 were 0.905, 0.893, 0.901, 0.898, and 0.884, respectively, revealing that the spatial distribution of the EEQ was clustered rather than random. The high-high (H-H) areas were mainly located in mountainous areas, and the low-low (L-L) areas were mainly distributed in deserts. Significant regions were mainly located in H-H and L-L, and most reached the significance level of 0.01, indicating that EEQ exhibited strong correlation. The EEQ in CA is affected by both natural and human factors. Among the natural factors, greenness and wetness promoted the EEQ, while heat and dryness reduced the EEQ, and heat had greater effects than the other three indexes. Human factors such as population growth, overgrazing, and hydropower development are important factors affecting the EEQ. This study provides important data for environmental protection and regional planning in arid and semi-arid regions.

TI  - An Improved Submerged Mangrove Recognition Index-Based Method for Mapping Mangrove Forests by Removing the Disturbance of Tidal Dynamics and <i>S. alterniflora</i>
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, it is a great challenge for remote sensing technology to accurately map mangrove forests owing to periodic inundation. A submerged mangrove recognition index (SMRI) using two high- and low-tide images was recently proposed to remove the influence of tides and identify mangrove forests. However, when the tidal height of the selected low-tide image is not at the lowest tidal level, the corresponding SMRI does not function well, which results in mangrove forests below the low tidal height being undetected. Furthermore, Spartina alterniflora Loisel (S. alterniflora) was introduced to China in 1979 and rapidly spread to become the most serious invasive plant along the Chinese coastline. The current SMRI has failed to distinguish S. alterniflora from submerged mangrove forests because of their similar spectral signatures. In this study, an SMRI-based mangrove forest mapping method was developed using the time series of Sentinel-2 images to mitigate the two aforementioned issues. In the proposed method, quantile synthesis was applied to the time series of Sentinel-2 images to generate a lowest-tide synthetic image for creating SMRI to identify submerged mangrove forests. Unsubmerged mangrove forests were classified using a support vector machine, and a preliminary mangrove forest map was created by merging them. In addition, S. alterniflora was distinguished from the mangrove forests by analyzing their phenological differences. Finally, mangrove forest mapping was performed by masking S. alterniflora. The proposed method was applied to the entire coastline of the Guangxi Province, China. The results showed that it can reliably and accurately identify submerged mangrove forests derived from SMRI by synthesizing low- and high-tide images using quantile synthesis, and the differentiation of S. alterniflora using phenological differences results in more accurate mangrove mapping. This work helps to improve the accuracy of mangrove forest mapping using SMRI and its feasibility for coastal wetland monitoring. It also provides data for sustainable management, ecological protection, and restoration of vegetation in coastal zones.

TI  - Identification of Urban Green Space Types and Estimation of Above-Ground Biomass Using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - High-quality urban green space supports the healthy functioning of urban ecosystems. This study aimed to rapidly assess the distribution, and accurately estimate the above-ground biomass, of urban green space using remote sensing methods, thus providing a better understanding of the urban ecological environment in Xuzhou for more effective management. We performed urban green space classifications and compared the performance of Sentinel-2 MSI data and Sentinel-1 SAR data and combinations, for estimating above-ground biomass, using field data from Xuzhou, China. The results showed the following: (1) incorporating an object-oriented method and random forest algorithm to extract urban green space information was effective; (2) compared with stepwise regression models with single-source data, biomass estimation models based on multi-source data provide higher estimation accuracy (R-2 = 0.77 for coniferous forest, R-2 = 0.76 for shrub-grass vegetation, R-2 = 0.75 for broadleaf forest); and (3) from 2016 to 2021, urban green space coverage in Xuzhou decreased, while the total above-ground biomass increased, with higher average above-ground biomass in broadleaf forests (133.71 tons/ha) compared to coniferous forests (92.13 tons/ha) and shrub-grass vegetation (21.65 tons/ha). Our study provides an example of automated classification and above-ground biomass mapping for urban green space using multi-source data and facilitates urban eco-management.

TI  - Rupture Process of the 2017 Mw 6.3 Earthquake in Jinghe, Northwest China, Constrained by GNSS, InSAR, and Teleseismic Waveforms
T2  - SEISMOLOGICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Jinghe, Xinjiang, earthquake on 8 August 2017 is not only one of the largest events that happened along the north Tien Shan but also the first Mw> 6 event that received adequate seismic and geodetic observations in this region, providing a rare chance to gain insights into the faults that bound the Tien Shan. A previous rupture model (Zhang et al., 2020) was built based on a hypothesis of a north-dipping seismogenic fault, but field geological mapping suggests the fault to be south dipping. Different fault geometry would result in different rupture scenarios. Here, we reconstructed the coseismic ground deformation with Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) observations and Sentinel-1A interferograms, modeled the rupture process on the geologically consistent and teleseismic P waveforms. Our results demonstrate that this earthquake occurred on a ramp fault buried under the foothills of the north Tien Shan, with strike of 86.8?? and dip of 46??. The unidirectional coseismic rupture extended 20 km along strike and down to a depth of 20 km with an average rupture velocity around 1.9 km/s. Primary slip occurred within 3???7 s after the rupture initiation with a peak of 0.38 m. This event released 3:78 ?? 1018 N??m seismic moment, corresponding to Mw 6.31. Modeling the interseismic deformation shows that the seismogenic fault of the 2017 Jinghe event absorbs about 5.2 ?? 1.0 mm/yr crustal shortening between the Junngar basin and the north Tien Shan. The recurrence interval for earthquakes of the same magnitude as the 2017 Jinghe earthquake is estimated to be 73 ?? 14 yr based on the coseismic slip and interseismic slip rate.

TI  - Soil Moisture Retrieval Using SAR Backscattering Ratio Method during the Crop Growing Season
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture content (SMC) is an indispensable basic element for crop growth and development in agricultural production. Obtaining accurate information on SMC in real time over large agricultural areas has important guiding significance for crop yield estimation and production management. In this study, the paper reports on the retrieval of SMC from RADARSAT-2 polarimetric SAR data. The proposed SMC retrieval algorithm includes vegetation correction based on a ratio method and roughness correction based on the optimal roughness method. Three vegetation description parameters (i.e., RVI, LAI, and NDVI) serve as vegetation descriptors in the parameterization of the algorithm. To testify the vegetation correction result of the algorithm, the water cloud model (WCM) was compared with the algorithm. The calibrated integrated equation model (CIEM) was employed to describe the backscattering from the underlying soil. To improve the accuracy of SMC retrieval, the CIEM model was optimized by using the optimal roughness parameter and the normalization method of reference incidence angle. Validation against ground measurements showed a high correlation between the measured and estimated SMC when the NDVI serves as vegetation descriptor (R-2 = 0.68, RMSE = 4.15 vol.%, p < 0.01). The overall estimation performance of the proposed SMC retrieval algorithm is better than that of the WCM. It demonstrates that the proposed algorithm has an operational potential to estimate SMC over wheat fields during the growing season.

TI  - Data reconstruction of daily MODIS chlorophyll-a concentration and spatio-temporal variations in the Northwestern Pacific
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea surface chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) is a key proxy for phytoplankton biomass. Spatio-temporal continuous Chl-a data are important to understand the mechanisms of chlorophyll occurrence and development and track phytoplankton changes. However, the greatest challenge in utilizing daily Chl-a data is massive missing pixels due to orbital position and cloud coverage. This study proposes the application of a spatial filling method using the machine learning-based Extreme Gradient Boosting (BST) to reconstruct missing pixels of daily MODIS Chl-a data from 2007 to 2018. The approach is applied to different trophic biogeographical subregions of the Northwestern Pacific where it has complex phytoplankton dynamics and frequent data missing. Various environmental variables are taken into consideration, including meteorological forcing, geographic and topographic features, and oceanic physical components. The BST-reconstructed Chl-a (BST Chl-a) is validated using in-situ Chl-a measurements, VIIRS and Himawari8 Chl-a products. The results show that the BST model is highly adaptive in reconstructing Chl-a data, and it performs well in pelagic, offshore and coastal with the best performance in pelagic. BST Chl-a improves coverage without significant quality degradation compared to the original MODIS Chl-a. BST Chl-a agrees better with in-situ data than that of MODIS, with CC of 0.742, RMSE of 0.247, MAE of 0.202 and Bias of 0.089. Cross-satellite validation using VIIRS and Himawari-8 Chl-a also shows promising results with the CC of 0.861 and 0.765, respectively, suggesting the high accuracy of BST Chl-a. The inter-annual trend of BST Chl-a decreases in coastal and increases in offshore

TI  - Settlement Prediction of Reclaimed Coastal Airports with InSAR Observation: A Case Study of the Xiamen Xiang'an International Airport, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Many coastal cities reclaim land from the sea to meet the rapidly growing demand for land caused by population growth and economic development. Settlement in reclaimed land may delay construction and even damage infrastructures, so accurately predicting the settlement over reclaimed areas is important. However, the limited settlement observation and ambiguous final settlement estimation affect accurate settlement prediction in traditional methods. This study proposes a new strategy to solve these problems by using the Multitemporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (MT-InSAR) method and takes the Xiamen Xiang'an International Airport, built on reclaimed land, as an example. The MT-InSAR is adopted to process the Sentinel-1 images to obtain the settlement history of the study area. The results show that settlement mainly occurs in the reclaimed areas, with the maximum average settlement rate exceeding 40 mm/y. We use the statistical properties of curve fitting to choose the best curve model from several candidate curve models to predict the settlement time series. The Asaoka method is used to identify the critical state between settlement and stability. We predict the consolidation time of the whole study area and reveal that the deformation rate is positively correlated with the consolidation time. The maximum remaining settlement time is over ten years since 24 December 2019. Therefore, manual compaction operations can be carried out to speed up settlement in the areas that need a long time to consolidate. The proposed method can be used to predict the settlement of similar reclaimed areas, and the predicted results can provide a reference for engineering construction.

TI  - Identification of forest vegetation types in southern China based on spatio-temporal fusion of GF-1 WFV and MODIS data
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - It is difficult to obtain long time series of high spatial resolution remote sensing images in southern China because of the complex terrain and frequent cloudy and rainy weather. In contrast, the spatio-temporal fusion can sychonorously obtain remote sensing data with high spatialtemporal resolution, which is beneficial to extract forest vegetation type information. With Xingguo County of Jiangxi Province as the study area, we fused the Landsat8 OLI and GF-1 WFV images with high spatial resolution with high temporal resolution of MODIS09 Al image on the basis of enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (ESTARFM), reconstructed the time series data of ESTARFM _ Landsat8 EVI and ESTARFM _GF-1 EVI with 8 d step of enhanced vegetation index (EVI), obtained the phenology ( PH) characteristics, and identified the forest vegetation types by using random forest classification model. The results showed that the correlation coefficients between the fusion data of ESTARFM_Landsat8 EVI and ESTARFM_GF-1 EVI and the real images were all greater than 0.7, and had good consistency in spatial distribution, which could be used to supplement the missing data with high spatial resolution. The extraction accuracy of random forest classification with different combination modes was EVI+PH>EVI>PH and the classification accuracy of fusion data GF-1 was higher than that of Landsat8. A total of 43 variables were selected as the optimal feature variables for classification. The overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient were 95.6% and 94.9%, respectively, including 37 sequential EVI values and 6 phenological feature information. The sequential EVI data contributed more to the identification of forest vegetation types, while the phenological feature information was beneficial to improve the classification accuracy. The ESTARFM fusion algorithm was suitable for GF-1 and MODIS data, which could solve the problem of insufficient long-term sequence of high spatial resolution images. The GF-1 temporal fusion images had high accuracy in the identification of forest vegetation types in southern China under complex terrain and frequent cloudy and rainy weather.

TI  - Research on the Applicability of DInSAR, Stacking-InSAR and SBAS-InSAR for Mining Region Subsidence Detection in the Datong Coalfield
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Intensive and large-scale underground coal mining has caused geological disasters such as local ground subsidence, cracks and collapse in the Datong coalfield, China, inducing serious threats to local residents. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) has the capability of surface deformation detection with high precision in vast mountainous areas. DInSAR, stacking-InSAR and SBAS-InSAR are commonly used InSAR-related deformation analysis methods. They can provide effective support for mine ecological security monitoring and prevent disasters. We use the three methods to conduct the deformation observation experiments in the Datong coalfield. Sentinel-1A data from November 2020 to October 2021 are used. As a result, a total of 256 deformations in the Datong coalfield were successfully detected by the three methods, of which 218 are mining deformations, accounting for 85% of the total deformations. By comparing the results of the three methods, we found that DInSAR, stacking-InSAR, and SBAS-InSAR detected 130, 256, and 226 deformations in the Datong coalfield, respectively, while the deformations caused by coal mining were 128, 218, and 190. DInSAR results with long spatiotemporal baselines are seriously incoherent. SBAS-InSAR results of displacement rate are more precise than stacking-InSAR, and the mean standard deviation is 1.0 mm/a. However, for areas with lush vegetation or low coherence, SBAS-InSAR has poor performance. The detection deformation area results of DInSAR and SBAS-InSAR are subsets of stacking-InSAR. The displacement rates obtained by stacking-InSAR and SBAS-InSAR are consistent; the mean difference in the displacement rate between the two methods is 2.7 mm/a, and the standard deviation is 5.1 mm/a. The mining deformation locations and their shapes in the study area can be identified with high efficiency and power by stacking-InSAR. Therefore, with a comprehensive understanding of the advantages and limitations of the three methods, stacking-InSAR can be an effective and fast method to identify the level, location and range of mining deformation in lush mountainous areas.

TI  - Monitoring Regional-Scale Surface Deformation of the Continuous Permafrost in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau with Time-Series InSAR Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As an important indicator of permafrost degradation, surface deformation is often used to monitor the thawing and freezing process in the permafrost active layer. However, due to the large area of the continuous permafrost of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) and the large amount of data processed by conventional time-series InSAR, previous studies have mostly focused on local area investigations, and regional characteristics of surface deformation of the continuous permafrost area on the QTP are still unclear. In this paper, we characterized surface deformation in space and time over the main continuous permafrost area on the QTP, by analyzing 11 ascending and 8 descending orbits of Sentinel-1 SAR data acquired between 2018 and 2021 with the time-series InSAR processing system LiCSAR. The reliability of the InSAR deformation results was verified by a combination of leveling measurement data, the intercomparison of overlapping area results, and field verification. The results show that the permafrost regions of the central QTP exhibited the most significant linear subsidence trend. The subsidence trend of permafrost on the QTP was mainly related to the thermal stability of permafrost, and the regions with larger subsidence rates were concentrated in sub-stable, transitional and unstable permafrost areas. We also found that, according to analysis of time-series displacement, the beginning and ending times of permafrost thawing were highly spatially heterogeneous, with the time of maximum thawing depth varying between mid-October and mid-November, which was probably attributed to the active layer thickness (ALT), water content in the active layer, and vegetation cover in these regions. This study is of great significance for understanding the changing trend of permafrost on the QTP under the background of climate change. In addition, this study also demonstrates that combination of Sentinel-1 SAR images with the LiCSAR system has significant potential for detecting permafrost deformation with high accuracy and high efficiency at regional and global scales.

TI  - Mapping the Levels of Soil Salination and Alkalization by Integrating Machining Learning Methods and Soil-Forming Factors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate updating of soil salination and alkalization maps based on remote sensing images and machining learning methods plays an essential role in food security, biodiversity, and desertification. However, there is still a lack of research on using machine learning, especially one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (CNN)s, and soil-forming factors to classify the salinization and alkalization degree. As a case study, the study estimated the soil salination and alkalization by Random forests (RF) and CNN based on the 88 observations and 16 environmental covariates in Da'an city, China. The results show that: the RF model (accuracy = 0.67, precision = 0.67 for soil salination) with the synthetic minority oversampling technique performed better than CNN. Salinity and vegetation spectral indexes played the most crucial roles in soil salinization and alkalinization estimation in Songnen Plain. The spatial distribution derived from the RF model shows that from the 1980s to 2021, soil salinization and alkalization areas increased at an annual rate of 1.40% and 0.86%, respectively, and the size of very high salinization and alkalization was expanding. The degree and change rate of soil salinization and alkalization under various land-use types followed mash > salinate soil > grassland > dry land and forest. This study provides a reference for rapid mapping, evaluating, and managing soil salinization and alkalization in arid areas.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Characteristics and Heterogeneity of Vegetation Phenology in the Yangtze River Delta
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation phenology and its spatiotemporal driving factors are essential to reflect global climate change, the surface carbon cycle and regional ecology, and further quantitative studies on spatiotemporal heterogeneity and its two-way driving are needed. Based on MODIS phenology, meteorology, land cover and other data from 2001 to 2019, this paper analyzes the phenology change characteristics of the Yangtze River Delta from three dimensions: time, plane space and elevation. Then, the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of phenology and its driving factors are explored with random forest and geographic detector methods. The results show that (1) the advance of start of season (SOS) is insignificant-with 0.17 days per year; the end of season (EOS) shows a significant delay-0.48 days per year. The preseason temperature has a greater contribution to SOS, while preseason precipitation is main factor in determining EOS. (2) Spatial differences of the phenological index do not strictly obey the change rules of latitude at a provincial scale. The SOS of Jiangsu and Anhui is earlier than that of Zhejiang and Shanghai, and EOS shows an obvious double-clustering phenomenon. In addition, a divergent response of EOS with elevation grades is found; the most significant changes are observed at grades below 100 m. (3) Land cover (LC) type is a major factor of the spatial heterogeneity of phenology, and its change may also be one of the insignificant factors driving the interannual change of phenology. Furthermore, nighttime land surface temperature (NLST) has a relatively larger contribution to the spatial heterogeneity in non-core urban areas, but population density (PD) contributes little. These findings could provide a new perspective on phenology and its complex interactions between natural or anthropogenic factors.

TI  - A Novel Topography Retrieval Algorithm Based on Single-Pass Polarimetric SAR Data and Terrain Dependent Error Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) data provide an alternative way for topography retrieval, especially when limited PolSAR data are available. This article proposes a novel topography retrieval algorithm based on the Lambertian backscatter model that further improves the vertical precision of digital elevation model (DEM) generation and requires only one flight. The key idea of the proposed algorithm is to avoid data fluctuations caused by the ratio of the azimuth slope angle to the polarimetric orientation angle (POA). The previous research has confirmed the feasibility of generating a DEM based on single-pass PolSAR data, but its effect on the quality of reference DEM has not been well-explained. To analyze this effect, a large number of experiments on DEM with different resolutions are conducted. In addition, an in-depth analysis of non-linear and terrain-dependent errors is performed. The L-band PolSAR data of NASA/JPL TOPSAR and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 and interferometric SAR (InSAR) DEM data are used to verify the proposed algorithm. The experimental results show that PolSAR data can be used as an additional reliable information source for DEM fusion under certain conditions to improve the quality of public DEM.

TI  - Google Earth Engine and Artificial Intelligence (AI): A Comprehensive Review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Remote sensing (RS) plays an important role gathering data in many critical domains (e.g., global climate change, risk assessment and vulnerability reduction of natural hazards, resilience of ecosystems, and urban planning). Retrieving, managing, and analyzing large amounts of RS imagery poses substantial challenges. Google Earth Engine (GEE) provides a scalable, cloud-based, geospatial retrieval and processing platform. GEE also provides access to the vast majority of freely available, public, multi-temporal RS data and offers free cloud-based computational power for geospatial data analysis. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods are a critical enabling technology to automating the interpretation of RS imagery, particularly on object-based domains, so the integration of AI methods into GEE represents a promising path towards operationalizing automated RS-based monitoring programs. In this article, we provide a systematic review of relevant literature to identify recent research that incorporates AI methods in GEE. We then discuss some of the major challenges of integrating GEE and AI and identify several priorities for future research. We developed an interactive web application designed to allow readers to intuitively and dynamically review the publications included in this literature review.

TI  - Contributions of Various Sources to the Higher-Concentration Center of CO within the ASM Anticyclone Based on GEOS-Chem Simulations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite observations show that carbon monoxide (CO) concentration centers exist in the tropopause region of the Tibetan Plateau, while their sources and formation mechanism still remain uncertain. In this paper, the 3-D chemical transport model GEOS-Chem is used to conduct sensitivity analysis in 2016. Combined with the analysis data and satellite data, the contribution of three important emission sources (South Asia, East Asia and Southeast Asia) and two important chemical reaction species (CH4 and nonmethane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs)) to CO in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) are studied. The results show that in the Asian monsoon region CO emissions originating from the surface are transported to the upper troposphere via a deep convection process and then enter the Asian Summer Monsoon (ASM) anticyclone. The strong ASM anticyclone isolates the mixing process of air inside and outside the anticyclone, upon entry of carbon monoxide-rich air. In the lower stratosphere, the intensity of the ASM anticyclone declines and the air within the anticyclone flows southwestward with monsoon circulation. We found that in the summer Asian monsoon region, South Asia exhibited the highest carbon monoxide concentration transported to the UTLS. CH4 imposed the greatest influence on the CO concentration in the UTLS region. According to the model simulation results, the CO concentrations in the Asian monsoon region at 100 hPa altitudes were higher than those in other regions at the same latitudes. Regarding effects, 43.18% originated from CH4 chemical reactions, 20.81% originated from NMVOC chemical reactions, and 63.33% originated from surface CO emissions, while sinks yielded a negative contribution of -27.32%. Regarding surface CO emissions, East Asia contributed 13.56%, South Asia contributed 39.27%, and Southeast Asia contributed 7.15%.

TI  - Multi-Category Segmentation of Sentinel-2 Images Based on the Swin UNet Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Medium-resolution remote sensing satellites have provided a large amount of long time series and full coverage data for Earth surface monitoring. However, the different objects may have similar spectral values and the same objects may have different spectral values, which makes it difficult to improve the classification accuracy. Semantic segmentation of remote sensing images is greatly facilitated via deep learning methods. For medium-resolution remote sensing images, the convolutional neural network-based model does not achieve good results due to its limited field of perception. The fast-emerging vision transformer method with self-attentively capturing global features well provides a new solution for medium-resolution remote sensing image segmentation. In this paper, a new multi-class segmentation method is proposed for medium-resolution remote sensing images based on the improved Swin UNet model as a pure transformer model and a new pre-processing, and the image enhancement method and spectral selection module are designed to achieve better accuracy. Finally, 10-categories segmentation is conducted with 10-m resolution Sentinel-2 MSI (Multi-Spectral Imager) images, which is compared with other traditional convolutional neural network-based models (DeepLabV3+ and U-Net with different backbone networks, including VGG, ResNet50, MobileNet, and Xception) with the same sample data, and results show higher Mean Intersection Over Union (MIOU) (72.06%) and better accuracy (89.77%) performance. The vision transformer method has great potential for medium-resolution remote sensing image segmentation tasks.

TI  - Machine Learning Techniques for Phenology Assessment of Sugarcane Using Conjunctive SAR and Optical Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop phenology monitoring is a necessary action for precision agriculture. Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites provide us with the opportunity to monitor crop phenology at a high spatial resolution with high accuracy. The main objective of this study was to examine the potential of the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data and their combination for monitoring sugarcane phenological stages and evaluate the temporal behaviour of Sentinel-1 parameters and Sentinel-2 indices. Seven machine learning models, namely logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, artificial neural network, support vector machine, naive Bayes, and fuzzy rule based systems, were implemented, and their predictive performance was compared. Accuracy, precision, specificity, sensitivity or recall, F score, area under curve of receiver operating characteristic and kappa value were used as performance metrics. The research was carried out in the Indo-Gangetic alluvial plains in the districts of Hisar and Jind, Haryana, India. The Sentinel-1 backscatters and parameters VV, alpha and anisotropy and, among Sentinel-2 indices, normalized difference vegetation index and weighted difference vegetation index were found to be the most important features for predicting sugarcane phenology. The accuracy of models ranged from 40 to 60%, 56 to 84% and 76 to 88% for Sentinel-1 data, Sentinel-2 data and combined data, respectively. Area under the ROC curve and kappa values also supported the supremacy of the combined use of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. This study infers that combined Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data are more efficient in predicting sugarcane phenology than Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 alone.

TI  - Land Surface Temperature Regulation Ecosystem Service: A Case Study of Jaipur, India, and the Urban Island of Jhalana Reserve Forest
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Although Land Surface Temperatures (LSTs) are on the rise globally, the distribution of LSTs varies depending on the land cover type. Urban Heat Island and Urban Cool Island effects act differently, especially in semi-arid regions. Therefore, we identify demi-decadal, seasonal, and zonal differences in LSTs in a semi-arid region in the city of Jaipur, where zones include rural and urban areas that encircle the Jhalana Reserve Forest (JRF). After deriving LSTs from remotely sensed thermal bands of Landsat satellites' Multi-spectral datasets, we found that there is a significant difference in LST (p < 0.01) among the zones. In addition, LSTs were found to be significantly lower in JRF compared to Urban and Rural areas in all seasons and all study years, which indicates the urban cooling effect due to the presence of the forest. Nevertheless, summer LSTs have warmed with a mean difference of 4.8 degrees C between 2000 and 2020. Therefore, our study supports the promotion of Urban Forests, especially in semi-arid zones, for inculcating LST regulation ecosystem services to enrich and enhance the standard of living of the human population.

TI  - Image Classification and Land Cover Mapping Using Sentinel-2 Imagery: Optimization of SVM Parameters
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use/cover (LU/LC) classification provides proxies of the natural and social processes related to urban development, providing stakeholders with crucial information. Remotely sensed images combined with supervised classification are common to define land use, but high-performance classifiers remain difficult to achieve, due to the presence of model hyperparameters. Conventional approaches rely on manual adjustment, which is time consuming and often unsatisfying. Therefore, the goal of this study has been to optimize the parameters of the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm for the generation of land use/cover maps from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery in selected humid and arid (three study sites each) climatic regions of Iran. For supervised SVM classification, we optimized two important parameters (gamma in kernel function and penalty parameter) of the LU/LC classification. Using the radial basis function (RBF) of the SVM classification method, we examined seven values for both parameters ranging from 0.001 to 1000. For both climate types, the penalty parameters (PP) showed a direct relationship with overall accuracy (OA). Statistical results confirmed that in humid study regions, LU/LC maps produced with a penalty parameter >100 were more accurate. However, for regions with arid climates, LU/LC maps with a penalty parameter >0.1 were more accurate. Mapping accuracy for both climate types was sensitive to the penalty parameter. In contrast, variations of the gamma values in the kernel function had no effect on the accuracy of the LU/LC maps in either of the climate zones. These new findings on SVM image classification are directly applicable to LU/LC for planning and environmental and natural resource management.

TI  - Mapping Asbestos-Cement Corrugated Roofing Tiles with Imagery Cube via Machine Learning in Taiwan
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Locating and calculating the number of asbestos-cement corrugated roofing tiles is the first step in the demolition process. In this work, archived image cubes of Taiwan served as the fundamental data source used via machine learning approach to identify the existence of asbestos-cement corrugated roofing tiles with more than 85% accuracy. An adequate quantity of ground-truth data covering all the types of roofs via aerial hyperspectral scan was the key to success for this study. Twenty randomly picked samples from the ground-truth group were examined by X-ray refraction detection to ensure correct identification of asbestos-cement corrugated roofing tiles with remote sensing. To improve the classifying accuracy ratio, two different machine learning algorithms were applied to gather the target layers individually using the same universal training model established from 400 ground-truth samples. The agreement portions within the overlapping layers of these two approaches were labeled as the potential targets, and the pixel growth technique was performed to detect the roofing boundary and create the polygon layer with size information. Exacting images from aerial photos within the chosen polygon were compared to up-to-date Sentinel-1 images to find the temporal disagreements and remove the mismatched buildings, identified as non-asbestos roofs, from the database to reflect the actual condition of present data. This automatic matching could be easily performed by machine learning to resolve the information lag while using archived data, which is an essential issue when detecting targets with non-simultaneous acquired images over a large area. To meet the 85% kappa accuracy requirement, the recurring processes were applied to find the optimal parameters of the machine learning model. Meanwhile, this study found that the support vector machine method was easier to handle, and the convolution neuro network method offered better accuracy in automatic classification with a universal training model for vast areas. This work demonstrated a feasible approach using low-cost and low-resolution archived images to automatically detect the existence of asbestos-cement corrugated roofing tiles over large regions. The entire work was completed within 16 months for an area of 36,000 km(2), and the detected number of asbestos-cement corrugated roofing tiles was more than three times the initial estimation by statistics method from two small-area field surveys.

TI  - Retrieval of Remotely Sensed Sediment Grain Size Evolution Characteristics along the Southwest Coast of Laizhou Bay Based on Support Vector Machine Learning
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Grain size is the basic property of intertidal zone sediment. Grain size acts as an indicator of sedimentary processes and geomorphological evolution under human and nature interactions. The remote sensing technique provides an alternative for sediment grain-size parameter monitoring with the advantages of wide coverage and real-time surveying. This paper attempted to map the distributions of three sediment grain size contents and the mean grain size with multitemporal Landsat images along the southwestern coast of Laizhou Bay, China, from 1989 to 2015. Considering the low correlations between the measured reflectance and grain-size parameters, we used a support vector machine (SVM) to develop a nonlinear calibration model by taking several band indices as input variables. Then, the performance of the back propagation neural network (BPNN) was determined and discussed with that of the SVM. The SVM performed better than the BPNN in calibrating the four grain-size parameters based on a comparison of R-2 and the root-mean-square error (RMSE). Moreover, an atmospheric correction algorithm originally proposed for case II water enabled the TM\ETM+ images to be precisely atmospherically corrected in this study. The SVM-mapped spatial-temporal grain-size variation showed a coarsening trend, which agreed with that obtained during in situ measurements in a former study. The changes in Yellow River discharge and precipitation associated with the coarsening trend were further analyzed. The yielded results showed that the coarsening trend and reduction in tidal flat area might be aggravated with overutilization. More reasonable planning would be necessary in this case.

TI  - Multi-Resolution Collaborative Fusion of SAR, Multispectral and Hyperspectral Images for Coastal Wetlands Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The hyperspectral, multispectral, and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing images provide complementary advantages in high spectral resolution, high spatial resolution, and geometric and polarimetric properties, generally. How to effectively integrate cross-modal information to obtain a high spatial resolution hyperspectral image with the characteristics of the SAR is promising. However, due to divergent imaging mechanisms of modalities, existing SAR and optical image fusion techniques generally remain limited due to the spectral or spatial distortions, especially for complex surface features such as coastal wetlands. This paper provides, for the first time, an efficient multi-resolution collaborative fusion method for multispectral, hyperspectral, and SAR images. We improve generic multi-resolution analysis with spectral-spatial weighted modulation and spectral compensation to achieve minimal spectral loss. The backscattering gradients of SAR are guided to fuse, which is calculated from saliency gradients with edge preserving. The experiments were performed on ZiYuan-1 02D (ZY-1 02D) and GaoFen-5B (AHSI) hyperspectral, Sentinel-2 and GaoFen-5B (VIMI) multispectral, and Sentinel-1 SAR images in the challenging coastal wetlands. Specifically, the fusion results were comprehensively tested and verified on the qualitative, quantitative, and classification metrics. The experimental results show the competitive performance of the proposed method.

TI  - The Use of UAV-Acquired Multiband Images for Detecting Rockfall-Induced Injuries at Tree Crown Level
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we present an identification of rockfall-injured trees based on multiband images obtained by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). A survey with a multispectral camera was performed on three rockfall sites with versatile tree species (Fagus sylvatica L., Larix decidua Mill., Pinus sylvestris L., Picea abies (L.) Karsten, and Abies alba Mill.) and with different characterizations of rockfalls and rockfall-induced injuries. At one site, rockfall injuries were induced in the same year as the survey. At the second site, they were induced one year after the initial injuries, and at the third site, they were induced six years after the first injuries. At one site, surveys were performed three years in a row. Multiband images were used to extract different vegetation indices (VIs) at the tree crown level and were further studied to see which VIs can identify the injured trees and how successfully. A total of 14 VIs were considered, including individual multispectral bands (green, red, red edge, and near-infrared) by using regression models to differentiate between the injured and uninjured groups for a single year and for three consecutive years. The same model was also used for VI differentiations among the recorded injury groups and size of the injuries. The identification of injured trees based on VIs was possible at the sites where rockfall injuries were induced at least one year before the UAV survey, and they could still be identifiable six years after the initial injuries. At the site where injuries were induced only four months before the UAV survey, the identification of injured trees was not possible. VIs that could explain the largest variability (R-2 > 0.3) between injured and uninjured trees were: inverse ratio index (IRVI), green-red vegetation index (GRVI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized ratio index (NRVI), and ratio vegetation index (RVI). RVI was the most successful, explaining 40% of the variance at two sites. R-2 values only increased by a few percentages (up to 10%) when the VIs of injured trees were observed over a period of three years and mostly did not change significantly, thus not indicating if the vitality of the trees increased or decreased. Differentiation among the injured groups did not show promising results, while, on the other hand, there was a strong correlation between the VI values (RVI) and the size of the injury according to the basal area of the trees (so-called injury index). Both in the case of broadleaves and conifers at two sites, the R-2 achieved a value of 0.82. The presented results indicate that the UAV-acquired multiband images at the tree crown level can be used for surveying rockfall protection forests in order to monitor their vitality, which is crucial for maintaining the protective effect through time and space.

M3  - Article
AB  - The study focuses on the problem of the formation of the cultural image of youth in the space of fashion. The most prominent trends in the development of youth fashion in this regard and the problems rising under the influence of mass culture are analyzed. The provided problematization of the study of youth cultural image by means of fashion examples allows examining the very phenomenon of fashion in a broader socio-cultural context associated not limited to appearance. The manifestations of youth fashion significant for the cultural image of a modern young person are examined according to the most critical components: language and behavioral activity, forms of self-presentation, and value and worldview attitudes. Special significance is attributed to the influence of the modern information environment on the formation of the cultural image of youth and the negative consequences of the influence of fashion on the cultural and moral identity of Russian youth.

TI  - Simulating geomagnetic bird navigation using novel high-resolution geomagnetic data
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Birds rely on precise navigational mechanisms, especially for long-distance migrations. One debated mechanism is their use of the geomagnetic field. It is unclear if and how different species of birds are using intensity or inclination (or both) for navigation. Previous geomagnetic modelling research is based on static geomagnetic data despite a temporally and spatially varying geomagnetic field. Animals supposedly have a high sensitivity to those changes of the geomagnetic field. In order to understand how birds respond in real-time to its temporal variation, we need to use accurate geomagnetic information linked to the position of the bird through co-location in space and time.We developed a data-driven approach to simulate geomagnetic migratory strategies, using, for the first time, accurate contemporaneous geomagnetic data obtained from Swarm satellites of the European Space Agency. We created biased correlated random walk models which were based on both GPS data from greater white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons) during fall migration between north-west Russia and central Europe and contemporaneous satellite geomagnetic data. Different strategies of geomagnetic navigation associated with different geomagnetic values were translated into probability surfaces, built from geomagnetic data, and included into the random walk models. To evaluate which strategy was most likely, we compared the measured GPS trajectories to the simulated trajectories using different trajectory similarity measurements. We propose this as an approach to track many bird species for future comparative studies.We found that navigational strategies in these geese using magnetic intensity were closer to the observed data than those using inclination. This was the case in 80% of the best models and is an indication that it should be more beneficial for these geese to use intensity over inclination. Additionally, our results supported results from a previous study, that navigation based on taxis and compass mechanisms were more similar to the observed data than other mechanisms. We therefore suggest that these geese may use a combination of these strategies for navigation at a broad-scale. Overall, it seems likely that for successful navigation to the target location more than one mechanism is necessary; indicating a multifactorial navigation mechanism of these migratory geese in the study area. The satellite geomagnetic data are available at a higher temporal resolution and the use significantly improved the fit of the modelled simulations in comparison to the modelled geomagnetic data. Therefore, using annotated geomagnetic data could greatly improve the modelling of animal geomagnetic navigation in future research.

TI  - Analysis of the dynamic characteristics of the east Guangdong shelf front in the northern South China Sea in summer
T2  - Journal of Tropical Oceanography
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the characteristics of the east Guangdong shelf front and its dynamical regime using in-situ measurements, satellite data, and high resolution simulations by the regional ocean modeling system (ROMS). Observation results show active upwelling thermal fronts with horizontal scale of 50km on the northern shelf of the South China Sea in summer. The horizontal temperature gradient at the front is up to 0.06 degrees Ckm(-1) and is stronger than satellite observed results in the same period. The front can reach 20m depth, and has the characteristics of the order-one Richardson number. Further diagnostic analysis using ROMS model output also show that the horizontal buoyancy gradient is enhanced at the front, with order-one Richardson number, which is favorable for frontal instabilities. High-resolution simulation results indicate that driven by the southwest wind in summer, the Ekman transport across the continental shelf caused by down-front wind, will accumulate cold water of upwellings to the warm water, enhancing the horizontal buoyancy gradient and front sharpness, and change the frontal baroclinicity, which leads to negative Ertel potential vorticity (EPV). As such, the Ekman buoyancy flux caused by summer monsoon may significantly contribute to the formation and instability of the continental front in the northern South China Sea, and it has an important impact on the local dynamic environment.

TI  - Assessment of spatiotemporal dynamics of land and vegetation cover change detection in Maze National Park, Southwest Ethiopia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Biodiversity conservation areas include National Parks which are integral parts of protected areas. In parks, the dynamics of land and vegetation covers are significantly affected by anthropogenic activities and natural factors. These resources are exposed to challenges due to unwise practices. Assessing and monitoring the status of park's natural resources enables us to understand the extent of land and vegetation resources. Few studies have been conducted in Maze National Park (MzNP) but none of them quantified the land and vegetation cover dynamics. The purpose of this study is, therefore, to quantify the extents spatiotemporal dynamics of land and vegetation cover of MzNP using GIS and RS technology considering three decades Landsat images acquired from USGS. GPS and GCPs were collected for the analysis of land cover classification and accuracy assessment, respectively. The trend analysis result revealed that scattered tree and grass land cover area have increased from 19.8% in 1987 to 51.6% in 2019. The area of sparse vegetation cover increased from 19.7% in 2000 to 78.4% in 2019. Highly dense and dense vegetation cover decreased remarkably. Accuracy assessment was 98% and computed Kappa coefficient was 0.97. The results suggested that the extent of MzNP's vegetation cover change was basically due to anthropogenic pressure. This study could be used to alarm responsible bodies to restructure and implement better environmental protection strategies for restoration of the rapidly deteriorating vegetation resource of MzNP.

TI  - Evaluation of FY-3E/HIRAS-II Radiometric Calibration Accuracy Based on OMB Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Before infrared hyperspectral data are used in satellite data assimilation systems or retrieval systems, the quantitative analysis of data deviation is necessary. Based on RTTOV's (Radiative Transfer for TOVS) simulation data of FY-3E/HIRAS-II (Hyperspectral Infrared Atmospheric Sounder) and the observation data of HIRAS-II, we counted the bias of observation minus simulation (OMB) during an on-orbit test; analyzed the characteristics and reasons for the bias from the perspective of the FOV (field of view), the scanning angle of the instrument, the day and night, and the target temperature change; and analyzed the stability of the radiometric calibration accuracy. We also combined the results of the MetOp-C/IASI (infrared atmospheric sounding interferometer), a similar high-precision instrument, with the bias of OMB to compare and evaluate the FY-3E/HIRAS-II radiometric calibration accuracy. In the end, we found that the mean OMB bias of the long-wave and medium-wave infrared bands is within +/- 2 K, and the bias standard deviation is better than 2 K; the bias of each FOV is consistent and the bias of most channels is better than 2 K. The OMB bias of each channel is consistent with the changes in the angle of the instrument. The bias trend of long-wave and medium-wave infrared channels is more consistent with the deviation of the day and night; the bias of the short-wave infrared channel at night is lower than in the daytime. When counting the bias as the target temperature changed, the results showed that there are no obvious temperature dependencies in the long-wave and medium-wave infrared channels. This reflects that the instrument's non-linear effect is well ordered. We further evaluated the stability of the radiometric calibration accuracy through statistics from the OMB standard deviation of each channel of FY-3E/HIRAS-II. Most channel accuracy stability values were better than 0.1 K. We calculated that IASI and HIRAS-II OMB have double differences, and the results show that the double difference in most channels is better than 1 K. It shows that the HIRAS-II and IASI observations are highly consistent. Through the statistics of the OMB bias during the on-orbit test period of FY-3E/HIRAS-II, we fully evaluated its radiometric calibration accuracy and laid the foundation for FY-3E/HIRAS-II data to be used in the retrieval application and assimilation system.

TI  - Estimation of Aboveground Carbon Density of Forests Using Deep Learning and Multisource Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests are crucial in carbon sequestration and oxygen release. An accurate assessment of forest carbon storage is meaningful for Chinese cities to achieve carbon peak and carbon neutrality. For an accurate estimation of regional-scale forest aboveground carbon density, this study applied a Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument (MSI), Advanced Land Observing Satellite 2 (ALOS-2) L-band, and Sentinel-1 C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to estimate and map the forest carbon density. Considering the forest field-inventory data of eastern China from 2018 as an experimental sample, we explored the potential of the deep-learning algorithms convolutional neural network (CNN) and Keras. The results showed that vegetation indices from Sentinel-2, backscatter and texture characters from ALOS-2, and coherence from Sentinel-1 were principal contributors to the forest carbon-density estimation. Furthermore, the CNN model was found to perform better than traditional models. Results of forest carbon-density estimation validated the improvements effectively by combining the optical and radar data. Compared with traditional regression methods, deep learning has a higher potential for accurately estimating forest carbon density using multisource remote-sensing data.

TI  - Crop Identification Based on Multi-Temporal Active and Passive Remote Sensing Images
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Although vegetation index time series from optical images are widely used for crop mapping, it remains difficult to obtain sufficient time-series data because of satellite revisit time and weather in some areas. To address this situation, this paper considered Wen County, Henan Province, Central China as the research area and fused multi-source features such as backscatter coefficient, vegetation index, and time series based on Sentinel-1 and -2 data to identify crops. Through comparative experiments, this paper studied the feasibility of identifying crops with multi-temporal data and fused data. The results showed that the accuracy of multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data increased by 9.2% compared with single-temporal Sentinel-2 data, and the accuracy of multi-temporal fusion data improved by 17.1% and 2.9%, respectively, compared with multi-temporal Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. Multi-temporal data well-characterizes the phenological stages of crop growth, thereby improving the classification accuracy. The fusion of Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar data and Sentinel-2 optical data provide sufficient time-series data for crop identification. This research can provide a reference for crop recognition in precision agriculture.

TI  - A Sensor Bias Correction Method for Reducing the Uncertainty in the Spatiotemporal Fusion of Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the development of multisource satellite platforms and the deepening of remote sensing applications, the growing demand for high-spatial resolution and high-temporal resolution remote sensing images has aroused extensive interest in spatiotemporal fusion research. However, reducing the uncertainty of fusion results caused by sensor inconsistencies and input data preprocessing is one of the challenges in spatiotemporal fusion algorithms. Here, we propose a novel sensor bias correction method to correct the input data of the spatiotemporal fusion model through a machine learning technique learning the bias between different sensors. Taking the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) images with low-spatial resolution (MODIS) and high-spatial resolution (Landsat) as the basic data, we generated the neighborhood gray matrices from the MODIS image and established the image bias pairs of MODIS and Landsat. The light gradient boosting machine (LGBM) regression model was used for the nonlinear fitting of the bias pairs to correct MODIS NDVI images. For three different landscape areas with various spatial heterogeneities, the fusion of the bias-corrected MODIS NDVI and Landsat NDVI was conducted by using the spatiotemporal adaptive reflection fusion model (STARFM) and the flexible spatiotemporal data fusion method (FSDAF), respectively. The results show that the sensor bias correction method can enhance the spatially detailed information in the input data, significantly improve the accuracy and robustness of the spatiotemporal fusion technology, and extend the applicability of the spatiotemporal fusion models.

TI  - Evaluation of Urban Vegetation Phenology Using 250 m MODIS Vegetation Indices
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The dynamics o 'urban vegetation phenology play an important role in influencing human activities. Previous studies have shown high-resolution remote sensing as a tool for urban vegetation mapping, but the low temporal resolution of these data limits their use for phenological modeling. Then fore, it is of great significance to evaluate Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MoDis) imagery for urban vegetation phenology monitoring. Here, we extracted the start and end of growing season (SOS and EOS) in urban ecosystems based on both the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (soig) and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) from the 250 m MODIS vegetation indices product (MOD13Q1). Then the accuracies of the satellite-derived SOS and EOS were evaluated through comparing phenological observations at 18 ground sites. Results showed that SOS was most consistent with the prime of leaf unfolding date and EOS was most consistent with the beginning of leaf coloring date. Overall, Ell was found to have stronger predictive strength than NDVI in detecting urban vegetation phenology in terms of both higher correlation coefficients and lower root-mean-square errors. In addition, the dynamic threshold method was more accurate in deriving SOS, while the double logistic method had relatively higher accuracy in deriving EOS.

TI  - The Impact of Long-Range Transport of Biomass Burning Emissions in Southeast Asia on Southern China
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The long-range transport of biomass burning pollutants from Southeast Asia has a significant impact on air quality in China. In this study, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) fire data and aerosol optical depth (AOD) products and the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) carbon monoxide (CO) data were used to analyze the impact of air pollution caused by biomass burning in Southeast Asia on southern China. Results showed that Yunnan, Guangdong and Guangxi were deeply affected by biomass burning emissions from March to April during 2016-2020. Comparing the data for fires on the Indochinese Peninsula and southern provinces of China, it is obvious that the contribution of pollutants emitted by local biomass burning in China to air pollution is only a small possibility. The distribution of CO showed that the overall emissions increased greatly from March to April, and there was an obvious transmission process. In addition, the MODIS AOD in areas close to the national boundary of China is at a high level (>0.6), and the AOD in the southwest of Guangxi province and the southeast of Yunnan Province is above 0.8. Combined with a typical air pollution event in southern China, the UVAI combined with wind direction and other meteorological data showed that the pollutants were transferred from the Indochinese Peninsula to southern China under the southwest monsoon. The PM2.5 data from ground-based measurements and backward tracking were used to verify the pollutant source of the pollution event, and it was concluded that the degree of pollution in Yunnan, Guangxi and Guangdong provinces was related to the distance from the Indochinese Peninsula. Results indicate that it is necessary to carry out in-depth research on the impact of cross-border air pollution transport on domestic air quality as soon as possible and to actively cooperate with foreign countries to carry out pollution source research and control.

TI  - Prediction of Total Phosphorus Concentration in Macrophytic Lakes Using Chlorophyll-Sensitive Bands: A Case Study of Lake Baiyangdian
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Total phosphorus (TP) is a significant indicator of water eutrophication. As a typical macrophytic lake, Lake Baiyangdian is of considerable importance to the North China Plain's ecosystem. However, the lake's eutrophication is severe, threatening the local ecological environment. The correlation between chlorophyll and TP provides a mechanism for TP prediction. In view of the absorption and reflection characteristics of the chlorophyll concentrations in inland water, we propose a method to predict TP concentration in a macrophytic lake with spectral characteristics dominated by chlorophyll. In this study, water spectra noise is removed by discrete wavelet transform (DWT), and chlorophyll-sensitive bands are selected by gray correlation analysis (GRA). To verify the effectiveness of the chlorophyll-sensitive bands for TP concentration prediction, three different machine learning (ML) algorithms were used to build prediction models, including partial least squares (PLS), random forest (RF) and adaptive boosting (AdaBoost). The results indicate that the PLS model performs well in terms of TP concentration prediction, with the least time consumption: the coefficient of determination (R-2) and root mean square error (RMSE) are 0.821 and 0.028 mg/L in the training dataset, and 0.741 and 0.029 mg/L in the testing dataset, respectively. Compared with the empirical model, the method proposed herein considers the correlation between chlorophyll and TP concentration, as well as a higher accuracy. The results indicate that chlorophyll-sensitive bands are effective for predicting TP concentration.

TI  - Land Subsidence Monitoring Method in Regions of Variable Radar Reflection Characteristics by Integrating PS-InSAR and SBAS-InSAR Techniques
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the InSAR solution, the uneven distribution of permanent scatterer candidates (PSCs) or slowly decoherent filtering phase (SDFP) pixel density in a region of variable radar reflection feature can cause local low accuracy in single interferometry. PSCs with higher-order coherence in Permanent Scatter InSAR (PS-InSAR) are generally distributed in those point targets of urban built-up areas, and SDFP pixels in Small Baseline Subset InSAR (SBAS-InSAR) are generally distributed in those distributed targets of countryside vegetation areas. According to the respective reliability of PS-InSAR and SBAS-InSAR for different radar reflection features, a new land subsidence monitoring method is proposed, which combines PS-SBAS InSAR by data fusion of different interferometry in different radar reflection regions. Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) clustering analysis is carried out on the density of PSCs with higher-order coherence in PS-InSAR processing to zone the region of variable radar reflection features for acquiring the boundary of data fusion. The vector monitoring data of PS-InSAR is retained in the dense region of PSCs with higher-order coherence, and the vector monitoring data of SBAS-InSAR is used in the sparse region of PSCs with higher-order coherence. The vertical displacements from PS-InSAR and SBAS-InSAR are integrated to obtain the optimal land subsidence. The verification case of 38 SAR images acquired by the Sentinel-1A in Suzhou city indicates that the proposed method can automatically choose a matched interferometry technique according to the variability of radar reflection features in the region and improve the accuracy of using a single interferometry method. The integrated method of the combined field is more representative of overall subsidence characteristics than the PS-InSAR-only or SBAS-InSAR-only results, and it is better suited for the assessment of the impact of land subsidence over the study area. The research results of this paper can provide a useful comprehensive reference for city planning and help decrease land subsidence in Suzhou.

TI  - Built-Up Area Mapping for the Greater Bay Area in China from Spaceborne SAR Data Based on the PSDNet and Spatial Statistical Features
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Built-up areas (BAs) information acquisition is essential to urban planning and sustainable development in the Greater Bay Area in China. In this paper, a pseudo-Siamese dense convolutional network, namely PSDNet, is proposed to automatically extract BAs from the spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data in the Greater Bay Area, which considers the spatial statistical features and speckle features in SAR images. The local indicators of spatial association, including Moran's, Geary's, and Getis' together with the speckle divergence feature, are calculated for the SAR data, which can indicate the potential BAs. The amplitude SAR images and the corresponding features are then regarded as the inputs for PSDNet. In this framework, a pseudo-Siamese network can independently learn the BAs discrimination ability from the SAR original amplitude image and the features. The DenseNet is adopted as the backbone network of each channel, which can improve the efficiency while extracting the deep features of the BAs. Moreover, it also has the ability to extract the BAs with multi-scale sizes by using a multi-scale decoder. The Sentinel-1 (S1) SAR data for the Greater Bay Area in China are used for the experimental validation. Our method of BA extraction can achieve above 90% accuracy, which is similar to the current urban extraction product, demonstrating that our method can achieve BA mapping for spaceborne SAR data.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Correlations between Soil pH and NPP of Grassland Ecosystems in the Yellow River Source Area, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, ecological concerns such as vegetation destruction, permafrost deterioration, and river drying have been paid much more attention to on the Yellow River Basin in China. Soil pH is regarded to be the fundamental variable among soil properties for vegetation growth, while net primary productivity (NPP) is also an essential indicator to reflect the healthy growth of vegetation. Due to the limitation of on-site samples, the spatial-temporal variations in soil pH and NPP, as well as their intrinsic mechanisms, remain unknown, especially in the Yellow River source area, China. Therefore, it is imperative to investigate the coupling relationship between soil pH and NPP of the area. The study coupled MODIS reflectance data (MOD09A1) with on-site soil pH to estimate spatial-temporal variations in soil pH, explore the response of NPP to soil pH, and assess the extent to which they contribute to grassland ecosystems, thus helping to fill knowledge gaps. Results indicated that the surface spectral reflectance for seven bands could express the geographic pattern of soil pH by applying a multiple linear regression equation; NPP exhibited an increasing trend while soil pH was the contrary in summer from 2000 to 2021. In summer, NPP was negatively correlated with soil pH and there was a lag effect in the response of NPP to soil pH, revealing a correlation between temperate steppes > montane meadows > alpine meadows > swamps in different grassland ecosystems. In addition, contribution indices for temperate steppes and montane meadows were positive whereas they were negative for swamps and alpine meadows, which are apparent findings. The contribution index of montane and alpine meadows was greater than that of temperate steppes and swamps. The approach of the study can enable managers to easily identify and rehabilitate alkaline soil and provides an important reference and practical value for ecological restoration and sustainable development of grassland ecosystems in alpine regions.

TI  - Grassland Aboveground Biomass Estimation through Assimilating Remote Sensing Data into a Grass Simulation Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Grassland aboveground biomass is crucial for evaluating grassland desertification, degradation, and grassland and livestock balance. Given the lack of understanding of mechanical processes and limited simulation accuracy for grassland aboveground biomass estimation, especially at the regional scale, this study investigates a new method combining remote sensing data assimilation technology and a grassland process-based model to estimate regional grassland biomass, focusing on improving the simulation accuracy by modeling and revealing the mechanism interpretability of grassland growth processes. Xilinhot City of Inner Mongolia was used as the study area. The ModVege model was selected as the grass dynamic simulation model. A likelihood function was constructed composed of the LAI, grassland aboveground biomass, and daily measurements wherein the accumulated temperature reached ST2 (the temperature sum defining the end of reproductive growth). Then, the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methodology was adapted to calibrate the ModVege model by maximizing the likelihood function. The time-series LAI from MOD15A3H was assimilated into the ModVege model, and the model parameters ST2 and BMGV0 (initial biomass and green vegetative tissues, respectively) were optimized at a 500 m pixel scale based on the four-dimensional variational method (4DVar) method. Compared with August 15th, the RMSE and MAPE of aboveground biomass were 242 kg/ha and 10%, respectively, after calibration. Data assimilation improved this accuracy, with the RMSE decreasing to 214 kg/ha. Overall, the aboveground grassland biomass of Xilinhot City shows spatial distribution patterns of high value in the northeast and low value in the central and southeast areas. Generally, the method implemented in this study provides an important reference for the aboveground biomass estimation of regional grassland.

TI  - A mechanistic assessment of urban heat island intensities and drivers across climates
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban heat island effect (UHI) has been widely observed globally, causing climate, health, and energy impacts in cities. The UHI intensities have been found to largely depend on background climate and the properties of the urban fabric. Yet, a complete mechanisticunderstanding of how UHIs develop at a global scale is still missing. Using an urban ecohydrological and land-surface model (urban TethysChloris) in combination with multi-source remote sensing data, we performed simulations for 49 large urban clusters across the Northern Hemisphere in 2009-2019 and analysed how surface and canopy air UHIs (SUHI and CUHI, respectively) develop during day and night. Biophysical drivers triggering the development of SUHIs and CUHIs have similar dependencies on background climate, but with different magnitudes. In humid regions daytime UHIs can be largely explained by the urban-rural difference in evapotranspiration, whereas heat convection and conduction are important in arid areas. Plant irrigation can largely promote daytime urban evapotranspiration only in arid and semi-arid climates.During night, heat conduction from the urban fabric to the environment creates large UHIs mostly in warm arid regions. Overall, this study presents a mechanistic quantification of how UHIs develop worldwide and proposes viable solutions for sustainable climate-sensitive mitigation strategies.

TI  - Predicting Yield Reduction Rates of Frost-Damaged Winter Wheat After Jointing Using Sentinel-2 Broad-Waveband Spectral Indices
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - On the regional scale, the late frost damage to winter wheat after jointing showed a spatial difference which determines that the sub-regional measures against the frost damage should be implemented. Broad-waveband spectral indices based on the Sentinel-2 satellite were proposed in this study to predict yield reduction rates of winter wheat. It is of great significance to disaster assessment and production management decision-making. Based on the artificial frost simulation experiments, the canopy reflectance data measured by ASD FieldSpec (R) 3 spectroradiometer were simulated to the Sentinel-2 wavebands using spectral resampling. And then, the nineteen published spectral indices and three new forms of wavelength random combinations (simple ratio, simple difference, and normalized difference) were used to construct the linear regression models with winter wheat yield reduction rates. In every form, broad-waveband spectral indices with the top three coefficients of determination were selected as the candidate indices. Aiming at the frost event in the Shangqiu area, all candidate indices were calculated using the Sentinel-2 reflectance data and used to predict winter wheat yield reduction rates, which were validated by the measured yields of the ground sampling points. The results indicated that: (1) With the decrease of the treatment temperatures, canopy reflectance shows a decreasing trend in the near-infrared region, but increased in the visible and short-waveband infrared regions. (2) Most of the nineteen published spectral indices were significantly (p<0.001) correlated with yield reduction rates, regardless of whether the canopy reflectance data were before or after resampling. The twelve candidate spectral indices screened out have good linear regression accuracy for predicting the yield reduction rates of winter wheat and the coefficient of determination above 0.631 in the calibration and the validation datasets. (3) The accuracy of candidate spectral indices calculated from sentinel-2 satellite data showed that the three spectral indices, including the band B9 failed to pass the significance test, and the other nine spectral indices all passed the extremely significant test. The two spectral indices (B8a-B12 and B8-B12)based on the combinations of the B8, B8a, and B12 had good accuracy. The coefficient of determination was 0.543 and 0.492, the root means square error was 8.510% and 8.971%, respectively. Further, B8a-B12 and B8-B12 were found to conform to the simple difference form, which was considered the optimal combination of the broad-waveband spectral indices predicting yield reduction rates of winter wheat. The research results revealed that the response mechanism of canopy reflectance at early spike development stage of winter wheat under different low-temperature stress, indicating that Sentinel-2 broad-waveband spectral indices have good accuracy in predicting the yield reduction rate of winter wheat. It is feasible to predict yield reduction rate at a regional scale after frost and has a guiding role in formulating frost disaster measures in different regions.

TI  - A Method for Prediction of Winter Wheat Maturity Date Based on MODIS Time Series and Accumulated Temperature
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate determination of crop phenology is key to field management and decision making. The existing research on phenology based on remote sensing data is mainly phenology monitoring, which cannot realize the prediction of phenology. In this paper, we propose a method to predict the maturity date (MD) of winter wheat based on a combination of phenology monitoring method and accumulated temperature. The method is divided into three steps. First, 2-band Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI2) time series data were generated using the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) reflectance data at 8-day intervals; then, the time series were reconstructed using polynomial fitting and the heading date (HD) of winter wheat was extracted using the maximum method. Secondly, the average cumulative temperature required for winter wheat to go from HD to MD was calculated based on historical phenological data and meteorological data. Finally, the timing of winter wheat HD and the current year's Meteorological Data were combined to predict winter wheat MD. The method was used to predict the MD of winter wheat in Hebei in 2018 and was validated with data from the phenology station and the Modis Land Cover Dynamics (MCD12Q2) product. The results showed that the coefficient of determination (R-2) for predicting MD using this method was 0.48 and 0.74, the root mean square error (RMSE) was 7.03 and 4.91 days, and Bias was 4.93 and -3.59 days, respectively. In summary, the method is capable of predicting winter wheat MD at the regional scale.

TI  - Emergency Monitoring of a Tailings Pond Leakage Accident Based on the GEE Platform
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The utilization of mineral resources plays an important role in supporting and promoting economic development and social progress. As a necessary facility for the development and utilization of mineral resources, tailings ponds will cause a series of safety and environmental problems once accidents occur. Based on the Sentinel-2 images obtained from the GEE (Google Earth Engine) platform, this paper carried out emergency monitoring of the Yichun Luming Mining tailings pond leakage accident on 28 March 2020, through the spectral changes in monitoring points in the downstream rivers of the tailings pond, the changes in the images before and after the accident, and the analysis of long-time series various indexes. The results revealed that the pollution was quickly treated in a short time, and the river spectrum returned to normal on April 13. The pollution spread for approximately 300 km downstream to the Yijimi River and the Hulan River, and was finally intercepted at the Lanxi Old Bridge 67 km away from the Songhua River, so that more serious pollution was avoided. This accident had a direct impact on the surrounding six counties. The decrease in NDVI reflects that the accident has a certain degree of influence on the vegetation around the tailings pond, while the change in NDTI reflects that some remedial measures have been taken for the tailings pond after the accident. This study demonstrates the advantages of the GEE platform for the emergency monitoring of accidents, which can provide a reference for the emergency monitoring of similar accidents.

TI  - Investigating the Impact of Using IR Bands on Early Fire Smoke Detection from Landsat Imagery with a Lightweight CNN Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Smoke plumes are the first things seen from space when wildfires occur. Thus, fire smoke detection is important for early fire detection. Deep Learning (DL) models have been used to detect fire smoke in satellite imagery for fire detection. However, previous DL-based research only considered lower spatial resolution sensors (e.g., Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)) and only used the visible (i.e., red, green, blue (RGB)) bands. To contribute towards solutions for early fire smoke detection, we constructed a six-band imagery dataset from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) with a 30-metre spatial resolution. The dataset consists of 1836 images in three classes, namely "Smoke", "Clear", and "Other_aerosol". To prepare for potential on-board-of-small-satellite detection, we designed a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model named "Variant Input Bands for Smoke Detection (VIB_SD)", which achieved competitive accuracy with the state-of-the-art model SAFA, with less than 2% of its number of parameters. We further investigated the impact of using additional Infra-Red (IR) bands on the accuracy of fire smoke detection with VIB_SD by training it with five different band combinations. The results demonstrated that adding the Near-Infra-Red (NIR) band improved prediction accuracy compared with only using the visible bands. Adding both Short-Wave Infra-Red (SWIR) bands can further improve the model performance compared with adding only one SWIR band. The case study showed that the model trained with multispectral bands could effectively detect fire smoke mixed with cloud over small geographic extents.

TI  - Analysis of the Spatial and Temporal Evolution of Land Subsidence in Wuhan, China from 2017 to 2021
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land subsidence is a common geological hazard. Rapid urban expansion has led to different degrees of ground subsidence within Wuhan in the past few years. The novel coronavirus outbreak in 2020 has seriously impacted urban construction and people's lives in Wuhan. Land subsidence in Wuhan has changed greatly with the resumption of work and production. We used 80 Sentinel-1A Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images covering Wuhan to obtain the land subsidence change information of Wuhan from July 2017 to September 2021 by using the small baseline subset interferometric SAR technique. Results show that the subsidence in Wuhan is uneven and concentrated in a few areas, and the maximum subsidence rate reached 57 mm/yr during the study period. Compared with land deformation before 2017, the land subsidence in Wuhan is more obvious after 2020. The most severe area of subsidence is located near Qingling in Hongshan District, with a maximum accumulated subsidence of 90 mm, and obvious subsidence funnels are observed in Qiaokou, Jiangan, Wuchang and Qingshan Districts. The location of subsidence centers in Wuhan is associated with building intensity, and most of the subsidence funnels are formed in connection with urban subway construction and building construction. Carbonate belt and soft ground cover areas are more likely to lead to karst collapse and land subsidence phenomena. Seasonal changes are observed in the land subsidence in Wuhan. A large amount of rainfall can replenish groundwater resources and reduce the rate of land subsidence. The change in water level in the Yangtze River has a certain impact on the land subsidence along the rivers in Wuhan, but the overall impact is small. An obvious uplift is observed in Caidian District in the south of Wuhan, and the reason may be related to the physical and chemical expansion effects of the expansive clay.

TI  - Using of Remote Sensing-Based Auxiliary Variables for Soil Moisture Scaling and Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is one of the core hydrological and climate variables that crucially influences water and energy budgets. The spatial resolution of available soil moisture products is generally coarser than 25 km, which limits their hydro-meteorological and eco-hydrological applications and the management of water resources at watershed and agricultural scales. A feasible solution to overcome these limitations is to downscale coarse soil moisture products with the support of higher-resolution spatial information. Although many auxiliary variables have been used for this purpose, few studies have analyzed their applicability and effectiveness in arid regions. To this end, we comprehensively evaluated four commonly used auxiliary variables, including NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), LST (Land Surface Temperature), TVDI (Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index), and SEE (Soil Evaporative Efficiency), against ground-based soil moisture observations during the vegetation growing season in the Heihe River Basin, China. Performance metrics indicated that SEE is most sensitive (R-2 >= 0.67) to soil moisture because it is controlled by soil evaporation limited by the available soil moisture. The similarity of spatial patterns also showed that SEE best captures soil moisture changes, with the STD (standard deviation) of the HD (Hausdorff Distance) less than 0.058 when compared with PLMR (Polarimetric L-band Multi-beam Radiometer) soil moisture products. In addition, soil moisture was mapped by RF (Random Forests) using both single auxiliary variables and 11 types of multiple auxiliary variable combinations. SEE was found to be the best auxiliary variable for scaling and mapping soil moisture with accuracy of 0.035 cm(3)/cm(3). Among the multiple auxiliary variables, the combination of LST, NDVI, and SEE was found to best enhance the scaling and mapping accuracy of soil moisture with 0.034 cm(3)/cm(3).

TI  - Increasing Streamflow in Poor Vegetated Mountain Basins Induced by Greening of Underlying Surface
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Arid ecosystems have exhibited greening trends in recent decades. There is no consensus on how underlying surface changes influence streamflow across vegetation gradients. We investigated this issue for the four typical arid mountain basins using a 30-year runoff database and the Budyko framework to quantify the contributions of climate and underlying surface changes to streamflow variations during summer periods. Results showed that in the poor vegetated basins, i.e., Heizi Basin and Kuche Basin, the underlying surface change has increased summer streamflow by 14.01 and 35.67 mm, respectively; climate contributed only -7.32 and 1.86 mm to summer streamflow changes, respectively. Comparatively, in the well-vegetated basins, i.e., Huangshui Basin and Kaidu Basin, climate change dominated summer streamflow variations by increasing 21.50 and 24.65 mm, respectively; the underlying surface change only increased summer streamflow by 3.72 and 1.56 mm, respectively. Additionally, the decomposition results were extended to monthly scale (from June to September) to reveal the effects of climate and underlying surface changes on monthly streamflow. This study deepens our knowledge of runoff responses, which can provide important references to support water resources management in other regions that receive water from mountains.

TI  - Evaluation of Global Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) Products at 500 m Spatial Resolution
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) is a key biophysical variable directly associated with the photosynthetic activity of plants. Several global FAPAR products with different spatial resolutions have been generated from remote sensing data, and much work has focused on validating them. However, those studies have primarily evaluated global FAPAR products at a spatial resolution of 1 km or more, whereas few studies have evaluated the global 500 m resolution FAPAR product distributed in recent years. Furthermore, there are a few FAPAR products, including black-sky, white-sky and blue-sky FAPAR datasets, and almost no studies have evaluated these products. In this article, three global FAPAR products at 500 m resolution, namely MODIS (only black-sky FAPAR), MUSES and EBR (black-sky, white-sky and blue-sky FAPAR) were compared to evaluate their temporal and spatial discrepancies and direct validation was conducted to compare these FAPAR products with the FAPAR values derived from the high-resolution reference maps from the Validation of Land European Remote Sensing Instrument (VALERI) and Implementing Multi-Scale Agricultural Indicators Exploiting Sentinels (IMAGINES) projects. The results showed that the MUSES FAPAR product exhibited the best spatial integrity, whereas the MODIS and EBR FAPAR products had many missing pixels in the equatorial rainforest regions and at high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere. The MODIS, MUSES and EBR FAPAR products were generally consistent in their spatial patterns. However, a relatively large discrepancy among these FAPAR products was present in the equatorial rainforest regions and the middle and high latitude regions where the main vegetation type was forest. The differences between the black-sky and white-sky FAPAR datasets at the global scale were significant. In January, the MUSES and EBR black-sky FAPAR values were larger than their white-sky FAPAR values in the region north of 30 degrees north latitude but they were smaller than their white-sky FAPAR values in the region south of 30 degrees north latitude. In July, the MUSES and EBR black-sky FAPAR values were lower than their white-sky FAPAR values in the region north of 30 degrees south latitude and they were larger than their white-sky FAPAR values in the region south of 30 degrees south latitude. The temporal profiles of the MUSES FAPAR product were continuous and smooth, whereas those of the MODIS and EBR FAPAR products showed many fluctuations, particularly during the growing seasons. Direct validation indicated that the MUSES FAPAR product had the best accuracy (R-2 = 0.6932, RMSE = 0.1495) compared to the MODIS FAPAR product (R-2 = 0.6202, RMSE = 0.1710) and the EBR FAPAR product (R-2 = 0.5746, RMSE = 0.1912).

TI  - Characteristics of Freeze-Thaw Cycles in an Endorheic Basin on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau Based on SBAS-InSAR Technology
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The freeze-thaw (F-T) cycle of the active layer (AL) causes the "frost heave and thaw settlement" deformation of the terrain surface. Accurately identifying its amplitude and time characteristics is important for climate, hydrology, and ecology research in permafrost regions. We used Sentinel-1 SAR data and small baseline subset-interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SBAS-InSAR) technology to obtain the characteristics of F-T cycles in the Zonag Lake-Yanhu Lake permafrost-affected endorheic basin on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau from 2017 to 2019. The results show that the seasonal deformation amplitude (SDA) in the study area mainly ranges from 0 to 60 mm, with an average value of 19 mm. The date of maximum frost heave (MFH) occurred between November 27th and March 21st of the following year, averaged in date of the year (DOY) 37. The maximum thaw settlement (MTS) occurred between July 25th and September 21st, averaged in DOY 225. The thawing duration is the thawing process lasting about 193 days. The spatial distribution differences in SDA, the date of MFH, and the date of MTS are relatively significant, but there is no apparent spatial difference in thawing duration. Although the SDA in the study area is mainly affected by the thermal state of permafrost, it still has the most apparent relationship with vegetation cover, the soil water content in AL, and active layer thickness. SDA has an apparent negative and positive correlation with the date of MFH and the date of MTS. In addition, due to the influence of soil texture and seasonal rivers, the seasonal deformation characteristics of the alluvial-diluvial area are different from those of the surrounding areas. This study provides a method for analyzing the F-T cycle of the AL using multi-temporal InSAR technology.

TI  - Cloud Removal for Optical Remote Sensing Imagery Using Distortion Coding Network Combined with Compound Loss Functions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical remote sensing (RS) satellites perform imaging in the visible and infrared electromagnetic spectrum to collect data and analyze information on the optical characteristics of the objects of interest. However, optical RS is sensitive to illumination and atmospheric conditions, especially clouds, and multiple acquisitions are typically required to obtain an image of sufficient quality. To accurately reproduce surface information that has been contaminated by clouds, this work proposes a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based cloud removal framework using a distortion coding network combined with compound loss functions (DC-GAN-CL). A novel generator embedded with distortion coding and feature refinement mechanisms is applied to focus on cloudy regions and enhance the transmission of optical information. In addition, to achieve feature and pixel consistency, both coherent semantics and local adaptive reconstruction factors are considered in our loss functions. Extensive numerical evaluations on RICE1, RICE2, and Paris datasets are performed to validate the good performance achieved by the proposed DC-GAN-CL in both peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and visual perception. This system can thus restore images to obtain similar quality to cloud-free reference images, in a dynamic range of over 30 dB. The restoration effect on the coherence of image semantics produced by this technique is competitive compared with other methods.

TI  - Joint Classification of Hyperspectral and LiDAR Data Based on Position-Channel Cooperative Attention Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing image classification is a prominent topic in earth observation research, but there is a performance bottleneck when classifying single-source objects. As the types of remote sensing data are gradually diversified, the joint classification of multi-source remote sensing data becomes possible. However, the existing classification methods have limitations in heterogeneous feature representation of multimodal remote sensing data, which restrict the collaborative classification performance. To resolve this issue, a position-channel collaborative attention network is proposed for the joint classification of hyperspectral and LiDAR data. Firstly, in order to extract the spatial, spectral, and elevation features of land cover objects, a multiscale network and a single-branch backbone network are designed. Then, the proposed position-channel collaborative attention module adaptively enhances the features extracted from the multi-scale network in different degrees through the self-attention module, and exploits the features extracted from the multiscale network and single-branch network through the cross-attention module, so as to capture the comprehensive features of HSI and LiDAR data, narrow the semantic differences of heterogeneous features, and realize complementary advantages. The depth intersection mode further improves the performance of collaborative classification. Finally, a series of comparative experiments were carried out in the 2012 Houston dataset and Trento dataset, and the effectiveness of the model was proved by qualitative and quantitative comparison.

TI  - Ecological Impact Prediction of Groundwater Change in Phreatic Aquifer under Multi-Mining Conditions
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In aeolian sandy grass shoal catchment areas that rely heavily on groundwater, mining-induced geological deformation and aquifer drainage are likely to cause irreversible damage to natural groundwater systems and affect the original circulation of groundwater, thus threatening the ecological environment. This study aimed to predict the impact of groundwater level decline on vegetation growth in the Hailiutu River Basin (HRB), which is a coal-field area. Based on remote-sensing data, the land use/cover change was interpreted and analyzed, and the central areas of greensward land in the basin were determined. Subsequently, the correlation between groundwater depth and grassland distribution was analyzed. Then, the groundwater system under natural conditions was modeled using MODFLOW, and the groundwater flow field in 2029 was predicted by loading the generalized treatment of coal mine drainage water to the model. The change in groundwater depth caused by coal mining and its influence on the grassland were obtained. The results show that coal mining will decrease the groundwater depth, which would induce degradation risks in 4 of the original 34 aggregation centers of greensward land that originally depended on groundwater for growth in HRB because they exceeded the groundwater threshold. The prediction results show that the maximum settlement of groundwater level can reach 5 m in the northern (Yinpanhao), 6 m in the eastern (Dahaize), and 10 m in the southern (Balasu) region of HRB. Attention should be paid to vegetation degradation in areas where groundwater depth exceeds the minimum threshold for plant growth.

TI  - Monitoring multi-temporal and spatial variations of water transparency in the Jiaozhou Bay using GOCI data
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Water transparency, commonly measured as Secchi disk depth (SDD), is essential for describing the optical properties of coastal waters. We proposed a regional linear corrected SDD estimation model based on the North Sea Mathematical Models for GOCI and the mechanical model developed by Lee et al. (2015) in the Jiaozhou Bay. Combined with the multiple variable linear regression analysis, the diurnal SDD variations of the bay inside and the bay mouth are controlled by the solar zenith angle (SZA) and tides. The bay outside mainly varies with SZA. From GOCI observations between 2011 and 2021, wind force influenced the entire area on the inner-annual SDD variations. It exhibits an increasing trend in the inter-annual dynamics, which was more stable inside the bay with an annual increase of 0.035 m, and air temperature was the most significant contribution. However, human activities cannot be ignored in causing water environment changes.

TI  - Formation mechanism of ground fissure at Beijing Capital International Airport revealed by high-resolution InSAR and numerical modelling
T2  - ENGINEERING GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A NE-SW trending ground fissure that extends for 13 km was first discovered at Beijing Capital International Airport (BCIA) in 1985. There are many factors that influenced its formation mechanism, including the activity of the Shunyi-Liangxiang (SL) fault, land subsidence and human engineering activities. Fine-scale surface deformation at BCIA was obtained by interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), using 27 TerraSAR-X data with a 3 m resolution, to better understand the failure phenomenon and formation mechanism of the ground fissure. Spatially, the SL fault intersects runway 36R obliquely at the airport, and the fissure forms along the fault. A zone of subsidence was observed on the footwall (northwest side) of the SL fault; however, the ground fissure along the SL fault dips towards the southeast. The InSAR subsidence rate profiles show a rate difference of 9-17 mm/yr across the ground fissure, consistent with the deformation characteristics of concrete surface fractures at BCIA. Constrained by the subsidence rate obtained by InSAR, the discrete element method (DEM) was applied to simulate the failure process of runway 36R. The formation mechanism of the ground fissure was revealed: the SE dipping SL normal fault is the most important geological factor controlling the boundary of subsidence and extension of the ground fissure; the regional subsidence on the footwall of the SL fault is the main triggering factor in the development of the ground fissure; the damage of the concrete surface induced localized uplift; and the decrease in soil strength in the fault zone has led to localized subsidence along the ground fissure.

TI  - Monitoring and Analysis of Water Level-Water Storage Capacity Changes in Ngoring Lake Based on Multisource Remote Sensing Data
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Mastering the fluctuation of water levels and the water storage capacity of plateau lakes is greatly important for monitoring the water balance of the Tibetan Plateau and predicting regional and global climate change. The water level of plateau lakes is difficult to measure, and the ground measured data of long-time series are difficult to obtain. Ngoring Lake is considered in this study, using spaceborne single-photon lidar ICESat-2/ATL13 inland lake standard data products, the water level values provided by Hydroweb laboratory, and the image data of an optical remote sensing satellite. A new method is proposed in the absence of measured data. The method uses multisource remote sensing data to estimate the long-term changes in the water levels, surface area, and water storage capacity of Ngoring Lake in the past three decades. The results show that the water level values of ICESat-2 and Hydroweb on overlapping observation days are highly correlated, with R-2 = 0.9776, MAE = 0.420 m, RMSE = 0.077 m, and the average absolute height difference is 0.049 m. The fusion of multiple altimetry data can obtain more continuous long-time series water-level observation results. From 1992 to 2021, the water body information of Ngoring Lake basin fluctuated greatly and showed different variation characteristics in different time periods. The lowest water level in January 1997 was approximately 4268.49 m, and it rose to its highest in October 2009, approximately 4272.44 m. The change in the water level in the basin was mainly affected by natural factors, such as precipitation, air temperature, and human activities. The analysis shows that ICESat-2 can be combined with other remote sensing data to realize the long-time series dynamic monitoring of plateau lakes, showing great advantages in the comprehensive observation of plateau lakes in no man's land.

TI  - Snow Cover in the Three Stable Snow Cover Areas of China and Spatio-Temporal Patterns of the Future
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of global warming, relevant studies have shown that China will experience the largest temperature rise in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and northwestern regions in the future. Based on MOD10A2 and MYD10A2 snow products and snow depth data, this study analyzes the temporal and spatial evolution characteristics of the snow cover fraction, snow depth, and snow cover days in the three stable snow cover areas in China, and combines 15 modes in CMIP6 snow cover data in four different scenarios with three kinds of variables, predicting the spatiotemporal evolution pattern of snow cover in China's three stable snow cover areas in the future. The results show that (1) the mean snow cover fraction, snow depth, and snow cover days in the snow cover area of Northern Xinjiang are all the highest. Seasonal changes in the snow cover areas of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau are the most stable. The snow cover fraction, snow depth, and snow cover days of the three stable snow cover areas are consistent in spatial distribution. The high values are mainly distributed in the southeast and west of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the south and northeast of Northern Xinjiang, and the north of the snow cover area of Northeast China. (2) The future snow changes in the three stable snow cover areas will continue to decline with the increase in development imbalance. Snow cover fraction and snow depth decrease most significantly in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the snow cover days in Northern Xinjiang decrease most significantly under the SSPs585 scenario. In the future, the southeast of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the northwest of Northern Xinjiang, and the north of Northeast China will be the center of snow cover reduction. (3) Under the four different scenarios, the snow cover changes in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and Northern Xinjiang are the most significant. Under the SSPs126 and SSPs245 scenarios, the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau snow cover has the most significant change in response. Under the SSPs370 and SSPs585 scenarios, the snow cover in Northern Xinjiang has the most significant change.

AB  - In remote sensing data processing, cover classification on decimeter-level data is a well-studied but tough subject that has been well-documented. The majority of currently existent works make use of orthographic photographs or orthophotos and digital surface models that go with them (DSMs). Urban land cover classification plays a significant role in the field of remote sensing to enhance the quality of different applications including environment protection, sustainable development, and resource management and planning. Novelty of the research done in this area is focused on extracting features from high-resolution satellite images to be used in the classification process. However, it is well known in machine learning literature that some of the extracted features are irrelevant to the classification process with a negative or no effect on its accuracy. In this work, a genetic algorithm-based feature selection approach is used to enhance the performance of urban land cover classification. Neural networks (NNs) and random forest (RF) classifiers were used to evaluate the proposed approach on a recent urban land cover dataset of nine different classes. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieved better performance with RF classifier using only 27% of the features. The random forest tree has achieved highest accuracy 84.27%; it is concluded that the RF algorithm is an appropriate algorithm for classifying cover land.

T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - As the COVID-19 pandemic began in early 2020, primary care influenza sentinel surveillance networks within the Influenza Monitoring Vaccine Effectiveness in Europe (I-MOVE) consortium rapidly adapted to COVID-19 surveillance. This study maps system adaptations and lessons learned about aligning influenza and COVID-19 surveillance following ECDC / WHO/ Europe recommendations and preparing for other diseases possibly emerging in the future. Using a qualitative approach, we describe the adaptations of seven sentinel sites in five European Union countries and the United Kingdom during the first pandemic phase (March-September 2020). Adaptations to sentinel systems were substantial (2/7 sites), moderate (2/7) or minor (3/7 sites). Most adaptations encompassed patient referral and sample collection pathways, laboratory testing and data collection. Strengths included established networks of primary care providers, highly qualified testing laboratories and stakeholder commitments. One challenge was the decreasing number of samples due to altered patient pathways. Lessons learned included flexibility establishing new routines and new laboratory testing. To enable simultaneous sentinel surveillance of influenza and COVID-19, experiences of the sentinel sites and testing infrastructure should be considered. The contradicting aims of rapid case finding and contact tracing, which are needed for control during a pandemic and regular surveillance, should be carefully balanced.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Dike swarms and structural lineaments were investigated in the Hada Alsham area, west-central Arabian Shield of Saudi Arabia, using remote sensing, field observations, and geochemical analysis techniques. SPOT-7 digital satellite data were employed in the analysis of these structural lineaments and dike swarms. The extracted orientations of the structural lineaments and dike swarms confirm that they are approximately identical, trending mainly in the NNW-WNW, NE-ENE, and E-W directions. Based on field observations and cross-cutting relationships, these dike swarms can be geochronologically arranged (from oldest to youngest) as mafic NNW- to WNW-trending dikes, mafic NE- to ENE-trending dikes, felsic NE-trending dikes, and local mafic E-W dikes. Major and trace elements geochemistry indicates that the studied dike swarms are basalt, basaltic andesite, and rhyolite in composition. Trace and REE diagrams, as well as their immobile elemental ratios of the studied dike swarms suggesting their formation in a typical intraoceanic island arc setting. In addition, the felsic NE dikes may represent extensive fractionation of the mafic magma from which the mafic NE dikes were formed because their incompatible elements signatures are almost similar. All dike swarms were likely emplaced between 620 and 576 Ma, and during the post-collisional extension and relaxation, following the amalgamation of terranes (island arcs) during the collision between the East and West Gondwana.

Its heat and drought tolerance give U.S. farmers an alternative to soybean and corn crop rotation. Mungbean is a 60- to 90-day crop with similar equipment needs, chemical inputs, and storage requirements to those of soybean and has a developed market. Its vulnerability to diseases in the United States is unknown. Thus, we compared the susceptibility of 10 mungbean genotypes to 8 soybean diseases in the lab. We also monitored disease occurrence in sentinel field plots in Iowa. Mungbean accessions showed a wide range of susceptibility to Cercospora kikuchii, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Diaporthe caulivora, Fusarium oxysporum, F. virguliforme, Macrophomina phaseolina, Pythium sylvaticum, and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. Symptoms of frogeye leaf spot, sudden death syndrome, and Rhizoctonia root and crown rot, common soybean diseases, were observed on mungbean in the field; isolates were identified as Cercospora sojina, F. virguliforme, and Rhizoctonia solani, and Koch's postulates were conducted. C. sojina and F. virguliforme are newly reported as causing disease in field-grown mungbean.

TI  - Identification of degradation factors in mountain semiarid rangelands using spatial distribution modelling and ecological niche theory
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents an approach to studying rangeland degradation by using remote sensing data, geographic information systems, and ecological niche theory. The role of environmental factors and land use in the spatial distribution of degraded rangelands in the Central Caucasus was assessed. Degradation stages were modelled in R using ENVIREM predictors, VIF test to select noncorrelated variables, ENMeval package to select the optimal model parameters, and the Maxent method to develop distribution models in the dismo package. Selected models had AUCtest, AUCtrain and CBI values close to 1, deltaAICc and AUCdiff values close to 0, and quite low AICc values. Environmental predictors of climate type (Thornthwaite aridity index and Emberger's pluviothermic quotient) were explanatory variables for least disturbed rangelands, while topography (Terrain roughness index) largely explained the distribution of most disturbed grasslands. Quantitative (Schoener's D) and graphical (Kernel density estimation, analysis of predictive maps) assessment revealed a significant overlap of 'ecological niches' and potential ranges of grasslands at different degradation stages, which indirectly supports the hypothesis of the important role of overgrazing in their degradation. Livestock management is likely to help restore disturbed mountain meadow steppes to steppe grasslands. Restoration of the arid shrub ecosystems to steppe grasslands or meadow steppes probably requires additional agricultural practices.

TI  - Mowing detection using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 time series for large scale grassland monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Managed grasslands cover about one third of the European utilized agricultural area. Appropriate grassland management is key for balancing trade-offs between provisioning and regulating ecosystem services. The timing and frequency of mowing events are major factors of grassland management. Recent studies have shown the feasibility of detecting mowing events using remote sensing time series from optical and radar satellites. In this study, we present a new method combining the regular observations of Sentinel-1 (S1) and the better accuracy of Sentinel-2 (S2) grassland mowing detection algorithms. This multi-source approach for grassland monitoring was assessed over large areas and in various contexts. The method was first validated in six European countries, based on Planet image interpretation. Its performances and sensitivity were then thoroughly assessed in an independent study area using a more precise and complete reference dataset based on an intensive field campaign. Results showed the robustness of the method across all study areas and different types of grasslands. The method reached a F1-score of 79% for detecting mowing events on hay meadows. Furthermore, the detection of mowing events along the growing season allows to classify mowing practices with an overall accuracy of 69%. This is promising for differentiating grasslands in terms of management intensity. The method could therefore be used for largescale grassland monitoring to support agri-environmental schemes in Europe.

TI  - Spatio-temporal monitoring of marsh vegetation phenology and its response to hydro-meteorological factors using CCDC algorithm with optical and SAR images: In case of Honghe National Nature Reserve, China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation phenology is a sensitive indicator which can comprehensively reflect the response of wetland vegetation to external environment changes. However, the time-series monitoring wetland vegetation phenological changes and clarifying its response to hydrology and meteorology still face great challenges. To fill these research gaps, this paper proposed a novel time-series approach for monitoring phenological change of marsh vegetation in Honghe National Nature Reserve (HNNR), Northeast China, using continuous change detection and classification (CCDC) algorithm and Landsat and Sentinel-1 SAR images from 1985 to 2021. We evaluated the spatio-temporal response relationship of phenological characteristics to hydro-meteorological factors by combining CCDC algorithm with partial least squares regression (PLSR). Finally, this study further explored the intra-annual loss and restoration of marsh vegetation in response to hydro-meteorological factors using the transfer entropy (TE) and CCDC-MLSR model constructed by CCDC and Multiple Linear Stepwise Regression (MLSR) algorithms. We found that the bimodal trajectory of phenology reflects two growth processes of marsh vegetation in one year, and high-frequency and high-amplitude loss occurred in shallow-water and deep-water marsh vegetation from April to October, resulting in the loss area within the year was significantly greater than the recovery area. We confirmed that the CCDC algorithm could track the evolution trajectory of time-series phenology of marsh vegetation. We further revealed that precipitation, temperature and frequency of water-level changes are the main driving factors for the spatio-temporal phenological evolution of different marsh vegetation. This study verified the effect of alternative changes of hydrology and climate on loss and recovery of marsh vegetation in each growth stage. The results of this study provide a scientific basis for wetland pro-tection, ecological restoration, and sustainable development.

TI  - Defining Communication and Language from Within a Pluralistic Evolutionary Worldview
T2  - TOPOI-AN INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF PHILOSOPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - New definitions are proposed for communication and language. Communication is defined as the evolution of physical, biochemical, cellular, community, and technological information exchange. Language is defined as community communication whereby the information exchanged comprises evolving individual and group-constructed knowledge and beliefs, that are enacted, narrated, or otherwise conveyed by evolving rule-governed and meaningful symbol systems, that are grounded, interpreted, and used from within evolving embodied, cognitive, ecological, sociocultural, and technological niches. These definitions place emphasis on the evolutionary aspects of communication and language, and they are here differentiated from four older paradigms that instead focus either on the referential or social aspects of language, or the informational or semantic aspects of communication. In contrast with these paradigms, the definitions proposed here for communication and language are in line with a pluralistic evolutionary worldview, one that necessitates the recognition that a multitude of units, levels, mechanisms and processes are involved in bringing forth communication and language.

TI  - The Tectonic Map and Structural Provinces of the Late Neoproterozoic Egyptian Nubian Shield: Implications for Crustal Growth of the Arabian-Nubian Shield (East African Orogen)
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Late Neoproterozoic Egyptian Nubian Shield (ENS) has attracted increasing attention since the establishment of the Egyptian Geological Survey and Mining Authority (EGSMA (1896)), which conducted the first mapping. In the last three decades, rapid improvements in analytical techniques, along with field-oriented studies, have made it possible for the interpretation of the ENS as an integral part of the juvenile Arabian-Nubian Shield (ANS) as a portion of the East African Orogen (EAO). However, a consistent tectonic map of the ENS does not exist. Presentation of such a map is the main objective of the present work where Landsat-based lithological discrimination is combined with the systematic structural investigation and careful reassessment of previously published geological maps. Our interpretation of this map indicates that in accordance with previous work, the basement units of the Eastern Desert (ED) can be divided into three structural domains: Northern, Central, and South-Eastern Desert provinces. The proposed provinces are ascribed to three different plate tectonic far-field boundary conditions. The earliest magmatic, metamorphic, and tectonic history was set off by the approximate north-south convergence of the Gabgaba-Gebeit, Jiddah-Asir terranes, and Eastern Desert-Midyan terranes along the Yanbo-Onib-Sol-Hamid-Gerf-Allaqi-Heiani (YOSHGAH) suture between c. 800 and 620 Ma. The second event between c. 640 and 580 Ma was correlated with the Nabitah Orogeny when the Ad Dawadimi-Ar Rayn terranes in the eastern Arabian Shield accreted to the earlier consolidated arc terranes (Afif and Tathlith terranes). During this period, east-west convergence between northwestern Saudi Arabia and the Central Eastern Desert (CED) in Egypt caused a pronounced strike-slip deformation associated with the displacement along the wider Najd Fault system. The third orogenic phase, which was younger than c. 580 Ma, was controlled by the evolution and retreat of the Cadomian Arc. The northern portions of the ENS and the northern Arabian Shield experienced extension whereas extensive post-orogenic magmatism was related to mantle delamination and associated crustal thinning.

TI  - Analysis of the Temporal Evolution of Ice Aprons in the Mont-Blanc Massif Using X and C-Band SAR Images
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper investigates the backscatter evolution and surface changes of ice aprons (IAs) by exploiting time series of X- and C-band SAR images from PAZ and Sentinel-1 satellites. IAs are extremely small ice bodies of irregular shape present on steep slopes and complex topographies in all the major high-Alpine environments of the world. Due to their small size and locations in complex topographies, they have been very poorly studied, and very limited information is known about their evolution and responses to climate change. SAR datasets can provide handy information about the seasonal behaviour of IAs since physical changes of IA surfaces modify the backscattering of RaDAR waves. The analysis of the temporal variations of the backscatter coefficient illustrates the effects of increasing temperatures on the surface of the IAs. All IAs considered in the analysis show a strong decrease in backscatter coefficient values in the summer months. The backscattering patterns are also supported by the annual evolution of the coefficient of variation, which is an appropriate indicator to evaluate the heterogeneity of the surface. Higher mean backscatter values in the X-band than in the C-band indicate surface scattering phenomena dominate the IAs. These features could provide key information for classifying IAs using SAR images in future research.

TI  - Outlier-Robust Superpixel-Level CFAR Detector With Truncated Clutter for Single Look Complex SAR Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detectors are well studied for ship detection in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, which suffer performance degradation due to the capture effect from interfering outliers, such as nearby targets, sidelobes, and ghosts in multitarget environments. To address this issue, the clutter truncation scheme is adopted to reduce the outlier contamination in clutter samples such that the accuracy of clutter modeling can be improved. However, the selection of clutter truncation depth is difficult, which often resorts to sensitivity study. In this article, the complex signal kurtosis (CSK) is first utilized as a statistical indicator for the decision of truncation depth to guarantee that the true clutter samples are maintained. Besides, a coarse-to-fine detection process is designed, including global superpixel proposal with the CSK and local identification of target pixels with the superpixel-level CFAR detector based on truncated statistics. During the local CFAR detection stage, the segmented superpixels provide convenient sample indexing for the iterative clutter truncation processing. The elevated performance achieved by the proposed method mainly benefits from the schemes of two-stage detection and automatic clutter truncation, yielding the increased detection efficiency and accuracy at the same time. Besides, false alarms caused by radio frequency interference can be reduced. In the experiment, the comparative results with state-of-the-art methods based on the Sentinel-1 and Gaofen-3 SAR data validate the performance of the proposed method.

TI  - Geospatial analysis of short term shoreline change behavior between Subarnarekha and Rasulpur estuary, east coast of India using intelligent techniques (DSAS)
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - A geospatial analysis of shoreline change pattern is most significant parameter to understand the behavioral interaction between land and sea water. Geospatial analyses using various statistical and quantitative methods which are more applicable, accurate and dependable to measures the spatio-temporal trend of erosion accretion and estimate the change rate of shoreline. Remote sensing and GIS techniques have been used for the identification of shoreline change over the various time scales. To identify the rate Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) was applied in the current research. The present study aimed to identify the trend of coastal erosion accretion during 43 years (1975-2018) which is divided into four short term period (1975-1988, 1988-2000, 2000-2010 and 2010-2018) between the coastal stretch of Subarnarekha and Rasulpur estuary along Bay of Bengal using multi temporal satellite images. The accurate shoreline position has been delineated by the histogram threshold method using the images of Landsat Multi Spectral Scanner, Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper. The shoreline change rate has been calculated based on cast transect method through some statistical techniques such as End Point Rate (EPR) and Net Shoreline Movement (NSM) in GIS application. 70.42 km long coastal stretch along Bay of Bengal has been divided into three littoral zones (LZ) to analyze the shoreline shifting on a zone basis. From the analysis it has been observed that maximum erosion occurred between 1988 and 2000 time period in all zones. The result shows that highest rate of net shoreline movement has been found in LZ I (- 1715.71 m) in 1975-1988 and LZ III (- 1719.65 m) in 2000-2010 at Subarnarekha estuary and Junput respectively. The present study reveals that most of the accretive formation is observed in 2000-2010 and 2010-2018. Major accretion is identified in the southern part of Subarnarekha estuary, 23.93 m/year in EPR method. Maximum shades of changes was experienced in LZ I, especially in Subarnarekha estuary area. In the time span of 1975-1988 this area faced the highest erosion and highest accretion with the rate of - 78.54 m/year and 23.93 m/year respectively through EPR method. During 1988-2000, - 37.35 m/year erosional rate was found in the Subarnarekha estuary. The highest erosional rate was - 8.48 m/year in Beguran Jalpai during 1988-2000 by EPR. The maximum rate of accretion has been noticed as 7.7 m/year in LZ II in the time period of 2010-2018.

T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Arctic ice shelves have declined over the past several decades, one of many indications of a rapidly changing cryosphere. Here we use a collection of off-nadir Landsat 8 images, a 1978 digital orthophotograph and photogrammetrically derived DEM, satellite altimetry and other data to examine the causes of an Arctic ice-shelf retreat in northernmost Greenland, the Hunt Fjord Ice Shelf (HFIS). HFIS has several distinct provenance regions comprised of glacier-derived ice and corrugated multi-decadal fast ice, with varying ice thicknesses (5-64 m). Available imagery shows little change in HFIS between 1978 and 2012, after which several midsummer calving events occurred (2012, 2016 and 2019) that reduced the HFIS by 42.5 km(2) (similar to 56%). Shelf area losses began as the number of surface melt days on the adjacent ice sheet more than doubled relative to the 1980s. Recent calving events also occurred during open-water periods at the ice-shelf front. Prior to mid-2012, there were no calving events during similar open-water periods. HFIS tributary glaciers have thinned by 3-20 m near their grounding zones, and may have accelerated since the 1980s, likely due to increased basal melting from contact with warm Atlantic Water.

TI  - Etiology of acute febrile illnesses in Southern China: Findings from a two-year sentinel surveillance project, 2017-2019
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundSouthern China is at risk for arborvirus disease transmission, including Zika virus and dengue. Patients often present to clinical care with non-specific acute febrile illnesses (AFI). To better describe the etiology of AFI, we implemented a two-year AFI surveillance project at five sentinel hospitals in Yunnan and Guangdong Provinces.MethodsBetween June 2017 and August 2019, we enrolled patients between 2 and 65 years of age presenting at one sentinel hospital in Mengla County, Yunnan, and four in Jiangmen City, Guangdong, with symptoms of AFI (acute onset of fever >= 37.5 degrees C within the past 7 days) without respiratory symptoms or diarrhea. Demographic, epidemiologic, and clinical information was obtained and entered into a web-based AFI surveillance database. A custom TaqMan Array card (TAC) was used to test patients' whole blood specimens for 27 different pathogens using real-time polymerase chain reaction assays.ResultsDuring the two-year project period, 836 patients were enrolled; 443 patients from Mengla County and 393 patients from Jiangmen City. The median age was 33 years [range: 2-65], and most were hospitalized [641, 77%]. Of 796 patients with valid TAC results, 341 (43%) were positive for at least one of the 10 unique pathogens detected. This included 205 (26%) patients positive for dengue virus, 60 (8%) for Orientia tsutsugamushi, and 42 (5%) for Coxiella burnetii. Ten patients (1%) in Jiangmen City tested positive for malaria, 8 of whom reported recent travel outside of China. TAC results were negative for 455 (57%) patients. None of the patients had a positive TAC detection for Zika virus.ConclusionsThe project detected variability in the etiology of AFI in Southern China and highlighted the importance of differential diagnosis. Dengue, O. tsutsugamushi, and C. burnetii were the most frequently identified pathogens among enrolled AFI patients. As a non-notifiable disease, the frequent detection of C. burnetii is noteworthy and warrants additional investigation. The project provided a framework for routine surveillance for persons presenting with AFI.

TI  - Volumetric change analysis of the Cauvery delta topography using radar remote sensing
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Geomorphology refers to the study of the Earth's physical land surface features. Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is a digital imagery where each pixel represents elevation value above or below mean sea level. The availability of DEM allows analysis of landscape morphology and related processes in terms of geomorphometry. DEM of Difference (DoD) techniques are used to estimate the elevation variations and volumetric changes over time. The volumetric change of terrain in the Cauvery delta (CD) for the past two decades is estimated using DoD algorithm by utilizing freely available moderate spatial resolution SRTM, PALSAR and Sentinel 1A DEMs which are derived by radar remote sensing technique. A detailed assessment of individual DEM's errors and propagating errors into the DoD are estimated using the field elevation points measured by Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) Global Positioning System (GPS). The default errors in the SRTM, PALSAR and Sentinel 1A DEMs are observed with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 3.33, 3.11 and 3.04 m respectively. The erosion and accretion rates determined are 25 and 30 million m3 / decade correspondingly. The total volume of sediment load due to erosion and accretion is 50 and 60 million m3 respectively during 2000-2020. Further the net area affected due to deposition (69 %) is higher than the total area affected due to erosion (30%). This study presents decadal sediment budget and rate of annual change due to erosion/accretion in the CD.(c) 2022 National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Remote Sensing Techniques for Bridge Deformation Monitoring at Millimetric Scale: Investigating the Potential of Satellite Radar Interferometry, Airborne Laser Scanning and Ground-Based Mobile Laser Scanning
T2  - PFG-JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY REMOTE SENSING AND GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In light of ageing infrastructure, structural condition assessment is a key prerequisite for the provision of reliable, safe and performant infrastructure networks. However, full systematic condition inspections across large transport networks are extremely resource intensive. Thus, network-wide continuous structural monitoring is hardly feasible using classical engineering assessment methods. Modern remote sensing techniques open up new possibilities for infrastructure assessment and monitoring. Three different methods for rapid, contactless and non-invasive infrastructure deformation monitoring are evaluated: (1) satellite radar interferometry (InSAR), (2) airborne laser scanning (ALS) using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and (3) vehicle-mounted mobile laser scanning (MLS). All methods are tested at an integral concrete bridge in Vienna, Austria, and results are contrasted to reference measurements available from several water-level gauges. In addition, thermal deformation is modelled based on the prevailing environmental conditions. Results show that all methods are well capable of detecting general deformation trends, albeit exhibiting different stages of maturity. While the main application of InSAR lies in long-term continuous deformation measurement of the overall structure, MLS and ALS have the benefit of providing a wealth of data through measurement campaigns. All three contactless measurement methods are suitable for supplementing current structural condition assessments.

TI  - LR B-splines to approximate bathymetry datasets: An improved statistical criterion to judge the goodness of fit
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The task of representing remotely sensed scattered point clouds with mathematical surfaces is ubiquitous to reduce a high number of observations to a compact description with as few coefficients as possible. To reach that goal, locally refined B-splines provide a simple framework to perform surface approximation by allowing an iterative local refinement. Different setups exist (bidegree of the splines, tolerance, refinement strategies) and the choice is often made heuristically, depending on the applications and observations at hand. In this article, we introduce a statistical information criterion based on the t-distribution to judge the goodness of fit of the surface approximation for remote sensing data with outliers. We use a real bathymetry dataset and illustrate how concepts from model selection can be used to select the most adequate refinement strategy of the LR B-splines.

TI  - The impact of multi-sensor land data assimilation on river discharge estimation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - River discharge is one of the most critical renewable water resources. Accurately estimating river discharge with land surface models (LSMs) remains challenging due to the difficulty in estimating land water storages such as snow, soil moisture, and groundwater. While data assimilation (DA) ingesting optical, microwave, and gravity measurements from space can help constrain theses storage states, its impacts on runoff and eventually river discharge are not fully understood. Here, by taking advantage of recently published land DA results that jointly assimilate eight different combinations of observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E), we quantify to what degree multi-sensor land DA improves the river discharge simulation skills over 40 global river basins, and investigate the complementary strengths of different satellite measurements on river discharge. To be more specific, river discharge is updated by feeding gridded runoff from the eight multi-sensor DA simulations into a vector-based river routing model named the Routing Application for Parallel computatIon of Discharge (RAPID). Our modeling results, including 7-year simulations at 177,458 river reaches globally, are used to study the seasonal to interannual variability of river discharge. It is found that assimilating GRACE has the greatest impact on global runoff patterns, leading to the most pronounced improvements in spatial river discharge in the middle and high latitudes with the R2 increased by 0.16. The seasonal variation of spatial discharge is most skillful during the boreal summer. However, our evaluation also shows model and DA still struggle to generate reasonable variability and averaged discharge over permafrost regions. By assessing how different satellites add value to discharge forecasts, this study paves the way for more advanced multi-sensor satellite data assimilation to predict the terrestrial hydrological cycle.

TI  - The non-significant correlation between landscape ecological risk and ecosystem services in Xi?an Metropolitan Area, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - As critical prerequisite for sustainable development research of social ecosystem (SDSE), the relationship between landscape security pattern and ecosystem services should be explicitly evaluated to support SDSE research. However, the existing evaluation system lacking of integrating analysts of the factors led to vague knowledge of the SDSE mechanism. To tackle this issue, this study, therefore, explored the relationship between landscape ecological risk and ecosystem services (e.g. carbon sequestration, soil conservation, water yield, crop production and residential support) at Xi'an Metropolitan Area using remote sensing data in 2010 and 2020. The results show that the overall landscape ecological risk decreased from 0.2618 to 0.2479. Although the rapid development of urban leading improvement for landscape ecological security and residential support, the total ecosystem services has declined due to the decline in water yield and crop production. Preventing the landscape ecological risk on landscape fragmentation cannot improve the level of ecosystem services. Notably, the stronger interference of human activities overwhelmingly caused a single advantageous ecosystem services with extreme risk, while the less caused multiple advantageous ecosystem services of ecological regulation with medium-low level ecological risk. Additionally, the competitive relationship between the crop production and residential support would not produce higher risk led by the intervention of human activity. The integrating of crop production and carbon sequestration (or soil conservation) resulted in high risk. Using these results, a potential spatial plan of Xi'an Metropolitan Area is then made based on multiple advantageous areas of ecosystem services. This study benefits decision-making for regional comprehensive risk prevention, future spatial pattern planning and development orientation, and sustainable development research of social ecosystem.

TI  - Land-use/land cover change and land surface temperature in Metropolitan Manila, Philippines using landsat imagery
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing technology has been widely used to address the issue of urbanization for monitoring. In Metropolitan Manila, Philippines, there is a decline in vegetation over the last decade. This leads to the excess heat in the surface temperature and a phenomenon known as Urban Heat Island. In this study, the land surface temperature (LST), land-use/land cover changes (LULC), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) in 2001 and 2019 were retrieved using Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper + (ETM +). Our results showed the following: (i) an increase in the mean temperature of 4.02 degrees C from 2001 to 2019 in MM, (ii) rise in NDBI and a decline in NDVI values is correlated with an increase in LST over the last years in MM; (iii) LULC maps affirmed the highest occupancy of built-up areas caused by possible urban sprawl explaining the increase in warming in MM. This study provides added evidence that urbanization activities in Metro Manila leads to a warming effect that drives discomfort to many average Filipinos. Hence, environmental policies that would implement proper urban design utilizing more green spaces is recommended for local government units in MM to support.

TI  - Estimating grassland vegetation cover with remote sensing: A comparison between Landsat-8, Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope imagery
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Grassland fractional vegetation cover (FVC) accurate mapping on a large scale is crucial, since degraded grasslands contribute less to provisioning services, carbon storage, water purification, erosion control and biodiversity conservation. The spatial and temporal resolution of Sentinel-2 (S2) and PlanetScope (PS) data has never been explored for grassland FVC estimation so far and will enable researchers and agencies to quantify and map timelier and more precisely grassland processes. In this paper we compare FVC estimation models developed from Landsat-8 (L8), S2 and PS imagery. The reference grassland FVC dataset was obtained on the Paganella ski runs (46.15N, 11.01E, Italy) applying unsupervised classification to nadir grassland RGB photographs taken from 1.35 m above the soil. Fractional Response Models between reference FVC and 18 vegetation indices (VIs) extracted from satellite imagery were fitted and analysed. Then, leave-one-out cross validation and spatiotemporal change analysis were also performed. Our study confirms the robustness of the commonly used VIs based on the difference between NIR and the red wavelength region (R-2 = 0.91 for EVI using S2 imagery) and indicate that VIs based on the red-edge spectral region are the best performing for PS imagery (R-2 = 0.89 for RECI). Only medium to high spatial resolution imagery (S2 and PS) precisely mapped spatial patterns at the study site, since grasslands FVC varies at a fine scale. Previously available imagery at medium to low spatial and temporal resolution (e.g., L8) may still be interesting for analysis requiring long time-series of data.

TI  - Comparison of bagging, boosting and stacking algorithms for surface soil moisture mapping using optical-thermal-microwave remote sensing synergies
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture information is key to irrigation water management, drought monitoring, and yield prediction. It plays a vital role in the water cycle and energy budget between the earth's surface and atmosphere. Hence, its monitoring is crucial for both natural and anthropogenic environments. While the current remote sensing-based global SM products available at coarser resolution (3/15 km) are unsuitable for field-level operations, the most widely used microwave remote sensing suffers from model complexities and in-situ data requirements. Weather conditions limit the alternate approaches such as optical/thermal. This study aims to map surface soil moisture (SSM) at 30 m spatial resolution in a semi-arid region by fusing optical, thermal, and microwave remote sensing data using bagging, boosting, and stacking machine learning approaches. The reference data were collected using a soil moisture meter. The covariates included radar backscatter from Sentinel-1, visible, near-infrared, shortwave infrared, land surface temperature, and spectral indices derived from Landsat 8. Boruta algorithm was used for feature selection which identified radar backscatter, modified normalized difference water index, and land surface temperature as the most critical covariates impacting the SSM. The random forest (RF) showed the highest correlation coefficient (r = 0.71), and least root mean square error (RMSE = 5.17%). The cubist model had the least mean bias error (MBE = 0.21%) during independent validation. Stacking of cubist, gradient boosting machine (GBM), and RF using elastic net (ELNET) as meta-learner further reduced the MBE (0.18%) and RMSE (5.03%) during the validation. Overall, stacking multiple machine learning models improved model prediction and can be recommended to improve the digital soil moisture mapping.

TI  - Pericancerous lymph node imaging with indocyanine green-guided near-infrared fluorescence in radical esophagectomy: Protocol for a single-center, prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial
T2  - THORACIC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction The incidence and mortality rates of esophageal carcinoma are higher than those of most malignancies in humans. Radical esophagectomy is the preferred treatment for early-stage esophageal cancer. However, the extent of lymphadenectomy during radical esophagectomy remains controversial. Indocyanine green (ICG) is the most commonly used imaging agent for the diagnosis of tumors and metastatic lymph nodes in clinical settings. Thus, the main aim of this study was to evaluate pericancerous lymph nodes imaging in video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery radical esophagectomy using a near-infrared (NIR) ICG imaging system and to improve the detection rate of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) and overall survival of patients with esophageal cancer. Methods This was a single-center, prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial (allocation rate = 1:1). Forty treatment-naive esophageal cancer patients were recruited and divided into two groups: the ICG and control groups. The inclusion criteria were age, absence of preoperative neoadjuvant therapy, elective surgery, and signed informed consent. Data of participants at four different time points (preoperation, intraoperation, postoperative 1 week and 3 months) were collected and recorded. The main endpoint of this study was to explore the accuracy and false-negative rate of lymphadenectomy using NIR-ICG fluorescence imaging and to identify the location of esophageal cancer SLN combined with postoperative pathological reports. Discussion This trial will provide more evidence on the extent of lymph node dissection for esophageal cancer and contribute to the development of treatment guidelines for esophageal cancer. Trial registration number NCT04615806.

TI  - A deep learning method for creating globally applicable population estimates from sentinel data
T2  - TRANSACTIONS IN GIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent research has shown promising results for estimating structural area, volume, and population from Sentinel 1 and 2 data at a 10 by 10-m spatial resolution. These studies were, however, conducted in homogeneous countries in Northern Europe. This study presents a deep learning methodology for population estimation in areas geographically distinct from Northern Europe. The two case study areas are Ghana and Egypt's Mediterranean coast, with supplementary ground truth data collected from Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Palestine, and Israel. This study aims to answer the question: How can we use Deep Learning to map structural area and type to derive population estimates for Ghana and Egypt based on Sentinel data? At 10 by 10-m resolution, the accuracy of the presented area predictions is similar to the Google Open Buildings dataset. An intercomparison of the presented population predictions is made with global state-of-the-art spatial population estimates, and the results are promising, with the proposed methodology showing comparable or better results than the state-of-the-art for the study areas.

TI  - Axillary surgery after neoadjuvant therapy in initially node-positive breast cancer: international EUBREAST survey
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background There is no consensus on axillary management after neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) in patients with clinically node-positive (cN+) breast cancer. To investigate current clinical practice, an international survey was conducted among breast surgeons and radiation oncologists. The aim of the first part of the survey was to provide a snapshot of international discrepancies regarding axillary surgery in this context. Methods The European Breast Cancer Research Association of Surgical Trialists (EUBREAST) developed a web-based survey containing 39 questions describing clinical scenarios in the setting of axillary management in patients with cN1 disease converting to ycN0 after NAT. The survey was then distributed to breast surgeons and radiation oncologists via 14 breast cancer societies between April and October 2021. Results Responses from 349 physicians in 45 countries were recorded. The most common post-NAT axillary surgery in patients with cN1 disease converting to ycN0 was targeted axillary dissection (54.2 per cent), followed by sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) alone (20.9 per cent), level 1-2 axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) (18.4 per cent), level 1-3 ALND (4 per cent), and targeted lymph node biopsy (2.5 per cent). For SLNB alone, dual tracers were most commonly used (62.3 per cent). Management varied widely in patients with ambiguous axillary status before initiation of treatment or a residual metastatic burden in the axilla after NAT. In patients with ycN+ tumours, ALND was the preferred surgical approach for 66.8 per cent of respondents. Conclusion These results highlight the wide heterogeneity in surgical approaches to the axilla after NAT. To standardize the guidelines, further data from clinical research are urgently needed, which underlines the importance of the ongoing AXSANA (EUBREAST-3) study.Several discrepancies in the surgical approach to the axilla in patients with cN+ disease converting to ycN0 exist. The most common axillary surgical approaches in patients with cN1 tumours converting to ycN0 are targeted axillary dissection (TAD) and sentinel lymph node biopsy. In targeted lymph node biopsy/TAD, there was a wide heterogeneity with regard to localization techniques.

TI  - Epidemiological and virological surveillance of influenza viruses in China during 2020-2021
T2  - INFECTIOUS DISEASES OF POVERTY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, seasonal influenza activity declined globally and remained below previous seasonal levels, but intensified in China since 2021. Preventive measures to COVID-19 accompanied by different epidemic characteristics of influenza in different regions of the world. To better respond to influenza outbreaks under the COVID-19 pandemic, we analyzed the epidemiology, antigenic and genetic characteristics, and antiviral susceptibility of influenza viruses in the mainland of China during 2020-2021. Methods Respiratory specimens from influenza like illness cases were collected by sentinel hospitals and sent to network laboratories in Chinese National Influenza Surveillance Network. Antigenic mutation analysis of influenza virus isolates was performed by hemagglutination inhibition assay. Next-generation sequencing was used for genetic analyses. We also conducted molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of circulating influenza viruses. Viruses were tested for resistance to antiviral medications using phenotypic and/or sequence-based methods. Results In the mainland of China, influenza activity recovered in 2021 compared with that in 2020 and intensified during the traditional influenza winter season, but it did not exceed the peak in previous years. Almost all viruses isolated during the study period were of the B/Victoria lineage and were characterized by genetic diversity, with the subgroup 1A.3a.2 viruses currently predominated. 37.8% viruses tested were antigenically similar to reference viruses representing the components of the vaccine for the 2020-2021 and 2021-2022 Northern Hemisphere influenza seasons. In addition, China has a unique subgroup of 1A.3a.1 viruses. All viruses tested were sensitive to neuraminidase inhibitors and endonuclease inhibitors, except two B/Victoria lineage viruses identified to have reduced sensitivity to neuraminidase inhibitors. Conclusions Influenza activity increased in the mainland of China in 2021, and caused flu season in the winter of 2021-2022. Although the diversity of influenza (sub)type decreases, B/Victoria lineage viruses show increased genetic and antigenic diversity. The world needs to be fully prepared for the co-epidemic of influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus globally.

TI  - Assessment of land use/land cover changes and its effect on land surface temperature using remote sensing techniques in Southern Punjab, Pakistan
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is defined as a phenomenon which shows that microclimate of an urban system gets heated much faster than its surrounding rural climates. The expansion of buildings has a noteworthy influence on land use/land cover (LULC) due to conversion of vegetation land into commercial and residential areas and their associated infrastructure by which LST is accelerated. The objective of the research was to study the impact of changes in LULC on LST of Southern Punjab (Pakistan) through remote sensing (RS) data. Landsat images of 30-year duration (1987, 1997, 2007 and 2017) were employed for identifying vegetation indices and LST in the study region. These images also helped to work out normalized difference water index (NDWI) and normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) maps. There was an increase from 29620 (3.63 %) to 88038 ha (10.8 %) in built-up area over the 30 years. LST values were found in the range 12-42 degrees C, 11-44 degrees C, 11-45 degrees C and 11-47 degrees C in the years 1987, 1997, 2007 and 2017, respectively. Regression coefficients (R-2) 0.81, 0.78, 0.84 and 0.76 were observed between NDVI and LST in the corresponding years respectively. Our study showed that NDVI and NDWI were negatively correlated with less LST; however, NDBI showed positive correlation with high LST. Our study gives critical information of LULC and LST and will be a helpful tool for policy makers for developing effective policies in managing land resources.

AB  - Land use changes are analyzed correctly, a series of improvements according to the changes are carried out appropriately, the relationship between land use development and economic and human survival is handled correctly, and the healthy and orderly development of the entire society is promoted. Aiming at the combination of multisource remote sensing data and monitoring changes in land planning, this study uses CBERS data and ASAR data as multisource remote sensing data sources to conduct in-depth research and discussion on the land use change in this area and uses the HPF pixel-level fusion method for data fusion to generate HPF. The data are integrated, and then, the CBERS data and HPF fusion data are used to extract the land use type information of Zhenning County, respectively, and a confusion matrix is built based on the field sample points to verify the accuracy, compare and analyze the relative error of the land use type information extraction before and after data fusion, and evaluate the CBERS data. Regarding the extraction effect of land use type information of fusion data with HPF, the results show that the two kinds of remote sensing data have good effects in extracting water body type information, and the accuracy has reached 100%.

TI  - Remote sensing of swidden agriculture in the tropics: A review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The evolution and transformations of swidden agriculture closely relate to ongoing studies of carbon budget, biological diversity, ecosystem services, indigenous wellbeing, and ethnic identities. Remote sensing has become an important tool to quantify and display swidden agriculture in transition. Due to its diversity, dynamics, and complexity, however, the development of universal remote sensing algorithms for mapping swidden agriculture faces major challenges. Although swidden agriculture has increasingly become the focus of climate change and other sustainable initiatives, a systematic review on remote sensing of this farming system in the tropics is seldom reported. With 89 peer-reviewed journal articles related to the identification, mapping, monitoring or forecast of swidden agriculture since the 1970s, the methodological progresses and shortcomings of remote sensing of swidden agriculture were compared and summarized, followed by providing several perspectives on near-future research directions. The conclusions were drawn as follows. Firstly, the limited remote sensing studies of swidden agriculture were mostly reported in Southeast Asia (66%), followed by Latin America and Central Africa. Secondly, Landsat is the most (59%) widely applied to monitor swidden agriculture and also holds huge potential in delineating its trajectories. Thirdly, the spectral feature-based algorithms (76%) are more used than the counterparts of geometric-based and structure-based ones. Finally, several aspects including exploring new data and algorithms for the enhancement of remote sensing of swidden agriculture have been proposed. This review paper might be served as a long-delayed appeal for strengthening remote sensing of swidden agriculture in the tropics for accurately assessing the carbon budget of forest change and other ecological and social effects caused by the evolution and transformations of swidden agriculture.

TI  - Applying optimum fusion method to improve lithological mapping of sedimentary rocks using sentinel-2 and ASTER satellite images
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was set the yield a precise map of geological formations appliying satellite image fusion techniques. Geologic maps are one of the most valuable sources for understanding the geological conditions of a region used to show the spread of different rock and soil outcrops. In the present research, the fusion of ASTER and Sentinel-2 images were applied using Brovey Transform (BT), Gram-Schmidt (GS), Color Normalized (CN), Smoothing Filter-based Intensity Modulation (SFIM) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) methods to prepare the lithological map. Based on the results of the employed methods, DWT and BT methods are good in terms of providing spectral and spatial information, respectively. The results also showed that the SFIM method has appropriate spectral and spatial accuracy. At the classification stage, all fused images were processed through supervised classification algorithm of Support Vector Machine (SVM) to identify and separate the geological formations of the study area. The evaluation of the classifications results demonstrated that the SVM method used in the fused images by SFIM method, with 83.16 overall accuracy and 0.82 kappa coefficient has evidential results for lithological mapping.

TI  - Hybrid approach for cerebral protection in open-heart surgery: Case series
T2  - JOURNAL OF CARDIAC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Stroke remains one of the most important complications of cardiac surgery and occurs in 2.2% after open-heart procedure. It is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The use of a cerebral protection system during transcatheter aortic valve implantation may be associated with a lower risk of periprocedural strokes, and mortality at 30 days. The aim of the present study was to assess the safety and feasibility of this device in patients at high risk for stroke during open cardiac surgery. Methods We present six patients with a high risk of perioperative stroke who underwent placement of Sentinel cerebral protection system during various open-heart operations between 2018 and 2021. Results The system was successfully deployed, and debris was retrieved in all patients. There was no device-related complication or development of ischemic stroke postoperatively. One patient suffered from intracranial hemorrhage due to peri-operative coagulopathy. Conclusions We demonstrated the feasibility and safety of this hybrid approach with a high debris capture rate. It encourages further study to evaluate the benefits of the Sentinel cerebral protection system in reducing stroke and mortality in selected patients undergoing open-heart surgery.

TI  - Retrieval of Tidal Flat Elevation Based on Remotely Sensed Moisture Approach
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to challenging conditions of field survey techniques, it is difficult to measure the topography of tidal flats, an important parameter to understanding the evolution and dynamics of the constantly changing zone. This study used remotely sensed sediment moisture estimates to retrieve tidal flat elevation. The method is based on the observation that the intertidal zone is gradually exposed from land to sea at low tide, meaning that higher elevations contain less moisture. Here, we investigate the nature of the relationship between reflectance and moisture content from Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus images and the study areas as a proxy for mapping the elevation of an exposed tidal flat surface. Statistical analysis confirmed a negative correlation between moisture and elevation; however, the correlation coefficient was relatively weak, and the slope of the intersecting tidal creek was found to be a crucial factor affecting this relationship. After segmenting the slope to correspond to areas of tidal flat and nontidal flat surfaces, the correlation coefficient of the moisture and elevation increased significantly. A retrieval model was then developed to generate the tidal flat elevations of different slope grades. After verification, the retrieval accuracy of the model was up to 17.3 cm. This research study demonstrated that the remotely sensed moisture method is suitable for monitoring the surface elevation of tidal flats.

TI  - Global assessment of partitioning transpiration from evapotranspiration based on satellite solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence data
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - An accurate assessment of terrestrial ecosystem transpiration (T) is important to understand the vegetation-atmosphere feedbacks under climate change. Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) shows great potential to estimate T because of its mechanical linkage with photosynthesis and stomatal conductance. However, a global and spatially estimation of terrestrial T based on remotely sensed SIF remains unresolved and novel strategies are challenged to entail a precise partition of T from evapotranspiration (ET) across various biomes. Here, with far-red SIF from Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite and ground observations for a total of 30 sites encompassing ten primary plant functional types (PFTs), we extend a SIF-driven semi-mechanism canopy conductance (g(c)) model for different plant functional types (PFTs), and use the optimized Penman-Monteith model (PMopt) to calculate T and T/ET. We reveal that the relationship between SIF and the product of gc and 0.5 power of vapor pressure deficit (g(c) x VPD0.5) is tighter than the relationship between SIF and ecosystem productivity. The SIF-g(c) x VPD0.5 linear regressions show improved R-2 and increased magnitude in slopes across PFTs when aggregating daily to 16-day. Our T/ET results show high correlations with the results of the Ball-Berry-Leuning model combined with PMopt at the site scale (R-2 = 0.69), and with the results calculated by leaf area index in a previous study at the PFT scale (0.70). We further determine the global mean T/ET (0.57 +/- 0.14), close to the ensemble mean of global averaged T/ET (0.55), using 36 different methods. The global T estimated using the SIF-based approach is compared with two other remote sensing products. Our method provides a valuable tool for T and ET estimation using remote sensing data and is critical to understanding ecohydrological processes under climate change.

TI  - Measuring and monitoring restored ecosystems: can remote sensing be applied to the ecological recovery wheel to inform restoration success?
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The commencement of the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration has highlighted the urgent need to improve restoration science and fast-track ecological outcomes. The application of remote sensing for monitoring purposes has increased over the past two decades providing a variety of image datasets and derived products suitable to map and measure ecosystem properties (e.g. vegetation species, community composition, and structural dimensions such as height and cover). However, the operational use of remote sensing data and derived products for ecosystem restoration monitoring in research, industry, and government has been relatively limited and underutilized. In this paper, we use the Society for Ecological Restoration (SER) ecological recovery wheel (ERW) to assess the current capacity of drone-airborne-satellite remote sensing datasets to measure each of the SER's recommended attributes and sub-attributes for terrestrial restoration projects. Based on our combined expertise in the areas of ecological monitoring and remote sensing, a total of 11 out of 18 sub-attributes received the highest feasibility score and show strong potential for remote sensing assessments; while sub-attributes such as gene flows, all trophic levels and chemical and physical substrates have a reduced capacity for monitoring. We argue that in the coming decade, ecologists can combine remote sensing with the ERW to monitor restoration recovery and reference ecosystems for improved restoration outcomes at the local, regional, and landscape scales. The ERW approach can be adapted as a monitoring framework for projects to utilize the benefits of remote sensing and inform management through scalable, operational, and meaningful outcomes.

TI  - Accurate resection of nonpalpable, ultrasonography undetectable breast cancer tumor by preoperative indocyanine green injection using stereotactic mammography: A case report
T2  - ANNALS OF MEDICINE AND SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: and importance: Tumor localization is vital in the surgical management of nonpalpable breast cancer. Various localization methods exist, each with their own disadvantages. Therefore, we need to investigate the optimal method of diagnosis for this condition. Case presentation: A 66-year-old woman presented to our facility with a microcalcification detected on screening mammography (MMG). The lesion was neither palpable nor detectable on ultrasonography (US). Three-dimensional stereotactic biopsy using MMG revealed ductal carcinoma in situ. The precise tumor location was needed to perform breast-conserving surgery. Clinical discussion: Our hospital did not have radioisotope imaging; hence, wire placement would have been difficult for this lesion location. To aid in localization, indocyanine green (ICG) and fluorescence imaging were used. ICG was injected preoperatively using stereotactic MMG, which enabled clear visualization of the lesion. Then, an accurate resection was performed. The patient was discharged without any complications 2 days after surgery. Conclusion: The findings of this case report suggest that stereotactic MMG-guided ICG can be useful in localizing breast cancer tumors that are nonpalpable and undetectable by US.

TI  - River Bathymetry Retrieval From Landsat-9 Images Based on Neural Networks and Comparison to SuperDove and Sentinel-2
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Landsat mission has kept an eye on our planet, including water bodies, for 50 years. With the launch of Landsat-9 and its onboard Operational Land Imager 2 (OLI-2) in September 2021, more subtle variations in brightness (14-bit dynamic range) can be captured than previous sensors in the Landsat series (e.g., 12-bit Landsat-8). The enhanced radiometric resolution of OLI-2 appeals to the aquatic remote sensing community because the instrument might be capable of resolving smaller differences in water-leaving radiance. This study evaluates the potential to map river bathymetry from Landsat-9 imagery. We employ a neural network (NN)-based regression model for bathymetry retrieval and compare the results with optimal band ratio analysis (OBRA). The effect of Landsat-9 pan-sharpening on depth retrieval is also examined. In addition, we perform an intersensor comparison with Sentinel-2 and newly available 8-band SuperDoves from the PlanetScope constellation. Depth retrieval results from the Colorado and Potomac Rivers imply that Landsat-9 provided more accurate bathymetry across a range of depths up to 20 m, particularly when pan-sharpened. Downsampling the SuperDove data improved bathymetry retrieval due to enhanced signal-to-noise ratio, most notably in deep waters (maximum detectable depth increased from similar to 15 to similar to 20 m). Similarly, the enhanced spectral resolution of 8-band SuperDoves improved depth retrieval relative to 4-band Doves. The NN-based model outperformed OBRA by incorporating more spectral information.

TI  - An integrated assessment of land use impact, riparian vegetation and lithologic variation on streambank stability in a peri-urban watershed (Nigeria)
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Bank erosion is an important source of sediment and phosphorus to inland fluvial systems and is generally responsible for more than half of the total watershed sediment export. Numerous studies have quantified bank erosion and the spatio-temporal variation of sediment flux in different watersheds. However, there is sparse research to date on the linkages between bank erosion/accretion and sediment export under different land uses, especially in rapidly evolving peri-urban watersheds. This research, therefore, integrated remote sensing techniques and repeated field survey of erosion pin plots to quantify bank erosion and sediment flux in the 80 km(2) Nkisi River watershed (NRW), southeast Nigeria, over a three-year period. The impact of land use change on streambank erosion was evaluated by utilising remotely sensed Landsat datasets of 2003, 2010, 2016 and 2019. Geotechnical tests were used to characterise the lithologic properties of the banks, while the Bank Stability and Toe Erosion Model (BSTEM) was used to determine the stability of the banks under various hydrological conditions and mechanical properties of the riparian vegetation. Mean bank recession rates increased from 10.7 cm during the 2017-2018 monitoring period to 17.5 cm for the 2019-2020 monitoring period. The percentage of total watershed export ascribed to bank erosion in the three stream reaches varied from 6.6 to 44.9%. The high rates of bank erosion and accretion within the NRW were attributed to rapid changes in land use, which evolved from grassland and woodland to cropland, built-up and bare land. The BSTEM accurately predicted the high erosion rates of the streambanks and showed that riparian vegetation has a mechanical effect on bank stability. However, the mechanical effect diminishes as the depth to water table rises during high streamflow events.

TI  - Study on the spatial-temporal pattern and evolution of surface urban heat island in 180 shrinking cities in China
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Under the background of rapid urbanization, the urban heat island effect becomes more and more intense, which is common in many big cities. However, it is unclear whether this change will lead to a new turnaround in the mitigation of the urban heat island effect in shrinking cities with population loss. In this study, based on the MODIS product from 2001 to 2019, we analyzed the spatial and temporal patterns of surface urban heat island (SUHI) in 180 shrinking cities in China. The changes of SUHI at different scales in combination with latitude and climate zones were quantified. The results showed that SUHI intensity varied greatly in different latitudes and climate zones. In the arid zone, the SUHI intensity is the lowest in the daytime and the highest in the night. Combined with the SUHI characteristics of typical expanding cities, SUHI of shrinking cities in China shows a decreasing trend. This indicates that in shrinking cities, the decrease of population has a certain easing effect on SUHI. However, the driving mechanism behind it needs to be further explored so as to put forward specific measures to alleviate SUHI more specifically.

TI  - Soil salinity inversion in coastal cotton growing areas: An integration method using satellite-ground spectral fusion and satellite-UAV collaboration
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinity is a crucial factor in agriculture, rising salinity undermines cotton (Gossypium spp.) production in coastal areas of China and damages crops in other countries. In this study, we propose an effective integration method using satellite-ground spectral fusion and satellite-unmanned arial vehicle (UAV) collaboration for soil salinity monitoring in cotton growing areas. Firstly, an extreme learning machine (ELM), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) models were constructed based on UAV images from test areas. The optimal model was selected for soil salinity inversion. Meanwhile, ground imaging hyperspectrum and SENTINEL-2A multispectral images were differentially fused by nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). Then, taking the inversion results of UAV as the training sample to build convolutional neural network (CNN) model of the fused SENTINEL-2A, the soil salinity distribution map of cotton fields in the study area was obtained by inversion, and the satellite-UAV-ground integrated inversion of soil salinity in coastal cotton fields was realized. The results showed that the spectrum after satellite-ground fusion was closer to the original ground hyperspectrum, the fusion improved the correlation between spectrum and soil salinity, and UAV inversion data possessed great potential for the reference data of satellite inversion. The soil salinity obtained by satellite-UAV-ground integration approach was highly consistent with the measured salinity in the study area (R-2 = 0.805), and the integration approach is suitable for soil salinity inversion in the cotton seedling stage in the coastal area. The satellite-UAV-ground integration approach proposed in this study fully tap the advantages of remote sensing data from different platforms and improved the ability to obtain soil salinisation information in large-scale quantitatively, accurately, and quickly.

TI  - Influence of Tectonic Factor on Porphyry Copper Deposits Localization and Distribution (Arasbaran District, NW Iran): Synthesis of Alteration Patterns and Lineaments Using Digital Techniques
T2  - GEOTECTONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Kighal and Bormolk porphyry copper deposits (PCDs) are known subeconomic deposits and are similar to 10 km south of Sungun, the world-class copper mine in NW Iran. The deposits are located in the Azerbaijan plateau, within Alborz, Zagros, and Caucasus Mountain ranges, having undergone active tectonics, including uplift and thrust-folding from the Cimmerrian Orogeny. The sub-economic nature of the Kighal and Bormolk deposits, despite their relatively close distance and age and lithologic similarity to those of the Sungun deposit, has been discussed. The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery were used to map alteration patterns and lineaments associated with these deposits. In order to discriminate alteration minerals of the deposits in comparison with those in the Sungun deposit, the ASTER image was processed using False Color Composite (FCC), Band Ratio (BR), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF), and Mixture-Tuned Matched-Filtering (MTMF) techniques, which recognize seven alteration types in the Kighal-Bormolk area and three types in the Sungun area, including its more intense alteration systems. The results were verified by field observations, mineralogical, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies. Also, lineament extraction of DEM and Landsat 8 OLI data by Envi 5.1, Geomatica, ArcGIS 10.6, and Rockworks 16, displayed a lower density of fault intersections in the Kighal-Bormolk area. Additionally, NW-SE trending lineaments of the Sungun deposit, which is in accordance with most of the valuable porphyry copper deposits in Iran, are taken into account.

TI  - Effects of spatial scale of atmospheric reanalysis data on clear-sky surface radiation modeling in tropical climates: A case study for Singapore
T2  - SOLAR ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar resource assessments most generally require atmospheric information, which is customarily acquired from gridded datasets. The spatial scale mismatch problem, i.e., the difference in spatial representativeness of gridded data and in situ measurements, therefore becomes relevant. This study examines how the gridded data used as inputs to clear-sky radiation models can affect their performance at urban scale. The tropical island of Singapore is selected for the case study. Aerosol optical depth at 550 nm (AOD550), angstrom ngstrom exponent (AE), and precipitable water (PW) from both the MERRA-2 reanalysis and ground-based stations (AERONET and SuomiNet) are collected between 2013-2020. Firstly, it is found that, relatively to the AERONET ground truth, the bias in MERRA-2's AOD550 is more prominent than that in AE or PW. Next, the bias propagation from the gridded inputs (AOD550, AE, and PW) to clear-sky radiation predictions is explored using various models. The estimated clear-sky direct normal irradiance (DNIcs) is more sensitive to AOD550 variation than the clear-sky global horizontal irradiance (GHIcs). Six clear-sky radiation models, five of which accept MERRA-2 gridded inputs, are compared with each other, and with the in situ irradiance measurements recorded at 9 sites. The inter-model difference across Singapore is remarkably consistent because the whole island fits inside a single MERRA-2 grid cell. Under high-AOD550 situations, however, the inter-model deviation becomes large for both GHIcs and DNIcs. The conventional model-versus-measurement comparison shows that each model achieves very different site-to-site performance, largely because the spatially-averaged inputs cannot fully represent the micro-climatic variability. Relatively speaking, no clear-sky radiation model significantly outperforms its peers. The simple MAC2 model and the empirical (locally derived) YANG GHIcs-only model are recommended for Singapore.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping: Current Applications and Future Perspectives in Gynecology Malignant Tumors
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - The sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) is a group of lymph nodes initially involved in the metastatic spread of cancer cells. SLN mapping refers to intraoperative localization and biopsy of SLNs with specific tracers to assess lymph node metastases. It is widely used in a variety of tumor surgeries for its high sensitivity and high negative predictive value. In the evaluation of the status of lymph node metastases in gynecological malignancies, it has received increasingly more attention due to its minor invasiveness, few complications, and high diagnosis rate. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines provide an excellent introduction to the indications and methods of SLN techniques in vulvar, cervical, and endometrial cancers, but they provide little explanation about some specific issues. In this review, we summarize different dyes and injection methods and discuss the indications of application and the clinical trials of SLN mapping in gynecological malignant tumors, aiming to provide a reference for the rational application of sentinel techniques in gynecology malignant tumors before relevant guidelines are updated.

TI  - Ground-Level NO<sub>2</sub> Surveillance from Space Across China for High Resolution Using Interpretable Spatiotemporally Weighted Artificial Intelligence
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - ABSTRACT: Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) at the ground level poses a serious threat to environmental quality and public health. This study developed a novel, artificial intelligence approach by integrating spatiotemporally weighted information into the missing extra-trees and deep forest models to first fill the satellite data gaps and increase data availability by 49% and then derive daily 1 km surface NO2 concentrations over mainland China with full spatial coverage (100%) for the period 2019-2020 by combining surface NO2 measurements, satellite tropospheric NO2 columns derived from TROPOMI and OMI, atmospheric reanalysis, and model simulations. Our daily surface NO2 estimates have an average out-of-sample (out-of-city) cross-validation coefficient of determination of 0.93 (0.71) and rootmean-square error of 4.89 (9.95) mu g/m3. The daily seamless high-resolution and high-quality dataset "ChinaHighNO2" allows us to examine spatial patterns at fine scales such as the urban-rural contrast. We observed systematic large differences between urban and rural areas (28% on average) in surface NO2, especially in provincial capitals. Strong holiday effects were found, with average declines of 22 and 14% during the Spring Festival and the National Day in China, respectively. Unlike North America and Europe, there is little difference between weekdays and weekends (within +/- 1 mu g/m3). During the COVID-19 pandemic, surface NO2 concentrations decreased considerably and then gradually returned to normal levels around the 72nd day after the Lunar New Year in China, which is about 3 weeks longer than the tropospheric NO2 column, implying that the former can better represent the changes in NOx emissions.

TI  - Consistency assessment of multi-date PlanetScope imagery for seagrass percent cover mapping in different seagrass meadows
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Seagrass percent cover is a crucial and influential component of the biophysical characteristics of seagrass beds and is a key parameter for monitoring seagrass conditions. Therefore, the availability of seagrass percent cover maps greatly assists in sustainable coastal ecosystem management. This research aimed to assess the consistency of PlanetScope imagery for seagrass percent cover mapping using two study areas, namely Parang Island and Labuan Bajo, Indonesia. Assessing the consistency of the PlanetScope imagery performance in seagrass percent cover mapping helps understand the effects of variations in the image quality on its performance in monitoring changes in seagrass cover. Percent cover maps were derived using object-based image analysis (image segmentation and random forest) and pixel-based random forest algorithm. Accuracy assessment and consistency analysis were conducted on the basis of the following three approaches: overall accuracy consistency, agreement percentage and consistent pixel locations. Results show that PlanetScope images can fairly consistently map seagrass percent cover for a specific area across different dates. However, these images produced different levels of accuracy when used for mapping in seagrass meadows with various characteristics and benthic cover complexities. The mapping accuracy (OA-overall accuracy) and consistency (AP-agreement percentage) in patchy seagrass meadows (Parang Island, mean OA 18.4%-38.6%, AP 44.1%-70.3%) are different from those in continuous seagrass meadows (Labuan Bajo, OA 43.0%-56.2%, and AP 41.8%-55.8%). Moreover, PlanetScope images are consistent when used for mapping seagrasses with low and high percent covers but strive to obtain good consistency for medium percent cover due to the combination of seagrass and non-seagrass in a pixel. Furthermore, images with relatively similar image acquisition conditions (i.e., winds, aerosol optical depth, signal-to-noise ratio, and sunglint intensity) produce better consistency. The OA is related to the image acquisition conditions, whilst the AP is related to variation in these conditions. Nevertheless, PlanetScope is still the best high spatial resolution image that provides daily acquisition and is highly beneficial for various applications in tropical areas with persistent cloud coverage.

TI  - Quantifying the sensitivity of SAR and optical images three-level fusions in land cover classification to registration errors
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical (SAR-optical) data are two important remote sensing data sources. Fusing them is expected to lead to complementary information that benefits land cover classification (LCC). The fusion of SAR-optical images occurs in three levels, i.e., pixel-level, feature-level, and decision-level. However, accurately registering SAR-optical images is still a challenge, and geometric registration errors will bring great uncertainty to LCC based on SAR-optical images fusion. Therefore, this study quantitatively evaluates the sensitivity of SAR-optical images three-level fusions to registration errors through simulation experiments. The results show that: (1) geometric registration errors affect LCC based on SAR-optical images fusion at three levels in a significant manner. Among them, feature-level fusion is the least sensitive to registration errors. (2) the fusion taken optical image as reference image presents better tolerance to registration errors than that based on SAR image. (3) the response of SAR-optical images fusion to registration errors in LCC of heterogeneous regions is greater than that in homogeneous regions. (4) during the LCC, the fusion of SAR-optical images with comparable spatial resolution has a higher tolerance of registration errors. (5) fusing SAR-optical data does not always guarantee the improvement of LCC compared to using optical data alone, depending on fusion levels, fusion methods and classifiers. We believe these findings can greatly benefit the research community in developing new SAR-optical images fusion methods to improve LCC in the future.

TI  - Impact of current and future land use change on biodiversity in Nanliu River Basin, Beibu Gulf of South China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The temporal and spatial dynamics of biodiversity and its future trends are of great significance for maintaining biodiversity pattern and ensuring regional ecological security in the Nanliu River Basin of Beibu Gulf. At present, most studies are concerned with the assessment of biodiversity in historical period, but few studies focused on the prediction of biodiversity under several scenarios in future years, and the history and future spatial simulation of habitat quality has not been carried out. Therefore, the establishment of biodiversity simulation studies under different scenarios in the future plays a crucial role in the sustainable development of regional social economy. This study takes Nanliu River Basin, which only flows into the sea in the Beibu Gulf, as the research object. Based on land use data and social and economic data interpreted from remote sensing data in 2000, 2010 and 2020, Conversion of Land Use and its Effects at Small Region Extent (CLUE-S) model was used to simulate and predict land use patterns for ecological protection scenarios, natural growth scenarios and food security scenarios in 2030. The Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Service and Tradeoff (InVEST) model was used to evaluate the biodiversity of different scenarios in the past and future and discuss the habitat quality and degradation degree of biodiversity in the watershed. Results were presented as follows. In 2000-2020, an increasing trend of construction land, shrub land and water area was found in the Nanliu River basin of Beibu Gulf. The largest increase was observed in construction land, and the largest decrease was noted in cultivated land and woodland. The best habitat quality will be under the ecological protection scenario in 2030. The biodiversity in the upstream and downstream of the three scenarios showed varying degrees of improvement, and the midstream exhibited a degradation trend. The research results of this paper can make up for the vacancy of biodiversity habitat evaluation system in Nanliu River Basin at home and abroad, and have important theoretical and practical significance for promoting ecological protection and ecological planning of watershed.

TI  - A Warm and A Cold Spot in Cape Cod Waters Amid the Recent New England Shelf Warming
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the widely recognized warming of the New England Continental Shelf (NES), climate patterns of the shelf's economically and ecologically important coastal environments remain less examined. Here we use a satellite sea-surface temperature (SST) analysis gridded on 0.05 degrees C spatial resolution to show, for the first time, the existence of a warm and a cold spot in the environs of Cape Cod, Massachusetts amid the NES warming of the past 15 years. The warm spot refers to an increasing warming trend in shallow waters of Nantucket Sound sheltered by the islands of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket. The summer SST maxima have increased by 3.1 +/- 1.0 degrees C (p), about three times faster than the warming elsewhere on the NES, and the summer season has lengthened by 20 +/- 7 days (p). The cold spot refers to an increasing cooling trend over Nantucket Shoals, an area of shallow sandy shelf that extends south and southeast from Nantucket Island and also known for strong tidal mixing. The strong cooling trend during June-August reduced the SST maxima by -2.5 +/- 1.2 degrees C (p) and shortened the warm season by -32 +/- 11 days (p). Away from the Cape Cod waters, the broad warming on the shelf is attributable to a forward shifted annual cycle. The shift is most significant in August-November, during which the summer temperatures lingered longer into the fall, producing a pronounced warming and delaying the onset of the fall season by 13 +/- 6 days (p). The three different patterns of SST phenology trends displayed by the respective warm spot, the cold spot, and the broad shelf highlight the highly dynamically diverse responses of coastal waters under climate warming. Finally, the study showed that spatial resolution of SST datasets affects the characterization of the spatial heterogeneity in the nearshore SSTs. The widely used Optimum Interpolation SST (OISST) on 0.25 degrees C resolution was examined. Although the two SST datasets agree well with the measurements from the moored buoys at four locations, OISST does not have the cold spot and shows a higher rate of warming on the shelf.

TI  - Assimilation of wheat and soil states for improved yield prediction: The APSIM-EnKF framework
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate prediction of within-field crop yield in response to spatial and temporal variability provides essential information for farm managers to improve productivity and ensure optimal use of inputs. Understanding yield spatial and temporal variability cannot be solely addressed by crop modelling or remote sensing but by inte-grating the instantaneous spatial information from remote sensing and the temporal information from crop modelling. Sequential data assimilation techniques allow wheat and soil observations to be assimilated into the crop model while it evolves and evaluate model and observational uncertainties to improve the accuracy of crop monitoring and yield prediction.Objectives: The objective of this study was to comprehensively explore the potential yield estimation improve-ment by assimilating observations of all prognostic wheat and soil states, including various repeat intervals and accuracy, allowing recommendations on implementation to be made.Methods: This study develops an Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) data assimilation framework for the APSIM-Wheat model and illustrates potential improvements in wheat yield estimation through a synthetic study. Through several scenarios, assimilation of wheat and soil observations into APSIM was explored, by assimilating these variables solely or collectively, and in various phenological stages.Results and conclusions. The results showed, under the specific weather and soil conditions assumed in this study, that while open-loop (no data assimilation) provided a yield estimation with a bias of 10.1%, assimilation in the flowering to end of grain filling stage reduced the bias to 1.4%, 2.9%, 4.4%, and 1.0% when constraining with leaf area index, leaf weight, stem weight, surface soil moisture observations, respectively. When assimilating in the floral initiation to the flowering stage, the yield estimation bias was reduced to 7.1%, 9.8%, 1.1%, and 1.2% when constraining with leaf nitrogen, stem nitrogen, top-layer soil ammonium-nitrogen and nitrate-nitrogen, respectively. Leaf area index, biomass and surface soil moisture are recommended for data assimilation especially with observations from remote sensing.Significance: This study developed a data assimilation framework for the APSIM-Wheat model and can be extended to over 20 crop modules integrated with APSIM. This synthetic study provided a exhaustive data assimilation experiment for wheat and soil states that are measurable by current techniques with a rigorous justification on uncertainties. It thus provides a guide for future agricultral data assimilation practices in choosing crop and soil states for assimilation, and for planning the timing and frequency of data collection. It should also inspire researchers to develop new techniques for measuring wheat states.

TI  - Urban green and blue space changes: A spatiotemporal evaluation of impacts on ecosystem service value in Bangladesh
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid decline in urban green (UGS) and blue space (UBS) in developing countries has led to a widespread degradation of available ecosystem services (ES). However, impacts of UGS and UBS changes on ES tend to vary over space and time, and to date these impacts have not been studied in sufficient detail in emerging economies. By comparing UGS and UBS change patterns with multitemporal Landsat data recorded during the past 30 years (1991-2021), this study has examined the impact of several factors on ES in some of the world's climate hotspots. Although obtaining relevant and accurate information on ES is difficult in many parts of the developing world, this work has developed baseline data suitable for assessing ES loss over five densely populated cities in Bangladesh - Dhaka, Chattogram, Khulna, Rajshahi, and Sylhet. ES loss was quantified in monetary terms using adjusted value coefficients. The topographic and anthropogenic factors driving spatial differences in ES degradation in these cities were analyzed with a geographical detector. The results indicated that the cities experienced a combined monetary loss of USD 628.58 million as a result of specific ES degradation, primarily due to the decline of UGS and UBS. The value of ES loss was notably higher in Dhaka and Chattogram than in the other cities due to marked differences in anthropogenic activities. Population growth, extensive urban sprawl, and the development of dense road networks were identified as the major causes of urban green and blue space loss and consequent reduction of ES. The findings of this study provide important insights which can be used to support the formulation of public policies and management plans aimed at restoring and maintaining sustainable urban ecosystems.

TI  - Evaluating irrigation status in the Mekong Delta through polarimetric L-band SAR data assimilation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - For sustainable food production in the Mekong Delta, local information on irrigation status is essential for allocating water resources efficiently at the community level. ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 L-band SAR can be used to detect submerged and nonsubmerged soil covered by rice plants at a spatial resolution compatible with field observation but a low temporal resolution. In this study, a new multiscale data assimilation technique is developed to estimate the spatiotemporal dynamics of field water levels at a temporal resolution appropriate to inform decision-making on when to initiate irrigation. The method employs an irrigation model based on parameters representing farmers' irrigation practices. ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data are used to derive the hydrological parameters of the model, including an irrigation parameter representing how deep the field water level dropped until the next round of irrigation was initiated. We developed observation operators for the soil submersion status under vegetation and spatial submersion percentages instead of assimilating soil moisture products. The study uses ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data (25-100 m spatial resolution, approximately every 42 days) over the Mekong Delta and experimental data collected in situ for model initialization and validation. The estimated irrigation parameter controlling the maximum depth of field water level showed spatiotemporal consistency with the ground-observed value (RMSE = 4.24 cm). The values of the parameters also showed spatial consistency with respect to DEM data; he paddies with low irrigation model parameter values were prone to be located in low -elevation zones (< 2 m), whereas high model parameters values tended to be located in paddies in the high -elevation zones (> 3 m).The results show promising applications using L-band SAR observations for monitoring paddy field water level, for irrigation practices and for estimation of the water consumption and of methane emissions.

TI  - Time-series surface water gap filling based on spatiotemporal neighbourhood similarity
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical satellite-derived surface water monitoring is challenging because of the spatial gaps in images caused by clouds, cloud shadows, voids, etc. Here, an efficient method for filling gaps in time-series surface water images is proposed, based on the spatiotemporal characteristics of water. This method utilises the accurately classified historical ternary (gap, water, non-water) or binary (water, non-water) water image time-series and the clear part of the ternary gap water image. Pixels with values of 0 and 1 in the same period water occurrence image are first used to correct the gap water image. The spatial neighbourhood similarity is then calculated as a quality control band for mosaicking the accurately classified historical water images. The final result is generated by replacing the gap pixels with a mosaic image. The proposed method was implemented on the Google Earth Engine, and 93 Landsat 8 top-of-atmosphere (TOA) images were used to verify its validity. Quantitative evaluations were adequate, with a mean accuracy, recall, and precision of 0.98, 0.90, and 0.85, respectively. The proposed method could improve the utilisation of optical remote sensing data and would be applicable to the production of large-area homogeneous surface water time-series and water resource monitoring.

TI  - The Use of Indocyanine Green (ICG) and Near-Infrared (NIR) Fluorescence-Guided Imaging in Gastric Cancer Surgery: A Narrative Review
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Near-infrared fluorescence imaging with indocyanine green is an emerging technology gaining clinical relevance in the field of oncosurgery. In recent decades, it has also been applied in gastric cancer surgery, spreading among surgeons thanks to the diffusion of minimally invasive approaches and the related development of new optic tools. Its most relevant uses in gastric cancer surgery are sentinel node navigation surgery, lymph node mapping during lymphadenectomy, assessment of vascular anatomy, and assessment of anastomotic perfusion. There is still debate regarding the most effective application, but with relatively no collateral effects and without compromising the operative time, indocyanine green fluorescence imaging carved out a role for itself in gastric resections. This review aims to summarize the current indications and evidence for the use of this tool, including the relevant practical details such as dosages and times of administration.

TI  - The ecotoxicology of marine tributyltin (TBT) hotspots: A review
T2  - MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Tributyltin (TBT) was widely used as a highly efficient biocide in antifouling paints for ship and boat hulls. Eventually, TBT containing paints became globally banned when TBT was found to cause widespread contam-ination and non-target adverse effects in sensitive species, with induced pseudohermaphroditism in female neogastropods (imposex) being the best-known example. In this review, we address the history and the status of knowledge regarding TBT pollution and marine TBT hotspots, with a special emphasis on the Norwegian coastline. The review also presents a brief update on knowledge of TBT toxicity in various marine species and humans, highlighting the current understanding of toxicity mechanisms relevant for causing endocrine disrup-tion in marine species. Despite observations of reduced TBT sediment concentrations in many marine sediments over the recent decades, contaminant hotspots are still prevalent worldwide. Consequently, efforts to monitor TBT levels and assessment of potential effects in sentinel species being potentially susceptible to TBT in these locations are still highly warranted.

Improved assessment of SGD occurrences provides information to constrain current estimates of total freshwater discharges, which are crucial for evaluation of changes in the global water cycle. This study leverages SGD linkages to patterns in sea surface temperature (SST) and color. Typically, groundwater temperatures exhibit less variability than SST and tend to have temperature distinct from sea water. Consequently, thermally anomalous plumes often occur in coastal areas with SGD. Nutrient-enriched groundwater flows have been linked to changes in ocean color as a consequence of algae growth and of the presence of colored dissolved organic matter. Under such conditions, SGD presence may also manifest as plumes of different colors. Changes in SST and color can be captured through satellite imagery for the thermal infrared and visible bands, which are used here to detect potential SGD (PSGD) occurrences. A method based on clustering and spectroscopy techniques is applied to automatically detect PSGD plumes. SST data are clustered to map SST anomalies. Derivative analysis and angular distance are applied to identify a color signature linked to SGD. In a novel approach, SST and color are combined to identify PSGD through remote sensing. The methods presented in this study were applied to Landsat 7 and 8 imagery captured over southern Ireland and the west coast of the Island of HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai, where past field surveys of radon isotopes activities and salinity have documented SGD occurrences. These selected sites are used as validation points. Derivative analysis and angular distance resulted in PSGD plumes in the vicinity of sampled locations, mainly locations with samples that are strong indicators of SGD. In general, the PSGD plumes derived from each method are compared as independent, parallel lines of evidence of PSGD occurrences. Results also show that PSGD pixels from derivative analysis and angular distance alone, without considering SST, can be obfuscated by confounding factors, such as low tides and unrelated chlorophyll enrichment, and that combining SST and color data reduces those effects. These results provide further evidence for PSGD occurrences along the south coast of Ireland and the west coast of the Island of HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai, and showcase that satellite data can be used to better identify the location of PSGD occurrences over large areas.

TI  - Prediction of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Status in Breast Cancers with PET/CT Negative Axilla
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Aim Prior knowledge of axillary node status can spare a lot of patients with early breast cancer morbidity due to an unnecessary axillary dissection. Our study compared various metabolic and pathological features that can predict the sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) status in patients with positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) negative axilla. Patients and Methods All consecutive patients with early breast cancers (< 5 cm) with PET/CT negative axilla who underwent breast surgery and SLNB from November 2016 to February 2020 were included. Various primary tumor (PT) pathological variables and metabolic variables on PET/CT such as maximum standardized uptake value (PT-SUV (max) ), metabolic tumor volume (PT-MTV), and total lesion glycolysis (PT-TLG) were compared using univariate and multivariate analyses for prediction of SLNB status. Results Overall 70 patients, all female, with mean age 55.6 years (range: 33-77) and mean tumor size 2.2 cm (range: 0.7-4.5), were included. SLNB was positive in 20% of patients ( n = 14) with nonsentinel nodes positive in 4% ( n = 3) patients. Comparing SLNB positive and negative groups, univariate analysis showed significant association of SLNB with low tumor grade, positive lymphovascular invasion (LVI), positive estrogen receptor (ER) status with lower mean K (i) -67 index (34.41 vs. 52.02%; p = 0.02), PT-SUV (max) (5.40 vs. 8.68; p = 0.036), PT-MTV (4.71 cc vs. 7.46 cc; p = 0.05), and PT-TLG (15.12 g/mL.cc vs. 37.10 g/mL.cc; p = 0.006). On multivariate analysis, only LVI status was a significant independent predictor of SLNB status (odds ratio = 6.23; 95% confidence interval: 1.15-33.6; p = 0.033). Conclusion SLNB is positive in approximately 20% of early breast cancers with PET/CT negative axilla and SLNB status appears to be independent of PT size. SLNB+ PTs were more likely to be LVI+ and ER + ve, with lower grade/K (i) -67/metabolic activity (SUV (max) /MTV/TLG) compared with SLNB-ve tumors. Logistic regression analysis revealed LVI status as the only significant independent predictor of sentinel lymph node status.

TI  - Development of a methodological approach to estimate vegetation biomass using remote sensing in the Brazilian semiarid NE region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate estimation of vegetation biomass over large areas is still a significant challenge. The evolution of low-cost geotechnologies is rapidly facilitating this task, but their use to estimate biomass on tropical dry forests (TDFs) is still scarce. TDFs cover large areas and are currently among the most threatened global ecosystems due to intense anthropic pressures. Therefore, there is a need for the development of tools capable of monitoring the complex spatial-temporal dynamics of these highly variable ecosystems. We developed a methodology to estimate aboveground biomass stocks in a tropical dry forest (known as "Caatinga "), native to the semiarid region of Northeast Brazil, using field and orbital data, regression models, and high-performance computation. We combined twenty types of vegetation spectral indices and isolated spectral bands of the Landsat 8 satellite OLI sensor to generate regression model equations that could predict biomass stocks. The selected models were applied in a cloud processing routine developed using Google Earth Engine (GEE) to estimate the biomass (30 m pixel resolution) in the entire semiarid region of Pernambuco state (85,900 km2), using the years 2017 and 2018 as references. The regression models were capable of predicting the biomass in dense Caatinga (mu 32.6 Mg ha(-1 )R(2) 0.52), open Caatinga (mu 11.4 Mg ha(-1)-R(2 )0.56), and pasturelands (mu 4.2 Mg ha(-1 )R(2) 0.94). Using the equations previously defined and the map of the Brazilian Annual Coverage and Land Use Mapping (Mapbiomas) we developed a workflow script in GEE to plot a map that represents the biomass stock over the entire semiarid region of Pernambuco. The system plotted the distribution and amount of biomass with similar results to those available in the literature. Given the large area of the region, the biomass was estimated with reasonable precision in spatial and temporal distribution, while demanding little time and hardware costs. Future refinements of the method will be pursued, but the proposed version represents an improvement in the capability to provide reliable estimates and contributes to monitor the biomass dynamics in the in semiarid region of NE Brazil.

TI  - Land capital and emissions convergence in an extended Green Solow model
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The main purpose of this paper is to analyze the contribution of land capital to the growth of emissions and income per capita in the long run. We collect new satellite data from the Earth Observatory to obtain estimates of the Enhanced Vegetation Index at the country level for the period 2000-2015. We use these data and the World Bank wealth estimates of natural capital to calibrate and empirically test an extension of the Green Solow model with land degradation and land capital investment. We show that the model is consistent with the cross-country variation in growth rates of carbon emissions per capita and find that there is convergence at the global level, with the contribution of land capital investment to the growth of emissions being negative and significant in all specifications.

TI  - Estimating Biophysical Parameters of Native Grasslands Using Spectral Data Derived from Close Range Hyperspectral and Satellite Data
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating biophysical parameters of native grassland enables management changes that affect ecological processes and economic benefits. Although multiple hyperspectral studies were focused on native grasslands, just a few compare data at different scales and among ecoregions. In this study, we compared data collected at different spectral and spatial scales and among Canadian Prairie ecoregions. Field observations indicate that the Fescue Ecoregion grasslands has specific dominant species, while the Moist-Mixed and Mixed Ecoregions share similar dominant species, which is important in determining parameters such as leaf area index (LAI) and canopy height. Hyperspectral measurements showed a specific signature for the Fescue Ecoregion, due to denser canopies, while the Moist-Mixed and Mixed Ecoregions showed similar spectral characteristics to each other. The correlation between biophysical parameters and spectral indices reveals the importance of LAI, since it was significantly correlated with all spectral indices analyzed. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), and the Plant Senescence Reflectance Index (PSRI) showed significant correlations with biophysical parameters. The comparison results indicated the PSRI being overestimated at all sites (satellite data) and NDVI underestimated at all sites. Finally, the satellite-derived LAI showed a significant positive relationship with the field-measured LAI.

TI  - Medium Spatial Resolution Mapping of Global Land Cover and Land Cover Change Across Multiple Decades From Landsat
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover maps are essential for characterizing the biophysical properties of the Earth's land areas. Because land cover information synthesizes a rich array of information related to both the ecological condition of land areas and their exploitation by humans, they are widely used for basic and applied research that requires information related to land surface properties (e.g., terrestrial carbon models, water balance models, weather, and climate models) and are core inputs to models and analyses used by natural resource scientists and land managers. As the Earth's global population has grown over the last several decades rates of land cover change have increased dramatically, with enormous impacts on ecosystem services (e.g., biodiversity, water supply, carbon sequestration, etc.). Hence, accurate information related to land cover is essential for both managing natural resources and for understanding society's ecological, biophysical, and resource management footprint. To address the need for high-quality land cover information we are using the global record of Landsat observations to compile annual maps of global land cover from 2001 to 2020 at 30 m spatial resolution. To create these maps we use features derived from time series of Landsat imagery in combination with ancillary geospatial data and a large database of training sites to classify land cover at annual time step. The algorithm that we apply uses temporal segmentation to identify periods with stable land cover that are separated by breakpoints in the time series. Here we provide an overview of the methods and data sets we are using to create global maps of land cover. We describe the algorithms used to create these maps and the core land cover data sets that we are creating through this effort, and we summarize our approach to accuracy assessment. We also present a synthesis of early results and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of our early map products and the challenges that we have encountered in creating global land cover data sets from Landsat. Initial accuracy assessment for North America shows good overall accuracy (77.0 & PLUSMN; 2.0% correctly classified) and 79.8% agreement with the European Space Agency (ESA) WorldCover product. The land cover mapping results we report provide the foundation for robust, repeatable, and accurate mapping of global land cover and land cover change across multiple decades at 30 m spatial resolution from Landsat.

TI  - Performance of MODIS Deep Blue Collection 6.1 Aerosol Optical Depth Products Over Indonesia: Spatiotemporal Variations and Aerosol Types
T2  - ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to evaluate the performance of the long-term Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Deep Blue (DB) Collection 6.1 (C6.1) in determining the spatiotemporal variation of aerosol optical depth (AOD) and aerosol types over Indonesia. For this purpose, monthly MODIS DB AOD datasets are directly compared with Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) Version 3 Level 2.0 (cloud-screened and quality-assured) monthly measurements at 8 sites throughout Indonesia. The results indicate that MODIS DB AOD retrievals and AERONET AOD measurements have a high correlation in Sumatra Island (i.e., Kototabang (r = 0.88) and Jambi (r = 0.9)) and Kalimantan Island (i.e., Palangkaraya (r = 0.89) and Pontianak (r = 0.92)). However, the correlations are low in Bandung, Palu, and Sorong. In general, MODIS DB AOD tends to overestimate AERONET AOD at all sites by 16 to 61% and can detect extreme fire events in Sumatra and Kalimantan Islands quite well. Aerosol types in Indonesia mostly consist of clean continental, followed by biomass burning/urban industrial and mixed aerosols. Palu and Sorong had the highest clean continental aerosol contribution (90%), while Bandung had the highest biomass burning/urban-industrial aerosol contribution to atmospheric composition (93.7%). For mixed aerosols, the highest contribution was found in Pontianak, with a proportion of 48.4%. Spatially, the annual mean AOD in the western part of Indonesia is higher than in the eastern part. Seasonally, the highest AOD is observed during the period of September-November, which is associated with the emergence of fire events.

TI  - Biocompatible Tantalum Nanoparticles as Radiosensitizers for Enhancing Therapy Efficacy in Primary Tumor and Metastatic Sentinel Lymph Nodes
T2  - ACS NANO
M3  - Article
AB  - Metastasis of breast carcinoma is commonly realized through lymphatic circulation, which seriously threatens the lives of breast cancer patients. Therefore, efficient therapy for both primary tumor and metastatic sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) is highly desired to inhibit cancer growth and metastasis. During breast cancer treatment, radiotherapy (RT) is a common clinical method. However, the efficacy of RT is decreased by the radioresistance to a hypoxic microenvironment and inevitable side effects for healthy issues at high radiation doses. Considering the above-mentioned, we provide high biocompatible poly(vinylpyrrolidone) coated Ta nanoparticles (Ta@PVP NPs) for photothermal therapy (PTT) assisted RT for primary tumor and metastatic SLNs. On the one hand, for primary tumor treatment, Ta@PVP NPs with a high X-ray mass attenuation coefficient (4.30 cm(2)/kg at 100 keV) can deposit high radiation doses within tumors. On the other hand, for metastatic SLNs treatment, the effective delivery of Tap PVP NPs from the primary tumor into SLNs is monitored by computed tomography and photoacoustic imaging, which greatly benefit the prognosis and treatment for metastatic SLNs. Moreover, TapPVP NPs-mediated PTT could enhance the RT effect, and immunogenic cell death caused by RT/PTT could induce an immune response to improve the therapeutic effect of metastatic SLNs. This study not only explores the potential of TapPVP NPs as effective radiosensitizers and photothermal agents for combined RT and PTT but also offers an efficient strategy to cure both primary tumor and metastatic SLNs in breast carcinoma.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Alone is Adequate for Chemotherapy Decisions in Postmenopausal Early-Stage Hormone-Receptor-Positive, HER2-Negative Breast Cancer with One to Three Positive Sentinel Lymph Nodes
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The RxPONDER trial randomized patients with cT1-3N0 hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative (HR(+)HER2(-)) breast cancer and one to three positive nodes and Recurrence Score (RS) < 26 to endocrine therapy (ET) or chemoendocrine therapy (CET) with equivalent survival in postmenopausal women. In current practice, cN0 patients with one or two positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) do not undergo axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), raising concerns about applying these data in patients who may have additional nodal disease. Methods We identified institutional [Dana-Farber Brigham Cancer Center (DF/BCC), 2016-2020] and national [National Cancer Database (NCDB), 2012-2017] cohorts of women aged 50-75 years with cT1-3N0 HR(+)HER2(-) breast cancer and RS < 26 treated with upfront surgery with one to three positive SLN. Axillary nodal burden and outcomes were assessed on the basis of the number of positive nodes and CET use. Results A total of 197 and 13,499 HR(+)HER2(-) eligible patients with one to three positive SLN and RS < 26 were identified in the DF/BCC and NCDB databases, respectively, and 12.7% of DF/BCC and 32.4% of NCDB patients had ALND. Of these, only 12.0 and 4.9% had more than three total positive nodes, respectively. Rates of CET were 6.6% in DF/BCC and 20.9% in NCDB patients. In the NCDB, similar adjusted 4-year overall survival was seen between patients treated with CET or ET for any number of positive nodes (98.1-99.9%, all p > 0.05). Conclusions Postmenopausal women with cT1-3N0 HR(+)HER2(-) breast cancer and RS < 26 with one to three positive SLN are unlikely to have more than three total positive nodes. CET decisions should continue to be based on SLN biopsy as ALND is unlikely to change treatment recommendations or outcomes.

TI  - Barriers and challenges in providing standard breast cancer care in low resource settings
T2  - TROPICAL DOCTOR
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we investigated the barriers to the delivery of internationally accepted breast cancer care in low resource settings (LRS) as compared to well-endowed resource settings (WRS) via an online survey. The survey was completed by 199 surgeons from eleven countries: 51 from WRS and 148 from LRS, based on our definition. The two most common facilities lacking in LRS were sentinel lymph node biopsy and immune-histochemistry (67% and 60% respectively). Only 22% respondents from LRS confirmed that all their eligible patients received hormonal therapy and only 8% radiotherapy as compared to 98% and 75% from WRS. Widespread limitations exist in most LRS, making internationally accepted breast cancer treatment guidelines impossible to follow, and thus resulting in suboptimal cancer care.

TI  - Toward Exempting from Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in T1 Breast Cancer Patients: A Retrospective Study
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Objective: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is used to assess the status of axillary lymph node (ALN), but it causes many adverse reactions. Considering the low rate of sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis in T1 breast cancer, this study aims to identify the characteristics of T1 breast cancer without SLN metastasis and to select T1 breast cancer patients who avoid SLNB through constructing a nomogram. Methods: A total of 1,619 T1 breast cancer patients with SLNB in our hospital were enrolled in this study. Through univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis, we analyzed the tumor anatomical and clinicopathological factors and constructed the Heilongjiang Medical University (HMU) nomogram. We selected the patients exempt from SLNB by using the nomogram. Results: In the training cohort of 1,000 cases, the SLN metastasis rate was 23.8%. Tumor volume, swollen axillary lymph nodes, pathological types, and molecular subtypes were found to be independent predictors for SLN metastasis in multivariate regression analysis. Distance from nipple or surface and position of tumor have no effect on SLN metastasis. A regression model based on the results of the multivariate analysis was developed to predict the risk of SLN metastasis, indicating an AUC of 0.798. It showed excellent diagnostic performance (AUC = 0.773) in the validation cohort. Conclusion: The HMU nomogram for predicting SLN metastasis incorporates four variables, including tumor volume, swollen axillary lymph nodes, pathological types, and molecular subtypes. The SLN metastasis rates of intraductal carcinoma and HER2 enriched are 2.05% and 6.67%. These patients could be included in trials investigating the SLNB exemption.

TI  - Analysis of spatial-temporal variation of the saline-sodic soil in the west of Jilin Province from 1989 to 2019 and influencing factors
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization is a serious land degradation phenomenon that significantly affects regional economies and agricultural development. Since the 1980s, the state of soil salinization has been constantly changing due to various climatic conditions, human activities, and the application of soil improvement measures. In this study, the Landsat-5 TM and Landsat-8 OLI satellites, launched in 1984 and 2013, respectively, were used to track changes in soil electrical conductivity (EC), a key indicator of soil salinity. A remote-sensing inversion model for the EC of saline-sodic soil was established (R = 0.5), and the soil EC in western Jilin Province from 1989 to 2019 was inverted. Then, the temporal and spatial variation characteristics of the soil salinization degree were counted, and the related variables and influencing factors were analyzed. The results are in good agreement with the conclusion that meteorological conditions are the most relevant and important factors in soil salinization. The area of saline soil increased continuously in the natural state (from 1989 to 1999), and the implementation of government policies (1999 to 2019) reversed the saline soil expansion, converting large areas of saline soil to grassland and cropland. This study is the first to quantitatively analyze the degree of soil salinization and its influencing factors in western Jilin Province from 1989 to 2019; this work also successfully predicted and monitored the variation in soil salinization. This provides data support for the study of the dominant elements in soil salinization changes and the rational development of land.

TI  - Multiscale DenseNet Meets With Bi-RNN for Hyperspectral Image Classification
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Convolutional neural network (CNN) has been successfully introduced to hyperspectral image (HSI) classification and achieved effective performance. With the depth of the CNN increases, it may cause the gradient to become zero, and the structure lacks the utilization of the correlated spatial feature information between different convolutional layers. At the same time, this single-scale convolution kernel is insufficient in expressing the complex spatial structure information of HSI. In addition, the CNN-based methods treat the HSIs spectral band data as a disordered vector in the process of feature extraction, which abandons the exploitation of its internal spectral correlations. To address these issues, we propose a novel spectral-spatial network classification framework based on multiscale dense connected convolutional network (DenseNet) and bidirection recurrent neural network (Bi-RNN) with attention mechanism network (MDRN). For the proposed MDRN, in terms of spatial feature extraction, a multiscale DenseNet is exploited to combine shallow and deep convolution features to extract the multiscale and complex spatial structure features at each layer. In the aspects of spectral feature extraction, Bi-RNN with attention mechanism is used to capture the inner spectral correlations within a continuous spectrum. Three standard real hyperspectral datasets were used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed MDRN approach. Experimental results indicate that the proposed MDRN method can make full use of the spectral and spatial information of the image, and it has better performance than some advanced algorithms in HSI classification. Finally, in the application of hyperspectral data captured by Gaofen-5 satellite, the practicability of the proposed MDRN method is also superior to other methods.

TI  - C- and L-band SAR signatures of Arctic sea ice during freeze-up
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying sea ice types in the early stages of development from L-band SAR imagery remains an active research area during the Arctic freeze-up period. We used ScanSAR C- and L-band imagery from RADARSAT-2, ALOS PALSAR and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2, to identify ice types in the North Water Polynya (NOW) and Victoria Strait (VS) region of the Canadian Arctic. We investigated the HH-polarized microwave backscatter coefficient (sigma(0)(HH)) and its GLCM texture parameters for six ice classes and open water. We found very low sigma(0)(HH) for nilas at both C- and L-band. Although similar sigma(0)(HH) found for grey ice at both frequencies, sigma(0)(HH) decrease with increasing ice thickness at L-band from grey ice, whereas, at C-band, sigma(0)(HH) increases from grey to grey-white ice and then decreases as the ice grows. GLCM texture parameters show lower values for L-band than C-band; however, separability among classes was found only for a few selected parameters. We used the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm for ice type classification from SAR scenes using sigma(0)(HH) and GLCM texture statistics. Due to overlapping sigma(0)(HH) signatures at C-band, early-stage ice classes were substantially misclassified. L-band identified early-stage ice classes with higher accuracy compared to C-band but misclassified thicker ice types and open water. L-band alone provided very good classification results (similar to 80% accuracy) and combining L- and C-band (i.e., dual-frequency approach) further increased accuracy to >90%. C-band alone resulted in the lowest accuracy of <60%. We acknowledge that developing a universal ice classification is still a challenge and requires some manual supervision to adopt variable ice conditions into the classification method. However, a dual-frequency approach can achieve higher classification accuracy than conventionally used single-frequency approaches. This research highlights the value of upcoming L-Band SAR missions to improve sea ice classification in regions where a variety of ice types exist, including many thinner types, which are now dominating an increasingly warming Arctic.

TI  - Assessing the effectiveness of community-based watershed management practices in reversing land degradation in the Finchwuha watershed, Gojjam, Ethiopia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RIVER BASIN MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Land degradation is an evident and severe environmental problem in Ethiopia. Since 2003 community-based watershed management has been implemented in the study area to reduce land degradation. This study aimed to investigate to what extent the community-based watershed management is effective in rehabilitating the land. Woody vegetative cover, land use/cover (LULC) change and soil erosion rate were selected variables to examine the effectiveness of the management measures. The LULC and woody vegetative cover spatial datasets were created from Landsat satellite images of 2003 and 2019 using ERDAS IMAGINE 2016 (R) and ArcGIS10.8 (R). The soil loss rate was modelled using geoinformation techniques combined with the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation. To assess the perception of farmers involved in the watershed rehabilitation activities, qualitative data were collected through Focus Group Discussions and Key Informant interviews. The results showed that the average annual soil loss rate in the study area was 49.5 tonnes (t)/hectare (ha(-1))/year(y(-1)) in 2003 and 23.8 t ha(-1)y(-1) in 2019, which is a 52% decrease over 16 years. Woody vegetative cover and grassland increased by 11% and 103%, respectively. These figures and respondents' responses, Focus Group Discussants and Key Informants showed that the community-based watershed management measures implemented in the study area were effective for improving vegetation cover and reducing soil loss (reducing land degradation). The sustainability of these achievements is contingent on the availability of a robust local organizational set-up complemented by the provision of natural resources development technologies, capacity building and security of land tenure. In sum, the findings in the study lead to conclude that the active involvement of farmers in land management and security of land tenure are effective approaches to reverse land degradation in the highlands of Ethiopia.

TI  - Bowel perfusion demonstrated using indocyanine green fluorescence imaging in two cases of strangulated ileus
T2  - CLINICAL JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We report the use of indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence for intraoperative diagnosis in two cases of strangulated ileus. We successfully preserved the bowel and avoided postoperative complications by detecting adequate perfusion and no necrosis in the intestine's strangulated regions. In the first case, enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed a closed loop intestine, which showed poor contrast, and we performed laparotomy with ICG fluorescence. In the second case, the CT scan revealed bowel obstruction without ascites. We conservatively treated the patient with the insertion of a long tube. The patient's condition did not improve, and we performed laparotomy using ICG fluorescence. In both of these cases, the visual observation during laparotomy showed that the ileum had dark-red discoloration. We demonstrated perfusion and preserved the ileum by injecting 2.5 mg of ICG intravenously; fluorescence was observed in the dark-red ileum using the PINPOINT system (Novadaq, Kalamazoo, MI, US). Both patients recovered successfully after the surgery with no adverse events. Our data suggest that ICG fluorescence imaging can be one of the decision-making modalities in patients with strangulated ileus.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim A critical discussion comparing Newtonian science and complexity science as the philosophical basis for suicide research and its impact on suicide knowledge development and clinical practice. Design Discussion paper. Data Sources A review of literature on suicide research and complexity science ranging from 2000 to 2022. Implications for Nursing Suicide research based on a Newtonian worldview can have negative consequences for suicide knowledge development and can permeate nursing practice in ways that take away from addressing the complex needs of patients, their families and healthcare teams. Conclusion A Newtonian worldview as a philosophical basis for research is insufficient for the study of a phenomenon as complex as suicide. A complexity science approach is better suited to the study of suicide given the multiple, interrelated, emerging factors that can contribute to a person's decision to end their own life. Impact Suggestions are provided as to how a complexity science approach to the research of suicide can inform useful knowledge development that better meets the needs of individuals facing suicidality and their families. Researchers, healthcare administrators and nurses providing care to those struggling with suicidality can benefit from adopting a complexity science worldview in addressing this multifaceted phenomenon.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective was to carry out a prospective study to compare the current extended pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND) to the sentinel node (SN) technique with 99mTcnanocolloid.METHODS: We conducted a prospective study between January 2013 and May 2020. In the first 74 patients, 99mTc-nanocolloid was used. Then from June 2017 onwards, in 38 patients we used a combined radiotracer prepared by adding indocyanine green (ICG). A preoperative SPECT/CT was also performed to check on the SNs. We extracted the SNs guided by a laparoscopic gamma-ray detection probe and/or a fluorescence camera.RESULTS: We included 112 patients with a Briganti nomogram-assessed risk of 5% or more. In 4 out of the total, the radiotracer did not migrate. The mean number of extracted nodes was 21.56 (13.46-29.71) and the mean of extracted SNs was 5.17 (1.83-8.51) (p<0.001). The technique that registered the most nodes with high activity was SPECT/CT, with an average of 4.33 nodes (2.42-6.23) (p<0.001). We found SNs outside the template in 78% of the patients. A total of 46% of the complications were related to ePLND. The SN biopsy showed a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 97.5%, PVV of 92.86%, and NPV of 100%.CONCLUSIONS: Our results prove that ePLND is a technique with significant morbidity; up to 46 % of the complications were related to the ePLND. The SN surgery showed great accuracy in detecting metastases due to the SPECT/CT and a lower rate of complications than ePLND.

TI  - Identification of saline landscapes from an integrated SVM approach from a novel 3-D classification schema using Sentinel-1 dual-polarized SAR data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presented an integrated SVM classification method that investigated the relationship between intrinsic scattering attributes of the surface features and the conductivity characteristics of the soil in the newly proposed two-and three-dimensional classification (2D and 3D) schema to classify the saline landscape. The study was conducted in the Vellore district, Tamil Nadu, which is composed of heterogeneous saline landforms due to the active geological processes and anthropogenic activities. The intensity products of Sentinel-1 data (VV + VH) of C-band frequency were employed in the present study. The SVM with linear kernel has outperformed the other models, namely random forest (RF), naive Bayes (NB), and K-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN), in performing the broad level of classification from the 2D classification schema (SVMOA = 84.2%, RFOA = 80.4%, k-NNOA = 78.8%, NBOA = 68.4%). The soil EC values derived from the dielectric loss measurements (R-2 = 0.79, rho = 0.018, and alpha=95%) were used to introduce the integrated SVM approach in the 3D schema to further breakdown the mapped classes into non-saline (NS) (soil EC <= 2 ds/cm), slightly saline (SS) (soil EC = 2.1 to 4 ds/cm) and moderately saline (MS) (soil EC = 4.1 to 8 ds/cm) categories. The overall performance of the integrated SVM approach implemented for the 3D classification schema (F1 = 0.80) was found to be satisfactory, but with an associated uncertainty majorly from MS (Precision = 0.52, F1 = 0.69), SS (Recall = 0.09, F1 = 0.15), and NS waterbodies (Recall = 0.18, F1 = 0.29) as shown in the Precision-Recall graph (AUCPR(3D) = 0.62). However, with the promising performance level demonstrated for the other nine classes such as NS, SS, and MS wet soil (F1 = 0.92, 0.92, 0.96), healthy plants (F1 = 0.83), salt-tolerant plants under SS and MS conditions (F1 = 0.83, 0.88), and waterlogged vegetation under NS, SS, and MS conditions (F1 = 0.82, 0.83, 0.83), the proposed classification scheme becomes an effective method to map saline and non-saline features from dual-polarimetric SAR data.

TI  - The effects of wheat-pea mixed intercropping on biocontrol potential of generalist predators in a long-term experimental trial
T2  - ANNALS OF APPLIED BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Arthropod generalist predators can be effective natural control agents of pests and weeds in agroecosystems. Their activity and contribution to biocontrol may increase in response to more complex agricultural habitats. In this study, we investigated the effects of winter wheat-pea mixed intercropping on the biocontrol potential of generalist predators compared with the respective mono-crops. We evaluated not only the effects during the intercropping season but also the pre-crop values of the mixture for the subsequent barley crop. Furthermore, we evaluated the influence of different long-term soil organic carbon and fertility management regimes on activity and biocontrol potential of predators. Field work was conducted over two seasons in a field experiment located in Gembloux, Belgium. A set of proxies for ecosystem functions were measured using the Rapid Ecosystem Function Assessment approach. We measured attack and predation rates of sentinel prey and weed seeds artificially placed in the field. Furthermore, we assessed activity density of the main groups of generalist predators during the exposure of the baits. Our results showed that crop type affected activity and biocontrol potential of predators. Predation rates were much lower in wheat than pea and wheat-pea. The mixture wheat-pea had a positive effect on predator activity density compared to wheat mono-crop, while pea supported an intermediate activity of epigeal predators. In the second season of the field work, we found the highest biocontrol potential by predators in barley plots cultivated after pea. Finally, our results failed to find any differences in biocontrol potential of predators between long-term soil organic carbon and fertilisation management strategies. These results suggest that crop type has a major relevance in influencing the activity of generalist predators, and the mixed intercropping wheat-pea may represent a valid strategy to enhance biological pest control in comparison to wheat cultivated as mono-crop. Furthermore, we show that the cultivation of pea as mono-crop may have an important pre-crop value within the rotation increasing the provision of ecosystem services such as biocontrol.

TI  - Integrated wildfire risk assessment of natural and anthropogenic ecosystems based on simulation modeling and remotely sensed data fusion
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Even though wildfires constitute a natural phenomenon, fires of high intensity may provoke profound ecological and socioeconomic implications. Primary aim of the paper constitutes the integrated wildfire risk assessment of a fire-prone region in Greece through the simulation modeling of burn probability (BP) and fire intensity to natural and anthropogenic resources (forests, birds' habitats, built-up areas, agricultural fields, energy networks etc.), as well as the identification of resources response to fires of differentiated intensity. So, fire modeling constitutes the primary input to wildfire effects determination through the contribution of fire and resources specialists. The predicted fire effects were quantified and mapped through a spatial index of Net Value Change which aggregates the total predicted change in terms of area gained (e. g. forest regeneration) or lost due to fire impacts. The greatest loss from the total area of each resource/asset was predicted to electricity and renewable energy sources networks (-0.48%), followed by mixed forests (-0.47%), residential buildings and assets (-0.43%), coniferous forests (-0.43%), shrubs (-0.4%), broad-leaved forests (-0.27%) and agricultural crops (-0.19%). The mapping of this index demonstrated that the resources which are at high risk are located close to compact flammable material, following the pattern of increased fire intensity and BP. Hence, this framework can strategically and operationally be used to establish a hierarchical priority-based model for optimal allocation of fire resources. This two-stage of analysis allows for an objective quantification of fire effects to a spatial level (i.e. prefecture) where many biophysical attributes might heavily affect the fire modeling outcomes enhancing the credibility of results.

TI  - Constraining baryonic feedback and cosmology with weak-lensing, X-ray, and kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich observations
T2  - MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Modern weak-lensing observations are becoming increasingly sensitive to baryonic feedback processes which are still poorly understood. So far, this challenge has been faced either by imposing scale-cuts in the data or by modelling baryonic effects with simple, one-parameter models. In this paper, we rely on a more general, seven-parameter prescription of baryonic feedback effects, which is primarily motivated by observations and has been shown to agree with a plethora of hydrodynamical simulations. By combining weak-lensing data from the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS-1000) with observations of gas around galaxy clusters, we are able to constrain baryonic parameters and learn more about feedback and cosmology. In particular, we use cluster gas fractions from X-ray data and gas profiles from kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) observations to provide evidence for baryonic feedback that is stronger than predicted by most hydrodynamical simulations. In terms of the matter power spectrum, we report a beyond-per cent effect at wave-modes above k similar to 0.1-0.45 h Mpc(-1) and a maximum suppression of 12-33 per cent at k similar to 7 h Mpc(-1) (68 per cent confidence level). Regarding the combined parameter Sigma(8) = sigma g(Omega(m)/0.3)(0.58), we find the known tension with the Planck satellite data to be reduced from 3.8 sigma to 2.9 sigma once baryonic effects are fully included in the analysis pipeline. The tension is further decreased to 2.6 sigma when the weak-lensing data are combined with X-ray and kSZ observations. We conclude that, while baryonic feedback effects become more important in modern weak-lensing surveys, they are unlikely to act as the main culprit for the observed Sigma(8)-tension.

AB  - SAtellite-based Marine Process Understanding, Development, Research and Applications (SAMUDRA) for blue economy, a technology development program of the Space Applications Centre, is an umbrella program covering research and applications geared toward physical and biological oceanography making use of current and future satellite observations for developing the nation's blue economy. The main motivation behind this project was to develop satellite and numerical model-based information and value-added products and to demonstrate the implementation of developed applications for operational requirements. The program also aimed at improving existing methodologies for various applications by utilizing space-based inputs. Several field campaigns with the use of NavIC-enabled instruments and NABHMITRA were conducted for measuring biophysical parameters and validation of developed applications in the coastal regions. One of the key aspects of this project was development of web-based customized tools/dissemination system for providing the information to the end users. Some of the key/notable achievements of SAMUDRA were development of a portal OceanEye (tailor-made web-portal for Shipping Corporation of India), storm-surge/inundation system, oil-spill trajectory modeling, level-next potential fishing zone algorithm and rip current alert system.

TI  - Temporal Trend in an Initial Treatment, Survival, and Medical Costs Among Patients With Lung Cancer Between 2013 and 2018 in Kyoto City, Japan
T2  - VALUE IN HEALTH REGIONAL ISSUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: This study aimed to identify the variation of treatment contents and outcomes and economic burden of lung cancer among the elderly population in Japan. Methods: New-onset primary lung cancer from April 2013 to March 2019 were identified by using the Kyoto City administrative database for National Health Insurance and Advanced Elderly Medical Service System. Patient characteristics, initial treatment, medical costs, and deaths were analyzed. Continuous variables were calculated using standard descriptive statistical methods. Results: A total of 4845 people who were diagnosed as having lung cancer and received any treatment between 2013 and 2018 were included in the study. The average age of patients was 73 to 74 years for a 6-year study period. The proportion of patients who received surgery, drug therapy, and radiation therapy as initial treatment was 31% to 42%, 36% to 44%, and 21% to 24%, respectively. Healthcare costs increased between fiscal year (FY) 2014 and FY 2018, with a particularly significant increase of 340 million for drug therapy, whereas the mortality rate in ,2-year follow-up decreased from Conclusions: This cross-sectional study demonstrated that the improvement in the survival rate and proportion of surgery as an initial treatment was increased whereas drug therapy decreased and medical costs increased among patients with lung cancer over time. Based on these results, it is necessary to implement sustainable healthcare measures with a consideration of cost-effectiveness.

TI  - HE-DFNETS: A Novel Hybrid Deep Learning Architecture for the Prediction of Potential Fishing Zone Areas in Indian Ocean Using Remote Sensing Images
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Indian subcontinent is known for its larger coastline spanning, over 8100 km and is considered the habitat for many millions of people. The livelihood of their habitat is purely dependent upon the fishing activities. Often, the search for fish requires more time for catching and more resources, thus increasing the operational cost leading to low profitability. With the advent of artificial intelligence algorithms, designing intelligent algorithms for an effective prediction of fishing areas has reached new heights in terms of high accuracy (A(cy)) and less time. But still, predicting the location of potential fishing zones (PFZs) is always a daunting task. To reduce these issues, this work presented the novel hybrid prediction architecture of PFZs using remote sensing images. The proposed architecture integrates the deep convolutional layers and flitter bat optimized long short-term memory (FB-LSTM)-based recurrent neural networks (RNN). These convolutional layers are utilized to remove the various color features such as chlorophyll, sea surface temperature (SST), and GPS location from the satellite images, and FB-LTSM is utilized to predict the potential locations for fishing. The extensive experimentations are carried out utilizing the satellite data from Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) and implemented using TensorFlow 1.18 with Keras API. The performance metrics such as prediction A(cy), precision (P-sc(n)), recall (R-cl) or sensitivity (S-ty), specificity (S-fy), and F1-score and compared with other existing intelligent learning models. From our observations, the proposed architecture (99% prediction A(cy)) has outperformed the other existing algorithms and finds its best place in designing an intelligent system for better predicting of PFZs.

TI  - Integrating process-related information into an artificial neural network for root-zone soil moisture prediction
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantification of root-zone soil moisture (RZSM) is crucial for agricultural applications and the soil sciences. RZSM impacts processes such as vegetation transpiration and water percolation. Surface soil moisture (SSM) can be assessed through active and passive microwave remotesensing methods, but no current sensor enables direct RZSM retrieval. Spatial maps of RZSM can be retrieved via proxy observations (vegetation stress, water storage change and surface soil moisture) or via land surface model predictions. In this study, we investigated the combination of surface soil moisture information with process-related inferred features involving artificial neural networks (ANNs). We considered the infiltration process through the soil water index (SWI) computed with a recursive exponential filter and the evaporation process through the evaporation efficiency computed based on a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) remote-sensing dataset and a simplified analytical model, while vegetation growth was not modeled and was only inferred through normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series. Several ANN models with different sets of features were developed. Training was conducted considering in situ stations distributed in several areas worldwide characterized by different soil and climate patterns of the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN), and testing was applied to stations of the same data-hosting facility. The results indicate that the integration of process-related features into ANN models increased the overall performance over the reference model level in which only SSM features were con sidered. In arid and semiarid areas, for instance, performance enhancement was observed when the evaporation efficiency was integrated into the ANN models. To assess the robustness of the approach, the trained models were applied to observation sites in Tunisia, Italy and southern India that are not part of the ISMN. The results reveal that joint use of surface soil moisture, evaporation efficiency, NDVI and recursive exponential filter represented the best alternative for more accurate predictions in the case of Tunisia, where the mean correlation of the predicted RZSM based on SSM only sharply increased from 0.443 to 0.801 when process-related features were integrated into the ANN models in addition to SSM. However, process-related features have no to little added value in temperate to tropical conditions.

TI  - Automated Global Classification of Surface Layer Stratification Using High-Resolution Sea Surface Roughness Measurements by Satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - A three-state global estimator of marine surface layer atmospheric stratification is demonstrated using more than 600,000 Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar wave mode images at incidence angle approximate to 36.8 degrees. Stratification is quantified using a bulk Richardson number, Ri, derived from collocated ERA5 surface analyses. The three stratification states are defined as unstable: Ri < -0.012, near-neutral: -0.012 Ri < +0.001, and stable: Ri > +0.001. These boundaries are identified by the characteristic boundary layer coherent structures that form in these regimes and modulate the surface roughness imaged by the radar. An automated machine learning algorithm identifies the coherent structures impressed on the images. Data from 2016 to 2019 are used to examine spatial and temporal variation in these state estimates in terms of expected wind and thermal forcing. This new satellite-based approach for detecting air-sea stratification has implications for weather modeling and air-sea flux products.

TI  - Research on the Current Situation and Countermeasures of Inpatient Cost and Medical Insurance Payment Method for Rehabilitation Services in City S
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveThis study aimed to introduce bed-day payment for rehabilitation services in City S, China, and analyze the cost of inpatient rehabilitation services. Key issues were defined and relevant countermeasures were discussed. MethodsThe data about the rehabilitation cost of 3,828 inpatient patients from June 2018 to December 2019 was used. Descriptive statistics and the Kruskal-Wallis test were employed to describe sample characteristics and clarify the comparity of cost and length of stay (LOS) across different groups. After normalizing the distribution of cost and LOS by Box-Cox transformation, multiple linear regression was used to explore the factors influencing cost and LOS by calculating the variance inflation factor (VIF) to identify multicollinearity. Finally, 20 senior and middle management personnel of the hospitals were interviewed through a semi-structured interview method to further figure out the existing problems and countermeasures. Results(1) During 2015-2019: both discharges and the cost of rehabilitation hospitalization in City S rose rapidly. (2) The highest number of discharges were for circulatory system diseases (57.65%). Endocrine, nutritional, and metabolic diseases were noted to have the longest average length of stay (ALOS) reaching 105.8 days. The shortest ALOS was found to be 24.2 days from the diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue. Neurological, circulatory, urological, psychiatric, infectious, and parasitic diseases were observed to be generally more costly. (3) The cost of rehabilitation was determined to mainly consist of the rehabilitation fee (23.63%), comprehensive medical service fee (22.61%), and treatment fee (19.03%). (4) Type of disease, age, nature of the hospital, and grade of the hospital have significant influences both on cost and LOS (P < 0.05). The most critical factor affecting the cost was found to be the length of stay (standardized coefficient = 0.777). (5) The key issues of City S's rehabilitative services system were identified to be the incomplete criteria, imperfections in the payment system, and the fragmentation of services. ConclusionsBed-day payment is the main payment method for rehabilitation services, but there is a conflict between rapidly rising costs and increasing demand for rehabilitation. The main factors affecting the cost include the length of stay, type of disease, the grade of the hospital, etc. Lack of criteria, imperfections in the payment system, and the fragmentation of services limit sustainability. The core approach is to establish a three-tier rehabilitative network and innovate the current payment system.

TI  - Fusion of time-series optical and SAR images using 3D convolutional neural networks for crop classification
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing is a most promising technique for providing crop maps, thanks to the development of satellite images at various temporal and spatial resolutions. Three-dimensional (3D) convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have the potential to provide rich features that represent the spatial and temporal patterns of crops when applied to time series. This study presents a novel 3D-CNN framework for classifying crops that is based on the fusion of radar and optical time series and also fully exploits 3D spatial-temporal information. To extract deep convolutional maps, the proposed technique uses one separate sequence for each time series dataset. To determine the label of each pixel, the extracted feature maps are passed to the concatenating layer and subsequent transmitted to the sequential fully connected layers. The proposed approach not only takes advantage of CNNs, i.e. automatic feature extraction, but also discovers discriminative feature maps in both, spatial and temporal dimensions and preserves the growth dynamics of crop cycles. An overall accuracy of 91.3% and a kappa coefficient of 89.9% confirm the proposed method's potential. It is also shown that the suggested approach outperforms other methods.

TI  - Bayesian time-varying occupancy model for West Nile virus in Ontario, Canada
T2  - STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Occupancy models determine the true presence or absence of a species by adjusting for imperfect detection in surveys. They often assume that species presences can be detected only if sites are occupied during a sampling season. We extended these models to estimate occupancy rates that vary throughout a sampling season as well as account for spatial dependence among sites. For these methods, we constructed a fast Gibbs sampler with the Polya-Gamma augmentation strategy to conduct inference on covariate effects. We applied these methods to evaluate how environmental conditions and surveillance practices are associated with the presence of West Nile virus in mosquito traps across Ontario, Canada from 2002 to 2017. We found that urban land cover and warm temperatures drove viral occupancy, whereas viral testing on pools with higher proportions of Culex mosquitoes was more likely to result in a positive test for West Nile virus. Models with time-varying occupancy effects achieved much lower Watanabe-Akaike information criteria than models without such effects. Our final model had strong predictive performance on test data that included some of the most extreme seasons, demonstrating the promise of these methods in the study of pathogens spread by mosquito vectors.

TI  - Earth observation for ecosystem accounting: spatially explicit national seagrass extent and carbon stock in Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique and Madagascar
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Seagrass ecosystems are globally significant hot spots of blue carbon storage, coastal biodiversity and coastal protection, rendering them a so-called natural climate solution. Their potential as a natural climate solution has been largely overlooked in national and international climate strategies and financing. This stems mainly from the lack of standardized, spatially explicit mapping and region-specific carbon inventories. Here, we introduce a novel seagrass ecosystem accounting framework that harnesses machine learning, big satellite data analytics and open region-specific reference data within the Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform. Leveraging a biennial percentile composite, assembled from 16 453 Sentinel-2 surface reflectance image tiles at 10-m spatial resolution, and 20 820 reference data points, we applied the cloud-native framework to produce the first national inventories of seagrass extent and total seagrass carbon stocks in Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique and Madagascar. We estimated 4316 km(2) of regional seagrass extent (mean F1-score of 59.3% and overall accuracy of 84.3%) up to 23 m of depth. Pairing country-specific in situ carbon data and our spatially explicit seagrass extents, we calculated total regional seagrass blue carbon stocks between 11.2-40.2 million MgC, with the largest national carbon pool in Kenya (8-29.2 million MgC). We envisage that improvements in the remote sensing components of the framework guided by a necessary influx of region-specific data on seagrass stocks and fluxes could reduce uncertainties in our current spatially explicit ecosystem extent and carbon accounts, enhancing the incorporation of seagrasses into Multilateral Environmental Agreements for future resilient ecosystems, societies and economies.

TI  - Mapping corn dynamics using limited but representative samples with adaptive strategies
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping the corn dynamics at a large scale and multiple years is essential for global food security. Traditional mapping approaches by collecting training samples from field surveys are labor-intensive, challenging large-scale mapping of corn dynamics over the long term. This study developed an efficient approach to map large-scale corn dynamics in the main corn districts of the United States (US) using adaptive strategies for collecting high-quality training samples. First, this study proposed an automatic approach to collect stable and representative corn samples from the crop data layers (CDL) product. Then, this study improved the mapping performance of corn at a large scale and in earlier years by using adaptive strategies to collect limited (less than 500) but high-quality training samples. Finally, this study assessed and discussed the model performance across spaces and years using multi-source datasets from 2001 to 2020. Our results indicate the proposed approach with adaptive strategies can generate robust classification models with good performance in mapping large-scale corn dynamics. In our study area, the mean overall accuracy (OA) of corn is about 88% if using the CDL data as a reference. Besides, the R2 of corn areas at the county scale between our result and the surveyed acreage statistics is above 0.9, suggesting the proposed strategy is helpful for mapping corn dynamics across different years. The proposed approach demonstrated that limited but representative samples could map corn dynamics at a large scale with good performance, showing significant improvement compared to the traditional approach. It is feasible to map crop dynamics with multiple types by combining existing crop products with collected field samples, particularly in China, where crop products at the national scale are still lacking.

TI  - Mapping irrigated croplands in China using a synergetic training sample generating method, machine learning classifier, and Google Earth Engine
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural irrigation is an important vehicle for increasing crop yield, but large-scale irrigation has posed great challenges to global and regional water availability and climate change via altering land-atmosphere interactions. The knowledge of irrigation distribution is essential to understand regional water cycles and guide agricultural management decision-making, but such information is scarce in China. We developed a remote sensing-dominated framework to map irrigated croplands in China at 500 m resolution using a synergetic training sample generating method, machine learning classifier, and a cloud computing platform (Google Earth Engine, GEE). To overcome the challenges of lacking nationwide training samples, we first produced two provisional irrigation maps by fusing statistics and MODIS-derived annual peak greenness indices. The two provisional irrigation maps were then spatially filtered with an existing irrigation product (GRIPC) to construct the initial training sample pool. Next, to enhance the robustness and cover more irrigated candidates, we screened and introduced the irrigated croplands in three land use/cover maps (CCI-LC, GLC_FCS, and NLCD) to supplement the training data pool. Afterward, we utilized locally adaptive random forest classifiers and data cubes (MODIS-derived spectral indices, climatic and topographic variables) to generate irrigation maps in each province of China on GEE. The resulting map outperformed other current irrigation maps with an overall accuracy of 79.2% . The map also showed a reasonable consistency with statistical data at the province and prefecture levels, with the determination coefficient (R2) of 0.89 and 0.77, respectively. In total, we identified 87.04 million hectares of irrigated croplands in mainland China in 2015. Using the resulting map and water use statistics, we found a high correlation between irrigation area and agricultural water use in Northwest, Northeast, and South China, and a low correlation in North China Plain. This map is expected to serve national water resource management and assist decision-making in improving agricultural adaption to climate change.

TI  - A machine learning method trained by radiative transfer model inversion for generating seven global land and atmospheric estimates from VIIRS top-of-atmosphere observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) has observed the Earth since 2011 and will continue for several decades. Unfortunately, few high-level land surface products have been produced and publicly released. The numerical inversion of radiative transfer model (RTM) has long been used for the retrieval of land surface and atmospheric variables from satellite data; however, it is computationally intensive. Some methods (e.g., using look-up tables) are efficient but are most suitable for estimating individual variable. Various machine learning (ML) models have been developed, mostly trained by either ground measurements that may not be adequate to represent different conditions, or RTM simulations that may not be realistic due to model uncertainty and unnecessary combinations of illumination-viewing geometries and variable values. In this study, we replaced the numerical inversion scheme by the ML algorithm that is trained using RTM inversion for estimating multiple variables simultaneously. Our training dataset for the ML models was generated by inverting the land and atmospheric variables from VIIRS top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance data using a coupled land-surface-atmosphere RT model. Two multi-output ML algorithms were explored: backpropagation neural networks and random forest (RF) regression. The best-performing RF model was then applied to estimate seven land and atmospheric variables globally from VIIRS TOA data: the leaf area index (LAI), incident photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR), incident shortwave radiation (ISR), land surface albedo, land surface reflectance, and TOA albedo. The inversion results were validated using ground measurements at 54 sites and showed comparable accuracy to the numerical inversion scheme that is suitable for only small regions. An experiment was also conducted to test this method on a much larger region for detailed evaluation. Finally, seven global estimates in 2013 were experimentally produced. Inter-comparison with the existing satellite products showed that the VIIRS estimates had high consistency with the LAI and FAPAR products of the Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) products suite. Moreover, the VIIRS officially released the VNP43MA3 albedo and VNP09A1 surface reflectance products, the retrieved estimates also matched them well. It was also shown that simultaneous estimation of all seven variables was more accurate and efficient than estimating individual variable sequentially.

TI  - An advanced change detection method for time-series soil moisture retrieval from Sentinel-1
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The feasibility of soil moisture retrieval from C-band Sentinel-1 data has been widely acknowledged, with preoperational 1-km products currently available at regional and/or continental scale using the long-term (LTCD) or short-term change detection (STCD) methods. Both algorithms share the same assumptions of time-invariant roughness and vegetation, which can be questionable even for a short period of 4 Sentinel-1 acquisitions (18-36 days). An advanced change detection (ACD) method is proposed in this study for an improved soil moisture retrieval from Sentinel-1 data, including two main modifications with respect to the existing STCD methods: i) approximating the effect of temporal varying vegetation on the Sentinel-1 backscatter as a variation in the two-way attenuation, and ii) a temporal soil moisture constraint based on the coarse Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) soil moisture product to partly remove the uncertainty caused by vegetation and/or roughness changes. The evaluation, based on time-series observations from 34 OzNet stations and ground samples collected during the Fifth Soil Moisture Active and Passive Experiment (SMAPEx-5) showed that the ACD improved the correlation coefficient (R), root mean square error (RMSE) and un biased RMSE (ubRMSE), achieving 0.66, 0.071 m3/m3 and 0.071 m3/m3 at the point scale, 0.77, 0.063 m3/m3 and 0.051 m3/m3 at 1-km scale, 0.80, 0.055 m3/m3 and 0.050 m3/m3 at 3-km scale. The contribution of the two modifications was further investigated using 559 stations from 22 networks across the world, showing that: i) the two modifications can increase R by 0.08-0.13 and reduce the retrieval RMSE by 0.009-0.013 m3/m3 (10% - 15% relative), and ii) the retrieval over densely vegetated areas or areas with large temporal vegetation variation can benefit more from the proposed modifications. The ACD achieved stable performance for various Sentinel-1 orbits/passes and maintained a stable performance for retrieval windows up to 30 Sentinel-1 acquisitions, providing a promising alternative for achieving consistent soil moisture retrievals from Sentinel-1.

TI  - Global Changes in Water Vapor 1979-2020
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Global-scale changes in water vapor and responses to surface temperature variability since 1979 are evaluated across a range of satellite and ground-based observations, a reanalysis (ERA5) and coupled and atmosphere-only CMIP6 climate model simulations. Global-mean column integrated water vapor increased by 1%/decade during 1988-2014 in observations and atmosphere-only simulations. However, coupled simulations overestimate water vapor trends and this is partly explained by past studies showing that internal climate variability suppressed observed warming in this period. Decreases in low-altitude tropical water vapor in ERA5 and ground-based observations before around 1993 are considered suspect based on inconsistency with simulations and increased column integrated water vapor in microwave satellite data since 1979. Atmospheric Infra-red Sounder satellite data does not capture the increased tropospheric water vapor since 2002 shown by other satellite, reanalysis, and model products. However, global water vapor responses to interannual surface temperature variability are consistent across data sets with increases of similar to 4%-5% near the surface and 10%-15% at 300 hPa for each 1 degrees C increase in global surface temperature. Global water vapor responses are explained by thermodynamic amplification of upper tropospheric temperature changes and the Clausius Clapeyron temperature dependence of saturation vapor pressure that are dominated by the tropical ocean responses. Upper tropospheric moistening is larger in climate model simulations with greater upper tropospheric warming.

TI  - Characteristics of anchoveta (<i>Engraulis ringens</i>) schools in the optimum zone and the physiological stress zone of its distribution between 2011 and 2021
T2  - FISHERIES OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study has considered anchoveta acoustic data from the Pelagic Resources Hydroacoustic Assessment Surveys carried out by the Peruvian Sea Institute (IMARPE) and free access satellite data (HYCOM and MODIS from the USA) of some oceanographic variables between the period 2011 and 2021, to know the oceanographic conditions, characteristics of schools and size structure in the optimum zone (OZ) and in the physiological stress zone (PSZ), of their total distribution. The OZ is determined by the extent of the Cold Coastal Waters (CCW), and the PSZ is determined by the mixing of waters, to the north by the CCW-ESW (Equatorial Surface Waters) and to the west between the CCW-SSW (Subtropical Surface Waters). The range of sea surface temperature and salinity in the PSZ (16.1-25.0 degrees C and 34.65-35.29, respectively) was wider than in the OZ (14.5-24.0 degrees C and 34.65-35.20, respectively), where a higher number of schools were recorded. Our analyses showed that the morphometric and energetic acoustic descriptors of anchoveta schools in the summer were higher during summers compared to springs. In terms of positional characteristics, the mean depth of the schools in the PSZ was slightly greater than in the OZ. The total size structure of anchoveta in the OZ consisted mainly of juvenile specimens (less than 12 cm total length) in the summer of 2011 and 2013-2014 and in the spring between 2014-2017 and 2021. In the PSZ, adult specimens (greater than 12 cm total length) predominated in summer between 2011-2013, 2015, 2018, and 2021 and in spring between 2011-2013, 2015, and between 2018-2021. However, specimens greater than 10 cm in total length were found in the PSZ. Knowledge of the location of this zone away from the coast will allow a high probability of anchoveta capture of adult specimens during fishing periods.

TI  - Soil wind erodibility and erosion estimation using Landsat satellite imagery and multiple-criteria decision analysis in Urmia Lake Region, Iran
T2  - ARID LAND RESEARCH AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing variations in soil wind erosion (SWE) is critical for identifying key change areas and formulating desertification control strategies. Satellite images with an expansive spatial coverage and temporal repeatability make it possible to monitor the process of soil degradation and its consequences such as SWE. This research aims to model SWE in the eastern shoreline of Urmia Lake in the 2005-2017 period through multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). Soil moisture, soil erodibility (SE), soil crust index, number of snow cover days, wind field intensity, and vegetation fraction were determined as critical factors affecting SWE. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method was applied to determine the weight of each factor. High SE and poor vegetation were the most important factors in the developed SWE model. The SE was precisely estimated (relative percent deviation (RPD)=2.01) by the support vector regression (SVR) method using Landsat-8 image. The developed SWE estimation method had an overall accuracy of 81%. Most of the eastern shoreline of Urmia Lake Region was classified in the severe SWE class. Results showed a declining erosion intensity trend from central parts with high wind erosion (47% of the region) to northern and southern parts of the region. Increasing the distance from the lake led to an increase in SWE.

TI  - pN0(i+) and pN1mi Breast Cancer: Treatment and Outcomes in Comparison With pN0 and pN1a in the Modern Era
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY BIOLOGY PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Locoregional recurrence risk and the role of locoregional radiation therapy (LRRT) in pN0(i+) and pN1mi breast cancer are unclear. This study compares locoregional relapse-free survival (LRRFS) in patients with pN0(i+) and pN1mi relative to pN0 and pN1a disease and evaluates LRRFS according to locoregional treatment. Methods and Materials: We studied 10,271 patients referred between 2006 and 2011 with newly diagnosed pT1-T2, pN0, pN0(i+), pN1mi, or pN1a, M0 breast cancer. Outcomes were 10-year Kaplan-Meier LRRFS, relapse-free survival (RFS), distant relapse-free survival, and breast cancer-specific survival. Multivariable analysis of LRRFS and RFS was performed in pN0(i+) and pN1mi cohorts. Results: Median follow-up was 9.3 years. In patients with pN0 (n = 7492), pN0(i+) (n = 305), pN1mi (n = 619), and pN1a (n = 1855) disease, LRRT was used in 1.1%, 24.3%, 45.7%, and 71.1%, respectively. Ten-year outcomes were LRRFS 96%, 92%, 97%, and 96% (P < .001), distant RFS 94%, 91%, 90%, and 84% (P < .001), and breast cancer-specific survival 95%, 90%, 93%, and 87% (P < .001), respectively. Ten-year LRRFS for patients treated with breast-conserving surgery alone, with breast RT, and with LRRT were 81%, 93%, and 91% for patients with pN0(i+) (P = .16) and 94%, 96%, and 100% for patients with pN1mi (P = .02), respectively. Among patients treated with mastectomy, 10-year LRRFS with surgery alone and with LRRT were 93% and 100% for patients with pN0(i+) (P = .12) and 95% and 99% for patients with pN1mi (P = .09). On multivariable analysis of patients with pN0(i+) and pN1mi, systemic therapy was associated with improved LRRFS in patients with pN0(i+) (hazard ratio [HR], 0.2; [0.06-0.6]; P = .005) and patients with pN1mi (HR, 0.1; [0.03-0.5]; P = .006). In patients with pN1mi, LRRT was associated with a trend toward increased LRRFS (HR, 0.2; [0.03-1.1]; P = .07). LRRT was not significantly associated with improved RFS in pN0(i+) or pN1mi disease. Conclusions: In the era of sentinel node staging and modern systemic therapy, patients with pN0(i+) and PN1mi treated with LRRT experienced 10-year LRR risks <= 10% after breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy and RT. LRRT was associated with a trend toward increased LRRFS in pN1mi but not pN0(i+) disease. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - An evaluation of the liquid cloud droplet effective radius derived from MOMS, airborne remote sensing, and in situ measurements from CAMP<SUP>2</SUP>Ex
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The cloud drop effective radius (Re) of the drop size distribution derived from passive satellite sensors is a key variable used in climate research. Validation of these satellite products has often taken place under stratiform cloud conditions that favor the assumption of cloud horizontal homogeneity used by the retrieval techniques. However, many studies have noted concerns with respect to significant biases in retrieved R-e arising from cloud heterogeneity, for example, in cumulus cloud fields. Here, we examine data collected during the 2019 "Cloud, Aerosol and Monsoon Processes Philippines Experiment" (CAMP(2)Ex), which, in part, targeted the objective of providing the first detailed evaluation of R-e retrieved across multiple platforms and techniques in a cumulus and congestus cloud region. Our evaluation consists of cross-comparisons of R-e between the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Terra satellite, the Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP) onboard the NASA P-3 aircraft, and in situ measurements from both the NASA P-3 and Learjet aircraft that are all taken in close spatiotemporal proximity to the same cloud fields. A particular advantage of our approach lies in the capability of the RSP to retrieve Re using a bi-spectral MODIS approach and a polarimetric approach, which allows for the evaluation of bi-spectral and polarimetric R-e retrievals from an airborne perspective using the same samples.Averaged over all P-3 flight segments examined here for warm clouds, the RSP polarimetric method, the in situ method, and the bias-adjusted MODIS method of Fu et al. (2019) show a comparable median (mean +/- standard deviation) for the R-e samples of 9.6 (10.2 +/- 4.0) mu m, 11.0 (13.6 +/- 11.3) mu m, and 10.4 (10.8 +/- 3.8) mu m, respectively. These values are far lower than the values of 15.1 (16.2 +/- 5.5) mu m and 17.2 (17.7 +/- 5.7) mu m from the bi-spectral retrievals of RSP and MODIS, respectively. Similar results are observed when R-e is segregated by cloud-top height and in detailed case studies. The clouds sampled during CAMP(2)Ex consist of mostly small (mean transect length similar to 1.4 km) and low clouds (mean cloud-top height similar to 1 km), which had more numerous small clouds than the trade wind cumuli sampled in past field campaigns such as Rain in Shallow Cumulus over the Ocean (RICO) and the Indian Ocean Experiment (INDOEX). The overestimates of R-e from the RSP bi-spectral technique compared with the polarimetric technique increased as cloud size and cloud optical depth decreased. Drizzle, cloud-top bumpiness, and solar zenith angle, however, are not closely correlated with the overestimate of bi-spectral R-e. For shallow clouds that dominated the liquid cloud cover for the CAMP(2)Ex region and period, we show that 3-D radiative transfer and cloud heterogeneity, particularly for the optically thin and small clouds, appear to be the leading cause of the large positive biases in bi-spectral retrievals. Because this bias varies with the underlying structure of the cloud field, caution continues to be warranted in studies that use bi-spectral R-e retrievals in cumulus cloud fields.
