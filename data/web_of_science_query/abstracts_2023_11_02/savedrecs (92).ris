TI  - Utilization of Landsat-8 data for the estimation of carrot and maize crop water footprint under the arid climate of Saudi Arabia
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The crop Water Footprint (WF) can provide a comprehensive knowledge of the use of water through the demarcation of the amount of the water consumed by different crops. The WF has three components: green (WFg), blue (WFb) and grey (WFgr) water footprints. The WFg refers to the rainwater stored in the root zone soil layer and is mainly utilized for agricultural, horticultural and forestry production. The WFb, however, is the consumptive use of water from surface or groundwater resources and mainly deals with irrigated agriculture, industry, domestic water use, etc. While the WFgr is the amount of fresh water required to assimilate pollutants resulting from the use of fertilizers/agrochemicals. This study was conducted on six agricultural fields in the Eastern region of Saudi Arabia, during the period from December 2015 to December 2016, to investigate the spatiotemporal variation of the WF of silage maize and carrot crops. The WF of each crop was estimated in two ways, namely agro-meteorological (WFAgro) and remote sensing (WFRS) methods. The blue, green and grey components of WFAgro were computed with the use of weather station/Eddy covariance measurements and field recorded crop yield datasets. The WFRS estimated by applying surface energy balance principles on Landsat-8 imageries. However, due to non-availability of Landsat-8 data on the event of rainy days, this study was limited to blue component (WFRS-b). The WFAgro of silage maize was found to range from 3545 m(3) t(-1) to 4960 m(3) t(-1); on an average, the WFAgro-g, WFAgro-b, and WFAgro-gr are composed of < 1%, 77%, and 22%, respectively. In the case of carrot, the WFAgro ranged between 297 m(3) t(-1) and 502 m(3) t(-1). The WFAgro-g of carrot crop was estimated at < 1%, while WFAgro-b and WFAgro-gr was 67% and 32%, respectively. The WFAgro-b is occupied as a major portion in WF of silage maize (77%) and carrot (68%) crops. This is due to the high crop water demand combined with a very erratic rainfall, the irrigation is totally provided using groundwater delivered by center pivot irrigation systems. On the other hand, the WFRS-b estimated using Landsat-8 data was varied from 276 (+/- 73) m(3) t(-1) (carrot) and 2885 (+/- 441) m(3) t(-1) (silage maize). The variation (RMSE) between WFRS-b and WFAgro-b was about 17% and 14% for silage maize and carrot crops, respectively.

TI  - Predicting Heliothis (<i>Helicoverpa armigera</i>) pest population dynamics with an age-structured insect population model driven by satellite data
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - The cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera) is among the most damaging agricultural insect pests in the world. The life cycle of H. armigera is temperature dependent and as such modeling its population dynamics for integrated pest management (IPM) purposes requires accurate temperature information throughout the area of interest, which is not always available. We present, for the first time, a continuous age-structured insect population model driven by satellite-derived land surface temperature (LST) to derive population dynamics of H. armigera. We use LST data from the Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) conducting model simulations and validating the model with H. armigera larvae counts from in-field scout reports in nine sweet corn (Zea mays convar) and four tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) crop fields in Northern Israel. We compared our results with a similar model that uses air temperature derived from the nearest weather station as an input. To accurately predict population dynamics, we used different model initiation scenarios considering pesticide application and migration patterns between neighboring corn and tomato fields, which were identified as sink and source of the adult population. Results show that our LST-driven model outperformed the model driven by ambient air temperature. Model simulations generally followed the larval population development observed in the field when the model was initiated the day before the first larvae were detected, providing realistic population dynamics. Simulations with different adult population migration rates showed the importance of including between-field migration in the LST-driven model. In conclusion, this study provides a basis for future development of real-time IPM support systems, particularly when combining a temperature driven age-structured insect population model with real-time satellite-derived information.

TI  - Label-free quantitative proteomic analysis of drought stress-responsive late embryogenesis abundant proteins in the seedling leaves of two wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i> L.) genotypes
T2  - JOURNAL OF PROTEOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins are highly hydrophilic proteins with key roles in environmental stress responses. In this study, we performed the first survey of the LEA proteome in seedling leaves from two wheat genotypes subjected to drought stress, i.e., Shaanhe 6 (SH, drought-tolerant) and Zhengyin 1 (ZY, drought-sensitive). After isolating the LEA subpopulation by treating total soluble proteins with heating combined with 1% trichloroacetic acid treatment that was assessed by Western blotting of dehydrins, label-free proteomic analysis identified 38 LEA proteins or homologues belonging to seven LEA subfamilies in the two genotypes. The abundances of over half of the LEA proteins changed significantly after drought stress and they were involved in protection against drought, with at least 20 in SH and 14 in ZY. We found that the common differentially expressed LEA proteins increased in abundance more in the SH genotype compared with the ZY genotype, and six LEA proteins were significantly upregulated exclusively in the SH genotype, which may contribute to higher drought tolerance in SH. We also identified 221 non-LEA proteins from 12 functional categories. Our results provide a deeper understanding of the LEA expression patterns in response to drought stress in two wheat genotypes.Significance: We identified 38 LEA proteins or homologues from different LEA families in two wheat genotypes, thereby indicating the complex and versatile protective roles of LEA proteins in drought stress resistance. Moreover, the abundance of differentially expressed LEA proteins increased more in the SH genotype compared with the ZY genotype, and several LEA proteins with significant upregulation only in the SH genotype may contribute to its higher tolerance of drought stress. 221 non-LEA proteins were differentially accumulated in at least one of the SH and ZY genotypes. They are involved mainly with 12 biological functions and they might explain different drought responses of the two genotypes. The differentially expressed LEA and non-LEA proteins may be potential markers of drought tolerance to facilitate wheat breeding, particularly those that were specifically upregulated in the SH genotype, or with opposing expression patterns in the two genotypes.

TI  - Radiometric Calibration Tracking Detection for FY-3A/MERSI by Joint Use of Snow Targets in South and North Poles
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow targets of Dome C and Greenland in the south and north poles arc the calibration tracking targets, which arc internationally applied. However, due to the existence of polar night phenomenon, it is difficult to continuously calibrate and track remote sensing instruments in a single polar ice and snow target. In response to this problem, a method of continuous tracking and monitoring of the radiation performance of the FY-3A/ medium resolution spectral imager (MERSI) solar reflectance band using a combination of two polar ice targets is proposed. Firstly, using the relatively stable observation data of FY-3A/MERSI in late life stage, two bidirectional distribution function models of apparent reflectivity of ice and snow target arc established. Then, the model is used to normalize the apparent reflectivity sequence of ice and snow target, eliminate the change information caused by the target non-Lambertian, obtain the parameters that reflect the change of the radiation performance of the remote sensor, and achieve the fusion of different ice and snow target data series. Finally, using the quadratic polynomial fitting model, the trend of the data after the fusion is analyzed, and it is compared with other related research results. The results show that the uncertainty of the tracking model is better than 3%, especially for the short wavelength of less than 550 nm, in which the uncertainty is better than 2%. Attenuation rate results show that the blue band attenuation is significant, especially in the band 8 (113 nm), the annual average attenuation rate is close to 7%. The red and the near infrared band (excluding the water vapor channel) arc the most stable wave bands, and the annual average attenuation rate is within +/- 0.5%. The verification results show that the proposed method is in good agreement with other methods, and the deviation of the total attenuation rate of many years in most bands is less than 3%.

TI  - Classification of the type of eco-geological environment of a coal mine district: A case study of an ecologically fragile region in Western China
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Western China is characterized by abundant coal resources but it also faces the problems of poor water resources and fragile ecological environment, which have become more prominent due to the large-scale exploitation of coal resources in recent years. Shennan coal mine district is located at the border area between the Loess Plateau and Mu Us Desert of Northern Shaanxi province, which belongs to the typical arid and semi-arid ecologically fragile region of Western China, The geological features and ecological environmental characteristics of this district show wide variations with spatial distribution. However, intense coal mining activities will inevitably lead to further deterioration of the already fragile ecological and geological (eco-geological) environment, making recovery increasingly difficult. Therefore, investigating the different characteristics and classifying the types of the eco-geological environment are of great significance to in selecting appropriate mining methods, which would help in realizing coordinated exploitation of coal resources and environmental protection before coal exploitation. In this study, based on the remote sensing and geographic information system technology, Landsat8 remote sensing image, regional geological data, Digital Elevation Model (DEM), borehole data, hydrological data were analyzed. Furthermore, the eco-geological environment of the study area was classified into three types with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, surface elevation, terrain slope, surface lithology, geomorphic type, and hydrographic net are selected as the main control factors to classify eco-geological environment type. Each control factor was quantified using ArcGIS, with the aid of MATLAB 2014b as the computing platform, eco-geological environment of study area is classified into three types combining weighted fuzzy C-means (WFCM) clustering algorithm and the weight of each main control factor determined by fuzzy Delphi analytic hierarchy process (FDAHP) method. Finally, the classification of the eco-geological environment was verified through a field survey of the Hongliulin coal mine, and the results showed high accuracy. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Patterns of island change and persistence offer alternate adaptation pathways for atoll nations
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea-level rise and climatic change threaten the existence of atoll nations. Inundation and erosion are expected to render islands uninhabitable over the next century, forcing human migration. Here we present analysis of shoreline change in all 101 islands in the Pacific atoll nation of Tuvalu. Using remotely sensed data, change is analysed over the past four decades, a period when local sea level has risen at twice the global average (similar to 3.90 +/- 0.4 mm. yr(-1)). Results highlight a net increase in land area in Tuvalu of 73.5 ha (2.9%), despite sea-level rise, and land area increase in eight of nine atolls. Island change has lacked uniformity with 74% increasing and 27% decreasing in size. Results challenge perceptions of island loss, showing islands are dynamic features that will persist as sites for habitation over the next century, presenting alternate opportunities for adaptation that embrace the heterogeneity of island types and their dynamics.

TI  - Assessment and monitoring of land degradation using geospatial technology in Bathinda district, Punjab, India
T2  - SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Land degradation leads to alteration of ecological and economic functions due to a decrease in productivity and quality of the land. The aim of the present study was to assess land degradation with the help of geospatial technology - remote sensing (RS) and geographical information system (GIS) - in Bathinda district, Punjab. The severity of land degradation was estimated quantitatively by analyzing the physico-chemical parameters in the laboratory to determine saline or salt-free soils and calcareous or sodic soils and further correlating them with satellite-based studies. The pH varied between 7.37 and 8.59, electrical conductivity (EC) between 1.97 and 8.78 dS m(-1) and the methyl orange or total alkalinity between 0.070 and 0.223 (HCO3-) g L-1 as CaCO3. The spatial variability in these soil parameters was depicted through soil maps generated in a GIS environment. The results revealed that the soil in the study area was exposed to salt intrusion, which could be mainly attributed to irrigation practices in the state of Punjab. Most of the soil samples of the study area were slightly or moderately saline with a few salt-free sites. Furthermore, the majority of the soil samples were calcareous and a few samples were alkaline or sodic in nature. A comparative analysis of temporal satellite datasets of Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 OLI_TIRS of 2000 and 2014, respectively, revealed that the water body showed a slight decreasing trend from 2.46 km(2) in 2000 to 1.87 km(2) in 2014, while the human settlements and other built-up areas expanded from 586.25 to 891.09 km(2) in a span of 14 years. The results also showed a decrease in area under barren land from 68.9847 km(2) in 2000 to 15.26 km(2) in 2014. A significant correlation was observed between the digital number (DN) of the near-infrared band and pH and EC. Therefore, it is suggested that the present study can be applied to projects with special relevance to soil scientists, environmental scientists and planning agencies that can use the present study as baseline data to combat land degradation and conserve land resources in an efficient manner.

TI  - Integrated vector control of <i>Aedes aegypti</i> mosquitoes around target houses
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The developing fetuses of pregnant women are at high risk of developing serious birth defects following Zika virus infections. We applied an Integrated Vector Control (IVC) approach using source reduction, larviciding, and mass trapping with non-insecticidal sticky traps to protect targeted houses by reducing the density of female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes.Methods: We tested the hypothesis that Ae. aegypti density could be reduced to below three female mosquitoes/trap/week around a target house in the center of a circular area with a 150 m radius using IVC. Two non-adjacent areas within the same neighbourhood were selected and randomly designated as the treatment or control areas. Sentinel Autocidal Gravid Ovitraps (SAGO traps) were placed in each study area and were sampled weekly from May to November, during the 2016 Zika epidemic in Puerto Rico. The experimental design was longitudinal with pre- and post-IVC treatment observations between treatment and control areas, and a partial cross-over design, where IVC was applied to the original control area after 2 months to determine if Ae. aegypti density converged to levels observed in the treatment area. Pools of female Ae. aegypti mosquitoes were analyzed by RT-PCR to detect Zika, dengue and chikungunya virus RNA.Results: Overall, pre-treatment mosquito densities in the inner (0-50 m; 15.6 mosquitoes/trap/week), intermediate (50-100 m; 18.1) and outer rings (100-150 m; 15.6) were reduced after treatment to 2.8, 4.1, and 4.3 in the inner, middle, and outer rings, respectively. Density at the target house in the treatment area changed from 27.7 mosquitoes/trap/week before IVC to 2.1 after IVC (92.4% reduction), whereas after treating the original control area (cross-over) density changed from 22.4 to 3.5 (84.3% reduction). Vector reductions were sustained in both areas after IVC. Zika virus was detected in Ae. aegypti, but the low incidence of the virus precluded assessing the impact of IVC on Zika transmission during the study.Conclusions: Applying IVC to circular areas that were surrounded by untreated areas significantly decreased the number of mosquitoes around target houses located in the center. Gravid Ae. aegypti females in the center of the 150 m areas fell below threshold levels that possibly protect against novel invading arboviruses, such as chikungunya and Zika.

TI  - Differing HIV vulnerability among female sex workers in a high HIV burden Indian state
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionThe HIV sentinel surveillance [HSS] conducted in 2010-11 among female sex workers [FSW] in the state of Maharashtra, India provided an opportunity to assess characteristics of different types of FSWs and their HIV risk. It is important for India's National AIDS Control Program, to understand the differences in vulnerability among these FSW, in order to define more specific and effective risk reduction intervention strategies. Therefore, we analyzed data from HSS with the objective of understanding the HIV vulnerability among different types of FSW in Maharashtra.Material and methodsCross sectional data collected as a part of HSS among FSWs in year 2010-11 from 21 sentinel sites in the state of Maharashtra were analyzed to understand the vulnerability and characteristics of different types of female sex workers based on their place of solicitation using multinomial logistic regression.ResultsWhile the HIV prevalence was 6.6% among all FSWs, it was 9.9% among brothel based [BB], 9% among street based [SB] and 3.1% and 3.7% among home based [HB], and bar based [Bar-B] sex workers respectively. SB FSWs were least likely to be located in HIV low burden districts [ANC] [ARRR: 0.61[95% CI: 0.49, 0.77]], but were 6 times more likely to be recently [<1 year] involved in sex work [ARRR: 6.15 [95% CI: 3.15, 12.0]]. The number of clients of SB FSWs in the preceding week were lower than 11% [ARRR: 0.89 [95% CI: 0.87, 0.90]] as compared to the BB FSWs denoting lesser client load. The duration since last paid sex was shorter [ARRR: 0.94[95% CI: 0.91, 0.96]] as compared to the BB FSWs.ConclusionStreet based FSWs have emerged as one of the most vulnerable types of FSW with a high HIV prevalence similar to BB FSWs. Our study reveals that they have more frequent sex acts despite lower client loads, and are more likely to be located in districts highly affected by HIV (ANC prevalence >1%). We identify them as a group to be focused on for prevention interventions and it is likely that they would be easily amenable to novel interventions due to their higher literacy rate as compared to other typologies.

TI  - Investigating biomass burning aerosol morphology using a laser imaging nephelometer
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Particle morphology is an important parameter affecting aerosol optical properties that are relevant to climate and air quality, yet it is poorly constrained due to sparse in situ measurements. Biomass burning is a large source of aerosol that generates particles with different morphologies. Quantifying the optical contributions of non-spherical aerosol populations is critical for accurate radiative transfer models, and for correctly interpreting remote sensing data. We deployed a laser imaging nephelometer at the Missoula Fire Sciences Laboratory to sample biomass burning aerosol from controlled fires during the FIREX intensive laboratory study. The laser imaging nephelometer measures the unpolarized scattering phase function of an aerosol ensemble using diode lasers at 375 and 405 nm. Scattered light from the bulk aerosol in the instrument is imaged onto a charge- coupled device (CCD) using a wide-angle field-of-view lens, which allows for measurements at 4-175 degrees scattering angle with similar to 0.5 degrees angular resolution. Along with a suite of other instruments, the laser imaging nephelometer sampled fresh smoke emissions both directly and after removal of volatile components with a thermodenuder at 250 degrees C. The total integrated aerosol scattering signal agreed with both a cavity ring-down photoacoustic spectrometer system and a traditional integrating nephelometer within instrumental uncertainties. We compare the measured scattering phase functions at 405 nm to theoretical models for spherical (Mie) and fractal (Rayleigh-Debye-Gans) particle morphologies based on the size distribution reported by an optical particle counter. Results from representative fires demonstrate that particle morphology can vary dramatically for different fuel types. In some cases, the measured phase function cannot be described using Mie theory. This study demonstrates the capabilities of the laser imaging nephelometer instrument to provide realtime, in situ information about dominant particle morphology, which is vital for understanding remote sensing data and accurately describing the aerosol population in radiative transfer calculations.

TI  - Seasonal and annual variability of coastal sulphur plumes in the northern Benguela upwelling system
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated the seasonal and annual variability of surface sulphur plumes in the northern Benguela upwelling system off Namibia because of their significant impacts on the marine ecosystem, fishing industry, aquaculture farming and tourism due to their toxic properties. We identified the sulphur plumes in ocean colour satellite data of the medium resolution imaging spectrometer (MERIS) for the 2002-2012 time period using the differences in the spectral properties of Namibian Benguela optical water types. The sulphur events have a strong seasonal cycle with pronounced main and off-seasons forced by local and remote-driven processes. The main peak season is in late austral summer and early austral autumn at the beginning of the annual upwelling cycle caused by increasing equatorwards along-shore winds. The sulphur plume activity is high between February and April during the seasonal oxygen minimum associated with the seasonal reduction of cross-shore ventilation of the bottom waters, the seasonal southernmost position of the Angola Benguela Frontal Zone, the seasonal maximum of water mass fractions of South Atlantic and Angola Gyre Central Waters as well as the seasonal arrival of the downwelling coastal trapped waves. The off-season is in austral spring and early austral summer during increased upwelling intensity and enhanced oxygen supply. The annual variability of sulphur events is characterized by very high activities in years 2004, 2005 and 2010 interrupted by periods of lower activity in years 2002 to 2003, 2006 to 2009 and 2011 to 2012. This result can be explained by the relative contributions or adding effects of local and remote-driven forces (from the equatorial area). The probability for the occurrence of sulphur plumes is enhanced in years with a lower annual mean of upwelling intensity, decreased oxygen supply associated with decreased lateral ventilation of bottom waters, more southern position of the Angola Benguela Frontal Zone, increased mass fraction of South Atlantic Central Water and stronger downwelling coastal trapped waves. Understanding of the variability and forcing processes of the toxic sulphur events will help in the future to monitor and forecast them as well as to manage their social and economic consequences in the northern Benguela upwelling system off Namibia.

TI  - Comparison of the prevalence of respiratory viruses in patients with acute respiratory infections at different hospital settings in North China, 2012-2015
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are a great public health challenge globally. The prevalence of respiratory viruses in patients with ARIs attending at different hospital settings is fully undetermined.Methods: Laboratory-based surveillance for ARIs was conducted at inpatient and outpatient settings of 11 hospitals in North China. The first 2-5 patients with ARIs were recruited in each hospital weekly from 2012 through 2015. The presence of respiratory viruses was screened by PCR assays. The prevalence of respiratory viruses was determined and compared between patients at different hospital settings.Results: A total of 3487 hospitalized cases and 6437 outpatients/Emergency Department (ED) patients were enrolled. The most commonly detected viruses in the hospitalized cases were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, 33.3%) in children less than two years old, adenoviruses (13.0%) in patients 15-34 years old, and influenza viruses (IFVs, 9.6%) in patients >= 65 years. IFVs were the most common virus in outpatient/ED patients across all age groups (22.7%). After controlling for the confounders caused by other viruses and covariates, adenoviruses (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 3.97, 99% confidence interval [99% CI]: 2.19-7.20) and RSV (aOR: 2.04, 99% CI: 1.34-3.11) were independently associated with increased hospitalization in children, as well as adenoviruses in adults (aOR: 2.14, 99% CI: 1.19-3.85). Additionally, co-infection of RSV with IFVs was associated with increased hospitalization in children (aOR: 12.20, 99% CI: 2.65-56.18).Conclusions: A substantial proportion of ARIs was associated with respiratory viruses in North China. RSV, adenoviruses, and co-infection of RSV and IFVs were more frequent in hospitalized children (or adenoviruses in adults), which might predict the severity of ARIs. Attending clinicians should be more vigilant of these infections.

TI  - The potential of satellite spectro-imagery for monitoring CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from large cities
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assesses the potential of 2 to 10 km resolution imagery of CO2 concentrations retrieved from the shortwave infrared measurements of a space-borne passive spectrometer for monitoring the spatially integrated emissions from the Paris area. Such imagery could be provided by missions similar to CarbonSat, which was studied as a candidate Earth Explorer 8 mission by the European Space Agency (ESA). This assessment is based on observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs) with an atmospheric inversion approach at city scale. The inversion system solves for hourly city CO2 emissions and natural fluxes, or for these fluxes per main anthropogenic sector or ecosystem, during the 6 h before a given satellite overpass. These 6 h correspond to the period during which emissions produce CO2 plumes that can be identified on the image from this overpass. The statistical framework of the inversion accounts for the existence of some prior knowledge with 50% uncertainty on the hourly or sectorial emissions, and with similar to 25% uncertainty on the 6 h mean emissions, from an inventory based on energy use and carbon fuel consumption statistics. The link between the hourly or sectorial emissions and the vertically integrated column of CO2 observed by the satellite is simulated using a coupled flux and atmospheric transport model. This coupled model is built with the information on the spatial and temporal distribution of emissions from the emission inventory produced by the local air-quality agency (Airparif) and a 2 km horizontal resolution atmospheric transport model. Tests are conducted for different realistic simulations of the spatial coverage, resolution, precision and accuracy of the imagery from sun-synchronous polar-orbiting missions, corresponding to the specifications of CarbonSat and Sentinel-5 or extrapolated from these specifications. First, OSSEs are conducted with a rather optimistic configuration in which the inversion system is perfectly informed about the statistics of the limited number of error sources. These OSSEs indicate that the image resolution has to be finer than 4 km to decrease the uncertainty in the 6 h mean emissions by more than 50 %. More complex experiments assess the impact of more realistic error estimates that current inversion methods do not properly account for, in particular, the systematic measurement errors with spatially correlated patterns. These experiments highlight the difficulty to improve current knowledge on CO2 emissions for urban areas like Paris with CO2 observations from satellites, and call for more technological innovations in the remote sensing of vertically integrated columns of CO2 and in the inversion systems that exploit it.

TI  - Business travel-associated illness: a GeoSentinel analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAVEL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Analysis of a large cohort of business travelers will help clinicians focus on frequent and serious illnesses. We aimed to describe travel-related health problems in business travelers.Methods: GeoSentinel Surveillance Network consists of 64 travel and tropical medicine clinics in 29 countries; descriptive analysis was performed on ill business travelers, defined as persons traveling for work, evaluated after international travel 1 January 1997 through 31 December 2014.Results: Among 12 203 business travelers seen 1997-2014 (14 045 eligible diagnoses), the majority (97%) were adults aged 20-64 years; most (74%) reported from Western Europe or North America; two-thirds were male. Most (86%) were outpatients. Fewer than half (45%) reported a pre-travel healthcare encounter. Frequent regions of exposure were sub-Saharan Africa (37%), Southeast Asia (15%) and South Central Asia (14%). The most frequent diagnoses were malaria (9%), acute unspecified diarrhea (8%), viral syndrome (6%), acute bacterial diarrhea (5%) and chronic diarrhea (4%). Species was reported for 973 (90%) of 1079 patients with malaria, predominantly Plasmodium falciparum acquired in sub-Saharan Africa. Of 584 (54%) with malaria chemoprophylaxis information, 92% took none or incomplete courses. Thirteen deaths were reported, over half of which were due to malaria; others succumbed to pneumonia, typhoid fever, rabies, melioidosis and pyogenic abscess.Conclusions: Diarrheal illness was a major cause of morbidity. Malaria contributed substantial morbidity and mortality, particularly among business travelers to sub-Saharan Africa. Underuse or non-use of chemoprophylaxis contributed to malaria cases. Deaths in business travelers could be reduced by improving adherence to malaria chemoprophylaxis and targeted vaccination for vaccine-preventable diseases. Pre-travel advice is indicated for business travelers and is currently under-utilized and needs improvement.

TI  - Rapid nodal staging of head and neck cancer surgical specimens with flow cytometric analysis
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Detection of metastatic spread of head and neck cancer to cervical lymph nodes is essential for optimal design of therapy. Undetected metastases lead to mortality, which can be prevented by better detection methods.Methods: We analysed 41 lymph nodes from 19 patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Each lymph node was divided in two, one half processed for histopathology and the other half dissociated into single-cell suspension, stained for the carcinoma cell markers cytokeratin 5/8 (CK5/8), epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) and epithelial mucin (MUC-1), and analysed with flow cytometry. Flow cytometry data were compared with histopathology performed on serial sections and immunohistochemistry. Six cervical lymph nodes from cancer-free patients were used to establish baseline levels in flow cytometry.Results: Flow cytometry analysis (fluorescence-activated cell sorting; FACS) detected all six metastases confirmed by histopathology as well as the histologically negative nodes. Importantly, among nine sentinel lymph nodes, FACS analysis detected <1% malignant cells in four cases, not found in histopathology. Results from flow cytometry analysis can be obtained within 3 h of the time of biopsy.Conclusions: We show that flow cytometric analysis of nodal tissue is sensitive and reliable in identifying metastases of OSCC. Flow cytometry is inexpensive and fast, providing a possibility of perioperative diagnostics and immediate treatment planning.

TI  - Criticality of the zero-temperature jamming transition probed by self-propelled particles
T2  - SOFT MATTER
M3  - Article
AB  - We perform simulations of athermal systems of self-propelled particles (SPPs) interacting via harmonic repulsion in the vicinity of the zero-temperature jamming transition at point J. Every particle is propelled by a constant force f pointing to a randomly assigned and fixed direction. When f is smaller than the yield force f(y), the system is statically jammed. We find that f(y) increases with packing fraction and exhibits finite size scaling, implying the criticality of point J. When f > f(y), SPPs flow forever and their velocities satisfy the k-Gamma distribution. Velocity distributions at various packing fractions and f collapse when the particle velocity is scaled by the average velocity (v) over bar, suggesting that (v) over bar is a reasonable quantity to characterize the response to f. We thus define a response function R(phi,f) = (v) over bar(phi,f)/f. The function exhibits critical scaling nicely, implying again the criticality of point J. Our analysis and results indicate that systems of SPPs behave analogically to sheared systems, although their driving mechanisms are apparently distinct.

TI  - Favourable prognostic role of histological regression in stage III positive sentinel lymph node melanoma patients
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph node (SLN)-positive melanoma patients are a heterogeneous group of patients with survival rates ranging from similar to 20 to over 80%. No data are reported concerning the role of histological regression on survival in stage III melanoma.Methods: The study included 365 patients with positive SLN from two distinct hospitals. The model was developed on patients from 'AOU Citta della Salute e della Scienza di Torino', and externally validated on patients from IRCCS of Candiolo. Survival analyses were carried out according to the presence of regression and adjusted for all other prognostic factors.Results: Among patients followed at 'AOU Citta della Salute e della Scienza di Torino' (n = 264), the median follow-up time to death or censoring (whatever two events occurred earlier) was 2.7 years since diagnosis (interquartile range: 1.3-5.8). In all, 79 patients died from melanoma and 11 from other causes. Histological regression (n = 43) was associated with a better prognosis (sub-HR = 0.34, CI 0.12-0.92), whereas the other factors above showed an inverse association. In the external validation, the concordance index was 0.97 at 1 year and decreased to 0.66 at 3 years and to 0.59 at 5 years. Adding histological regression in the prognostic model increased the discriminative ability to 0.75 at 3 years and to 0.62 at 5 years. Finally, using a cutoff of 20% for the risk of death led to a net re-classification improvement of 15 and 11% at 3 and 5 years after diagnosis, respectively.Conclusions: Histological regression could lead to an improvement in prognostic prediction in patients with stage III-positive SLN melanoma.

TI  - Photosynthesis-irradiance parameters of marine phytoplankton: synthesis of a global data set
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - The photosynthetic performance of marine phytoplankton varies in response to a variety of factors, environmental and taxonomic. One of the aims of the MArine primary Production: model Parameters from Space (MAPPS) project of the European Space Agency is to assemble a global database of photosynthesis-irradiance (P-E) parameters from a range of oceanographic regimes as an aid to examining the basin-scale variability in the photophysiological response of marine phytoplankton and to use this information to improve the assignment of P-E parameters in the estimation of global marine primary production using satellite data. The MAPPS P-E database, which consists of over 5000 P-E experiments, provides information on the spatio-temporal variability in the two P-E parameters (the assimilation number, P-m(B) , and the initial slope, alpha(B), where the superscripts B indicate normalisation to concentration of chlorophyll) that are fundamental inputs for models (satellite-based and otherwise) of marine primary production that use chlorophyll as the state variable. Quality control measures consisted of removing samples with abnormally high parameter values and flags were added to denote whether the spectral quality of the incubator lamp was used to calculate a broad-band value of alpha(B). The MAPPS database provides a photophysiological data set that is unprecedented in number of observations and in spatial coverage. The database will be useful to a variety of research communities, including marine ecologists, biogeochemical modellers, remote-sensing scientists and algal physiologists.

TI  - Connecting smoke plumes to sources using Hazard Mapping System (HMS) smoke and fire location data over North America
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fires represent an air quality challenge because they are large, dynamic and transient sources of particulate matter and ozone precursors. Transported smoke can deteriorate air quality over large regions. Fire severity and frequency are likely to increase in the future, exacerbating an existing problem. Using the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) Hazard Mapping System (HMS) smoke data for North America for the period 2007 to 2014, we examine a subset of fires that are confirmed to have produced sufficient smoke to warrant the initiation of a U.S. National Weather Service smoke forecast. We find that gridded HMS-analyzed fires are well correlated (r = 0.84) with emissions from the Global Fire Emissions Inventory Database 4s (GFED4s). We define a new metric, smoke hours, by linking observed smoke plumes to active fires using ensembles of forward trajectories. This work shows that the Southwest, Northwest, and Northwest Territories initiate the most air quality forecasts and produce more smoke than any other North American region by measure of the number of HYSPLIT points analyzed, the duration of those HYSPLIT points, and the total number of smoke hours produced. The average number of days with smoke plumes overhead is largest over the north-central United States. Only Alaska, the Northwest, the Southwest, and Southeast United States regions produce the majority of smoke plumes observed over their own borders. This work moves a new dataset from a daily operational setting to a research context, and it demonstrates how changes to the frequency or intensity of fires in the western United States could impact other regions.

TI  - Estimating winter wheat planting area in north China driven by the East Asia monsoon
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping and monitoring cropland areas and distributions from remote sensing data could provide early warning information of threats to the global and regional food security. Winter wheat is traditionally the most cultivated food crop in China, and the Huang-Huai-Hai (HHH) plain is an important winter wheat production base. Due to a long latitudinal distance, the same winter wheat growth stage delays from the north to the south of the plain. Influenced by the monsoon climate, isolines of the winter wheat phenology are oriented in a northeast-southwest direction, which is similar to that of the temperature distribution. In this paper, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-enhanced vegetation index (EVI) was applied to estimate the winter wheat planting information on the HHH plain, using a model built according to seasonal change of the winter wheat EVI. The result shows that the average accuracy of the estimation was 75.4% with a standard deviation of 26.1%, when the impacts from the phenology delay and the monsoon climate were not considered. When winter wheat phenology delay was considered with and without the influences from the monsoon climate, the accuracy was 93.2% with a standard deviation of 6.1% and 84.7% with a standard deviation of 11.0%, respectively. The accuracy increased evidently. Therefore, both the phenology delay and monsoon climate impacts should be taken into consideration when estimating the winter wheat planting information in a large monsoon climate region.

TI  - Use of Direct Oral Anticoagulants in Canadian Primary Care Practice 2010-2015: A Cohort Study From the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundAs questions have been raised about the appropriateness of direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) dosing among outpatients with atrial fibrillation, we examined this issue in patients being managed by primary care providers.Methods and ResultsThis was a retrospective cohort new-user study using electronic medical records from 744 Canadian primary care clinicians. Potentially inappropriate DOAC prescribing was defined as prescribing lower or higher doses than those recommended by guidelines for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Of the 6658 patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation who were prescribed a DOAC (mean age: 74.8; 55% male), 626 (9.4%) had a CHADS(2) score of 0, and 168 (2.5%) had a CHADS-VASc score of 0. Of the DOAC prescriptions, 527 (7.7%) were deemed potentially inappropriate: 496 (7.2%) were potentially underdosed, and 31 (0.5%) were prescribed a dose that was higher than recommended. Patients were more likely to be prescribed lower-than-recommended doses if they were female (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.3 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.0-1.5]), had multiple comorbidities (aOR: 1.4 [95% CI, 1.1-1.8])particularly heart failure (aOR: 1.6 [95% CI, 1.2-2.0]) or dementia (aOR: 1.4 [95% CI, 1.1-1.8])or if they were also taking aspirin (aOR: 1.7 [95% CI, 1.3-2.1]) or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (aOR: 1.2 [95% CI, 1.02-1.5]). Potentially inappropriate DOAC dosing was more common in rural practices (aOR: 2.1 [95% CI, 1.7-2.6]) or smaller practices (aOR: 1.9 [95% CI, 1.6-2.4] for practices smaller than median).ConclusionsThe vast majority of DOAC prescriptions in our cohort of primary care-managed patients appeared to be for appropriate doses, particularly since prescribing a reduced dose of DOAC may be appropriate in frail patients or those taking other medications that predispose to bleeding.

TI  - Dissolved organic matter and its optical characteristics in the Laptev and East Siberian seas: spatial distribution and interannual variability (2003-2011)
T2  - OCEAN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS) is the broadest and shallowest continental shelf in the world. It is characterized by both the highest rate of coastal erosion in the world and a large riverine input of terrigenous dissolved organic matter (DOM). DOM plays a significant role in marine aquatic ecosystems. The chromophoric fraction of DOM (CDOM) directly affects the quantity and spectral quality of available light, thereby impacting both primary production and ultraviolet (UV) exposure in aquatic ecosystems.A multiyear study of CDOM absorption, fluorescence, and spectral characteristics was carried out over the vast ESAS in the summer-fall seasons. The paper describes observations accomplished at 286 stations and 1766 in situ high-resolution optical measurements distributed along the nearshore zone. Spatial and interannual CDOM dynamics over the ESAS were investigated, and driving factors were identified. It was shown that the atmospheric circulation regime is the dominant factor controlling CDOM distribution on the ESAS.This paper explores the possibility of using CDOM and its spectral parameters to identify the different biogeochemical regimes in the surveyed area. The analysis of CDOM spectral characteristics showed that the major part of the Laptev and East Siberian seas shelf is influenced by terrigenous DOM carried in riverine discharge. Western and eastern provinces of the ESAS with distinctly different DOM optical properties were also identified; a transition between the two provinces at around 165-170 degrees E, also consistent with hydrological and hydrochemical data, is shown.In the western ESAS, a region of substantial river impact, the content of aromatic carbon within DOM remains almost constant. In the eastern ESAS, a gradual decrease in aromaticity percentage was observed, indicating contribution of Pacific-origin waters, where allochthonous DOM with predominantly aliphatic character and much smaller absorption capacity predominates. In addition, we found a stable tendency towards reduced concentrations of CDOM and dissolved lignin and an increase in spectral slope and slope ratio values eastward from the Lena River delta; the Lena is the main supplier of DOM to the eastern Arctic shelf.The strong positive correlation (r = 0.97) between dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and CDOM values in the surface shelf waters influenced by terrigenous discharge indicates that it is feasible to estimate DOC content from CDOM fluorescence assessed in situ using a WETStar fluorometer. This approach is reliable over the salinity range of 3 to 24.5. The fact that there is little difference between predicted and observed parameters indicates that the approach is justified.The direct estimation of DOM optical characteristics in the surface ESAS waters provided by this multiyear study will also be useful for validating and calibrating remote sensing data.

Here, we evaluate model reliability based on a comprehensive comparison of decadal trends (2002-2014) in land water storage from seven global models (WGHM, PCR-GLOBWB, GLDAS NOAH, MOSAIC, VIC, CLM, and CLSM) to trends from three Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite solutions in 186 river basins (similar to 60% of global land area). Medians of modeled basin water storage trends greatly underestimate GRACE-derived large decreasing (<=-0.5 km(3)/y) and increasing (>= 0.5 km(3)/y) trends. Decreasing trends from GRACE are mostly related to human use (irrigation) and climate variations, whereas increasing trends reflect climate variations. For example, in the Amazon, GRACE estimates a large increasing trend of similar to 43 km(3)/y, whereas most models estimate decreasing trends (-71 to 11 km(3)/y). Land water storage trends, summed over all basins, are positive for GRACE (similar to 71-82 km(3)/y) but negative for models (-450 to -12 km(3)/y), contributing opposing trends to global mean sea level change. Impacts of climate forcing on decadal land water storage trends exceed those of modeled human intervention by about a factor of 2. The model-GRACE comparison highlights potential areas of future model development, particularly simulated water storage. The inability of models to capture large decadal water storage trends based on GRACE indicates that model projections of climate and human-induced water storage changes may be underestimated.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: To investigate the sensitivity and specificity of commercial nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) testing kits for Dengue fever diagnose, and provide the evidence for diagnostic criteria revision. Methods: 300 PCR or virus isolation positive blood samples for dengue virus were collected from sentinel hospitals for dengue surveillance in Guangzhou, Dongguang and Zhongshang from May 2015 to Nov. 2016. At the same time, 308 PCR negative samples for Dengue virus were collected as control group. The information of the sample was collected using questionnaires. These samples were tested using imported and domestic ELISA and the colloidal gold-labeled kits that were widely used for detecting dengue NS1. Sensitivity, specificity and coincidence were calculated and analyzed, and Z hongshan's result was regarded as the reslut of the third part. Results: The positive group includes 133 males and 167 females, average ages are 47.2±13.3, 179, 110 and 11 of them is Dengue Ⅰ, Ⅱ and Ⅲ respectively. The negative group includes 154 males and 154 females, average ages are (40.1±11.6) years old. The sensitivity of domestic ELISA Kits (94.5%) is less than imported (99.5%), and the result has statistical significance (chi(2)=8.59, P=0.030), the specificity is 99.7% and 97.7% respectively; The sensitivity of imported and domestic the colloidal gold-labeled Kits is 97.5% and 96.5% respectively, both of specificities are 100%. The sensitivity and specificity of Dengue Ⅰ for NS1 test are more than 97.0%. The sensitivity of domestic ELISA and gold-labeled Kits is 90.0% and 95.0%, and the specificity is 96.8% and 100% respectively for Dengue Ⅱ test. The sensitivity of imported ELISA and gold-labeled Kits is 100% and 98.0%, and the specificity is 99.4% and 100% respectively for Dengue Ⅱ test. The result of the third party show the sensitivity and specificity of domestic ELISA and gold-labeled Kits are 90.0% and 98.0%, the differences has statistical significance (chi(2)=5.67, P=0.020). Conclusion: NS1 testing can be used as early dengue fever diagnose for higher sensitivity and specificity.

TI  - Diabetes and the occurrence of infection in primary care: a matched cohort study
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: People with diabetes may be at higher risk for acquiring infections through both glucose- dependent and biologic pathways independent of glycemic control. Our aim was to estimate the association between diabetes and infections occurring in primary care.Methods: Using the Newfoundland and Labrador Sentinel of the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network, patients with diabetes >= 18 years between 1 January 2008 and 31 March 2013 were included with at least 1-year of follow-up. We randomly matched each patient with diabetes on the date of study entry with up to 8 controls without diabetes. Primary outcome was the occurrence of >= 1 primary care physician visits for any infectious disease. Secondary outcomes included primary visits for head & neck, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, skin and soft tissue, musculoskeletal, and viral infections. Using multivariable conditional logistic regression analysis, we measured the independent association between diabetes and the occurrence of infections.Results: We identified 1779 patients with diabetes who were matched to 11,066 patients without diabetes. Patients with diabetes were older, had a higher prevalence of comorbidities, and were more often referred to specialists. After adjusting for potential confounders, patients with diabetes had an increased risk of any infection compared to patients without diabetes (adjusted odds ratio = 1.21, 95% confidence interval 1.07-1.37). Skin and soft tissue infections had the strongest association, followed by genitourinary, gastrointestinal, and respiratory infections. Diabetes was not associated with head and neck, musculoskeletal, or viral infections.Conclusion: Patients with diabetes appear to have an increased risk of certain infections compared to patients without diabetes.

TI  - Trends in parasite prevalence following 13 years of malaria interventions on Bioko island, Equatorial Guinea: 2004-2016
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Whilst there have been substantial reductions in malaria transmission over the past decade, in many countries in West and Central Africa the malaria burden remains high. Monitoring and evaluation of malaria transmission trends and intervention strategies are key elements for malaria control programmes. This study uses a time series of annual malaria indicator surveys to track the progress of malaria control in Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea, over a 13 year period of intensive interventions. Malaria infection and haemoglobin were measured annually in children (1 to 14 years) in cross-sectional household surveys from 2004 to 2016 in 18 sentinel sites across the island. Trends in transmission patterns were assessed and the impact of the vector control interventions (net use and spray coverage) was evaluated.Results: Between 2004 and 2016 approximately 106,500 individual tests for parasitaemia were conducted using rapid diagnostic tests. Although spray coverage remained relatively high (> 70%) over the time period, reported net usage was generally below 40%. Parasite prevalence reduced from 43.3 to 10.5% between 2004 and 2016. The prevalence of moderate to severe anaemia in children aged 1-5 years reduced from 14.9 to 1.6%. Impact in individual sites ranged from 57 to 100% reductions in parasite prevalence between 2004 and 2016. Sleeping under a net and living in a house that had been sprayed in the past 12 months were independently protective against infection (OR = 0.69 [95% CI 0.61-0.80] and OR = 0.87 [95% CI 0.78-0.97], respectively), whilst recent travel to the mainland increased the odds of infection nearly fourfold (OR = 3.94 [95% CI 2.79-5.56]).Conclusion: Island-wide interventions have resulted in a substantial reduction in malaria transmission on Bioko Island. This unique time series of 13 consecutive annual malaria indicator surveys clearly demonstrates the long-term effectiveness of the sustained use of two vector control interventions, indoor residual spraying and LLINs, and the value of comprehensive and sustained surveillance. Despite considerable success in reducing the burden on the island, malaria is still endemic, with populations in some areas remaining at high risk of infection.

TI  - Two decades of satellite observations of AOD over mainland China using ATSR-2, AATSR and MODIS/Terra: data set evaluation and large-scale patterns
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The retrieval of aerosol properties from satellite observations provides their spatial distribution over a wide area in cloud-free conditions. As such, they complement ground-based measurements by providing information over sparsely instrumented areas, albeit that significant differences may exist in both the type of information obtained and the temporal information from satellite and ground-based observations. In this paper, information from different types of satellite-based instruments is used to provide a 3-D climatology of aerosol properties over mainland China, i.e., vertical profiles of extinction coefficients from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP), a lidar flying aboard the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) satellite and the columnintegrated extinction (aerosol optical depth - AOD) available from three radiometers: the European Space Agency (ESA)'s Along-Track Scanning Radiometer version 2 (ATSR-2), Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) (together referred to as ATSR) and NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard the Terra satellite, together spanning the period 1995-2015. AOD data are retrieved from ATSR using the ATSR dual view (ADV) v2.31 algorithm, while for MODIS Collection 6 (C6) the AOD data set is used that was obtained from merging the AODs obtained from the dark target (DT) and deep blue (DB) algorithms, further referred to as the DTDB merged AOD product. These data sets are validated and differences are compared using Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) version 2 L2.0 AOD data as reference. The results show that, over China, ATSR slightly underestimates the AOD and MODIS slightly overestimates the AOD. Consequently, ATSR AOD is overall lower than that from MODIS, and the difference increases with increasing AOD. The comparison also shows that neither of the ATSR and MODIS AOD data sets is better than the other one everywhere. However, ATSR ADV has limitations over bright surfaces which the MODIS DB was designed for. To allow for comparison of MODIS C6 results with previous analyses where MODIS Collection 5.1 (C5.1) data were used, also the difference between the C6 and C5.1 merged DTDB data sets from MODIS/Terra over China is briefly discussed.The AOD data sets show strong seasonal differences and the seasonal features vary with latitude and longitude across China. Two-decadal AOD time series, averaged over all of mainland China, are presented and briefly discussed. Using the 17 years of ATSR data as the basis and MODIS/Terra to follow the temporal evolution in recent years when the environmental satellite Envisat was lost requires a compari son of the data sets for the overlapping period to show their complementarity. ATSR precedes the MODIS time series between 1995 and 2000 and shows a distinct increase in the AOD over this period. The two data series show similar variations during the overlapping period between 2000 and 2011, with minima and maxima in the same years. MODIS extends this time series beyond the end of the Envisat period in 2012, showing decreasing AOD.

TI  - The biology and ecology of slimy sculpin: A recipe for effective environmental monitoring
T2  - FACETS
M3  - Review
AB  - Recently, the use of small-bodied fish in environmental monitoring has increased, particularly within the Canadian environmental effects monitoring (EEM) and other adaptive programs. Although it is possible to measure changes with many small-bodied species, interpretation is often complicated by the absence of information on the biology and ecology of fish not of commercial, recreational, or traditional interest. Knowing and understanding the basic biology of these fishes aids in the sensitivity of study designs (i.e., ability to detect change) and the interpretation of all biological levels of responses (e.g., cellular to community). The increased use of slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus Richardson, 1836) in impact assessment studies in North America provides a considerable amount of information on life history aspects. The slimy sculpin has the most ubiquitous North American distribution among cottids but yet has a very small home range, thus integrating environmental conditions of localized areas. This paper describes aspects of slimy sculpin life cycle that affect collection efficiency and timing, and describes and provides data collected over more than 10 years of studies at more than 20 reference study sites. This overview provides a functional and informative compilation to support adaptive environmental monitoring and provide a baseline for comparative ecological study.

TI  - Reduced arctic tundra productivity linked with landform and climate change interactions
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Arctic tundra ecosystems have experienced unprecedented change associated with climate warming over recent decades. Across the Pan-Arctic, vegetation productivity and surface greenness have trended positively over the period of satellite observation. However, since 2011 these trends have slowed considerably, showing signs of browning in many regions. It is unclear what factors are driving this change and which regions/landforms will be most sensitive to future browning. Here we provide evidence linking decadal patterns in arctic greening and browning with regional climate change and local permafrost-driven landscape heterogeneity. We analyzed the spatial variability of decadal-scale trends in surface greenness across the Arctic Coastal Plain of northern Alaska (similar to 60,000 km(2)) using the Landsat archive (1999-2014), in combination with novel 30 m classifications of polygonal tundra and regional watersheds, finding landscape heterogeneity and regional climate change to be the most important factors controlling historical greenness trends. Browning was linked to increased temperature and precipitation, with the exception of young landforms (developed following lake drainage), which will likely continue to green. Spatiotemporal model forecasting suggests carbon uptake potential to be reduced in response to warmer and/or wetter climatic conditions, potentially increasing the net loss of carbon to the atmosphere, at a greater degree than previously expected.

TI  - Pre-operative and intra-operative detection of axillary lymph node metastases in 108 patients with invasive lobular breast cancer undergoing mastectomy
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Despite the recent changes in the treatment of the axilla in selected breast cancer patient, positive sentinel lymph node (SLN) in patients undergoing mastectomy still necessitates axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). In invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), pre-operative detection of the lymph node metastasis may be demanding due to its unique morphology. The aim of this study was to examine the benefit of preoperative axillary ultrasound (AUS), ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy (US-FNAB), and intra-operative imprint cytology (IIC), in order to avoid two-stage axillary surgery in patients with ILC undergoing mastectomy.Methods: The object of this study were 102 patients (median age 52, range 34-73 years) with clinically non-suspicious axilla in whom 108 mastectomies were performed after a pre-operative AUS investigation. Whenever a metastasis was detected in a sentinel lymph node, ALND was done. Reports of the pre-operative AUS investigation, US-FNAB, and IIC were compared with definitive histopathological reports of surgical specimens.Results: In 46 cases lymph node metastases were diagnosed. AUS suspicious lymph nodes were found in 29/108 cases and histopathology confirmed metastases in 22/30 cases. US-FNAB was performed in 29 cases with AUS suspicious lymph nodes. Cytology proved metastases in 11/29 cases. Histopathology confirmed metastases in 10/11 cases with only isolated tumor cells found in one case. IIC investigation was performed in 63 cases and in 10/27 cases metastases were confirmed by histopathology. Pre-operative AUS, US-FNAB, and/or IIC investigation enabled ALND during a single surgical procedure in 20/46 patients with metastases in lymph nodes.Conclusion: Pre-operative AUS, US-FNAB, and/or IIC are/is beneficial in patients with ILC planned for mastectomy in order to decrease the number of two stage axillary procedures.

TI  - Performance of a prognostic 31-gene expression profile in an independent cohort of 523 cutaneous melanoma patients
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The heterogeneous behavior of patients with melanoma makes prognostication challenging. To address this, a gene expression profile (GEP) test to predict metastatic risk was previously developed. This study evaluates the GEP's prognostic accuracy in an independent cohort of cutaneous melanoma patients.Methods: This multi-center study analyzed primary melanoma tumors from 523 patients, using the GEP to classify patients as Class 1 (low risk) and Class 2 (high risk). Molecular classification was correlated to clinical outcome and assessed along with AJCC v7 staging criteria. Primary endpoints were recurrence-free (RFS) and distant metastasis-free (DMFS) survival.Results: The 5-year RFS rates for Class 1 and Class 2 were 88% and 52%, respectively, and DMFS rates were 93% versus 60%, respectively (P < 0.001). The GEP was a significant predictor of RFS and DMFS in univariate analysis (hazard ratio [HR] = 5.4 and 6.6, respectively, P < 0.001 for each), along with Breslow thickness, ulceration, mitotic rate, and sentinel lymph node (SLN) status (P < 0.001 for each). GEP, tumor thickness and SLN status were significant predictors of RFS and DMFS in a multivariate model that also included ulceration and mitotic rate (RFS HR = 2.1, 1.2, and 2.5, respectively, P < 0.001 for each; and DMFS HR = 2.7, 1.3 and 3.0, respectively, P < 0.01 for each).Conclusions: The GEP test is an objective predictor of metastatic risk and provides additional independent prognostic information to traditional staging to help estimate an individual's risk for recurrence. The assay identified 70% of stage I and II patients who ultimately developed distant metastasis. Its role in consideration of patients for adjuvant therapy should be examined prospectively.

TI  - Landsat-8 data for chromite prospecting in the Logar Massif, Afghanistan
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Chromite is widely distributed in the east and southeast of Afghanistan, especially in Logar Province. Chromite mineralization is podiform-type and is hosted in the stratigraphically lowest ultramafic rocks of the Logar Ophiolite Complex. This ophiolite complex represents a remnant of an early Cretaceous oceanic crust that was thrusted over a late Permian to Mid-Jurassic platform-type sequence of the Kabul Terrane during the Himalayan Orogeny. The ultramafic rocks are composed mainly of dunite and harzburgite, which are variably serpentinized. Chromite mineralization of the Logar area ranges from massive chromitite pods to disseminated chromite crystals in the ultramafic rocks. Microscopically, the chromite exhibits granular texture and is generally fresh; however, some magnetite and/classification as a tool for mineral exploration improve lithological mapping in the Logar Valley area.or ferritchromite are formed along the fractures of some chromite grains. The primary interstitial silicate minerals of the massive chromite and the silicate minerals surrounding the disseminated chromite grains are completely altered to serpentine along with some chlorite. Thus, serpentinite is most likely the host of the chromite in the Logar Province. The main aim of this study is discriminate serpentine using the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI). The serpentinite of the Logar Province is separated by the combination of bands, principal components, band ratios, and supervised classification techniques.

TI  - The sedimentary and remote-sensing reflection of biomass burning in Europe
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: We provide the first European-scale geospatial training set relating the charcoal signal in surface lake sediments to fire parameters (number, intensity and area) recorded by satellite moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors. Our calibration is intended for quantitative reconstructions of key fire-regime parameters by using sediment sequences of microscopic (MIC from pollen slides, particles 10-500 mu m) and macroscopic charcoal (MAC from sieves, particles > 100 mu m).Location: North-south and east-west transects across Europe, covering the mediterranean, temperate, alpine, boreal and steppe biomes.Time period: Lake sediments and MODIS active fire and burned area products were collected for the years 2012-2015.Methods: Cylinder sediment traps were installed in lakes to annually collect charcoal particles in sediments. We quantitatively assessed the relationships between MIC and MAC influx (particles/cm(2)/year) and the MODIS-derived products to identify source areas of charcoal and the extent to which lake-sediment charcoal is linked to fire parameters across the continent.Results: Source area of sedimentary charcoal was estimated to a 40-km radius around sites for both MIC and MAC particles. Fires occurred in grasslands and in forests, with grass morphotypes of MAC accurately reflecting the burned fuel-type. Despite the lack of local fires around the sites, MAC influx levels reached those reported for local fires. Both MIC and MAC showed strong and highly significant relationships with the MODIS-derived fire parameters, as well as with climatic variation along a latitudinal temperature gradient.Main conclusions: MIC and MAC are suited to quantitatively reconstructing fire number and fire intensity on a regional scale. However, burned area may only be estimated using MAC. Local fires may be identified by using several lines of evidence, e.g. analysis of large particles (> 600 mu m), magnetic susceptibility and sedimentological data. Our results offer new insights and applications to quantitatively reconstruct fires and to interpret available sedimentary charcoal records.

TI  - MODIS-Based Estimates of Global Terrestrial Ecosystem Respiration
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Terrestrial ecosystem respiration (R-eco) represents a large carbon source from land to atmosphere and is highly spatiotemporally heterogeneous across scales. Upscaling of field-measured respiration data using remote sensing information is urgently needed for understanding regional and global patterns of ecosystem respiration. Using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data with resolutions of 1km and 8days and flux measurements from 171 sites (total of 812 site years) across the world from 2000 to 2014, we developed a semiempirical, yet physiologically based, remote sensing model, which can simulate R-eco observed across most biomes with a small margin of error (R-2=0.55, root-mean-square error=1.67gCm(-2)d(-1), efficiency=0.46, and mean bias error=0.18gCm(-2)d(-1)). The reference respiration at the annual mean nighttime land surface temperature (LST) can be well represented by MODIS enhanced vegetation index and LST. A comprehensive comparison of six respiration-temperature (R-T) models shows that the more physiologically based R-T model (extended Arrhenius model) may be most suitable for estimating the respiration rate at higher latitudes. Integrating an effect of vegetation change on R-eco in different biomes effectively improves estimates of R-eco in almost all of the biomes.Plain Language Summary Here we develop an empirical yet physiologically based remotely sensed R-eco model (Ensemble_all) which is capable of capturing spatiotemporal patterns in R-eco at the global scale. We provide a new data set for global R-eco from 2001 to 2010, which will complement the currently relatively scarce global R-eco data sets and thus help to constrain global R-eco estimates, which are crucial for projecting climate change impacts on terrestrial carbon cycling and future atmospheric CO2 concentrations. This work also offers the opportunity to further understand the drivers behind ecosystem respiration.

TI  - Tracking Formation of a Lava Lake From Ground and Space: Masaya Volcano (Nicaragua), 2014-2017
T2  - GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - A vigorously degassing lava lake appeared inside the Santiago pit crater of Masaya volcano (Nicaragua) in December 2015, after years of degassing with no (or minor) incandescence. Here we present an unprecedented-long (3 years) and continuous volcanic gas record that instrumentally characterizes the (re)activation of the lava lake. Our results show that, before appearance of the lake, the volcanic gas plume composition became unusually CO2 rich, as testified by high CO2/SO2 ratios (mean: 12.26.3) and low H2O/CO2 ratios (mean: 2.31.3). The volcanic CO2 flux also peaked in November 2015 (mean: 81.340.6 kg/s; maximum: 247 kg/s). Using results of magma degassing models and budgets, we interpret this elevated CO2 degassing as sourced by degassing of a volatile-rich fast-overturning (3.6-5.2 m(3)s(-1)) magma, supplying CO2-rich gas bubbles from minimum equivalent depths of 0.36-1.4 km. We propose this elevated gas bubble supply destabilized the shallow (<1 km) Masaya magma reservoir, leading to upward migration of vesicular (buoyant) resident magma, and ultimately to (re)formation of the lava lake. At onset of lava lake activity on 11 December 2015 (constrained by satellite-based MODIS thermal observations), the gas emissions transitioned to more SO2-rich composition, and the SO2 flux increased by a factor approximate to 40% (11.45.2 kg/s) relative to background degassing (8.0 kg/s), confirming faster than normal (4.4 versus approximate to 3 m(3)s(-1)) shallow magma convection. Based on thermal energy records, we estimate that only approximate to 0.8 of the 4.4 m(3)s(-1) of magma actually reached the surface to manifest into a convecting lava lake, suggesting inefficient transport of magma in the near-surface plumbing system.

TI  - Impact of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy on Nodal Disease and Nodal Surgery by Tumor Subtype
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is known to downstage disease in the breast and increase breast conservation. It can also decrease nodal disease extent. We evaluated the impact of NAC on nodal positivity, nodal burden, and nodal surgery by tumor subtype.All cT1-4c breast cancers from 2010 to 2014 in the National Cancer Database were evaluated, comparing patients receiving NAC with those undergoing primary surgery (PS). Rates of pathologic node-negative status (pN0) and sentinel lymph node (SLN) surgery (1-5 nodes) were compared using chi-square tests, and adjusted odds ratios (OR) were estimated.Of 461,549 patients, 36,715 (8.0%) received NAC and 424,834 (92.0%) had PS. In cN0 patients, pN0 rates were higher in NAC compared with PS patients in ER-/HER2+ [93.2 vs. 79.0%, odds ratio (OR) 3.64, p < 0.001], ER-/HER2- (89.9 vs. 85.2%, OR 1.55, p < 0.001), and ER+/HER2+ (84.7 vs. 78.3%, OR 1.54, p < 0.001). Patients with cT2-3, N0 tumors had significantly higher rate of SLN surgery for NAC versus PS for each biologic subtype except for ER+/HER2- tumors, amongst which this was true only for T3 tumors. In cN1-3 patients, pN0 rates after NAC were 61.3% in ER-/HER2+, 47.7% in ER+/HER2+, 47.3% in ER-/HER2-, and 20.2% in ER+/HER2- and SLN surgery was highest in ER-/HER2+ (28.9%, p < 0.05 versus other subtypes).NAC increases rates of pN0 among cN0 patients compared with PS. Among cN+ patients, 20-61% undergoing NAC convert to pN0 depending on tumor type, with lowest nodal response in ER+/HER2- disease. Use of NAC results in less extensive axillary surgery than in patients treated with PS in both cN0 and cN+ disease.

TI  - Assessment of the urban sprawl on agriculture lands of two major municipalities in Jordan using supervised classification techniques
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The growing populations in urban areas are continuously changing the surrounding natural ecosystems. Jordan is a country with limited resources and witnessing rapid population growth rates and urban advancement towards their agricultural lands. The aim of this research is to investigate the spatial and temporal urban expansion on the agricultural lands of Greater Amman (GAM) and Greater Irbid (GIM) municipalities for the period 2003-2015. Geographic Information System and ENVI-supervised classification technique were used to classify Landsat images of municipalities' lands into urban, agricultural, and undeveloped lands. In 2015, the urban area of GIM land increased by 70% of that in 2003. The newly urbanized area represented 12% (39km(2)) of the total GIM land. The GIM land's conversion rate to urban area was 1% (3.24km(2)). In 2015, the urban area of GAM land represented 41% of the municipality's land where 16% (128km(2)) is the newly urbanized land with an annual land conversion rate of 1.3% (10.7km(2)). This sprawl was mainly on agricultural lands where 18 and 50% of the 2003 agricultural lands of GIM and GAM, respectively, were eliminated by 2015. The existed agricultural lands in GIM by 2015 represented 38% of the total municipality lands while only 14% of the total GAM land is agricultural land. The annual agricultural land recession rates in GIM and GAM were 1 and 1.1%; therefore, their agricultural lands are expected to be eliminated by 2053 and 2028, respectively. These rates of losing agricultural lands are alarming and need to be regulated through sustainable and recent urban planning approaches.

TI  - MicroRNAs and their role on fish oxidative stress during xenobiotic environmental exposures
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
M3  - Review
AB  - There is a growing global concern about the health implications of xenobiotics, which have harmful effects to both humans and wildlife. Among them, teleost fish are known as very sensitive to anthropogenic impacts, and are often being used as sentinel species in the aquatic environment. Xenobiotic molecules can alter the physiological homeostasis of fish and trigger an oxidative stress through overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), suppressing the antioxidant system (AS) activity. An overwhelming generation of ROS is usually accompanied by damage to lipids, proteins and DNA structure, which can be associated with mutations, chromosomal aberrations and carcinogenesis. In particular, more attention has been paid lately to transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation by several genes and microRNAs (miRNAs) related to AS after xenobiotic exposure in fish. Revealing these molecular mechanisms will help better understanding the processes of detoxification of xenobiotics and resistance to stress, and can also provide valuable information for estimating risk assessment of environmental pollution.

TI  - Spatial coverage of mangrove communities in the Arabian Gulf
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves are the natural protectors of the coast, carbon sinks, and a nursery to many terrestrial as well as aquatic organisms. Different effects caused by natural forces together with anthropogenic factors have reduced mangrove cover on a global scale, yet little is known about the overall surface covered by mangroves in the Arabian Gulf. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine their spatial coverage and distribution along the Gulf coastlines, using 25 satellite imagery recently acquired from Landsat 8 data for the year 2017. This study found about 165 km(2) of fragmented scattered mangroves, mostly intense in the United Arab Emirates, where plantation projects have likely played a significant role in increasing their cover over the years. Whereas mangrove in Kuwait is rare, areas like Bahrain, Qatar and Saudi Arabia remained stable with a slight increase. However, mangroves in Iran appear to suffer a decline throughout the years.

T2  - TRANSFUSION AND APHERESIS SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and objectives: The frequency of red blood cell (RBC) antigens in Brazil varies due to differences in the ethnic groups in different regions: however, these studies have not been performed in Minas Gerais, where African admixture is more prevalent in comparison with other states. Due to these facts, this study aimed to determine the frequency of RBC genotypes on Rh, Kell, Duffy and Kidd systems in blood donors and multi-transfused patients from Minas Gerais, Southeast Brazil.Methods: Blood samples were collected from 170 donors and 117 patients with different diagnosis and at least three RBC transfusions, DNA was extracted from leukocytes and genotyped by PCR-SSP, Multiplex or RFLP to alleles of the referred systems. The results were compared by the Chi-Square test, with a significance level of 5%.Results: The most frequent genotypes were: RHD+, RHCE*ce/RHCE*ce, KEL*2/KEL*2, FY*B-67T/FY*B-67T and JK*A/JK*B. FY*B-67C/FY*B-67C, RHD*psi and JK*A/JK*A genotypes were more prevalent in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients than in donors. Many differences in RBC genotype frequencies were observed in comparison with studies from other states and countries.Conclusion: The results reinforce the importance of determining RBC genotypes of blood donors and patients in different regions of Brazil and the world, improving the transfusion safety of individuals requiring chronic RBC transfusions, especially those with SCD, due to ethnic differences in relation to donors.

TI  - Analysis of Agricultural Drought in East Java Using Vegetation Health Index
T2  - AGRIVITA
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a natural hazard indicated by the decreasing of rainfall and water storage and impacting agricultural sector. Agricultural drought assessment has been used to monitor agricultural sustainability, particularly in East Java as national agricultural production center. Identification of drought characteristics - correlated with El Nino-Southern Oscillation, and agricultural impact on paddy fields and rice production using VHI (Vegetation Health Index) were conducted. VHI is produced by TCI (Temperature Condition Index) and VCI (Vegetation Condition Index) derived from MODIS satellite data, LST (Land Surface Temperature) and EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index), respectively. The results showed agricultural drought usually started in June, maximum in October and ended in November. Onset and end time drought tends to follow monsoonal rainfall pattern. El Nino 2015 showed long duration of agricultural drought (i.e. +/- 5 months), high severity (i.e. mild-extreme drought; VHI 0-40) and areal extent of drought approx. 197,343 km(2), while during La Nina 2010 the areal extent was approx. 28,685 km(2) with mild-severe drought (VHI 10-40). Impact of agricultural drought on paddy fields showed wider (smaller) areal extent in sub-round 3 (sub-round 1) from September-December (January-April). Areal extent of drought was negatively correlated with rice production (r=-0.79) which significant in 99 % confidence level.

TI  - Evaluation of the effect of the herpes zoster vaccination programme 3 years after its introduction in England: a population-based study
T2  - LANCET PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background In 2013, a herpes zoster vaccination programme was introduced in England for adults aged 70 years with a phased catch-up programme for those aged 71-79 years. We aimed to evaluate the effect of the first 3 years of the vaccination programme on incidence of herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia in this population.Methods In this population-based study, we extracted data from the Royal College of General Practitioners sentinel primary care network on consultations with patients aged 60-89 years for herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia occurring between Oct 1, 2005, and Sept 30, 2016, obtaining data from 164 practices. We identified individual data on herpes zoster vaccinations administered and consultations for herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia, and aggregated these data to estimate vaccine coverage and incidence of herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia consultations. We defined age cohorts to identify participants targeted in each year of the programme, and as part of the routine or catch-up programme. We modelled incidence according to age, region, gender, time period, and vaccine eligibility using multivariable Poisson regression with an offset for person-years.Findings Our analysis included 3.36 million person-years of data, corresponding to an average of 310 001 patients aged 60-89 years who were registered at an RCGP practice each year. By Aug 31, 2016, uptake of the vaccine varied between 58% for the recently targeted cohorts and 72% for the first routine cohort. Across the first 3 years of vaccination for the three routine cohorts, incidence of herpes zoster fell by 35% (incidence rate ratio 0.65 [95% 0.60-0.72]) and of postherpetic neuralgia fell by 50% (0.50 [0.38-0.67]). The equivalent reduction for the four catch-up cohorts was 33% for herpes zoster (incidence rate ratio 0.67 [0.61-0.74]) and 38% for postherpetic neuralgia (0.62 [0.50-0.79]). These reductions are consistent with a vaccine effectiveness of about 62% against herpes zoster and 70-88% against postherpetic neuralgia.Interpretation The herpes zoster vaccination programme in England has had a population impact equivalent to about 17 000 fewer episodes of herpes zoster and 3300 fewer episodes of postherpetic neuralgia among 5.5 million eligible individuals in the first 3 years of the programme. Communication of the public health impact of this programme will be important to reverse the recent trend of declining vaccine coverage. Copyright (C) The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Chart validation of inpatient International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) administrative diagnosis codes for venous thromboembolism (VTE) among intravenous immune globulin (IGIV) users in the Sentinel Distributed Database
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel Distributed Database (SDD) is a database of patient administrative healthcare records, derived from insurance claims and electronic health records, sponsored by the US Food and Drug Administration for evaluation of medical product outcomes. There is limited information on the validity of diagnosis codes for acute venous thromboembolism (VTE) in the SDD and administrative healthcare data more generally.In this chart validation study, we report on the positive predictive value (PPV) of inpatient administrative diagnosis codes for acute VTE-pulmonary embolism (PE) or lower-extremity or site-unspecified deep vein thrombosis (DVT)-within the SDD. As part of an assessment of thromboembolic adverse event risk following treatment with intravenous immune globulin (IGIV), charts were obtained for 75 potential VTE cases, abstracted, and physician-adjudicated.VTE status was determined for 62 potential cases. PPVs for lower-extremity DVT and/or PE were 90% (95% CI: 73-98%) for principal-position diagnoses, 80% (95% CI: 28-99%) for secondary diagnoses, and 26% (95% CI: 11-46%) for position-unspecified diagnoses (originating from physician claims associated with an inpatient stay). Average symptom onset was 1.5 days prior to hospital admission (range: 19 days prior to 4 days after admission).PPVs for principal and secondary VTE discharge diagnoses were similar to prior study estimates. Position-unspecified diagnoses were less likely to represent true acute VTE cases.

TI  - Ship Detection in Gaofen-3 SAR Images Based on Sea Clutter Distribution Analysis and Deep Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Target detection is one of the important applications in the field of remote sensing. The Gaofen-3 (GF-3) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite launched by China is a powerful tool for maritime monitoring. This work aims at detecting ships in GF-3 SAR images using a new land masking strategy, the appropriate model for sea clutter and a neural network as the discrimination scheme. Firstly, the fully convolutional network (FCN) is applied to separate the sea from the land. Then, by analyzing the sea clutter distribution in GF-3 SAR images, we choose the probability distribution model of Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) detector from K-distribution, Gamma distribution and Rayleigh distribution based on a tradeoff between the sea clutter modeling accuracy and the computational complexity. Furthermore, in order to better implement CFAR detection, we also use truncated statistic (TS) as a preprocessing scheme and iterative censoring scheme (ICS) for boosting the performance of detector. Finally, we employ a neural network to re-examine the results as the discrimination stage. Experiment results on three GF-3 SAR images verify the effectiveness and efficiency of this approach.

TI  - Results From the Deep Convective Clouds-Based Response Versus Scan-Angle Characterization for the MODIS Reflective Solar Bands
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Terra and Aqua Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) scan mirror reflectance is a function of the angle of incidence (AOI) and was characterized prior to launch by the instrument vendor. The relative change of the prelaunch response versus scan angle (RVS) is tracked and linearly scaled on-orbit using observations at two AOIs of 11.2 degrees and 50.2 degrees corresponding to the moon view and solar diffuser, respectively. As the missions continue to operate well beyond their design life of six years, the assumption of linear scaling between the two AOIs is known to be inadequate in accurately characterizing the RVS, particularly at short wavelengths. Consequently, an enhanced approach of supplementing the on-board measurements with response trends from desert pseudoinvariant calibration sites (PICS) was formulated in MODIS Collection 6 (C6). An underlying assumption for the continued effectiveness of this approach is the long-term (multiyear) and short-term (month to month) stability of the PICS. Previous work has shown that the deep convective clouds (DCC) can also be used to monitor the on-orbit RVS performance with less trend uncertainties compared with desert sites. In this paper, the raw sensor response to the DCC is used to characterize the on-orbit RVS on a band and mirror-side basis. These DCC-based RVS results are compared with those of C6 PICS-based RVS, showing an agreement within 2% observed in most cases. The pros and cons of using a DCC-based RVS approach are also discussed in this paper. Although this reaffirms the efficacy of the C6 PICS-based RVS, the DCC-based RVS approach presents itself as an effective alternative for future considerations. Potential applications of this approach to other instruments, such as Suomi National Polarorbiting Partnership, Joint Polar Satellite Systems, and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite, are also discussed.

TI  - Detection and Discrimination of Ship Targets in Complex Background From Spaceborne ALOS-2 SAR Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes a novelmethod for ship detection and discrimination in complex background from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. It first implements a pixel-level land-sea segmentation with the aid of a global 250-m water mask. Then, an efficient multiscale constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detector with generalized Gamma distribution clutter model is designed to detect candidate targets in the sea. At last, eigenellipse discrimination andmaximum-likelihood (ML) discrimination are designed to further exclude false alarm nonship objects in nearshore and harbor area. The proposed land-sea segmentation method is compared with multilevel Otsu method. The proposed multiscale ship detector is compared with conventional CFAR detectors. These contrast experiments show the good performance of our method. Finally, experiments undertaken on actual ALOS-2 SAR data show the efficacy of the proposed approach in detecting nearshore ship targets in a complex coastal environment.

TI  - Bionic Vision, Social Work, and Community Development: A Research Participant's Reflections
T2  - HEALTH & SOCIAL WORK
M3  - Article
AB  - This article discusses bionic vision through the author's experiences as Australia's first research participant in an early prototype bionic eye trial. During her two-year participation, she drew on various theoretical perspectives, including critical and community development approaches that not only influence her professional social work perspective, but extend to her personal worldview. In a rapidly emerging biotechnological age, this article contributes a holistic perspective, bringing into focus theory and practice; issues of human experience, human rights, and oppressive relationships; tensions between agency and structure (particularly relating to disability from a social model of disability and the medical model); and practical applications of artificial vision. Beyond its practical applications, illuminated is the relevance of community development values and principles such as a sense of connectedness, participation, and empowerment, which are understood in terms of an antioppressive perspective. The article concludes by recognizing the potential benefit of bionic vision for vision-impaired and blind people in their everyday lives.

TI  - Object-Based Rule Sets and Its Transferability for Building Extraction from High Resolution Satellite Imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the advent of high spatial resolution satellite imagery, automatic and semiautomatic building extractions have turned into one of the outstanding research topics in the field of remote sensing and machine vision. To this date, various algorithms have been presented for extracting the buildings from satellite images. Such methods lend their bases to diverse criteria such as radiometric, geometric, edge detection, and shadow. In this paper, a novel object based approach has been proposed for automatic and robust detections as well as extraction of the building in high spatial resolution images. To fulfill this, we simultaneously made use of both stable and variable features. While the former can be derived from inherent characteristics of the buildings, the latter is extracted using a feature analysis tool. In addition, a novel perspective has been recommended to boost the automation degree of the segmentation part in the object based analysis of remote sensing imagery. The proposed method was applied to a QuickBird imagery of an urban area in Isfahan city and the results of the quantitative evaluation demonstrated that the proposed method could yield promising results. Moreover, in another section of this study, for assessing the algorithm transferability, the rule set was implemented to a part of the WorldView image of Yazd city, proving that the proposed approach is capable of transferability in different types of case studies.

TI  - Sensor-Based Assessment of Soil Salinity during the First Years of Transition from Flood to Sprinkler Irrigation
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - A key issue for agriculture in irrigated arid lands is the control of soil salinity, and this is one of the goals for irrigated districts when changing from flood to sprinkling irrigation. We combined soil sampling, proximal electromagnetic induction, and satellite data to appraise how soil salinity and its distribution along a previously flood-irrigated field evolved after its transformation to sprinkling. We also show that the relationship between NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) and ECe (electrical conductivity of the soil saturation extracts) mimics the production function between yield and soil salinity. Under sprinkling, the field had a double crop of barley and then sunflower in 2009 and 2011. In both years, about 50% of the soil of the entire studied field-45 ha-had ECe < 8 dS m(-1), i.e., allowing barley cultivation, while the percent of surface having ECe >= 16 dS m(-1) increased from 8.4% in 2009 to 13.7% in 2011. Our methodology may help monitor the soil salinity oscillations associated with irrigation management. After quantifying and mapping the soil salinity in 2009 and 2011, we show that barley was stunted in places of the field where salinity was higher. Additionally, the areas of salinity persisted after the subsequent alfalfa cropping in 2013. Application of differential doses of water to the saline patches is a viable method to optimize irrigation water distribution and lessen soil salinity in sprinkler-irrigated agriculture.

TI  - Exploring Multispectral ALS Data for Tree Species Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multispectral Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) is a new technology and its output data have not been fully explored for tree species classification purposes. The objective of this study was to investigate what type of features from multispectral ALS data (wavelengths of 1550 nm, 1064 nm and 532 nm) are best suited for tree species classification. Remote sensing data were gathered over hemi-boreal forest in southern Sweden (58 degrees 2718.35N, 13 degrees 398.03E) on 21 July 2016. The field data consisted of 179 solitary trees from nine genera and ten species. Two new methods for feature extraction were tested and compared to features of height and intensity distributions. The features that were most important for tree species classification were intensity distribution features. Features from the upper part of the upper and outer parts of the crown were better for classification purposes than others. The best classification model was created using distribution features of both intensity and height in multispectral data, with a leave-one-out cross-validated accuracy of 76.5%. As a comparison, only structural features resulted in an highest accuracy of 43.0%. Picea abies and Pinus sylvestris had high user's and producer's accuracies and were not confused with any deciduous species. Tilia cordata was the deciduous species with a large sample that was most frequently confused with many other deciduous species. The results, although based on a small and special data set, suggest that multispectral ALS is a technology with great potential for tree species classification.

TI  - Evaluating high-resolution remote sensing data for reconstructing the recent evolution of supra glacial debris: A study in the Central Alps (Stelvio Park, Italy)
T2  - PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY-EARTH AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last decades, the expansion of supraglacial debris on worldwide mountain glaciers has been reported. Nevertheless, works dealing with the detection and mapping of supraglacial debris and detailed analyses aimed at identifying the temporal and spatial trends affecting glacier debris cover are still limited. In this study, we used different remote sensing sources to detect and map the supraglacial debris cover, to analyze its evolution, and to assess the potential of different remote-sensed image data. We performed our analyses on the glaciers of Ortles-Cevedale Group (Stelvio Park, Italy), one of the most representative glacierized sectors of the European Alps. High-resolution airborne orthophotos (pixel size 0.5 m x 0.5 m) acquired during the summer season in the years 2003, 2007, and 2012 permitted to map in detail, with an error lower than +/- 5%, the supraglacial debris cover through a maximum likelihood classification. Our findings suggest that over the period 2003-2012, supraglacial debris cover increased from 16.7% to 30.1% of the total glacier area. On Forni Glacier we extended these quantification thanks to the availability of UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) orthophotos from 2014 and 2015 (pixel size 0.15 m x 0.15 m): this detailed analysis permitted to confirm debris is increasing on the glacier melting surface (+20.4%) and confirms the requirement of high-resolution data in debris mapping on Alpine glaciers. Finally, we also checked the suitability of medium-resolution Landsat ETM+ data and Sentinel 2 data to map debris in a typical Alpine glaciation scenario where small ice bodies (<0.5 km(2)) are the majority. The results we obtained suggest that medium-resolution data are not suitable for a detailed description and evaluation of supraglacial debris cover in the Alpine scenario, nevertheless Sentinel 2 proved to be appropriate for a preliminary mapping of the main debris features.

TI  - Potential of Sentinel-1 Images for Estimating the Soil Roughness over Bare Agricultural Soils
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study is to analyze the potential of Sentinel-1 C-band SAR data in VV polarization for estimating the surface roughness (Hrms) over bare agricultural soils. An inversion technique based on Multi-Layer Perceptron neural networks is used. It involves two steps. First, a neural network (NN) is used for estimating the soil moisture without taking into account the soil roughness. Then, a second neural network is used for retrieving the soil roughness when using as an input to the network the soil moisture that was estimated by the first network. The neural networks are trained and validated using simulated datasets generated from the radar backscattering model IEM (Integral Equation Model) with the range of soil moisture and surface roughness encountered in agricultural environments. The inversion approach is then validated using Sentinel-1 images collected over two agricultural study sites, one in France and one in Tunisia. Results show that the use of C-band in VV polarization for estimating the soil roughness does not allow a reliable estimate of the soil roughness. From the synthetic dataset, the achievable accuracy of the Hrms estimates is about 0.94 cm when using the soil moisture estimated by the NN built with a priori information on the moisture volumetric content "mv" (accuracy of mv is about 6 vol. %). In addition, an overestimation of Hrms for low Hrms-values and an underestimation of Hrms for Hrms higher than 2 cm are observed. From a real dataset, results show that the accuracy of the estimates of Hrms in using the mv estimated over a wide area (few km(2)) is similar to that in using the mv estimated at the plot scale (RMSE about 0.80 cm).

TI  - Bayesian estimation and use of high-throughput remote sensing indices for quantitative genetic analyses of leaf growth
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Characterizing the genetic basis of traits that vary during ontogeny and affect plant performance is a major goal in evolutionary biology and agronomy. Describing genetic programs that specifically regulate morphological traits can be complicated by genotypic differences in physiological traits. We describe the growth trajectories of leaves using novel Bayesian function-valued trait (FVT) modeling approaches in Brassica rapa recombinant inbred lines raised in heterogeneous field settings. While frequentist approaches estimate parameter values by treating each experimental replicate discretely, Bayesian models can utilize information in the global dataset, potentially leading to more robust trait estimation. We illustrate this principle by estimating growth asymptotes in the face of missing data and comparing heritabilities of growth trajectory parameters estimated by Bayesian and frequentist approaches. Using pseudo-Bayes factors, we compare the performance of an initial Bayesian logistic growth model and a model that incorporates carbon assimilation (A(max)) as a cofactor, thus statistically accounting for genotypic differences in carbon resources. We further evaluate two remotely sensed spectroradiometric indices, photochemical reflectance (pri2) and MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (mtci) as covariates in lieu of A(max), because these two indices were genetically correlated with A(max) across years and treatments yet allow much higher throughput compared to direct leaf-level gas-exchange measurements. For leaf lengths in uncrowded settings, including A(max) improves model fit over the initial model. The mtci and pri2 indices also outperform direct A(max) measurements. Of particular importance for evolutionary biologists and plant breeders, hierarchical Bayesian models estimating FVT parameters improve heritabilities compared to frequentist approaches.

TI  - Application of thermal imaging of wheat crop canopy to estimate leaf area index under different moisture stress conditions
T2  - BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermal imaging cameras determine the temperature of objects by non-contact measurements and give the temperature reading for each pixel of the image. They work on the same principle as spot pyrometers. Thermal imaging of the crop canopy can give the temperatures of both the crop canopy and the soil directly. However, a better distinction between the two classes, i.e., leaf and soil, can be made using image classification techniques. In the present study, thermal imaging was used to determine the canopy coverage of wheat; the leaf area index (LAI) was estimated under different moisture stress conditions. The thermal Images were analysed by five different supervised image classification techniques, maximum likelihood, Mahalanobis, minimum distance to mean, parallele-piped and support vector machine methods, using ENVI - image analysis software. The best estimation of LAI was by the support vector machine method, due to its higher overall classification accuracy and the Kappa coefficients. This was further supported by the statistical analysis based on the comparison between the digital image derived LAI and those measured using the plant canopy analyser. The LAI of wheat crop canopy estimated from the thermal images using the support vector machine method was meaningful with higher R-2 value of 0.915 and lower values of root mean squared errors (RMSE) and mean based errors (MBE). The present study clearly showed that thermal image analysis can be applied as a non-destructive, rapid technique to characterise the temperature of crop canopy and then to estimate the LAI of wheat grown under moisture stress conditions.

TI  - Remotely sensed MODIS wetland components for assessing the variability of methane emissions in Indian tropical/subtropical wetlands
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Temperature and area fluctuations in wetlands greatly influence its various physico-chemical characteristics, nutrients dynamic, rates of biomass generation and decomposition, floral and faunal composition which in turn influence methane (CH4) emission rates. In view of this, the present study attempts to up-scale point CH4 flux from the wetlands of Uttar Pradesh (UP) by modifying two-factor empirical process based CH4 emission model for tropical wetlands by incorporating MODIS derived wetland components viz. wetland areal extent and corresponding temperature factors (F-t). This study further focuses on the utility of remotely sensed temperature response of CH4 emission in terms of F-t. F-t is generated using MODIS land surface temperature products and provides an important semi-empirical input for up-scaling CH4 emissions in wetlands. Results reveal that annual mean F-t values for UP wetlands vary from 0.69 (2010-2011) to 0.71(2011-2012). The total estimated area-wise CH4 emissions from the wetlands of UP varies from 66.47 Gg yr(-1) with wetland areal extent and Ft value of 2564.04 km(2) and 0.69 respectively in 2010-2011 to 88.39 Gg yr(-1) with wetland areal extent and Ft value of 2720.16 km(2) and 0.71 respectively in 2011-2012. Temporal analysis of estimated CH4 emissions showed that in monsoon season estimated CH4 emissions are more sensitive to wetland areal extent while in summer season sensitivity of estimated CH4 emissions is chiefly controlled by augmented methanogenic activities at high wetland surface temperatures.

TI  - A Revised Historical Fire Regime Analysis in Tunisia (1985-2010) from a Critical Analysis of the National Fire Database and Remote Sensing
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term fire history reconstructions provide fruitful information in the context of global change. Global remotely-sensed burned areas offer a uniform estimate of fire regimes worldwide, but hardly capture small fire events and cover only the last 20 years. Burned areas from national statistics often lack credibility due to discrepancies in fire report protocols between countries, partial data records and uncertain burned area estimates from field observations. However, they constitute a unique and valuable alternative long-term key source of information. We provide here a detailed critical analysis of the fire database in Tunisia, on the southern boundary of the Mediterranean basin and with a contrasted socio-economic environment compared to the more studied European side. We analyzed the fire record database with a quality checking protocol, combined with remote sensing burned area characterization from Landsat images. The high uncertainties in fire numbers could not lead to any conclusion for an accurate trend estimate. The corrected burned area lead to an average yearly burned area of 1799 ha year(-1) compared to previous estimates of 1017 ha year(-1), leading to a fraction of burnable land affected by fires of 0.19%, on the lowest range of observations in the Mediterranean basin. From this corrected database, we revised the usually assumed burned area decrease in this region, with no significant trend detected over the 1985-2010 period. We conclude on the need for thorough assessment of data quality in fire history reconstruction from national statistics to prevent misleading conclusions, and for an increased credibility, in order to be further used in fire models benchmarking or fire weather analysis. Our results can contribute to the under-represented fire regime analysis on the southern boundary of the Mediterranean basin.

TI  - A critical interpretive synthesis: Use of the occupational justice framework in research
T2  - AUSTRALIAN OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY JOURNAL
M3  - Review
AB  - BackgroundThe occupational justice framework was established in the late 1990s with an agenda to spur occupational therapists to take action against injustices pertaining to occupation.MethodsA critical interpretive synthesis of 23 texts was undertaken to examine how the occupational justice framework has been utilised in research, with a particular focus on how such research is located on a knowledge to action continuum and the extent to which it enacts the call to remediate occupational injustices.ResultsWithin the texts reviewed, the occupational justice framework was predominantly used to interpret research findings, and only four studies explicitly used an action research approach. There was also a dominant tendency to individualise situations of occupational justice, but with some examples attending to the social and political production of injustices. Absences and silences related to the locations of the research in developed regions and a focus on conceptualisations of justice commensurate with a Western worldview were evident.ConclusionsFull realisation of the potential contributions of the occupational justice framework requires challenging traditional modes of research that focus primarily on knowledge generation, and expanding into modes of research that embrace a knowledge to action continuum. This expansion, which will enable occupational justice research to more fully embrace action-oriented work, requires practicing epistemological reflexivity, adopting a critical stance, incorporating a participatory action research approach and collaborating with scholars from different disciplines.

TI  - Spectral indices based object oriented classification for change detection using satellite data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEM ASSURANCE ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Change detection, using remotely sensed data can be utilized in a diversified way such as, land use and cover analysis, forest or vegetation assessment, and flood monitoring. The aim of this study is to develop a methodology for change detection in highly urbanized areas, using time-series satellite imagery. This paper analyzes the effectiveness of the object oriented classification over unsupervised algorithms such as k-means for the purpose of change detection. The study area selected is, National Capital Territory of Delhi, which is a good representative of the urban agglomeration conditions in the Asian region. A time series of Landsat 5 (TM) and Landsat 8 (OLI) imageries for the duration of 1993-2014, have been acquired in order to represent the wide range of pattern variation. This study uses three spectral indices namely, Normalized Difference Built-up Index to characterize built-up area, Modified Normalized Difference Water Index to signify open water and Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index to symbolize green vegetation. Further, this study employs object-based environment that separates similar pixels spatially and spectrally at different scales and assign information class to segmented objects. Results recommends the use of OBIA as a semi-automated tool for classification of remotely sensed satellite data. Moreover, using OBIA along with traditional spectral indices, for the classification, provides dimensionality reduction. Moreover, such a method produces classified map which have great correspondence with reality, reflects in high accuracies that were achieved for classes like built-up. The statistics indicated that the classification with object oriented paradigm achieved an overall accuracy of up to 90.1 %, which is far better as compared to automated unsupervised clustering algorithm, such as k-means.

TI  - Developing a Remotely Sensed Drought Monitoring Indicator for Morocco
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is one of the most serious climatic and natural disasters inflicting serious impacts on the socio-economy of Morocco, which is characterized both by low-average annual rainfall and high irregularity in the spatial distribution and timing of precipitation across the country. This work aims to develop a comprehensive and integrated method for drought monitoring based on remote sensing techniques. The main input parameters are derived monthly from satellite data at the national scale and are then combined to generate a composite drought index presenting different severity classes of drought. The input parameters are: Standardized Precipitation Index calculated from satellite-based precipitation data since 1981 (CHIRPS), anomalies in the day-night difference of Land Surface Temperature as a proxy for soil moisture, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index anomalies from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data and Evapotranspiration anomalies from surface energy balance modeling. All of these satellite-based indices are being used to monitor vegetation condition, rainfall and land surface temperature. The weighted combination of these input parameters into one composite indicator takes into account the importance of the rainfall-based parameter (SPI). The composite drought index maps were generated during the growing seasons going back to 2003. These maps have been compared to both the historical, in situ precipitation data across Morocco and with the historical yield data across different provinces with information being available since 2000. The maps are disseminated monthly to several main stakeholders' groups including the Ministry of Agriculture and Department of Water in Morocco.

TI  - Identification of Leveled Archeological Mounds (Hoyuk) in the Alluvial Plain of the Ceyhan River (Southern Turkey) by Satellite Remote-Sensing Analyses
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The alluvial plain of the Ceyhan River (SE Turkey) has been populated since the Neolithic. In 1954, Marjory Veronica Seton-Williams described for this area several archeological mounds (hoyuk), which are the remains of ancient settlements. Today, according to the archeological research carried out in the area, some of these mounds result to have been leveled by agricultural activities. In this work, we identified many color anomalies by low-cost remote-sensing analyses of satellite images. We checked the nature of these anomalies in a dedicated survey and we found a good correspondence between color anomalies and archeological remains consistent with leveled hoyuk. We compared the grain size and chemical characteristics of the soil collected inside the color anomalies with the soil collected in other areas of the alluvial plain. We found irrelevant differences in grain-size characteristics, but a higher content of CaCO3 in soils collected inside the anomalies with respect to those collected outside. Therefore, the content of CaCO3 could be considered the feature that makes the color anomalies visible. The reason for this higher content of CaCO3 is related to the anthropogenic material used in the different phases of hoyuk growth. This work suggests a low-cost analysis useful for rapid identification and preservation of archeological information on the history of Mediterranean settlement.

TI  - A Method for Automatic and Rapid Mapping of Water Surfaces from Sentinel-1 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable information about the spatial distribution of surface waters is critically important in various scientific disciplines. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is an effective way to detect floods and monitor water bodies over large areas. Sentinel-1 is a new available SAR and its spatial resolution and short temporal baselines have the potential to facilitate the monitoring of surface water changes, which are dynamic in space and time. While several methods and tools for flood detection and surface water extraction already exist, they often comprise a significant manual user interaction and do not specifically target the exploitation of Sentinel-1 data. The existing methods commonly rely on thresholding at the level of individual pixels, ignoring the correlation among nearby pixels. Thus, in this paper, we propose a fully automatic processing chain for rapid flood and surface water mapping with smooth labeling based on Sentinel-1 amplitude data. The method is applied to three different sites submitted to recent flooding events. The quantitative evaluation shows relevant results with overall accuracies of more than 98% and F-measure values ranging from 0.64 to 0.92. These results are encouraging and the first step to proposing operational image chain processing to help end-users quickly map flooding events or surface waters.

TI  - The variations of the Forggensee reservoir throughout the year seen by Sentinel-1
T2  - PFG-JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY REMOTE SENSING AND GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The estimation and visualization of a daily open water mask is becoming more and more important in science. This article describes a simple and robust method of low to derive a daily water mask by the example of the Forggensee. The reservoir is known for its pronounced changes in water level. Each year during autumn, the water level is lowered by approx. 15.5 m and the water surface is reduced to one quarter so that the reservoir can be used as a flood control during spring. To describe this seasonal change, water surfaces are estimated for the year 2016. For the detection of the water surfaces, freely available radar images from the satellite Sentinel-1 are used. Open and calm water is generally indicated by a low backscattering. Thus, a simple threshold method can be used to detect the water surfaces. Subsequent vectorising delivers the current borderline between land and water for each of the available 57 SAR acquisitions. However, for a more detailed understanding of the seasonal changes of the Forggensee reservoir, a daily watermask is desirable. For days without any Sentinel-1 scenes, the missing water surfaces are linearly interpolated. To visualize these seasonal changes of the Forggensee reservoir, a poster as well as a freely available online animation is created.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy versus observation in thick melanoma: A multicenter propensity score matching study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - The clinical value of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy in thick melanoma patients (Breslow >4 mm) has not been sufficiently studied. The aim of the study is to evaluate whether SLN biopsy increases survival in patients with thick cutaneous melanoma, and, as a secondary objective, to investigate correlations between survival and lymph node status. We included 1,211 consecutive patients with thick melanomas (>4 mm) registered in the participating hospitals' melanoma databases between 1997 and 2015. Median follow-up was 40 months. Of these patients, 752 were matched into pairs by propensity scores based on sex, age, tumor location, histologic features of melanoma, year of diagnosis, hospital and adjuvant interferon therapy. The SLN biopsy vs. observation was associated with better DFS [adjusted hazard ratio (AHR), 0.74; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61-0.90); p=0.002] and OS (AHR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.60-0.94; p=0.013) but not MSS (AHR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.65-1.08; p=0.165). SLN-negative patients had better 5- and 10-year MSS compared with SLN-positive patients (65.4 vs. 51.9% and 48.3 vs. 38.8%; p=0.01, respectively). As a conclusion, SLN biopsy was associated with better DFS but not MSS in thick melanoma patients after adjustment for classic prognostic factors. SLN biopsy is useful for stratifying these patients into different prognostic groups.

TI  - Monitoring Water Levels and Discharges Using Radar Altimetry in an Ungauged River Basin: The Case of the Ogooue
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Radar altimetry is now commonly used for the monitoring of water levels in large river basins. In this study, an altimetry-based network of virtual stations was defined in the quasi ungauged Ogooue river basin, located in Gabon, Central Africa, using data from seven altimetry missions (Jason-2 and 3, ERS-2, ENVISAT, Cryosat-2, SARAL, Sentinel-3A) from 1995 to 2017. The performance of the five latter altimetry missions to retrieve water stages and discharges was assessed through comparisons against gauge station records. All missions exhibited a good agreement with gauge records, but the most recent missions showed an increase of data availability (only 6 virtual stations (VS) with ERS-2 compared to 16 VS for ENVISAT and SARAL) and accuracy (RMSE lower than 1.05, 0.48 and 0.33 and R-2 higher than 0.55, 0.83 and 0.91 for ERS-2, ENVISAT and SARAL respectively). The concept of VS is extended to the case of drifting orbits using the data from Cryosat-2 in several close locations. Good agreement was also found with the gauge station in Lambarene (RMSE = 0.25 m and R-2 = 0.96). Very good results were obtained using only one year and a half of Sentinel-3 data (RMSE < 0.41 m and R-2 > 0.89). The combination of data from all the radar altimetry missions near Lamabrene resulted in a long-term (May 1995 to August 2017) and significantly improved water-level time series (R-2 = 0.96 and RMSE = 0.38 m). The increase in data sampling in the river basin leads to a better water level peak to peak characterization and hence to a more accurate annual discharge over the common observation period with only a 1.4 m(3)s(-1) difference (i.e., 0.03%) between the altimetry-based and the in situ mean annual discharge.

TI  - Comments on "Regional Impacts of Irrigation in Mexico and the Southwestern United States on Hydrometeorological Fields in the North American Monsoon Region''
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - For their investigation of the impact of irrigated agriculture on hydrometeorological fields in the North American monsoon (NAM) region, Mahalov et al. used the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model to simulate weather over the NAM region in the summer periods of 2000 and 2012, with and without irrigation applied to the regional croplands. Unfortunately, while the authors found that irrigated agriculture may indeed influence summer precipitation, the magnitude, location, and seasonality of their irrigation inputs were substantially inaccurate because of 1) the assumption that pixels classified as "irrigated cropland'' are irrigated during the summer and 2) an outdated land cover map that misrepresents known agricultural districts. The combined effects of these errors are 1) an overestimation of irrigated croplands by a factor of 3-10 along the coast of the Gulf of California and by a factor of 1.5 near the Colorado River delta and 2) a large underestimation of irrigation by a factor of 7-10 in Chihuahua, particularly in 2012. Given the sensitivity of the WRF simulations conducted by Mahalov et al. to the presence of irrigated agriculture, it is expected that the identified errors would significantly impact surface moisture and energy fluxes, resulting in noticeably different effects on precipitation. The authors suggest that the analysis of irrigation effects on precipitation using coupled land-atmospheric modeling systems requires careful specification of the spatiotemporal distribution of irrigated croplands.

To better assess the importance of mobile technologies in rhinitis control, the ARIA (Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma) score ranging from 0 to 4 of the Allergy Diary was compared with EQ-5D (EuroQuol) and WPAI-AS (Work Productivity and Activity Impairment in allergy) in 1288 users in 18 countries. This study showed that quality-of-life data (EQ-5D visual analogue scale and WPA-IS Question 9) are similar in users without rhinitis and in those with mild rhinitis (scores 0-2). Users with a score of 3 or 4 had a significant impairment in quality-of-life questionnaires.

TI  - Leveraging hospital big data to monitor flu epidemics
T2  - COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Objective: Influenza epidemics are a major public health concern and require a costly and time-consuming surveillance system at different geographical scales. The main challenge is being able to predict epidemics. Besides traditional surveillance systems, such as the French Sentinel network, several studies proposed prediction models based on internet-user activity. Here, we assessed the potential of hospital big data to monitor influenza epidemics.Methods: We used the clinical data warehouse of the Academic Hospital of Rennes (France) and then built different queries to retrieve relevant information from electronic health records to gather weekly influenza-like illness activity.Results: We found that the query most highly correlated with Sentinel network estimates was based on emergency reports concerning discharged patients with a final diagnosis of influenza (Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.931). The other tested queries were based on structured data (ICD-10 codes of influenza in Diagnosis-related Groups, and influenza PCR tests) and performed best (PCC of 0.981 and 0.953, respectively) during the flu season 2014-15. This suggests that both ICD-10 codes and PCR results are associated with severe epidemics. Finally, our approach allowed us to obtain additional patients' characteristics, such as the sex ratio or age groups, comparable with those from the Sentinel network.Conclusions: Conclusions: Hospital big data seem to have a great potential for monitoring influenza epidemics in near real-time. Such a method could constitute a complementary tool to standard surveillance systems by providing additional characteristics on the concerned population or by providing information earlier. This system could also be easily extended to other diseases with possible activity changes. Additional work is needed to assess the real efficacy of predictive models based on hospital big data to predict flu epidemics. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is considered the most common pathogen causing severe lower respiratory tract infections among infants and young children. We describe the seasonality and geographical spread of RSV infection in 15 countries of the European Union and European Economic Area. We performed a retrospective descriptive study of weekly laboratory-confirmed RSV detections between weeks 40/2010 and 20/2016, in patients investigated for influenzalike illness, acute respiratory infection or following the clinician's judgment. Six countries reported 4,230 sentinel RSV laboratory diagnoses from primary care and 14 countries reported 156,188 non-sentinel laboratory diagnoses from primary care or hospitals. The median length of the RSV season based on sentinel and non-sentinel surveillance was 16 (range: 9-24) and 18 (range: 8-24) weeks, respectively. The median peak weeks for sentinel and non-sentinel detections were week 4 (range: 48 to 11) and week 4.5 (range: 49 to 17), respectively. RSV detections peaked later (r = 0.56; p = 0.0360) and seasons lasted longer with increasing latitude (r = 0.57; p = 0.0329). Our data demonstrated regular seasonality with moderate correlation between timing of the epidemic and increasing latitude of the country. This study supports the use of RSV diagnostics within influenza or other surveillance systems to monitor RSV seasonality and geographical spread.

TI  - Estimating Wetland Connectivity to Streams in the Prairie Pothole Region: An Isotopic and Remote Sensing Approach
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding hydrologic connectivity between wetlands and perennial streams is critical to understanding the reliance of stream flow on inputs from wetlands. We used the isotopic evaporation signal in water and remote sensing to examine wetland-stream hydrologic connectivity within the Pipestem Creek watershed, North Dakota, a watershed dominated by prairie-pothole wetlands. Pipestem Creek exhibited an evaporated-water signal that had approximately half the isotopic-enrichment signal found in most evaporatively enriched prairie-pothole wetlands. Groundwater adjacent to Pipestem Creek had isotopic values that indicated recharge from winter precipitation and had no significant evaporative enrichment, indicating that enriched surface water did not contribute significantly to groundwater discharging into Pipestem Creek. The estimated surface water area necessary to generate the evaporation signal within Pipestem Creek was highly dynamic, varied primarily with the amount of discharge, and was typically greater than the immediate Pipestem Creek surface water area, indicating that surficial flow from wetlands contributed to stream flow throughout the summer. We propose a dynamic range of spilling thresholds for prairie-pothole wetlands across the watershed allowing for wetland inputs even during low-flow periods. Combining Landsat estimates with the isotopic approach allowed determination of potential (Landsat) and actual (isotope) contributing areas in wetland-dominated systems. This combined approach can give insights into the changes in location and magnitude of surface water and groundwater pathways over time. This approach can be used in other areas where evaporation from wetlands results in a sufficient evaporative isotopic signal.Plain Language Summary Connectivity of wetlands within watersheds is critical to wetland function at local-to-landscape scales. However, actual measures of connectivity between wetlands and streams at the watershed scale are difficult to make, but critical for quantifying these functions, and for supporting policy and decision making. In this manuscript, we combine and compare direct field measurements of connectivity using stable isotopes of water, and remotely sensed measurements of connectivity using Landsat data. We found that prairie-pothole wetlands contributed significant amounts of water to the perennial stream from high to low-flow conditions. This wetland water flowed through surface water connections and not through groundwater flow paths. Hydrologic connectivity between prairie-pothole wetlands and the stream was dynamic, fluctuating with streamflow. Combining the isotopic and Landsat approaches to estimating contributing area appears to be a promising technique for determining potential and actual contributing areas in these flat wetland-dominated systems.

T2  - VOX SANGUINIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Objectives A lateral flow assay for simultaneous blood group typing of ABO, RhD, C, E, c, e, Cw and K with stable end-point and without centrifugation is in routine use since several years (MDmulticard (R)). The typing of extended phenotype parameters belonging to the Duffy, Kidd, MNSs blood group systems and others, however, has not yet been demonstrated for this technique. Reliable detection of Fy(x), a weak Fy(b) phenotype with a pronounced quantitative reduction of the number of Fy(b) antigens on the erythrocyte surface, remains a weakness of current serological blood grouping techniques.Material and Methods The performance characteristics of the following reagents were evaluated in donor and patient samples in lateral flow technology (MDmulticard (R)): Anti-Fy(a), -Fy(b), -Jk(a), -Jk(b), -S, (s) over bar, -P1 and -k. The sensitivity to detect Fy(x) was in addition evaluated with Fy(x) positive samples, which had been preselected by MALDI-TOF MS-based genotyping.ResultsAll results obtained with the MDmulticard((R)) were in full accordance with those of the CE-certified reference products for all the eight reagent formulations used: Anti-Fy(a), -Fy(b), -Jk(a), -Jk(b), -S, (s) over bar, -P1 and -k. Also, all Fy(x) phenotypes of the selected population of 93 positive samples, originally identified by MALDI-TOF MS-based genotyping, were reliably detected by the lateral flow assay.Conclusion Extended phenotype blood group parameters, including the serologically challenging Fy(x) phenotype, can be determined simultaneously, rapidly and accurately using the lateral flow (MDmulticard((R))) technology, even in cases when IgG class antibodies are the only source of diagnostic antibodies.

T2  - RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study constructs a China High Resolution Emission Database (CHRED), including point emission sources, gridded emission data (with the spatial resolution of 1 km and 10 km), and supplementary socioeconomic data. This database responses to the growing and urgent demands of high-quality, fine-grained environmental emission data to support China's sustainable development at various spatial scales. The CHRED is derived from bottom-up, enterprise-level point sources. It covers emission sources of the whole Mainland China. It can be used for spatial analysis of emissions in China, validation and inversion of remote sensing data from carbon observation satellites, and spatially explicit environmental footprint analysis. It lays a solid foundation for studies on environmental emissions and emission mitigation policies in China.

TI  - Eta model simulations using two radiation schemes in clear-sky conditions
T2  - METEOROLOGY AND ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This work evaluates the performance of two radiation parameterization schemes in 30-day clear-sky runs of the Eta model over a region in Southeast Brazil. Two versions of the Eta model are compared: a version using the radiation scheme developed by the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) and a recently developed version using the Rapid Radiative Transfer Model for GCM (RRTMG). These simulations are compared against CMSAF satellite data and surface station data. The simulation using RRTMG produced downward surface shortwave radiation fluxes closer to observations and reduced the systematic positive bias of the Eta simulation using the GFDL scheme. The 2-m temperature negative bias found in the Eta-GFDL simulations is reduced in the Eta-RRTMG simulations, which results from a larger net total radiation in the Eta-RRTMG simulations. The new version has better accuracy than the Eta using the GFDL scheme for most of the evaluated variables, particularly for clear-sky conditions.

TI  - Remote sensing retrievals of colored dissolved organic matter and dissolved organic carbon dynamics in North American estuaries and their margins
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Dissolved organic carbon, DOC, and the colored component of dissolved organic matter, CDOM, are key indicators of coastal water quality and biogeochemical state. Yet applications of space-based remote sensing to monitoring of CDOM variability across estuarine ecosystems and assessment of DOC exchanges along highly dynamic terrestrial-aquatic interfaces have been scarce, in part due to the coarse spatial resolution of most existing ocean color sensors and the seasonal and regional dependence of most existing algorithms. Here, we used a rich dataset of field observations to develop and validate new CDOM and DOC algorithms that are broadly applicable to different estuarine and coastal regions, over different seasons and a wide range of in-water conditions. Algorithms were applied to satellite imagery from MERIS-Envisat at a spatial resolution (300 m) that can resolve much of the spatial variability that characterizes estuaries and their margins. Multi-spectral remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) was used to retrieve CDOM absorption at various wavelengths and CDOM absorption spectral slope in the 275-295 nm spectral range (S275-295). DOC concentrations were obtained from a tight relationship between the DOC-specific CDOM absorption and S275-295, two optical quantities that depend only on the quality of CDOM and strongly covary across spatial and temporal scales. Algorithm evaluation using MERIS satellite data across different estuarine and coastal environments (i.e., the northern Gulf of Mexico, the Delaware Bay, the Chesapeake Bay estuary, and the Middle Atlantic Bight coastal waters) and across different seasons over multiple years resulted in relative errors (mean absolute percent difference; MAPD) of 29% (N = 17), 9.5% (N = 14), and 18% (N = 32), for a(CDOM)(300), S275-295, and DOC, respectively. These relative errors are comparable to those previously reported for satellite retrievals of CDOM and DOC products in less optically complex offshore waters. Application of these algorithms to multi-year MERIS satellite imagery over the Chesapeake Bay estuary allowed, for the first time, to capture the impact of tidal exchanges on carbon dynamics along wetland estuary interfaces, and resolved spatial gradients, seasonal variability, and year-to-year changes in estuarine carbon amount and quality associated with marsh carbon export, riverine inputs, and extreme precipitation events.

TI  - Using VIIRS/NPP and MODIS/Aqua data to provide a continuous record of suspended particulate matter in a highly turbid inland lake
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Inland lakes are generally an important source of drinking water, and information on their water quality needs to be obtained in real time. To date, Moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data have played a critical, effective and long-term role in fulfilling this function. However, the MODIS instruments on board both the Terra and Aqua satellites have operated beyond their designed five-year mission lifespans (Terra was launched in 1999, whereas Aqua was launched in 2002), and these instruments may stop running at any time in the near future. The Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on board the Suomi National Polar Orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP, which was launched in Oct 2011) is expected to provide a consistent, long-term data record and continue the series of observations initiated by MODIS. To date, few evaluations of the consistency between VIIRS and MODIS have been conducted for turbid inland waters. In this study, we first used synchronous MODIS/Aqua and VIIRS/NPP data (+/- 1 h) collected during 2012-2015 to evaluate the consistency of Rayleigh-corrected reflectance (R-rc) observations over Lake Hongze (the fourth-largest freshwater lake in China), since accurate remote sensing reflectance (R-rc) values cannot be acquired over turbid inland waters. Second, we used recently developed algorithms based on R-rc in the red band to estimate the concentrations of suspended particulate matter (SPM) from MODIS/Aqua and VIIRS/NPP data. Finally, we assessed the consistency of the SPM products derived from MODIS/Aqua and VIIRS/NPP. The results show the following. (1) The differences in Rrc among the green (VIIRS 551 nm and MODIS 555 nm) and red bands (VIIRS 671 nm and MODIS 645 nm) indicate a satisfactory consistency, and the unbiased percentage difference (UPD) is < 12%. Meanwhile, the results for the near infrared (NIR) band (MODIS 859 nm and VIIRS 862 nm) indicate relatively large differences (UPD = 21.84%). (2) The satellite-derived SPM products obtained using MODIS/Aqua and VIIRS/NPP have a satisfactory degree of consistency (0-150 mg/L SPM: R-2 = 0.81, UPD < 16% and 0-80 mg/L SPM: R-2 = 0.85, UPD < 12%, respectively). These results demonstrate that VIIRS/NPP can continue to record the SPM observations initiated by MODIS/Aqua for turbid inland waters and establish environmental datasets over long time periods to support water quality management endeavors.

TI  - Evaluating Precipitation Estimates from Eta, TRMM and CHRIPS Data in the South-Southeast Region of Minas Gerais State-Brazil
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Precipitation estimates derived from the Eta model and from TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) and CHIRPS (Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data) remotely sensed data were compared to the precipitation data of the INMET (National Institute of Meteorology) meteorological stations in the south-southeast region of Minas Gerais state, Brazil, in the period between July 2009 and June 2015. Then, information about evapotranspiration (ETR), water deficit (DEF), and water surplus (EXC) was obtained from the precipitation data, using the sequential water balance (SWB) separately for each type of precipitation data (INMET, TRMM, Eta, and CHIRPS). Subsequently, the components of the SWB were comparatively analyzed. The results indicate that all three products overestimate rainfall. The strongest relationships between the INMET data and the estimated data were observed for the TRMM, in terms of precipitation estimates, as well as DEF, EXC, and ETR components. The Eta precipitation estimates are overestimated relative to those from INMET, resulting in underestimation of the water deficit (DEFETA) and overestimation of evapotranspiration (ETRETA). In general, the CHIRPS data presented a pattern similar to the station data, though statistical analyses were lower than those of the TRMM data.

TI  - Characterization of male breast cancer: results of the EORTC 10085/TBCRC/BIG/NABCG International Male Breast Cancer Program
T2  - ANNALS OF ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Male breast cancer (BC) is rare, managed by extrapolation from female BC. The International Male BC Program aims to better characterize and manage this disease. We report the results of part I, a retrospective joint analysis of cases diagnosed during a 20-year period.Methods: Patients with follow-up and tumor samples, treated between 1990 and 2010, in 93 centers/9 countries. Samples were centrally analyzed in three laboratories (the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and the United States).Results: Of 1822 patients enrolled, 1483 were analyzed; 63.5% were diagnosed between 2001 and 2010, 57 (5.1%) had metastatic disease (M1). Median age at diagnosis: 68.4 years. Of 1054 M0 cases, 56.2% were node-negative (N0) and 48.5% had T1 tumors; 4% had breast conserving surgery (BCS), 18% sentinel lymph-node biopsy; half received adjuvant radiotherapy; 29.8% (neo) adjuvant chemotherapy and 76.8% adjuvant endocrine therapy (ET), mostly tamoxifen (88.4%). Per central pathology, for M0 tumors: 84.8% ductal invasive carcinomas, 51.5% grade 2; 99.3% estrogen receptor (ER)-positive; 81.9% progesterone receptor (PR)-positive; 96.9% androgen receptor (AR)-positive [ER, PR or AR Allred score >= 3]; 61.1% Ki67 expression low (< 14% positive cells); using immunohistochemistry (IHC) surrogates, 41.9% were Luminal-A-like, 48.6% Luminal-B-like/HER-2-negative, 8.7% HER-2-positive, 0.3% triple negative. Median follow-up: 8.2 years (0.0-23.8) for all, 7.2 years (0.0-23.2), for M0, 2.6 years (0.012.7) for M1 patients. A significant improvement over time was observed in age-corrected BC mortality. BC-specific-mortality was higher for men younger than 50 years. Better overall (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were observed for highly ER+(P = 0.001), highly PR+(P = 0.002), highly AR+disease (P = 0.019). There was no association between OS/RFS and HER-2 status, Ki67, IHC subtypes nor grade.Conclusions: Male BC is usually ER, PR and AR-positive, Luminal B-like/HER2-negative. Of note, 56% patients had T1 tumors but only 4% had BCS. ER was highly positive in> 90% of cases but only 77% received adjuvant ET. ER, PR and AR were associated with OS and RFS, whereas grade, Ki67 and IHC surrogates were not. Significant improvement in survival over time was observed.

TI  - Soil Organic Carbon Estimation in Croplands by Hyperspectral Remote APEX Data Using the LUCAS Topsoil Database
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The most commonly used approach to estimate soil variables from remote-sensing data entails time-consuming and expensive data collection including chemical and physical laboratory analysis. Large spectral libraries could be exploited to decrease the effort of soil variable estimation and obtain more widely applicable models. We investigated the feasibility of a new approach, referred to as bottom-up, to provide soil organic carbon (SOC) maps of bare cropland fields over a large area without recourse to chemical analyses, employing both the pan-European topsoil database from the Land Use/Cover Area frame statistical Survey (LUCAS) and Airborne Prism Experiment (APEX) hyperspectral airborne data. This approach was tested in two areas having different soil characteristics: the loam belt in Belgium, and the Gutland-Oesling region in Luxembourg. Partial least square regression (PLSR) models were used in each study area to estimate SOC content, using both bottom-up and traditional approaches. The PLSR model's accuracy was tested on an independent validation dataset. Both approaches provide SOC maps having a satisfactory level of accuracy (RMSE = 1.5-4.9 gkg(-1); ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) = 1.4-1.7) and the inter-comparison did not show differences in terms of RMSE and RPD either in the loam belt or in Luxembourg. Thus, the bottom-up approach based on APEX data provided high-resolution SOC maps over two large areas showing the within- and between-field SOC variability.

TI  - Persistent negative changes in seasonal greenness over different forest types of India using MODIS time series NDVI data (2001-2014)
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assessed the spatial patterns of significant negative trend of forest seasonal greenness over the different forest types of India using 8-day composite MODIS NDVI (500 m) time series data (2001-2014). It was further analyzed to quantify the negative changes in the core forest areas and to indentify hotspots of it over the large protected forest areas. Significant negative changes in the seasonal greenness were found to be highest over tropical moist deciduous forest (2067.35 thousand ha) followed by tropical dry deciduous (1407.73 thousand ha), tropical wet evergreen (577.43 thousand ha), tropical semi evergreen (442.58 thousand ha), subtropical broad leaved (321.13 thousand ha) and Himalayan moist temperate forest (293.80 thousand ha). Mangroves forest also showed decrease in its greenness over 15.6% of its total area. Interestingly, most of the observed negative changes of high to medium magnitude were found in the core areas of the forest types. Hotspots analysis revealed spatially coherent significant negative changes of seasonal greenness over the large protected areas i.e. Similipal wildlife sanctuary of Odisha, Rajaji national park of Uttarakhand, Achanakmar wildlife sanctuary of Chhattisgarh and Sundarban of West Bengal. The outcomes of the present study would help in the prioritization of the forest types and protected forest areas for biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation programmes.

TI  - Polarimetric Calibration and Quality Assessment of the GF-3 Satellite Images
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The GaoFen-3 (GF-3) satellite is the first fully polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite designed for civil use in China. The satellite operates in the C-band and has 12 imaging modes for various applications. Three fully polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) imaging modes are provided with a resolution of up to 8 m. Although polarimetric calibration (PolCAL) of the SAR system is periodically undertaken, there is still some residual distortion in the images. In order to assess the polarimetric accuracy of this satellite and improve the image quality, we analyzed the polarimetric distortion errors and performed a PolCAL experiment based on scattering properties and corner reflectors. The experiment indicates that the GF-3 images can meet the satellite's polarimetric accuracy requirements, i.e., a channel imbalance of 0.5 dB in amplitude and +/- 10 degrees in phase and a crosstalk accuracy of -35 dB. However, some images still contain residual polarimetric distortion. The experiment also shows that the residual errors of the GF-3 standard images can be diminished after further PolCAL, with a channel imbalance of 0.26 dB in amplitude and +/- 0.2 degrees in phase and a crosstalk accuracy of -42 dB.

TI  - Pronounced changes in air quality, atmospheric and meteorological parameters, and strong mixing of smoke associated with a dust event over Bakersfield, California
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - On September 28, 2016, an intense dust storm impacted the city of Bakersfield and surrounding areas in California. The dust event coincided with smoke aerosols from the forest fire located in the northwest of Bakersfield. In California, forest fires are frequent during summer and fall seasons. The forest fire smoke plumes were subjected to large dispersion and appeared widespread. In this study, we present a detailed analysis of satellite and surface observations indicating pronounced changes in air quality, aerosol characteristics, trace gases, along the prevailing meteorological conditions over Bakersfield associated with the dust event and its interactions with the forest fire smoke. Back trajectory simulations clearly show inflow of the dust airmass from the Mojave Desert located east of Bakersfield, in contrast to the forward trajectories originating from the forest fire event located in the northwestern region, suggesting possibility of mixing of smoke and dust in the Bakersfield area. In addition, low and strong wavelength dependence of aerosol single scattering albedo also supports the observations of strong aerosol mixing of dust and smoke.

TI  - Estimating spatiotemporal distribution of PM<sub>1</sub> concentrations in China with satellite remote sensing, meteorology, and land use information
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: PM1 might be more hazardous than PM2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter <= 1 mu m and <= 2.5 mu m, respectively). However, studies on PM1 concentrations and its health effects are limited due to a lack of PM1 monitoring data.Objectives: To estimate spatial and temporal variations of PM1 concentrations in China during 2005-2014 using satellite remote sensing, meteorology, and land use information.Methods: Two types of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 6 aerosol optical depth (AOD) data, Dark Target (DT) and Deep Blue (DB), were combined. Generalised additive model (GAM) was developed to link ground-monitored PM1 data with AOD data and other spatial and temporal predictors (e.g., urban cover, forest cover and calendar month). A 10-fold cross-validation was performed to assess the predictive ability.Results: The results of 10-fold cross-validation showed R-2 and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for monthly prediction were 71% and 13.0 mu g/m(3), respectively. For seasonal prediction, the R-2 and RMSE were 77% and 11.4.Lg/m(3), respectively. The predicted annual mean concentration of PM1 across "China was 26.9 mu g/m(3). The PM1 level was highest in winter while lowest in summer. Generally, the PM1 levels in entire China did not substantially change during the past decade. Regarding local heavy polluted regions, PM1 levels increased substantially in the South-Western Hebei and Beijing-Tianjin region.Conclusions: GAM with satellite-retrieved AOD, meteorology, and land use information has high predictive ability to estimate ground-evel PM1. Ambient PM1 reached high levels in China during the past decade. The estimated results can be applied to evaluate the health effects of PM1. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Detection of Land Subsidence Associated with Land Creation and Rapid Urbanization in the Chinese Loess Plateau Using Time Series InSAR: A Case Study of Lanzhou New District
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lanzhou New District is the first and largest national-level new district in the Loess Plateau region of China. Large-scale land creation and rapid utilization of the land surface for construction has induced various magnitudes of land subsidence in the region, which is posing an increasing threat to the built environment and quality of life. In this study, the spatial and temporal evolution of surface subsidence in Lanzhou New District was assessed using Persistent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture radar (PSInSAR) to process the ENVISAT SAR images from 2003-2010, and the Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) InSAR to process the Sentinel-1A images from 2015-2016. We found that the land subsidence exhibits distinct spatiotemporal patterns in the study region. The spatial pattern of land subsidence has evidently extended from the major urban zone to the land creation region. Significant subsidence of 0-55 mm/year was detected between 2015 and 2016 in the land creation and urbanization area where either zero or minor subsidence of 0-17.2 mm/year was recorded between 2003 and 2010. The change in the spatiotemporal pattern appears to be dominated mainly by the spatial heterogeneity of land creation and urban expansion. The spatial associations of subsidence suggest a clear geological control, in terms of the presence of compressible sedimentary deposits; however, subsidence and groundwater fluctuations are weakly correlated. We infer that the processes of land creation and rapid urban construction are responsible for determining subsidence over the region, and the local geological conditions, including lithology and the thickness of the compressible layer, control the magnitude of the subsidence process. However, anthropogenic activities, especially related to land creation, have more significant impacts on the detected subsidence than other factors. In addition, the higher collapsibility and compressibility of the loess deposits in the land creation region may be the underlying mechanism of macro-subsidence in Lanzhou New District. Our results provide a useful reference for land creation, urban planning and subsidence mitigation in the Loess Plateau region, where the large-scale process of bulldozing mountains and valley infilling to create level areas for city construction is either underway or forthcoming.

TI  - "Blend-then-Index" or "Index-then-Blend": A Theoretical Analysis for Generating High-resolution NDVI Time Series by STARFM
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - There are two strategies for generating high-resolution vegetation index time series using spatiotemporal data blending methods, named as "Blend-then-Index" (BI) and "Index-then-Blend" (IB), according to the order of vegetation index calculation and data blending. This study aims to determine which strategy can obtain better results for generating a high-resolution normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series using the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM). The theoretical error analysis suggests that the more accurate strategy depends on the vegetation growth stages: BI has a smaller error than IB when the NDVI values at the prediction date are higher than the input NDVI values and vice versa. Simulated experiments using Landsat images were conducted to verify the theoretical analysis. This study provides guidelines for producing better high-resolution vegetation index time series using STARFM.

TI  - Super-Resolution Mapping of Impervious Surfaces from Remotely Sensed Imagery with Points-of-Interest
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate mapping of impervious surfaces is of key significance for various urban applications. Usually, traditional methods extract the proportion image of impervious surfaces from remote sensing images; however, the proportion image cannot specify where the impervious surfaces spatially distribute within a pixel. Meanwhile, impervious surfaces often locate urban areas and have a strong correlation with the relatively new big (geo)data points of interest (POIs). This study, therefore, proposed a novel impervious surfaces mapping method (super-resolution mapping of impervious surfaces, SRMIS) by combining a super-resolution mapping technique and POIs to increase the spatial resolution of impervious surfaces in proportion images and determine the accurate spatial location of impervious surfaces within each pixel. SRMIS was evaluated using a 10-m Sentinel-2 image and a 30-m Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) image of Nanjing city, China. The experimental results show that SRMIS generated satisfactory impervious surface maps with better-classified image quality and greater accuracy than a traditional hard classifier, the two existing super-resolution mapping (SRM) methods of the subpixel-swapping algorithm, or the method using both pixel-level and subpixel-level spatial dependence. The experimental results show that the overall accuracy increase of SRMIS was from 2.34% to 5.59% compared with the hard classification method and the two SRM methods in the first experiment, while the overall accuracy of SRMIS was 1.34-3.09% greater than that of the compared methods in the second experiment. Hence, this study provides a useful solution to combining SRM techniques and the relatively new big (geo)data (i.e., POIs) to extract impervious surface maps with a higher spatial resolution than that of the input remote sensing images, and thereby supports urban research.

TI  - Crowdsourcing photograph locations for debris flow hot spot mapping
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study shows the feasibility of obtaining hazardous hot spot information on landslide and debris flow from crowdsourced data. Historical hazard or disaster photographs were voluntarily uploaded by the public to a Web photograph album. A total of 2245 hazard photographs from 1973 to 2015 were crowdsourced, and each photograph was tagged with geographical coordinates. After the removal of outliers, 96% of the photograph points were found within the 4 km potential debris flow buffer of existing databases, and none was found along the steep slopes with a mean of 14A degrees. The photograph hot spot analysis using local Moran's I or G (i) * was identified statistically significant without subjective judgment. The DBSCAN model was also used to detect hot spot clusters effectively. The model parameters were nearly automatically generated on the basis of the count plot and the nearest neighbor distance graph. The results of these approaches were generally consistent with the hazardous hot spot maps and strongly related to central and southern Taiwan from the crowdsourced photograph data. Results reveal that the hot spot areas are found in areas with faults and near the potentially weak and fractured rocky regions. The majority of the landslides occur near the fault line because the strong ground motions triggered by an earthquake propagated along the fault rupture plane. Hot spot mapping using crowdsourced data can be used to estimate where debris flow will frequently occur and show how large the debris flow will be. Potentially hazardous areas can be effectively determined by the hot spot analysis of crowdsourced data.

TI  - Performance Evaluation of On-Orbit Calibration of <i>SNPP</i> VIIRS Reflective Solar Bands via Intersensor Comparison with <i>Aqua</i> MODIS
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - An intersensor comparison is carried out to evaluate the radiometric performance of the reflective solar bands (RSBs) of the first Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on board the Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (SNPP) satellite. Two versions of sensor data records (SDRs) for moderate-resolution RSBs M1-M8 (410-1238 nm)-one version from the NOAA Ocean Color (OC) Team and the operational version from the Interface Data Processing Segment (IDPS)-are compared against the well-calibrated Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the Aqua satellite. This comparison fully exploits the moderate resolution of the sensors and a precise simultaneous nadir overpass (SNO) analysis in a "nadir only'' approach to achieve a precision better than 1%. The key issues found to impact the SNO analysis are 1) an underlying bias beyond the 80-km spatial scale, 2) a scene-based sporadic variability of about 2% affecting the sample size selection criteria, and 3) large relative deviations at low radiances. It is shown that the OCSDRs achieve significantly better agreement with Aqua MODIS, such as smaller temporal variation, improved agreement in the early mission, and no observable long-term drift. The lone exception is the downward drift of about 1% in the Aqua MODIS band 8 (412 nm) versus SNPP VIIRS band M1 time series that possibly started in late 2013, which is ultimately attributed to errors in Aqua MODIS band 8. Finally, the long-term drift in the IDPS SDRs further illustrates the consequence of the worsening bias within the standard RSB calibration that will infect any versions of the VIIRS SDRs not mitigated for this error.

M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - With a wide spectrum of imaging capabilities-from optical to radar sensors, low to very high resolution, continental to local scale, single-image to multi-temporal approaches, yearly to sub-daily acquisition repeat cycles-Earth Observation (EO) offers several opportunities for the geoscience community to map and monitor natural and human-induced Earth hazards from space. The Special Issue "Observing Geohazards from Space" of Geosciences gathers 12 research articles on the development, validation, and implementation of satellite EO data, processing methods, and applications for mapping and monitoring of geohazards such as slow moving landslides, ground subsidence and uplift, and active and abandoned mining-induced ground movements. Papers published in this Special Issue provide novel case studies demonstrating how EO and remote sensing data can be used to detect and delineate land instability and geological hazards in different environmental contexts and using a range of spatial resolutions and image processing methods. Remote sensing datasets used in the Special Issue papers encompass satellite imagery from the ERS-1/2, ENVISAT, RADARSAT-1/2, and Sentinel-1 C-band, TerraSAR-X and COSMO-SkyMed X-band, and ALOS L-band SAR missions; Landsat 7, SPOT-5, WorldView-2/3, and Sentinel-2 multi-spectral data; UAV-derived RGB and near infrared aerial photographs; LiDAR surveying; and GNSS positioning data. Techniques that are showcased include, but are not limited to, differential Interferometric SAR (InSAR) and its advanced approaches such as Persistent Scatterers (PS) and Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) methods to estimate ground deformation, Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) to identify landslides in high resolution multi-spectral data, UAV and airborne photogrammetry, Structure-from-Motion (SfM) for digital elevation model generation, aerial photo-interpretation, feature extraction, and time series analysis. Case studies presented in the papers focus on landslides, natural and human-induced subsidence, and groundwater management and mining-related ground deformation in many local to regional-scale study areas in Austria, Belgium, Italy, Slovakia, Spain, and the UK.

AB  - The empirical Probability of Severe (ProbSevere) model, developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies (CIMSS), automatically extracts information related to thunderstorm development from several data sources to produce timely, short-term, statistical forecasts of thunderstorm intensity. More specifically, ProbSevere utilizes short-term numerical weather prediction guidance (NWP), geostationary satellite, ground-based radar, and ground-based lightning data to determine the probability that convective storm cells will produce severe weather up to 90 min in the future. ProbSevere guidance, which updates approximately every 2 min, is available to National Weather Service (NWS) Weather Forecast Offices with very short latency. This paper focuses on the integration of ground-based lightning detection data into ProbSevere. In addition, a thorough validation analysis is presented. The validation analysis demonstrates that ProbSevere has slightly less skill compared to NWS severe weather warnings, but can offer greater lead time to initial hazards. Feedback from NWS users has been highly favorable, with most forecasters responding that ProbSevere increases confidence and lead time in numerous warning situations.

TI  - Air Travel and Postoperative Lymphedema-A Systematic Review
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Lymphedema is not uncommon after axillary dissection for breast cancer. Improved survival of patients with breast cancer from advances in adjuvant therapy has resulted in increased awareness of the quality of life for long-term survivors. Air travel has been postulated as 1 of the risk factors of lymphedema exacerbation. In the present systematic review, we sought to critically evaluate the current data on this topic. The present study was registered in the Research Registry. A systematic review of lymphedema and air travel was performed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses protocol. The Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane databases were searched for English-language studies up to June 2017 with a predefined strategy. The retrieved studies were independently screened and rated for relevance. Data were extracted by 2 of us. A total of 55 studies were identified using predefined keywords; 12 studies were included using the criteria stated in the study protocol. A pooled analysis of 2051 patients with a history of air travel revealed that <= 14.5% developed lymphedema after air flight. However, a subsequent analysis of 4 studies with a control arm showed that 107 of 1189 patients (9%) with a documented history of air travel developed lymphedema compared with 204 of 2356 patients (8.7%) who had not flown (chi(2) test; P = .80). Two studies (1030 patients) evaluated the effect of lymphedema on patients' air travel patterns. Of the 1030 patients, 141 (13.7%) had totally avoided air travel after the development of lymphedema. However, air travel was not adversely associated with the development of lymphedema. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - A LandTrendr multispectral ensemble for forest disturbance detection
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring and classifying forest disturbance using Landsat time series has improved greatly over the past decade, with many new algorithms taking advantage of the high-quality, cost free data in the archive. Much of the innovation has been focused on use of sophisticated workflows that consist of a logical sequence of processes and rules, multiple statistical functions, and parameter sets that must be calibrated to accurately classify disturbance. For many algorithms, calibration has been local to areas of interest and the algorithm's classification performance has been good under those circumstances. When applied elsewhere, however, algorithm performance has suffered. An alternative strategy for calibration may be to use the locally tested parameter values in conjunction with a statistical approach (e.g., Random Forests; RF) to align algorithm classification with a reference disturbance dataset, a process we call secondary classification. We tested that strategy here using RF with LandTrendr, an algorithm that runs on one spectral band or index. Disturbance detection using secondary classification was spectral band- or index-dependent, with each spectral dimension providing some unique detections and different error rates. Using secondary classification, we tested whether an integrated multispectral LandTrendr ensemble, with various combinations of the six basic Landsat reflectance bands and seven common spectral indices, improves algorithm performance. Results indicated a substantial reduction in errors relative to secondary classification based on single bands/indices, revealing the importance of a multispectral approach to forest disturbance detection. To explain the importance of specific bands and spectral indices in the multispectral ensemble, we developed a disturbance signal-to-noise metric that clearly highlighted the value of shortwave infrared reflectance, especially when paired with near-infrared reflectance.

TI  - Satellite data and soil magnetic susceptibility measurements for heavy metals monitoring: findings from Agri Valley (Southern Italy)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Heavy metals pollution is a widespread problem in urbanized and industrial areas and there is a need of optimized and effective strategies for identifying and monitoring polluted areas. This study proposes an improved methodology based on Landsat satellite data and magnetic susceptibility measurements carried out in situ and in laboratory. Findings suggest that expeditious field surveys of soil magnetic susceptibility within stressed vegetated areas are a reliable indicator of soil contamination. Moreover, this procedure could provide a method for assessing heavy metals impacts and could be used to examine the effectiveness of emission control strategies.

TI  - Processes controlling the accelerated warming of the Arabian Sea
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Arabian Sea (AS) has undergone a regime shift after 1995, manifesting the disruption of its natural decadal cycle over-riding a secular rise in its sea-surface temperature (SST). Using a suite of in situ and remote sensing data, we show that the rate of post-1995 accelerated warming is spatially different, due to regionally and seasonally differing oceanographic processes. Along parts of the western boundary, the accelerated warming was mediated by a reduction in the post-1995 linear trend of wind speed during summer monsoon leading to reduced upwelling and also reduced evaporation trend. In the northeast AS, post-1995 increase in specific humidity during late winter, lead to a decrease in the evaporative cooling and subsequent convective mixing resulting in the increased rate of warming. The continued warming seen in the northeast AS until spring inter-monsoon was due to the increasing net heat flux trend into the ocean along with reducing trend in evaporation. The accelerated warming in the central AS was linked to the reduced wind speed trend.

TI  - Understanding land subsidence in salt marshes of the Venice Lagoon from SAR Interferometry and ground-based investigations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The existence of salt marshes and tidal morphologies is strictly connected to their elevation with respect to the mean sea level. Quantifying land subsidence of these high-valued transitional environments is therefore crucial to investigate their long-term possible survival, also in view of the expected climate changes. However, monitoring with a certain accuracy their movements has been challenging until now due to the peculiar features of these morphological forms: they are difficult to access, made of largely unconsolidated deposits, without anthropogenic structures, relatively far from anthropogenic facilities, and become submerged by the sea water twice a day. For these reasons, they have never be linked to traditional levelling and GPS networks, and also standard Interferometric SAR applications returned very poor results in terms of spatial and temporal coverage. An advanced Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) technique on a 5-year long stack of X-bandwidth SAR acquisitions of the Venice Lagoon is here presented. The regularity of the acquisitions, the short satellite revisiting time (11 days), the high image resolution (similar to 3 x 3 m), and the strategies used in the PSI application have allowed us to detect thousands of measurable persistent targets (PTs) in the Venice Lagoon salt marshes. The measured displacements range from small uplifts to subsidence rates of more than 20 mm/yr. The analyses of the observed displacements point out that land subsidence is much larger on man-made than natural salt marshes, with a significant negative correlation with the marsh age. In addition, land subsidence with the presence of halophytic vegetation species is generally smaller than on unvegetated marshes. Finally, at a few selected sites, the integration of the PSI outcome with local ground-based measurements, such as multi-depth benchmarks, feldspar marker horizons and surface elevation tables, has allowed quantifying the displacement variability versus depth and therefore developing a first conceptual model of the salt marsh consolidation and accretion processes.

TI  - Comparative analysis of lineaments extracted from Cartosat, SRTM and ASTER DEM: a study based on four watersheds in Konkan region, India
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, lineaments have been extracted from Cartosat, Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) Digital Elevation Models (DEM) of different spatial resolution. The extracted lineaments were analysed to understand which DEM is most suitable for extraction of lineaments accurately. The results have shown that maximum number of lineaments can be extracted by using Cartosat DEM while ASTER DEM provides lowest number of lineaments. As a result of this study, it is suggested to make use of Cartosat DEM for the extraction of lineaments in Indian territory (data is only available for India), because it provides the most detailed geological information among all the datasets. Cartosat DEM is also suitable for studying very small areas as detailed surface information can be extracted by using this data. SRTM DEM can be used for countries other than India, and it has the capability to deliver moderate structural information. Likewise, SRTM data is more suitable for a large study area. ASTER DEM is not recommended for the study of structural and geological surface features because most of the features cannot be extracted and the result could not be applied in the detailed geological study.

TI  - Combined Landsat and L-Band SAR Data Improves Land Cover Classification and Change Detection in Dynamic Tropical Landscapes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Robust quantitative estimates of land use and land cover change are necessary to develop policy solutions and interventions aimed towards sustainable land management. Here, we evaluated the combination of Landsat and L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data to estimate land use/cover change in the dynamic tropical landscape of Tanintharyi, southern Myanmar. We classified Landsat and L-band SAR data, specifically Japan Earth Resources Satellite (JERS-1) and Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (ALOS-2/PALSAR-2), using Random Forests classifier to map and quantify land use/cover change transitions between 1995 and 2015 in the Tanintharyi Region. We compared the classification accuracies of single versus combined sensor data, and assessed contributions of optical and radar layers to classification accuracy. Combined Landsat and L-band SAR data produced the best overall classification accuracies (92.96% to 93.83%), outperforming individual sensor data (91.20% to 91.93% for Landsat-only; 56.01% to 71.43% for SAR-only). Radar layers, particularly SAR-derived textures, were influential predictors for land cover classification, together with optical layers. Landscape change was extensive (16,490 km(2); 39% of total area), as well as total forest conversion into agricultural plantations (3214 km(2)). Gross forest loss (5133 km(2)) in 1995 was largely from conversion to shrubs/orchards and tree (oil palm, rubber) plantations, and gross gains in oil palm (5471 km(2)) and rubber (4025 km(2)) plantations by 2015 were mainly from conversion of shrubs/orchards and forests. Analysis of combined Landsat and L-band SAR data provides an improved understanding of the associated drivers of agricultural plantation expansion and the dynamics of land use/cover change in tropical forest landscapes.

TI  - A Novel Strategy for Very-Large-Scale Cash-Crop Mapping in the Context of Weather-Related Risk Assessment, Combining Global Satellite Multispectral Datasets, Environmental Constraints, and In Situ Acquisition of Geospatial Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cash crops are agricultural crops intended to be sold for profit as opposed to subsistence crops, meant to support the producer, or to support livestock. Since cash crops are intended for future sale, they translate into large financial value when considered on a wide geographical scale, so their production directly involves financial risk. At a national level, extreme weather events including destructive rain or hail, as well as drought, can have a significant impact on the overall economic balance. It is thus important to map such crops in order to set up insurance and mitigation strategies. Using locally generated data-such as municipality-level records of crop seeding-for mapping purposes implies facing a series of issues like data availability, quality, homogeneity, etc. We thus opted for a different approach relying on global datasets. Global datasets ensure homogeneity and availability of data, although sometimes at the expense of precision and accuracy. A typical global approach makes use of spaceborne remote sensing, for which different land cover classification strategies are available in literature at different levels of cost and accuracy. We selected the optimal strategy in the perspective of a global processing chain. Thanks to a specifically developed strategy for fusing unsupervised classification results with environmental constraints and other geospatial inputs including ground-based data, we managed to obtain good classification results despite the constraints placed. The overall production process was composed using "good-enough" algorithms at each step, ensuring that the precision, accuracy, and data-hunger of each algorithm was commensurate to the precision, accuracy, and amount of data available. This paper describes the tailored strategy developed on the occasion as a cooperation among different groups with diverse backgrounds, a strategy which is believed to be profitably reusable in other, similar contexts. The paper presents the problem, the constraints and the adopted solutions; it then summarizes the main findings including that efforts and costs can be saved on the side of Earth Observation data processing when additional ground-based data are available to support the mapping task.

TI  - Prospective Feasibility Trial of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in the Setting of Inflammatory Breast Cancer
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous studies on sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) patients did not assess nodal response with imaging or use of dual tracers. In this study, ultrasound failed to identify axillary complete response in IBC patients. SLNB using dual tracer mapping was also unsuccessful in 12 (75%) of 16 patients evaluated.Background: Most inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) patients have axillary disease at presentation. Current standard is axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). Advances in NACT have improved pathologic complete response (pCR) rates increasing interest in performing sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy (SLNB). Previous studies on SLNB for IBC patients did not assess nodal response with imaging or use dual tracer mapping. We sought to prospectively determine false negative rates of SLNB in IBC patients using dual tracer mapping, and to correlate pathology with preoperative axillary imaging. Patients and Methods: Patients with IBC were prospectively enrolled. Patients underwent axillary staging with physical examination and axillary ultrasound before and after NACT. All patients underwent SLNB using blue dye and radioisotope, followed by ALND. Results: Sixteen patients were prospectively enrolled. Clinical N stage was N0 in 1 patient, N1 in 8, and N3 in 7. SLN mapping was successful in only 4 patients (25%) with 12 (75%) not draining either tracer to a SLN. Three of the 4 (75%) who mapped had an axillary pCR. The patient who mapped but did not have an axillary pCR had a positive SLNB with additional axillary nodal disease identified on ALND. All patients who successfully mapped had presumed residual nodal disease on preoperative axillary ultrasound. Conclusion: SLNB was unsuccessful in most IBC patients. A small subset who have pCR might undergo successful SLNB, but preoperative axillary imaging failed to identify these patients. ALND should remain standard practice for IBC patients.

TI  - Exploring temporal dynamics of urban ecosystem services in Latin America: The case of Bogota (Colombia) and Santiago (Chile)
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Latin America is one of the most urbanized region in the world, where patterns of urbanization are disorganized and disjoint from urban planning, with unknown effects for ecosystem services (ES). We evaluated the ES in Bogota and Santiago for a 30-year period. Using remote sensing data, models and census data we quantified carbon regulation, climate mitigation and recreation potential. We assessed ES provision changes and their spatio-temporal patterns using landscape metrics. Urban vegetation patterns differ between the two cities because of climate variability and greening policies. Bogota stored more carbon than Santiago given to climate effects, differences within city were the result of different policies and management. Climate mitigation showed similar behavior for both cities, influenced by global climate, densification and urban sprawling. Recreation potential increased in the inner-city and decrease at the outskirts, reflecting unplanned urban sprawling and increase population. Areas of high ecosystem services connected for Bogota and fragmented for Santiago. Bogota improved its environmental condition, as evaluated by ES provision, while Santiago worsens, even there was an increased in vegetation cover. Vegetation cover was not a sufficient indicator for ecosystem services and the distribution of it becomes highly relevant for informing mismatches between services and vegetation.

TI  - Geostationary Visible Imager Calibration for the CERES SYN1deg Edition 4 Product
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) project relies on geostationary (GEO) imager derived TOA broadband fluxes and cloud properties to account for the regional diurnal fluctuations between the Terra and Aqua CERES and MODIS measurements. Anchoring the GEO visible calibration to the MODIS reference calibration and stability is critical for consistent fluxes and cloud retrievals across the 16 GEO imagers utilized in the CERES record. The CERES Edition 4A used GEO and MODIS ray-matched radiance pairs over all-sky tropical ocean (ATO-RM) to transfer the MODIS calibration to the GEO imagers. The primary GEO ATO-RM calibration was compared with the deep convective cloud (DCC) ray-matching and invariant desert/DCC target calibration methodologies, which are all tied to the same Aqua-MODIS calibration reference. Results indicate that most GEO record mean calibration method biases are within 1% with respect to ATO-RM. Most calibration method temporal trends were within 0.5% relative to ATO-RM. The monthly gain trend standard errors were mostly within 1% for all methods and GEOs. The close agreement amongst the independent calibration techniques validates all methodologies, and verifies that the coefficients are not artifacts of the methodology but rather adequately represent the true GEO visible imager degradation.

TI  - Gaofen-3 PolSAR Image Classification via XGBoost and Polarimetric Spatial Information
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The launch of the Chinese Gaofen-3 (GF-3) satellite will provide enough synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images with different imaging modes for land cover classification and other potential usages in the next few years. This paper aims to propose an efficient and practical classification framework for a GF-3 polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) image. The proposed classification framework consists of four simple parts including polarimetric feature extraction and stacking, the initial classification via XGBoost, superpixels generation by statistical region merging (SRM) based on Pauli RGB image, and a post-processing step to determine the label of a superpixel by modified majority voting. Fast initial classification via XGBoost and the incorporation of spatial information via a post-processing step through superpixel-based modified majority voting would potentially make the method efficient in practical use. Preliminary experimental results on real GF-3 PolSAR images and the AIRSAR Flevoland data set validate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed classification framework. The results demonstrate that the quality of GF-3 PolSAR data is adequate enough for classification purpose. The results also show that the incorporation of spatial information is important for overall performance improvement.

TI  - Mapping landslide surface displacements with time series SAR interferometry by combining persistent and distributed scatterers: A case study of Jiaju landslide in Danba, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - InSAR technology provides a powerful tool to detect potentially unstable slopes across wide areas and to monitor surface displacements of a single landslide. However, conventional time series InSAR methods such as persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) and small-baseline subset (SBAS) can rarely identify sufficient measurement points (MPs) in mountainous areas due to decorrelations caused by steep terrain and vegetation coverage. In this study, we developed a new InSAR approach, coherent scatterer InSAR (CSI), to map landslide surface displacements in the radar line-of-sight (LOS) direction by combining persistent scatterers (PS) and distributed scatterers (DS). The key ideas of CSI include the employment of the generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) test for the identification of statistically homogeneous pixels (SHPs) and the use of the phase linking algorithm to estimate optimal phase for each DS pixel. The joint exploitation of PS and DS targets dramatically increases the spatial density of MPs, which makes the phase unwrapping more reliable. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the CSI approach, we applied it to retrieve the historical displacements of the Jiaju landslide in Danba County of southwest China using 19 L-band ALOS PALSAR images (2006-2011) and nine C-band ENVISAT ASAR images (2007-2008). Multiple comparisons clearly illustrated the big advantages of CSI over PSI and SBAS in mapping landslide displacements with more details owing to much higher ( > 10 times) MP density. Furthermore, the superiority of L-band SAR data over C-band for landslide investigation in rural environments was confirmed. Quantitative validation of the CSI results for PALSAR data against in-situ GPS measurements suggested an accuracy of about 10.5 millimeters per year (mm/year) in terms of root mean square error (RMSE). Afterwards, the spatial-temporal characteristics of the Jiaju landslide surface displacements were summarized, with a new upper boundary for the active northern part delineated. Particularly, the northern part of the landslide moved faster than the southern part, exhibiting a maximum LOS displacement rate of around 120 mm/year. Subsequently, the fluvial erosion by the Dajinchuan River was identified as the predominant impact factor for the instability of the Jiaju landslide. Finally, the major problems and challenges for the application of CSI method were discussed, and the conclusions were given.

TI  - Role of number of sentinel nodes in predicting non-sentinel node metastasis in breast cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MEDICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective The aim of the present study was to determine how many sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) are appropriate for predicting non-SLN metastasis in breast cancer.Methods The association between clinicopathological features and non-SLN metastasis was retrospectively analyzed in 472 patients who underwent axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) following SLN biopsy. Another 251 patients who underwent only SLN biopsy without ALND were analyzed and followed up for 2 years.Results A large tumor size, positive SLN, and HER-2 positivity were independent predictors of non-SLN metastasis. There were significant differences in non-SLN metastasis between patients with one negative SLN and patients with an absence of negative SLNs. There was no significant difference in non-SLN metastasis between patients with one negative SLN and two or more negative SLNs. The recurrence-free survival rate for patients who did not undergo ALND was 99.6% (245/246).Conclusion Surgeons should ensure that the number of SLNs obtained is appropriate. The presence of one negative SLN is enough in SLN biopsy. Considering the invasiveness of the surgery, two or more negative SLNs may be unnecessary.

TI  - Preoperative prediction of sentinel lymph node metastasis in breast cancer based on radiomics of T2-weighted fat-suppression and diffusion-weighted MRI
T2  - EUROPEAN RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - To predict sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis in breast cancer patients using radiomics based on T-2-weighted fat suppression (T-2-FS) and diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI).We enrolled 146 patients with histologically proven breast cancer. All underwent pretreatment T-2-FS and DWI MRI scan. In all, 10,962 texture and four non-texture features were extracted for each patient. The 0.623 + bootstrap method and the area under the curve (AUC) were used to select the features. We constructed ten logistic regression models (orders of 1-10) based on different combination of image features using stepwise forward method.For T-2-FS, model 10 with ten features yielded the highest AUC of 0.847 in the training set and 0.770 in the validation set. For DWI, model 8 with eight features reached the highest AUC of 0.847 in the training set and 0.787 in the validation set. For joint T-2-FS and DWI, model 10 with ten features yielded an AUC of 0.863 in the training set and 0.805 in the validation set.Full utilisation of breast cancer-specific textural features extracted from anatomical and functional MRI images improves the performance of radiomics in predicting SLN metastasis, providing a non-invasive approach in clinical practice.aEuro cent SLN biopsy to access breast cancer metastasis has multiple complications.aEuro cent Radiomics uses features extracted from medical images to characterise intratumour heterogeneity.aEuro cent We combined T (2) -FS and DWI textural features to predict SLN metastasis non-invasively.

TI  - Atmospheric Correction Inter-Comparison Exercise
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Atmospheric Correction Inter-comparison eXercise (ACIX) is an international initiative with the aim to analyse the Surface Reflectance (SR) products of various state-of-the-art atmospheric correction (AC) processors. The Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) and Water Vapour (WV) are also examined in ACIX as additional outputs of AC processing. In this paper, the general ACIX framework is discussed; special mention is made of the motivation to initiate the experiment, the inter-comparison protocol, and the principal results. ACIX is free and open and every developer was welcome to participate. Eventually, 12 participants applied their approaches to various Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 image datasets acquired over sites around the world. The current results diverge depending on the sensors, products, and sites, indicating their strengths and weaknesses. Indeed, this first implementation of processor inter-comparison was proven to be a good lesson for the developers to learn the advantages and limitations of their approaches. Various algorithm improvements are expected, if not already implemented, and the enhanced performances are yet to be assessed in future ACIX experiments.

TI  - [<SUP>18</SUP>F]FDG PET/CT for assessing inguinal lymph nodes in patients with penile cancer - correlation with histopathology after inguinal lymphadenectomy
T2  - NUKLEARMEDIZIN-NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: Accurate staging of penile cancer requires invasive methods such as sentinel node biopsy or lymphadenectomy (LAD). We assessed the value of [F-18]FDG PET/CT for non-invasive nodal staging in penile cancer (PC) patients before inguinal LAD. Patients and methods: 41 consecutive patients with PC (stage pT1 or higher, cN0) received [F-18]FDG PET/CT before undergoing bilateral modified or radical inguinal staging LAD. Lymph nodes with a visually increased [F-18]FDG uptake were classified as suspicious of lymph node metastases (LNM). Standardized uptake value (SUV) of suspicious inguinal lymph nodes was determined. Results of [F-18]FDG PET/CT were correlated with histopathology. Results: In total 623 lymph nodes were resected, in 10 patients LNM were histologically confirmed (14/623 lymph nodes). In patient-based analysis [F-18]FDG PET/CT showed a sensitivity and specificity of 80% and 68 %, respectively, a positive predictive value (PPV) of 44 % and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 91 %. In the groin-based analysis, [F-18]FDG PET/CT had a sensitivity of 69 %, a specificity of 77 %, a PPV of 36 % and a NPV of 93 %. There was no significant difference in SUVmean and SUVmax between true positive and false positive lymph nodes (p = 0.093 and 0.069, respectively). Conclusion: [F-18]FDG PET/CT shows a high NPV in penile cancer patients without clinically evident LNM. However, due to its limited sensitivity (especially with respect to LNM of small size) and specificity (i.e. in the differentiation between (post) inflammatory and metastatic lymph nodes) [F-18]FDG PET/CT cannot replace invasive nodal staging.

A1  - Turkish Rotavirus Surveillance
TI  - Prevalence and diversity of rotavirus A genotypes cirulating in Turkey during a 2-year sentinel surveillance period, 2014-2016
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Human rotavirus A (RVA) is the main etiological agent of watery diarrhea among children under 5 years of age worldwide. The aims of this study were to investigate the prevalence and diversity of RVA genotypes circulating in Turkey during a 2-year sentinel surveillance study. A total of 1639 rotavirus antigen-positive stool samples were obtained from children younger than 5 years of age hospitalized with acute gastroenteritis. Rotavirus G and P genotypes were determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with consensus primers for the VP7 and VP4 genes, followed by semi-nested type-specific multiplex PCR. Rotavirus RNA was detected in 1396 (85.3%) of the samples tested. The highest detection rate (38.2%) was obtained among children in the 0-12 months age group, followed by children in the 13-24 months age group (36.2%). The most prevalent genotype was G1P[8] (24.6%) followed by G3P[8] (19.6%), G9P[8] (12.2%), G2P[4] (9.5%), G2P[8] (6.5%), and G4P[8] (4.8%). The proportions of uncommon and mixed genotypes were 21.5% and 1.14%, respectively. The large number of genotypes observed, including common, uncommon, and mixed types, indicates a high heterogeneity of RVA strains circulating in Turkey. The current study also exhibited dramatic fluctuations on the prevalences of the common genotypes, with increases in G3 and G1 and decreases in G9 and G2 from 2014-2016.

TI  - Terrestrial CDOM in Lakes of Yamal Peninsula: Connection to Lake and Lake Catchment Properties
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we analyze interactions in lake and lake catchment systems of a continuous permafrost area. We assessed colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption at 440 nm (a(440)(CDOM)) and absorption slope (S300-500) in lakes using field sampling and optical remote sensing data for an area of 350 km(2) in Central Yamal, Siberia. Applying a CDOM algorithm (ratio of green and red band reflectance) for two high spatial resolution multispectral GeoEye-1 and Worldview-2 satellite images, we were able to extrapolate the a()(CDOM) data from 18 lakes sampled in the field to 356 lakes in the study area (model R-2 = 0.79). Values of a(440)(CDOM) in 356 lakes varied from 0.48 to 8.35 m(-1) with a median of 1.43 m(-1). This a()(CDOM) dataset was used to relate lake CDOM to 17 lake and lake catchment parameters derived from optical and radar remote sensing data and from digital elevation model analysis in order to establish the parameters controlling CDOM in lakes on the Yamal Peninsula. Regression tree model and boosted regression tree analysis showed that the activity of cryogenic processes (thermocirques) in the lake shores and lake water level were the two most important controls, explaining 48.4% and 28.4% of lake CDOM, respectively (R-2 = 0.61). Activation of thermocirques led to a large input of terrestrial organic matter and sediments from catchments and thawed permafrost to lakes (n = 15, mean a(440)(CDOM) = 5.3 m(-1)). Large lakes on the floodplain with a connection to Mordy-Yakha River received more CDOM (n = 7, mean a(440)(CDOM) = 3.8 m(-1)) compared to lakes located on higher terraces.

TI  - Demonstration of Percent Tree Cover Mapping Using Landsat Analysis Ready Data (ARD) and Sensitivity with Respect to Landsat ARD Processing Level
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The recently available Landsat Analysis Ready Data (ARD) are provided as top of atmosphere (TOA) and atmospherically corrected (surface) reflectance tiled products and are designed to make the U.S. Landsat archive for the United States straightforward to use. In this study, the utility of ARD for 30 m percent tree cover mapping is demonstrated and the impact of different ARD processing levels on mapping accuracy examined. Five years of Landsat 5 and 7 ARD over 12 tiles encompassing Washington State are considered using an established bagged regression tree methodology and training data derived from Goddard LiDAR Hyperspectral & Thermal Imager (G-LiHT) data. Sensitivity to the amount of training data is examined with increasing mapping accuracy observed as more training data are used. Four processing levels of ARD are considered independently and the mapped results are compared: (i) TOA ARD; (ii) surface ARD; (iii) bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) adjusted atmospherically corrected ARD; and (iv) weekly composited BRDF adjusted atmospherically corrected ARD. The atmospherically corrected ARD provide marginally the highest mapping accuracies, although accuracy differences are negligible among the four (0.07% RMSE) when modest amounts of training data are used. The TOA ARD provide the most accurate maps compared to the other input data when only small amounts of training data are used, and the least accurate maps otherwise. The results are illustrated and the implications discussed.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Flash flood assessment and management are necessary for municipal, urban growth planning and emergency action plans. By using the Hydrologic Engineering Centers River Analysis System software, we can model flash flood events and calculate water surface profiles over the length of the modeled stream. After collecting elevation points by using GPS method, the digital elevation model can be calculated for the study area. Najran city has main flood stream passes beside King Abdullah Road based on facts and previous works. A small study area including the mainstream of Wady Najran and King Abdullah Road has chosen as test site. The used methodology has also been proved efficiently for identifying flood inundation maps. Water extent area overlapped by 52-86% for both used methods. At discharge Q = 15 m(3)/s, the road needs to be protected from the flood.

TI  - Atypical Melanocytic Proliferations: A Review of the Literature
T2  - DERMATOLOGIC SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - BACKGROUND Ambiguous histopathologic diagnoses represent a challenge for clinicians because of a lack of definitive diagnosis and related uncertainty about management.OBJECTIVE To review the literature on atypical melanocytic proliferations and detail synonymous terms, epidemiology, diagnostic work-up, histopathology, treatment, and prognosis.METHODS Databases from PubMed and Web of Science were searched for articles related to atypical melanocytic proliferations.RESULTS Intraepidermal melanocytic proliferations with features worrisome for possible melanoma in situ (MIS) are generally excised as for MIS. Reported rates of upstaging of such cases to invasive melanoma on review of the excision are very low. Because invasion, lymph node spread, and metastasis can occur in atypical melanocytic lesions with a thick intradermal component, these are often treated as for malignant melanoma.CONCLUSION Because the diagnosis dictates treatment, it is incumbent to establish a diagnosis as definitive as possible, obtaining second or third opinions and using ancillary studies when appropriate. When the diagnosis remains uncertain, it is difficult to provide guidelines for treatment. Clinical care decisions for patients with an uncertain diagnosis are best done on a case-by-case basis weighing probabilities of adverse outcomes against potential benefits and risks from various treatment options.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Interpolation of Cloudy SST Fields Using Conditional Analog Data Assimilation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The ever increasing geophysical data streams pouring from earth observation satellite missions and numerical simulations along with the development of dedicated big data infrastructure advocate for truly exploiting the potential of these datasets, through novel data-driven strategies, to deliver enhanced satellite-derived gapfilled geophysical products from partial satellite observations. We here demonstrate the relevance of the analog data assimilation (AnDA) for an application to the reconstruction of cloud-free level-4 gridded Sea Surface Temperature (SST). We propose novel AnDA models which exploit auxiliary variables such as sea surface currents and significantly reduce the computational complexity of AnDA. Numerical experiments benchmark the proposed models with respect to state-of-the-art interpolation techniques such as optimal interpolation and EOF-based schemes. We report relative improvement up to 40%/50% in terms of RMSE and also show a good parallelization performance, which supports the feasibility of an upscaling on a global scale.

TI  - Integrating GIS and multi-influencing factor technique for delineation of potential groundwater recharge zones in parts of Ilesha schist belt, southwestern Nigeria
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the multi-influencing factor (MIF) technique was implemented through geographical information system to delineate potential zones of groundwater recharge. The hydrogeological factors influencing groundwater recharge namely lineament, drainage, lithology, slope, land use, rainfall and soil were classified and integrated based on weight derived through the MIF technique. Integration of these factors enabled the generation of potential groundwater recharge zone map which was classified into four categories namely high, moderate, low and very low occupying areas of 214.9 km(2) (14.6%), 599.2 km(2) (40.8%), 502.3 km(2) (34.2%), and 152.4 km(2) (10.4%), respectively. A total of 55.43% of the study area was found to have moderate to high recharge potential. Areas of high recharge potential lies majorly within the quartzite lithology and parts of undifferentiated migmatite-gneiss bordering the highly fractured quartzite. Estimation of the infiltration rate based on the potential recharge zone map classes revealed that approximately 27% of the precipitated rainfall volume is probably infiltrated into the subsurface; however, the actual percentage reaching the underlying aquifer is expected to be lower due to losses through subsurface flow intercepting river channels. Yields of wells within the study area revealed that recharge has significant influence on well yields. Wells within the zones of high to moderate recharge potential were found to have substantial yields while the well located within the zone of low recharge potentiality was found to have negligible yield. Negligible yield is also expected in areas with very low recharge potential. The result portrays the potential groundwater recharge zones in the study area and is found to be helpful in better planning and management of groundwater resources to maintain a proper balance between the groundwater quantity and its exploitation.

Therefore, study of hydrometeorological time series is very important to understand the basin behaviour. This research uses the snow cover data derived from MODIS, streamflow, and meteorological records in the Songhua River Basin to evaluate similarity, complexity, and trends in the snow cover, temperature, precipitation, and streamflow. In this paper, we suggest a new method of ranking the statistics symbolic sequences to examine the degree of similarity (distance measurement) between meteorological stations and compare it with non-parametric correlation methods and also investigate the deviations in the complexity of a hydrometeorological time series. Information-based similarity index and multiscale entropy confirm that the hydrometeorological time series of different stations have self-similarity and abundant complexity. Wavelet entropy is also used to investigate the basin behaviour by taking streamflow records and population. It is found that with the increase in population and urbanization, the complexity values are increased. The results also exhibit that due to increase in urbanization, it affects the hydrological process and nature of environment resulting in complex catchment behaviour. Furthermore, the streamflow trend results displayed significant decline (22.21m(3)/sxyear(-1)) in the Songhua River. The results also indicated that the seasonal snow cover trend has no impact on changes of the streamflow. However, the decline of the streamflow may be influenced by the significant human activity upstream of the Songhua River.

TI  - Evaluation of microwave remote sensing for monitoring live fuel moisture content in the Mediterranean region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Live fuel moisture content (LFMC) is an important factor in fire risk management in the Mediterranean region. Drawing upon a large network of stations (the Reseau Hydrique) measuring LFMC for operational fire danger assessment in the south-eastern region of France, this study assesses the ability of several long-term passive microwave remote sensing indices to capture the LFMC temporal dynamic of various Mediterranean shrub species. Microwave remote sensing has a high potential for monitoring LFMC independently of several constraints (e.g., atmospheric and cloud contamination effects) associated with optical-infrared and thermal remote sensing observations. The following four microwave-derived indices are considered: (1) the Essential Climate Variable near-surface soil moisture (ECV_SM); (2) the root-zone soil moisture (ECV_RZSM) derived from ECV_SM; (3) the microwave polarization difference index (MPDI) computed from five microwave frequencies (C, X, Ku, K and Ka-band corresponding to 6.9, 10.7, 18.7, 23.8 and 36.5 GHz respectively); and (4) the vegetation optical depth (VOD) at C- and X-band (from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth observing system, AMSR-E). Firstly, an evaluation of the root-zone soil moisture ECV_RZSM against a network of soil moisture measurements (SMOSMANIA in southern France) gave satisfactory results. For most of the Reseau Hydrique sites, the present study found good agreement between LFMC and individual microwave indices, including root-zone soil moisture, VOD at X-band, and MPDI at X and Ku-bands, all averaged over the 15 days preceding the in-situ LFMC measurements. VOD at X-band showed the best agreement with the in situ LFMC data (median of correlation coefficients over all in situ sites = 0.43). Further comparisons between LFMC data and several optical indices computed from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) data including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), visible atmospheric resistant index (VARI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), normalized difference infrared index 6 (NDII6), normalized difference infrared index 7 (NDII7) and global vegetation moisture index (GVMI) were made. The comparisons showed that VARI and SAVI, as optical greenness indices, outperform the microwave indices and other optical indices with median of correlation coefficients of 0.66 and 0.65, respectively. Overall, this study shows that passive microwave indices, particularly VOD, are efficient proxies for LFMC of Mediterranean shrub species and could be used along with optical indices to evaluate fire risks in the Mediterranean region.

TI  - Can MODIS detect trends in aerosol optical depth over land?
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor onboard NASA's Aqua satellite has been collecting valuable data about the Earth system for more than 14 years, and one of the benefits of this is that it has made it possible to detect the long-term variation in aerosol loading across the globe. However, the long-term aerosol optical depth (AOD) trends derived from MODIS need careful validation and assessment, especially over land. Using AOD products with at least 70 months' worth of measurements collected during 2002-15 at 53 Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sites over land, Mann-Kendall (MK) trends in AOD were derived and taken as the ground truth data for evaluating the corresponding results from MODIS onboard Aqua. The results showed that the AERONET AOD trends over all sites in Europe and North America, as well as most sites in Africa and Asia, can be reproduced by MODIS/Aqua. However, disagreement in AOD trends between MODIS and AERONET was found at a few sites in Australia and South America. The AOD trends calculated from AERONET instantaneous data at the MODIS overpass times were consistent with those from AERONET daily data, which suggests that the AOD trends derived from satellite measurements of 1-2 overpasses may be representative of those from daily measurements.

TI  - Boundaries and Characteristics of Arid Regions in Mountain Valleys in Southwestern China
T2  - MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Arid regions in valleys of southwestern China have steep topography and fragile ecosystems, making them a critical and challenging management issue in this region. A substantial amount of the research on these arid regions in valleys took place in the 1980s; less work has been done since the start of the 21st century. Knowledge of the boundaries of arid lands within these valleys can provide basic data and a scientific foundation, and comparing and analyzing the characteristics of different valleys will help policymakers match management regimes to local conditions, assuring sustainability in these fragile areas. Using remote-sensing data, we extracted the boundaries of the arid regions within these valleys. We then calculated land cover, elevation, slope, and aspect data for the study area. Our results describe the basic features of these valleys; they occur between 23 degrees 23' and 33 degrees 19'N and between 97 degrees 03' and 104 degrees 43'E, with a total area of 33,391.60 x km(2) at elevations between 254 and 5707 m. The arid regions in valleys have slopes ranging from 0 to 87.17 degrees, with a mean of 25.77 degrees, and a slightly greater area and proportion of sunny aspects than of shady aspects. The main land covers in the arid regions in valleys are grasslands and shrublands. Our results indicate that (1) the arid regions within these valleys have expanded significantly, and their vegetation consists largely of grasses or shrubs; (2) the study area consists of interlaced mountains and valleys, with a terrain consisting of diverse slopes and aspects; and (3) the land cover gradually transitions from grassland to shrub, and elevation and slope decrease from northwest to southeast.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Lymph node status is one of the most important prognostic factors in endometrial cancer and crucial for deciding adjuvant therapy.Objective: The aim of the study was to assess the different models used to predict lymphatic nodal disease.Search Strategy: A literature search was conducted to detect the relevant studies.Inclusion Criteria: Relevant papers comparing the preoperative modality with the final histopathological results including randomized clinical trials, case-control studies, and any publications with a minimum of 50 patients in the report.Results: Molecular-based predictors are still far from a practical application. Preoperative radiological scans (positron emission tomography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasound) have shown the best predictor of lymphatic dissemination. However, there is currently no ideal model available, which can be used within standard clinical care.Conclusions: Surgical staging still remains the criterion standard in the determination of lymph node status in endometrial cancer.

TI  - Clinicopathological characteristics of cutaneous malignant melanoma in patients at a tertiary hospital in Macaronesia. Survival as a function of locoregional prognostic factors per the American Joint Committee on Cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Despite suffering high ultraviolet radiation levels, few data on malignant melanoma (MM) in Macaronesia are available.Methods Observational study of cutaneous MM cases diagnosed during a period of 12 years at a tertiary hospital in Canary Islands.Results A total of 532 patients (female/male = 1.4) with an average age of 56 years were included; 5% developed more than one MM, and 7% reported family history of MM. Phototype II (43%), dark eyes (41%), and dark hair (41%) predominated. There was a lower frequency of light-colored hair and eyes in those born in the Canary Islands. The most frequent locations of MM were on the back for men (37%) and on the lower extremities for women (35%). Among the infiltrating tumors (83%), the (median) thickness was 1.07 mm (women, 0.90 mm; men, 1.21 mm). Anatomopathological ulceration (AU) and a mitotic rate >= 1 mitosis/mm(2) (HMR) were recorded in 27% of patients. Patients with regional disease constituted 12% of the population. The most common stage was IA (34%). Melanoma-specific survival (MSSV) decreased significantly with thickness, presence of AU, HMR, and sentinel lymph node disease. These four variables were independent prognostic factors. The five-year MSSV varied between 100% (stage IA) and 39% (stage IIIC).Conclusions The characteristics of the patients were similar to those published in datasets from continental Europe, although the pigmentary features were darker in those originating from Macaronesia. The prognostic parameters described in the 7th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) independently predict MSSV in our patients.

TI  - The Shift From Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Performed Either Before or After Neoadjuvant Systemic Therapy in the Clinical Negative Nodes of Breast Cancer Patients. Results, and the Advantages and Disadvantages of Both Procedures
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - The clinical consequence of performing sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) before or after neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) in breast cancer patients remains under study. Therefore, we present a comparison between both approaches. The lymphadenectomy rate is reduced by threefold when the SLNB is assessed after NAT with no increase in early recurrences; consequently, it seems that this approach has more advantages for the patients than before NAT.Background: In patients with breast cancer who are candidates for neoadjuvant therapy (NAT), the timing of when to perform sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) remains under discussion. The aim of this study was to compare the advantages and disadvantages of SLNB performed before and after NAT. Patients and Methods: One hundred seventy-two patients, T1c to T3 and N0 (clinically and according to ultrasound) candidates for NAT were included. We compared the outcomes of 2 groups: (1) 122 patients of whom SLNB was performed before NAT (pre-NAT) from December 2006 to April 2014; and (2) 50 patients with SLNB performed after NAT (post-NAT) from May 2014 to July 2016. Results: Both groups were homogeneous in baseline patient characteristics. The SLNB was positive in 50 patients [41.7%] (33 macrometastases [66%] and 17 micrometastases [34%]) versus 6 patients [12%] (5 macrometastases [83.3%] and 1 micrometastases [16.7%]) in pre- and post-NAT groups, respectively. The lymphadenectomy was performed in 34 patients [28.3%] versus 4 patients [8%], with an odds ratio of 3.48 (95% confidence interval, 1.3-9.3). The recurrences in the pre-NAT group after a median follow-up of 62 months were 12 systemic, 2 local and systemic, and none axillary. In the post-NAT group were no recurrences after a median follow-up of 16 months. Finally, SLNB after NAT reduces the delay in starting NAT from 24 to 14 days (medians; P < .001) and the identification of the SLNB was in 122 patients [100%] versus 49 patients [98%]. Conclusion: SLNB performed after NAT significantly reduces the rate of lymphadenectomies without any increase in recurrences at early follow-up. Furthermore, it allows systemic treatment to be started earlier without interfering in the SLNB identification rate. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The effect of an underwater artificial air diffusion system on the water quality of Embalse San Roque, Cordoba-Argentine is assessed by means of a temporal-spatial analysis, for 2008-2011, through field data and LANDSAT5-TM satellite imagery. The temperature estimated using TM6 band, resulting with a determination coefficient of 0.94 and a mean square error of 0.4 degrees C. A multiple regression model was used to calculate the logarithm pf chlorophyll-a concentration by means of TM1 and TM4 bands, obtaining a determination coefficient of 0.64 which was validated with a control group with and agreement of 83%. The processed images show the localized effect of the underwater artificial air diffusion system, improving the water quality in their neighbors.

TI  - Confirmation of ENSO-Southern Ocean Teleconnections Using Satellite-Derived SST
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Southern Ocean is the focus of many physical, chemical, and biological analyses due to its global importance and highly variable climate. This analysis of sea surface temperatures (SST) and global teleconnections shows that SSTs are significantly spatially correlated with both the Antarctic Oscillation and the Southern Oscillation, with spatial correlations between the indices and standardized SST anomalies approaching 1.0. Here, we report that the recent positive patterns in the Antarctic and Southern Oscillations are driving negative (cooling) trends in SST in the high latitude Southern Ocean and positive (warming) trends within the Southern Hemisphere sub-tropics and mid-latitudes. The coefficient of regression over the 35-year period analyzed implies that standardized temperatures have warmed at a rate of 0.0142 per year between 1982 and 2016 with a monthly standard error in the regression of 0.0008. Further regression calculations between the indices and SST indicate strong seasonality in response to changes in atmospheric circulation, with the strongest feedback occurring throughout the austral summer and autumn.

TI  - Rigorous 3D change determination in Antarctic Peninsula glaciers from stereo WorldView-2 and archival aerial imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents detailed elevation and volume analysis of 16 individual glaciers, grouped at four locations, spread across the Antarctic Peninsula (AP). The study makes use of newly available WorldView-2 satellite stereo imagery to exploit the previously untapped value of archival stereo aerial photography. High resolution photogrammetric digital elevation models (DEMs) are derived to determine three-dimensional glacier change over an unprecedented time span of six decades with an unparalleled mean areal coverage of 82% per glacier. The use of an in-house robust surface matching algorithm ensured rigorous alignment of the DEMs to overcome inherent problems associated with processing archival photography, most notably the identification and correction of scale error in some datasets. The analysis provides insight into one of the most challenging and data-scarce areas on the planet by expanding the spatial extent north of the AP to include previously un-studied glaciers located in the South Shetland Islands. 81% of glaciers studied showed considerable loss of volume over the period of record. The mean annual mass loss for all glaciers yielded 0.24 +/- 0.08 m.w.e. per year, with a maximum mass loss of up to 62 m.w.e. and frontal retreat exceeding 2.2 km for Stadium Glacier, located furthest north on Elephant Island. Observed volumetric loss was broadly, though not always, correlated with frontal retreat. The combined mass balance of all 16 glaciers yielded- 1.862 +/- 0.006 Gt, which corresponds to- 0.005 mm sea level equivalent (SLE) over the 57 year observation period.

TI  - The Challenges of Remotely Measuring Oil Slick Thickness
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - The thickness of oil spills on the sea is an important but poorly studied topic. Means to measure slick thickness are reviewed. More than 30 concepts are summarized. Many of these are judged not to be viable for a variety of scientific reasons. Two means are currently available to remotely measure oil thickness, namely, passive microwave radiometry and time of acoustic travel. Microwave radiometry is commercially developed at this time. Visual means to ascertain oil thickness are restricted by physics to thicknesses smaller than those of rainbow sheens, which rarely occur on large spills, and thin sheen. One can observe that some slicks are not sheen and are probably thicker. These three thickness regimes are not useful to oil spill countermeasures, as most of the oil is contained in the thick portion of a slick, the thickness of which is unknown and ranges over several orders of magnitude. There is a continuing need to measure the thickness of oil spills. This need continues to increase with time, and further research effort is needed. Several viable concepts have been developed but require further work and verification. One of the difficulties is that ground truthing and verification methods are generally not available for most thickness measurement methods.

TI  - Shortwave IR Adaption of the Mid-Infrared Radiance Method of Fire Radiative Power (FRP) Retrieval for Assessing Industrial Gas Flaring Output
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The radiative power (MW) output of a gas flare is a useful metric from which the rate of methane combustion and carbon dioxide emission can be inferred for inventorying purposes and regular global surveys based on such assessments are now being used to keep track of global gas flare reduction efforts. Several multispectral remote sensing techniques to estimate gas flare radiative power output have been developed for use in such surveys and single band approaches similar to those long used for the estimation of landscape fire radiative power output (FRP) can also be applied. The MIR-Radiance method, now used for FRP retrieval within the MODIS active fire products, is one such single band approachbut its applicability to gas flare targets (which are significantly hotter than vegetation fires) has not yet been assessed. Here we show that the MIR-Radiance approach is in fact not immediately suitable for retrieval of gas flare FRP due to their higher combustion temperatures but that switching to use data from a SWIR (rather than MWIR) spectral channel once again enables the method to deliver unbiased FRP retrievals. Over an assumed flaring temperature range of 1600-2200 K we find a maximum FRP error of +/- 13.6% when using SWIR observations at 1.6 mu m and +/- 6.3% when using observations made at 2.2 mu m. Comparing these retrievals to those made by the multispectral VIIRS NightFire' algorithm (based on Planck Function fits to the multispectral signals) we find excellent agreement (bias = 0.5 MW, scatter = 1.6 MW). An important implication of the availability of this new SWIR radiance method for gas flare analysis is the potential to apply it to long time-series from older and/or more spectrally limited instruments, unsuited to the use of multispectral algorithms. This includes the ATSR series of sensors operating between 1991-2012 on the ERS-1, ERS-2 and ENVISAT satellites and such long-term data can be used with the SWIR-Radiance method to identify key trends in global gas flaring that have occurred over the last few decades.

TI  - Comparative analysis of clinics, pathologies and immune responses in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice infected with <i>Streptobacillus moniliformis</i>
T2  - MICROBES AND INFECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Streptobacillus (S.) moniliformis is a rat-associated zoonotic pathogen that occasionally causes disease in other species. We investigated the working hypothesis that intranasal infection might lead to different immune responses in C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice associated with distinct pathologies. This study confirmed with 75% mortality the known high susceptibility of C57BL/6 mice to Streptobacillus moniliformis infection in comparison to BALB/c mice which did not develop signs of disease. Main pathologies in C57BL/6 mice were purulent to necrotizing lymphadenitis and pneumonia. Significant seroconversion was recorded in surviving mice of both strains. Differentiation of IgG-subclasses revealed mean ratios of IgG2b to IgG1 below 0.5 in sera of all mice prior to infection and of BALB/c mice post infection. In contrast, C57BL/6 mice had a mean IgG2b/IgG1 ratio of 2.5 post infection indicating a Th1 immune response in C57BL/6 versus a Th2 response in BALB/c mice. Evaluation of different sentinel systems revealed that cultural and serological investigations of these animals might not be sufficient to detect infection. In summary, an intranasal S. moniliformis infection model in C57BL/6 mice leading to purulent to necrotizing inflammations in the lung, the lymph nodes and other organs associated with a Th1 immune response is described.

TI  - Analyzing spatial and temporal variability in short-term rates of post-fire vegetation return from Landsat time series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The disturbance and recovery cycles of Canadian boreal forests result in highly dynamic landscapes, requiring continued monitoring to observe and characterize environmental change over time. Well-established remote sensing methods capture change over forested ecosystems, however the return of forest vegetation in disturbed locations is infrequently documented and not well understood. Landsat time-series data allows for both the capture of the initial disturbance and the ability to monitor the subsequent vegetation regeneration with spectral vegetation indices. In this research, we used three spectral recovery metrics derived from an annual Landsatbased per-pixel Normalized Burn Ratio time series to determine trends in the short-term rates of spectral recovery for areas disturbed by wildfire (1986-2006), as assessed using a series of 5-year post-disturbance windows to observe forest recovery trends. Our results indicated that rates of spectral forest recovery vary over time and space in the Taiga and Boreal Shield ecozones. We found evidence that post-fire spectral forest recovery rates have accelerated over time in both the East and West Taiga Shield ecozones, with a consistent, positive, and significant trend measured using a Mann-Kendall test for monotonicity and Theil-Sen slope estimation. Over the analysis period (1986-2011), relative rates of spectral forest recovery increased by 18% in the Taiga Shield East and 9% in the Taiga Shield West. In contrast, spectral forest recovery rates in the Boreal Shield varied temporally, and were not consistently positive or negative. These results demonstrate that post-fire spectral recovery rates are not fixed over time and that spectral trends are dependent upon spatial location in the Canadian boreal. This retrospective baseline information on trends in spectral recovery rates highlights the value of, and continued need for detailed monitoring of vegetation regeneration in boreal forest ecosystems, particularly in the context of a changing climate.

TI  - On the imaging of exposed intertidal flats by single- and dual-co-polarization Synthetic Aperture Radar
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We used 26 Radarsat-2 and TerraSAR-X single- and dual-co-polarization Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images of a test site on the German North Sea coast to investigate the influence of imaging geometry and environmental conditions (wind speed, water level, and vegetation period) on the radar return from exposed intertidal flats. Multi-temporal analyses of single- (VV-) polarization SAR imagery indicate that the surface roughness is more variable at shorter scales (responsible for the X-band backscatter) than at longer scales (C-band). Less variation at both radar bands was found in sea-grass meadows. TerraSAR-X dual-co-polarization data were used for polarimetric analyses based on a decomposition of the Kennaugh matrix, whose elements provide information on the total intensity at both co-polarizations and on the relative strength of even- and odd-bounce backscattering. At steep incidence angles (around 30 degrees) the radar backscatter from bare sand flats is similarly strong at both co-polarizations, while the vertically polarized radar return dominates at higher incidence angles (above 40). At low water levels, resulting in lower moisture of the sandy sediments, strong single-bounce radar backscattering was observed, while higher water levels (and moisture) caused weak mixed (single- and double-bounce) backscattering. Apart from the absolute water level its history, e.g. the time and level of the closest low tide, must be considered. During the vegetation period, sea-grass meadows cause a stronger increase in horizontally (HH-) polarized radar backscatter, along with an increased double-bounce backscattering. We conclude that the Kennaugh element framework has potential to be used for classification purposes in intertidal areas, but also that, for a full interpretation of the SAR imagery, the exact topography and the surface roughness have to be known.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Distribution of Satellite-Retrieved Ground-Level PM<sub>2.5</sub> and Near Real-Time Daily Retrieval Algorithm Development in Sichuan Basin, China
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based monitoring can retrieve ground-level PM2.5 concentrations with higher-resolution and continuous spatial coverage to assist in making management strategies and estimating health exposures. The Sichuan Basin has a complex terrain and several city clusters that differ from other regions in China: it has an enclosed air basin with a unique planetary boundary layer dynamic which accumulates air pollution. The spatiotemporal distribution of 1-km resolution Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) in the Sichuan Basin was retrieved using the improved dark pixel method and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data in this study. The retrieved seasonal AOD reached its highest values in spring and had the lowest values in autumn. The higher correlation (r = 0.84, N = 171) between the ground-based Lidar AOD and 1-km resolution MODIS AOD indicated that the high-resolution MODIS AOD could be used to retrieve the ground-level PM2.5 concentration. The Lidar-measured annual average extinction coefficient increased linearly with the Planetary Boundary Layer Height (PBLH) in the range of 100 similar to 670 m, but exponentially decreased between the heights of 670 similar to 1800 m. Both the correlation and the variation tendency of simulated PBLH from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model & Shin-Hong (SHIN)/California Meteorological (CALMET) model (WRF_SHIN/CALMET) were closer to the Lidar observation than that of three other Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) schemes (the Grenier-Bretherton-McCaa (GBM) scheme, the Total Energy-Mass Flux (TEMF) scheme and the University of Washington (UW) scheme), which suggested that the simulated the Planetary Boundary Layer Height (PBLH) could be used in the vertical correction of retrieval PM2.5. Four seasonal fitting functions were also obtained for further humidity correction. The correlation coefficient between the aerosol extinction coefficient and the fitted surface-level PM2.5 concentration at the benchmark station of Southwest Jiao-tong University was enhanced significantly from 0.62 to 0.76 after vertical and humidity corrections during a whole year. During the evaluation of the retrieved ground-level PM2.5 with observed values from three cities, Yibin (YB), Dazhou (DZ), and Deyang (DY), our algorithm performed well, resulting in higher correlation coefficients of 0.78 (N = 177), 0.77 (N = 178), and 0.81 (N = 181), respectively.

TI  - ENSO Effects on Annual Variations of Summer Precipitation Stable Isotopes in Lhasa, Southern Tibetan Plateau
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Although El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) influences the Indian summer monsoon, its impact on moisture transport toward the southern Tibetan Plateau (TP) remains poorly understood. Precipitation stable isotopes are useful indices for climate change in the TP. Classical interpretations of variations of precipitation stable isotopes focus on the local surface air temperature or precipitation amount. However, several of the latest studies suggested they may correlate with large-scale modes of variability, such as ENSO. This paper presents a detailed study of ENSO's effect on annual variations of the oxygen stable isotopic composition of precipitation (delta O-18(p)) at Lhasa in the southern TP for up to 10 years. The stable isotopic composition of water vapor from satellite data [Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES)] and simulations from an isotopically enabled atmospheric general circulation model (zoomed LMDZiso) are used to explore the mechanism that leads to variations of delta O-18(p) at Lhasa. Statistically significant correlations delta O-18(p) and ENSO indices [Southern Oscillation index (SOI) and Nino-3.4 sea surface temperature index (Nino-3.4)] are observed. This paper shows that ENSO's effects on the location and intensity of convection over the Arabian Sea, the Bay of Bengal, and the tropical Indian Ocean, along moisture transport paths toward Lhasa, further impact convection from the northern Tibetan Plateau. The changing of this convection results in lower delta O-18(p) at Lhasa in 2007, a La Nina year, and higher delta O-18(p) in 2006, an El Nino year. The study presented here confirms that the regional upstream convection related to ENSO teleconnections plays an important role in variations of delta O-18(p) at the interannual scale and that the more depleted oxygen stable isotopic composition of vapor (delta O-18(v)) from the northwestern region of India during a La Nina year intensifies the lower delta O-18(p) at Lhasa in a La Nina year. The study's results have implications for the interpretation of past variations of archives with precipitation stable isotopes, such as ice cores, tree rings, lake sediments, and speleothems, in this region.

TI  - Quantifying and modelling decay in forecast proficiency indicates the limits of transferability in land-cover classification
T2  - METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. The ability to provide reliable projections for the current and future distribution of land-cover is fundamental if we wish to protect and manage our diminishing natural resources. Two inter-related revolutions make map productions feasible at unprecedented resolutions-the availability of high-resolution remotely sensed data and the development of machine-learning algorithms. However, ground-truthed data needed for training models is in most cases spatially and temporally clustered. Therefore, map production requires extrapolation of models from one place to another and the uncertainty cost of such extrapolation is rarely explored. In other words, the focus has mainly been on projections, and less on quantifying their reliability.2. Using the concept of "forecast horizon", we suggest that the predictability of land-cover classification models should be quantitatively explored as a continuum against distances measured along multiple dimensions-space, time, environmental and spectral. Focusing on ten agricultural sites from England and using models specifically designed to predict multivariate decay-curves, we ask: how does a model's predictive performance decay with distance? More specifically, we explored if we could predict the proficiency (kappa statistics) of a model trained in one site when making predictions in another site based on the spatial, temporal, spectral and environmental distances between sites.3. We found that model proficiency decays with distance between sites in each dimension. More importantly, we found for the first time, that it is possible to predict the performance a model transferred to or from a novel site will have, based on its distances from known sites. The spectral distance variables were the most important when predicting model transferability.4. Exploring model transferability as a continuum may have multiple usages including predicting uncertainty values in space and time, prioritisation of strategies for ground-truth data collection, and optimising model characteristics for defined tasks.

TI  - Detection of Phenology-Defined Data Acquisition Time Frames For Crop Type Mapping
T2  - PFG-JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY REMOTE SENSING AND GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural monitoring and assessment based on satellite data increasingly gains importance due to the growing number of available satellite sensors with high geometric and temporal resolution. Such tasks often require multiple images acquired on specific dates that among others account for inter-annual phenological variations to provide accurate results. This contribution presents an approach that links peaks of spectral separability profiles to crop phenological phases. The phases are spatially interpolated using a phenological model and ground observations. The profiles show the respective temporal development of the F-measure which is used as indicator for class-wise separability. It originates from binary classifications of vegetation indices computed for each set of a satellite data archive covering multiple years. Acquisition dates, which repeatedly show a separability maximum define phenological indicator phases. Potential alternative phases can be also defined. Experiments based on multi-temporal RapidEye satellite imagery were performed for three crops at two German test sites under different environmental conditions. The results showed that the phases yellow ripeness, heading and flowering can function as indicator phases for high spectral separability of winter barley, winter wheat and winter rapeseed. We could identify at least two identical, stable indicator phases per crop type for both test sites, which suggests the transferability and robustness of the presented approach.

TI  - Making ecological models adequate
T2  - ECOLOGY LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Critical evaluation of the adequacy of ecological models is urgently needed to enhance their utility in developing theory and enabling environmental managers and policymakers to make informed decisions. Poorly supported management can have detrimental, costly or irreversible impacts on the environment and society. Here, we examine common issues in ecological modelling and suggest criteria for improving modelling frameworks. An appropriate level of process description is crucial to constructing the best possible model, given the available data and understanding of ecological structures. Model details unsupported by data typically lead to over parameterisation and poor model performance. Conversely, a lack of mechanistic details may limit a model's ability to predict ecological systems' responses to management. Ecological studies that employ models should follow a set of model adequacy assessment protocols that include: asking a series of critical questions regarding state and control variable selection, the determinacy of data, and the sensitivity and validity of analyses. We also need to improve model elaboration, refinement and coarse graining procedures to better understand the relevancy and adequacy of our models and the role they play in advancing theory, improving hind and forecasting, and enabling problem solving and management.

TI  - Precipitation rate climatology related to different cloud types using satellite imagery over Iran
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud types have a substantial influence on precipitation. This paper presents a study of the monthly variations of daytime different cloud types over Iran using data collected from Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard Terra during 2001-2015, MODIS aboard Aqua during 2002-2015, International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) H-series cloud type data during 2001-2009 and precipitation rate associated with different cloud types using Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite products during 2001-2009. Different cloud types were determined using MODIS cloud optical thickness and cloud top pressure data based on ISCCP algorithm. The results showed that stratocumulus and cumulus clouds have maximum occurrence frequency over marine areas especially southern seas. The maximum frequency of nimbostratus and deep convective occurrence occurred over mountainous regions particularly at the time of Aqua overpass and cirrus and cirrostratus are observed over southeast of Iran during warm months due to monsoon system. Altostratus cloud is extended in each month except January, at the time of Terra overpass while nimbostratus is seen at the time of Aqua overpass during warm months in the study area. Cumulus and altocumulus clouds have shown remarkable frequency in all months especially over marine regions during warm and fall months. The higher value of precipitation rate is related to altostratus with a rate approximately 7 mm/h at the time of Terra overpass during April. Altostratus has the maximum recorded precipitation rate except in Nov., Dec., Sep., and Jan. at the time of Terra overpass, whereas the maximum precipitation rate is linked to nimbostratus cloud activity (up to 5 mm/h) except for March, April, and Sep. at the time of Aqua overpass. Deep convective (up to 1. 32 mm/h), cirrostratus (up to 1.11 mm/h), and cirrus (0.02 mm/h) are observed only in warm months. The results were compared with ISCCP cloud types so that precipitation rate classified from low to high and Spearman rank correlation was calculated. The results showed good agreement between these two cloud type data; however, there were few notable difference between them.

TI  - Satellite-Based Mapping of Cultivated Area in Gash Delta Spate Irrigation System, Sudan
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a simple methodology for mapping the seasonal cultivated area of the Gash Delta Spate Irrigation System based on satellite images was developed. The methodology combined information from multiple bands to characterize the land surface in terms of spectral indices (e.g., Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and surface temperature (Ts)). Visual interpretations of a conveniently selected image were undertaken to identify and select sample points of interest. The NDVI and Ts values (computed from multi-date images that represented the crop growing period) of the sample points were used to developed typical NDVI and Ts plots. By analyzing these plots and the cropping calendar, an NDVI and Ts threshold-based algorithm was developed to extract the cultivated area of a given season. Analysis of the developed algorithm showed that it was simple, easily modifiable, and had interpretable rules and threshold values. Comparing the extracted cultivated area with the field report area showed a promising application of the methodology to map and estimate the cultivated area from only remote sensing data.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable representations of global urban extent remain limited, hindering scientific progress across a range of disciplines that study functionality of sustainable cities. We present an efficient and low-cost machine-learning approach for pixel-based image classification of built-up areas at a large geographic scale using Landsat data. Our methodology combines nighttime-lights data and Landsat 8 and overcomes the lack of extensive ground reference data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology, which is implemented in Google Earth Engine, through the development of accurate 30 m resolution maps that characterize built-up land cover in three geographically diverse countries: India, Mexico, and the US. Our approach highlights the usefulness of data fusion techniques for studying the built environment and is a first step towards the creation of an accurate global-scale map of urban land cover over time.

TI  - Cost-based optimization of the stopping threshold for local disease surveillance during progressive eradication of tuberculosis from New Zealand wildlife
T2  - TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Bovine tuberculosis (TB) is managed in New Zealand largely via population reduction of the major wildlife disease reservoir of Mycobacterium bovis, the introduced brushtail possum Trichosurus vulpecula. New Zealand aims to eradicate M.bovis infection from its livestock and wildlife within 40years, as the culmination of progressive regional eradication programmes. Declarations of regional eradication are decided after extensive possum population control and post-control surveillance; hence, we developed a modelling framework, based on eco-epidemiological simulation data, to provide cost-evaluated options for deciding when to make these declarations. A decision-support framework evaluated potential costs of wildlife surveillance (and recontrol, if required) with respect to the calculated probability of successful eradication of M.bovis from wildlife. This enabled expected costs to be predicted in terms of stopping thresholds, allowing selection of optimal stopping rules based on minimizing costs. We identified factors that could influence optimal stopping values applied during regional eradication. Where vector/disease surveillance was inexpensive (for example, using low-cost detection devices or sentinel wildlife hosts) optimization involved setting a higher rather than lower stopping value, as it would be cheaper to minimize the risk of making a false declaration of eradication than to remedy any such failure. In addition, any cost of recontrol would largely depend on the time to rediscovery of residual M.bovis infection in wildlife, which would in turn be linked to the level of ongoing passive surveillance (with more rapid detection of re-emergent infection among wildlife in farmland situations than in remote forested regions). These two scenarios would favour different optimal stopping rules, as would the consideration of stakeholder confidence and socio-political issues, which are discussed. The framework presented here provides guidance to assess the economics underlying eradication of bovine TB from New Zealand farming; this eliminates reliance upon a pre-determined and uniform stopping rule for ceasing active management.

TI  - Effective Representation of River Geometry in Hydraulic Flood Forecast Models
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Bathymetric data are a critical input to hydraulic models. However, river depth and shape cannot be systematically observed remotely, and field data are both scarce and expensive to collect. In flood modeling, river roughness and geometry compensate for each other, with different parameter sets often being able to map model predictions equally well to the observed data, commonly known as equifinality. This study presents a numerical experiment to investigate an effective yet parsimonious representation of channel geometry that can be used for operational flood forecasting. The LISFLOOD-FP hydraulic model was used to simulate a hypothetical flood event in the Clarence catchment (Australia). A high-resolution model simulation based on accurate bathymetric field data was used to benchmark coarser model simulations based on simplified river geometries. These simplified river geometries were derived from a combination of globally available empirical formulations, remote sensing data, and a limited number of measurements. Model predictive discrepancy between simulations with field data and simplified geometries allowed an assessment of the geometry impact on inundation dynamics. In this study site, the channel geometrical representation for a reliable inundation forecast could be achieved using remote sensing-derived river width values combined with a few measurements of river depth sampled at strategic locations. Furthermore, this study showed that spatially distributed remote sensing-derived inundation levels at the very early stages of a flood event have the potential to support the effective diagnosis of errors in model implementations.Plain Language Summary Floods are among the most frequent and destructive natural disasters worldwide. An accurate and reliable flood forecast can provide vital information for land management and emergency response. Flood forecasts are achieved using numerical models that are able to predict the depth, velocity, and arrival time of the flood wave at each point of the valley. The accuracy of these predictions is strongly related to the quality of the three-dimensional representation of the valley. In particular, information on river geometry (that is cross-section shape, depth, and width) is critical to the application of these numerical models. However, it is impossible to measure river geometry along the entire river length, especially in large basins. This study developed a method to represent river geometry using a limited amount of time and money. Specifically, this objective can be achieved using available satellite imagery complemented with a few measurements. Moreover, this study showed that flood forecast skill can be improved by combining information from satellite and numerical models. Albeit simple, the river geometry representation proposed in this study can support the accurate prediction of floodplain inundation. This method was described and tested using, as example, a hypothetical flood event in an Australian catchment.

TI  - The Impact of Adding Sentinel Node Biopsy to Extended Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection on Biochemical Recurrence in Prostate Cancer Patients Treated with Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy
T2  - JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The benefit of adding sentinel node biopsy (SNB) to extended pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND) remains controversial. The aim of our study was to evaluate biochemical recurrence (BCR) after robot assisted radical prostatectomy and ePLND in prostate cancer patients, stratified by the application of SNB. The results were compared with the predictions of the updated Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center nomogram. Methods: Between January 2006 and November 2016, 920 patients underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and ePLND with or without SNB (184 and 736 patients, respectively). BCR was defined as 2 consecutive prostate specific antigen rises of at least 0.2 ng/mL. The Kaplan Meier method and Cox regression analyses were used to identify predictors of BCR. Results: Median follow-up was 28 mo (interquartile range, 13-56.7 mo). The 5-y BCR-free survival rate was 80.5% and 69.9% in the ePLND+SNB and ePLND groups, respectively. At multivariate analysis, prostate-specific antigen level, primary Gleason grade greater than 3, seminal vesicle invasion, and higher number of removed and positive nodes were independent predictors of BCR in the ePLND group. In the ePLND+SNB group, only the number of positive nodes was an independent predictor of BCR. The overall accuracy of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center nomogram was higher in the ePLND+SNB than in the ePLND group. However, the nomogram was underestimating the probability of BCR-free status in the ePLND+SNB group, whereas the ePLND group was performing as predicted. Conclusion: Adding SNB to ePLND improves BCR-free survival, although the precise explanation of this observation remains speculative. Our results should be interpreted cautiously, given the nonrandomized nature and the selection bias of the study.

TI  - Prognostic role of histological regression in primary cutaneous melanoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The prognostic significance of histological regression in primary melanoma has been debated for many years. We aim to review the evidence to see how histological regression may affect prognosis. A systematic review was performed by searching in MEDLINE, Scopus and the Cochrane Library from 1 January 1966 to 1 August 2015. All studies reporting hazard ratios or data on survival and histological regression were included. Primary random-effects meta-analyses were used to summarize outcome measures. Heterogeneity was assessed using the (2)-test and I-2-statistic. To assess the potential bias of small studies we used funnel plots and the Begg and Mazumdar adjusted rank correlation method. Summaries of survival outcomes were measured as hazard ratios or relative risk of death at 5 years according to the presence of histological regression of primary melanoma. In total, 183 articles were reviewed out of 1876 retrieved. Ten studies comprising 8557 patients were included. Patients with histological regression had a lower relative risk of death (077, 95% confidence interval 061-097) than those without. Examination of the funnel plot did not provide evidence of publication bias. The results showed that histological regression is a protective factor for survival.What's already known about this topic?The prognostic significance of histological regression in primary melanoma has been debated for many years. No robust data are reported on the prognostic value of histological regression.What does this study add?The results of this meta-analysis may be useful when looking at histological regression in a melanoma. Histological regression may be considered a favourable prognostic factor, probably linked to early activation of the host immune system against the tumour.

TI  - An Open-Boundary Locally Weighted Dynamic Time Warping Method for Cropland Mapping
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes an open-boundary locally weighted dynamic time warping (OLWDTW) method using MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time-series data for cropland recognition. The method solves the problem of flexible planting times for crops in Southeast Asia, which has sufficient thermal and water conditions. For NDVI time series starting at the beginning of the year and terminating at the end of the year, the method can separate the non-growing season cycle and growing season cycle for crops. The non-growing season cycle may provide some useful information for crop recognition, such as soil conditions. However, the shape of the growing season's NDVI time series for crops is the key to separating cropland from other land cover types because the shape contains all of the crop growth information. The principle of the OLWDTW method is to enhance the effects of the growing season cycle on the NDVI time series by adding a local weight to the growing season when comparing the similarity of time series based on the open-boundary dynamic time warping (DTW) method. Experiments with two satellite datasets located near the Khorat Plateau in the Lower Mekong Basin validate that OLWDTW effectively improves the precision of cropland recognition compared to a non-weighted open-boundary DTW method in terms of overall accuracy. The method's classification accuracy on cropland exceeds the non-weighted open-boundary DTW by 5-7%. In future studies, an open-boundary self-adaption locally weighted DTW and a more effective combination rule for different crop types should be explored for the method's best performance and highest extraction accuracy for cropland.

TI  - Low-Frequency SAR Radiometric Calibration and Antenna Pattern Estimation by Using Stable Point Targets
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) calibration for low-frequency missions by means of stable point targets is presented. Calibration at low frequency involves the absolute radiometric calibration, the antenna pattern and pointing characterization and validation, and the distortion system parameters' estimation. The use of traditional instrumentation, such as a polarimetric active radar calibrator, a corner reflector, or an active transponder, may be costly and can reduce the time the instrument is used for operational acquisitions. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the potentiality in calibration of point targets for which the radar cross section and the time stability have been characterized. Given a calibration site, once that a set of the stable point targets have been detected by the analysis of an interferometric stack of SAR acquisitions, they may be used as passive calibrators for the validation of radiometry, elevation antenna pattern, and pointing estimation. We show that, although less targets are expected to be found in P-or L-band than in C-or X-band, a sufficient amount (about 250 targets per acquisition) can provide an accuracy in antenna pattern estimation of about 0.04 dB, if the target accuracy is 0.1 dB at 1 sigma

TI  - An Improved Dimidiated Pixel Model for Vegetation Fraction in the Yarlung Zangbo River Basin of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The vegetation fraction is a key factor used in many research fields, including soil and water conservation, and ecological evaluation. In this paper, based on the traditional dimidiated pixel model, NDVI soil extraction is modified to improve the accuracy of the vegetation fraction obtained, thus also providing an improved method for obtaining vegetation factors in other areas of research. Due to the unique regional location of the Yarlung Zangbo River basin, terrain factors are critical for the stability of vegetation change. The improved model is here applied to inverse the vegetation coverage of the study region; the spatial patterns of change intensity during the past 15 years (1998-2012) are then analyzed. Considering the area's alpine climate, results show that terrain factors have a significant effect on the distribution of vegetation coverage change intensity. Before specific thresholds are reached, terrain factors such as elevation, topographic relief, and slope exhibit a positive correlation with change in the vegetation fraction. In areas with the same longitude, the higher the latitude the greater the change intensity, while vegetation change intensity also increases with an increasing variety among the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River. In the river's middle-upper and lower reaches, vegetation coverage is prone to increase and decrease, respectively. The results presented here could greatly enhance the inversion precision of vegetation coverage and reveal the spatial and temporal heterogeneity between vegetation coverage, which are of great ecological significance and practical value for the protection of eco-environment in the Yarlung Zangbo River basin.

TI  - Integrating remote sensing information with crop model to monitor wheat growth and yield based on simulation zone partitioning
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Research into crop growth models at the spatial scale is of great significance for evaluating crop growth, predicting grain yield and studying global climate change. Coupling spatial remote sensing (RS) data can effectively promote the simulation of growth models at spatial scales. However, the integration of RS data and crop models to produce a coupled model based on pixel by pixel requires a large amount of calculations. Simulation zone partitioning is used to separate and cluster the large area into a few relatively uniform zones. Then, the growth model can run on the basis of these units. This method both reflects spatial heterogeneity and avoids repeated simulations of regions with similar attributes, improving the simulation efficiency. In this study, simulation partitioning was performed using soil nutrient indices (organic matter content, total nitrogen content and available potassium content) and corresponding spatial characteristics of wheat growth, as indicated by RS data. A coupled model, integrating RS information and the WheatGrow model, using vegetation indices as the coupling parameters (based on the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm and PROSAIL model), was developed. The aim was to realize accurate prediction of wheat growth parameters and grain yield at the spatial scale. Good zone partitions were obtained by partitioning with the spatial combination of soil nutrient indices and the wheat canopy vegetation index, calculated during the main growth (jointing, heading and filling) stages. The variation coefficients of each index within individual simulation sub-zones were much smaller than those of the indices across the whole area. An analysis of variance showed that the indices were significantly different between the simulation sub-zones, which indicated that appropriate simulated sub-zones had been defined. The minimum root mean square error of the leaf area index, leaf nitrogen accumulation and yield between the predicted values and the values simulated by the coupled model were 0.92, 1.12 g m(-2), and 409.70 kg ha(-1), respectively, which were obtained when the soil-adjusted vegetation index was used as a partitioning zone and assimilating parameter. These results demonstrated that the coupled model of the crop model and RS data, based on the simulation sub-zones had a good prediction accuracy. The results provide important technical support for increasing model efficiency, when crop models need to be applied at the spatial scale.

TI  - Short-term associations of ambient air pollution and cause-specific emergency department visits in Guangzhou, China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Evidence of association of ambient air pollution with cause-specific emergency department visits in China is still limited. This study aimed to investigate short-termassociations between exposures to air pollutants and daily cause-specific emergency department visits using a large-scalemulticenter database involving a total of 65 sentinel hospitals in Guangzhou, the most densely-populated city in south China, during 2013-2015.Material and methods: We obtained data on 162,771 emergency department visits from 65 hospitals from the Emergency Medical Command Center in Guangzhou between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2015. Daily air pollution data on particulatematter (PM) of aerodynamic diameter < 10 and 2.5 mu m (PM10, and PM2.5, respectively), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O-3) were collected from the Daily Quality Report of the Guangzhou Environmental Protection Bureau during the study period. Visits for neurologic, respiratory and circulatory diseases were assessed in relation to air pollutants using Poisson generalized additive models.Results: Mean daily number of emergency department visits for neurologic, respiratory and circulatory diseases was 89, 24 and 35, respectively. After adjustment for other pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2 and O-3), meteorological factors and time-varying confounders, a 7.98-mu g/m(3) (interquartile range) increment in 2-day moving average of same-day and previous-day SO2 concentrations was associated with the statistically significant increase of 4.89% (95% confidence interval: 2.86, 6.95) in neurologic emergency department visits; elevation in SO2 level (per 7.98 mu g/m(3)) was linked to a 5.19% (95% confidence interval: 2.03, 8.44) increase in circulatory emergency department visits. Most positive links were seen during the cold season.Conclusions: The results of this study contribute to the evidence of the significant associations between SO2 and specific neurologic and circulatory conditions, and also provide insight into the planning of clinical services and emergency contingency response for air pollution exposures in Guangzhou.

TI  - Urban Land Cover and Ecosystem Service Changes based on Sentinel-2A MSI and Landsat TM Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainable development in metropolitan regions is challenging in the light of continuous urbanization. Remote sensing provides timely and reliable information on urban areas and their changing patterns. This study's objectives are to evaluate the contribution of Sentinel-2A (S-2A) data to urban ecosystem service mapping and to investigate spatial ecosystem service characteristics with landscape metrics through a novelmethod. Service pattern changes between 2005 and 2015 are mapped for Beijing, China. Landscape metrics are used to qualitatively evaluate urban ecosystem service provision bundle changes. S-2A and Landsat TM data are segmented and classified with SVM, distinguishing three artificial and four natural classes based on ecosystem function. Spatial characteristics influencing ecosystem services are quantified with seven landscape metrics. Beijing's urban development is characterized by reduction in agricultural areas in the urban fringe in favor of built-up areas, urban green space, and golf courses. A transformation of old suburban agglomerations into urban green space can be observed. The planar increase in urban areas is accompanied by the creation of managed urban green space. Service bundles based on land cover classes and spatial characteristics decreased more than 30% for bundles that represent food supply, noise reduction, waste treatment, and global climate regulation. Temperature regulation/moderation of climate extremes, recreation/place values/social cohesion, and aesthetic benefits/cognitive development are least affected. This new approach of extending the ecosystem service concept through integration of spatial characteristics of ecosystem service provisional patches through landscape metrics is believed to give a more realistic appraisal of ecosystem services in urban areas.

TI  - Evaluation of Multi-Frequency SAR Images for Tropical Land Cover Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth Observation (EO) data plays a major role in supporting surveying compliance of several multilateral environmental treaties, such as UN-REDD+ (United Nations Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation). In this context, land cover maps of remote sensing data are the most commonly used EO products and development of adequate classification strategies is an ongoing research topic. However, the availability of meaningful multispectral data sets can be limited due to cloud cover, particularly in the tropics. In such regions, the use of SAR systems (Synthetic Aperture Radar), which are nearly independent form weather conditions, is particularly promising. With an ever-growing number of SAR satellites, as well as the increasing accessibility of SAR data, potentials for multi-frequency remote sensing are becoming numerous. In our study, we evaluate the synergistic contribution of multitemporal L-, C-, and X-band data to tropical land cover mapping. We compare classification outcomes of ALOS-2, RADARSAT-2, and TerraSAR-X datasets for a study site in the Brazilian Amazon using a wrapper approach. After preprocessing and calculation of GLCM texture (Grey Level Co-Occurence), the wrapper utilizes Random Forest classifications to estimate scene importance. Comparing the contribution of different wavelengths, ALOS-2 data perform best in terms of overall classification accuracy, while the classification of TerraSAR-X data yields higher accuracies when compared to the results achieved by RADARSAT-2. Moreover, the wrapper underlines potentials of multi-frequency classification as integration of multi-frequency images is always preferred over multi-temporal, mono-frequent composites. We conclude that, despite distinct advantages of certain sensors, for land cover classification, multi-sensoral integration is beneficial.

T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Grounding line of a glacier or ice shelf where ice bottom meets the ocean is sensitive to changes in the polar environment. Recent rapid changes of grounding lines have been observed especially in southwestern Antarctica due to global warming. In this study, ERS-1/2 and Sentinel-1A Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image were interferometrically acquired in 1996 and 2015, respectively, to monitor the movement of the grounding line in the western part of Ronne Ice Shelf near the Antarctic peninsula. Double-Differential Interferometric SAR (DDInSAR) technique was applied to remove gravitational flow signal to detect grounding line from the interferometric phase due to the vertical displacement of the tide. The result showed that ERS-1/2 grounding lines are almost consistent with those from Rignot et al. (2011) which used the similar dataset, confirming the credibility of the data processing. The comparison of ERS-1/2 and Sentinle-1A DDInSAR images showed a grounding line retreat of 1.0 +/- 0.1 km from 1996 to 2015. It is also proved that the grounding lines based on the 2004 MODIS Mosaic of Antarctica (MOA) images and digital elevation model searching for ice plain near coastal area (Scambos et al., 2017), is not accurate enough especially where there is a ice plain with no tidal motion.

TI  - Estimation of built-up and green volume using geospatial techniques: A case study of Surabaya, Indonesia
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban indicators are important for communicating relevant information to land planners. Traditionally, the intensity and spatial pattern of urban land use are analyzed laterally using the two-dimensional approach. The availability of geospatial data such as those from remote sensing satellite imageries and digital surface models introduces a third dimension in urban analysis, namely urban volume. Thus, an urban volume indicator is applied to quantify built-up volume and green volume of a big Indonesian city using geospatial techniques, including remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS). Surabaya is selected as a case study since the city has grown significantly in terms of both population and capital investment in this decade. We examined the clustering pattern of low and high green volume by performing hot and cold spot analysis. The results indicate that the average built-up volume reaches 173.05 m(3)/pixel, represented by a residential single house of less than 7 m in height. The average green volume is 14.74 m(3)/pixel, characterized by vegetation of 0.6-1 m in height, mostly found in the backyards of houses. The ratio of green volume to built-up volume is small (8.52%, or 0.085 m(3) green volume per 1 m(3) built-up volume). The Kebun Binatang Surabaya Park has been classified as a hot spot area for green volume (highly clustered pixels with high green volume). The areas classified as cold spots are mostly with low green volume and a scattered/low-clustering pattern. There is a huge imbalance between built-up volume and green volume, the latter being much lower, indicating that there is a need for more green spaces and higher green volume. Overall, this study can be used as a reference for future development initiatives that could help improve living conditions in the city through greening programs in the context of sustainable urban development.

TI  - Simulation and Analysis of the Topographic Effects on Snow-Free Albedo over Rugged Terrain
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Topography complicates the modeling and retrieval of land surface albedo due to shadow effects and the redistribution of incident radiation. Neglecting topographic effects may lead to a significant bias when estimating land surface albedo over a single slope. However, for rugged terrain, a comprehensive and systematic investigation of topographic effects on land surface albedo is currently ongoing. Accurately estimating topographic effects on land surface albedo over a rugged terrain presents a challenge in remote sensing modeling and applications. In this paper, we focused on the development of a simplified estimation method for snow-free albedo over a rugged terrain at a 1-km scale based on a 30-m fine-scale digital elevation model (DEM). The proposed method was compared with the radiosity approach based on simulated and real DEMs. The results of the comparison showed that the proposed method provided adequate computational efficiency and satisfactory accuracy simultaneously. Then, the topographic effects on snow-free albedo were quantitatively investigated and interpreted by considering the mean slope, subpixel aspect distribution, solar zenith angle, and solar azimuth angle. The results showed that the more rugged the terrain and the larger the solar illumination angle, the more intense the topographic effects were on black-sky albedo (BSA). The maximum absolute deviation (MAD) and the maximum relative deviation (MRD) of the BSA over a rugged terrain reached 0.28 and 85%, respectively, when the SZA was 60 degrees for different terrains. Topographic effects varied with the mean slope, subpixel aspect distribution, SZA and SAA, which should not be neglected when modeling albedo.

TI  - Quantification of Rotavirus Diarrheal Risk Due to Hydroclimatic Extremes Over South Asia: Prospects of Satellite-Based Observations in Detecting Outbreaks
T2  - GEOHEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Rotavirus is the most common cause of diarrheal disease among children under 5. Especially in South Asia, rotavirus remains the leading cause of mortality in children due to diarrhea. As climatic extremes and safe water availability significantly influence diarrheal disease impacts in human populations, hydroclimatic information can be a potential tool for disease preparedness. In this study, we conducted a multivariate temporal and spatial assessment of 34 climate indices calculated from ground and satellite Earth observations to examine the role of temperature and rainfall extremes on the seasonality of rotavirus transmission in Bangladesh. We extracted rainfall data from the Global Precipitation Measurement and temperature data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer sensors to validate the analyses and explore the potential of a satellite-based seasonal forecasting model. Our analyses found that the number of rainy days and nighttime temperature range from 16 degrees C to 21 degrees C are particularly influential on the winter transmission cycle of rotavirus. The lower number of wet days with suitable cold temperatures for an extended time accelerates the onset and intensity of the outbreaks. Temporal analysis over Dhaka also suggested that water logging during monsoon precipitation influences rotavirus outbreaks during a summer transmission cycle. The proposed model shows lag components, which allowed us to forecast the disease outbreaks 1 to 2 months in advance. The satellite data-driven forecasts also effectively captured the increased vulnerability of dry-cold regions of the country, compared to the wet-warm regions.

TI  - Landslide Mapping and Assessment by Integrating Landsat-8, PALSAR-2 and GIS Techniques: A Case Study from Kelantan State, Peninsular Malaysia
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Integration of satellite remote sensing data and GIS techniques is an applicable approach for landslide mapping and assessment in highly vegetated regions with a tropical climate. In recent years, there have been many severe flooding and landslide events with significant damage to livestock, agricultural crop, homes, and businesses in the Kelantan river basin, Peninsular Malaysia. In this investigation, Landsat-8 and phased array type L-band synthetic aperture radar-2 (PALSAR-2) datasets and analytical hierarchy process (AHP) approach were used to map landslide in Kelantan river basin, Peninsular Malaysia. Landslides were determined by tracking changes in vegetation pixel data using Landsat-8 images that acquired before and after flooding. The PALSAR-2 data were used for comprehensive analysis of major geological structures and detailed characterizations of lineaments in the state of Kelantan. AHP approach was used for landslide susceptibility mapping. Several factors such as slope, aspect, soil, lithology, normalized difference vegetation index, land cover, distance to drainage, precipitation, distance to fault, and distance to the road were extracted from remotely sensed data and fieldwork to apply AHP approach. The excessive rainfall during the flood episode is a paramount factor for numerous landslide occurrences at various magnitudes, therefore, rainfall analysis was carried out based on daily precipitation before and during flood episode in the Kelantan state. The main triggering factors for landslides are mainly due to the extreme precipitation rate during the flooding period, apart from the favorable environmental factors such as removal of vegetation within slope areas, and also landscape development near slopes. Two main outputs of this study were landslide inventory occurrences map during 2014 flooding episode and landslide susceptibility map for entire Kelantan state. Modeled/predicted landslides with a susceptible map generated prior and post-flood episode, confirmed that intense rainfall throughout Kelantan has contributed to produce numerous landslides with various sizes. It is concluded that precipitation is the most influential factor for landslide event. According to the landslide susceptibility map, 65% of the river basin of Kelantan is found to be under the category of low landslide susceptibility zone, while 35% class in a high-altitude segment of the south and south-western part of the Kelantan state located within high susceptibility zone. Further actions and caution need to be remarked by the local related authority of the Kelantan state in very high susceptibility zone to avoid further wealth and people loss in the future. Geo-hazard mitigation programs must be conducted in the landslide recurrence regions for reducing natural catastrophes leading to loss of financial investments and death in the Kelantan river basin. This investigation indicates that integration of Landsat-8 and PALSAR-2 remotely sensed data and GIS techniques is an applicable tool for Landslide mapping and assessment in tropical environments.

TI  - Good guests and obnoxious gringos: Cosmopolitan ideals among North American migrants to Cuenca, Ecuador
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CULTURAL SOCIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article develops an empirical study of the cosmopolitan ideals of North American lifestyle migrants in Cuenca, Ecuador. It is meant as a corrective to existing studies, which often perceive cosmopolitanism to be a disposition, worldview, or cultural condition, but miss the importance of transnational and cosmopolitan cultural beliefs that emerge in novel ways within the new cultural fields constituted by lifestyle migration and that may significantly reconfigure status and economic class relations. In addition, it extends our empirical knowledge of North American cultural codes as they migrate to an international setting. North Americans in Ecuador express desire for cross-cultural contact and integration, and demonstrate this through a number of practices that serve to demarcate legitimate from illegitimate forms of transnational mobility. This legitimate form of transnationalism is painted in sharp relief from the profane 'obnoxious gringo, 'who 'should go back where they came from.' These discourses emerge from North American cultural beliefs about travel and transnationalism, as well as from North American attitudes towards migration from low-income countries to the United States and Canada.

TI  - Adaptive Component Selection-Based Discriminative Model for Object Detection in High-Resolution SAR Imagery
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes an innovative Adaptive Component Selection-Based Discriminative Model (ACSDM) for object detection in high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. In order to explore the structural relationships between the target and the components, a multi-scale detector consisting of a root filter and several part filters is established, using Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) features to describe the object from different resolutions. To make the detected components of practical significance, the size and anchor position of each component are determined through statistical methods. When training the root model and the corresponding part models, manual annotation is adopted to label the target in the training set. Besides, a penalty factor is introduced to compensate information loss in preprocessing. In the detection stage, the Small Area-Based Non-Maximum Suppression (SANMS) method is utilised for filtering out duplicate results. In the experiments, the aeroplanes in TerraSAR-X SAR images are detected by the ACSDM algorithm and different comparative methods. The results indicate that the proposed method has a lower false alarm rate and can detect the components accurately.

TI  - Monitoring Rice Phenology Based on Backscattering Characteristics of Multi-Temporal RADARSAT-2 Datasets
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation and monitoring of rice phenology is necessary for the management and yield prediction of rice. The radar backscattering coefficient, one of the most direct and accessible parameters has been proved to be capable of retrieving rice growth parameters. This paper aims to investigate the possibility of monitoring the rice phenology (i.e., transplanting, vegetative, reproductive, and maturity) using the backscattering coefficients or their simple combinations of multi-temporal RADARSAT-2 datasets only. Four RADARSAT-2 datasets were analyzed at 30 sample plots in Meishan City, Sichuan Province, China. By exploiting the relationships of the backscattering coefficients and their combinations versus the phenology of rice, HH/VV, VV/VH, and HH/VH ratios were found to have the greatest potential for phenology monitoring. A decision tree classifier was applied to distinguish the four phenological phases, and the classifier was effective. The validation of the classifier indicated an overall accuracy level of 86.2%. Most of the errors occurred in the vegetative and reproductive phases. The corresponding errors were 21.4% and 16.7%, respectively.

TI  - Radar Network-Based Detection of Mesocyclones at the German Weather Service
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The radar network of the German Weather Service [Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD)] provides 3D Doppler data in high spatial and temporal resolution, supporting the identification and tracking of dynamic small-scale weather phenomena. The software framework Polarimetric Radar Algorithms (POLARA) has been developed at DWD to better exploit the capabilities of the existing remote sensing data. The data processing and quality assurance implemented in POLARA include a dual-PRF dealiasing algorithm with error correction. Azimuthal shear information is derived and processed in the mesocyclone detection algorithm (MCD). Low-and midlevel azimuthal shear and track products are available as composite (multiradar) products. Azimuthal shear may be considered as a proxy for rotation. The MCD results and azimuthal shear products are part of the severe weather detection algorithms of DWD and are provided to the forecaster on the NinJo meteorological workstation system. The forecaster analyzes potentially severe cells by combining near-storm environment data with the MCD product as well as with the instantaneous azimuthal shear products (mid-and low level) and their tracks. These products and tracks are used to diagnose threat potential by means of azimuthal shear intensity and track longevity. Feedback from forecasters has shown the utility of the algorithms to analyze and diagnose severe convective cells in Germany and in adjacent Europe. In this paper, the abovementioned algorithms and products are presented in detail and case studies illustrating usability and performance are shown.

TI  - Targeting Sentinel Proteins and Extrasynaptic Glutamate Receptors: a Therapeutic Strategy for Preventing the Effects Elicited by Perinatal Asphyxia?
T2  - NEUROTOXICITY RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Perinatal asphyxia (PA) is a relevant cause of death at the time of labour, and when survival is stabilised, associated with short- and long-term developmental disabilities, requiring inordinate care by health systems and families. Its prevalence is high (1 to 10/1000 live births) worldwide. At present, there are few therapeutic options, apart from hypothermia, that regrettably provides only limited protection if applied shortly after the insult.PA implies a primary and a secondary insult. The primary insult relates to the lack of oxygen, and the secondary one to the oxidative stress triggered by re-oxygenation, formation of reactive oxygen (ROS) and reactive nitrogen (RNS) species, and overactivation of glutamate receptors and mitochondrial deficiencies. PA induces overactivation of a number of sentinel proteins, including hypoxia-induced factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) and the genome-protecting poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1). Upon activation, PARP-1 consumes high amounts of ATP at a time when this metabolite is scarce, worsening in turn the energy crisis elicited by asphyxia. The energy crisis also impairs ATP-dependent transport, including glutamate re-uptake by astroglia. Nicotinamide, a PARP-1 inhibitor, protects against the metabolic cascade elicited by the primary stage, avoiding NAD(+) exhaustion and the energetic crisis. Upon re-oxygenation, however, oxidative stress leads to nuclear translocation of the NF-kappa B subunit p65, overexpression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha, and glutamate-excitotoxicity, due to impairment of glial-glutamate transport, extracellular glutamate overflow, and overactivation of NMDA receptors, mainly of the extrasynaptic type. This leads to calcium influx, mitochondrial impairment, and inactivation of antioxidant enzymes, increasing further the activity of pro-oxidant enzymes, thereby making the surviving neonate vulnerable to recurrent metabolic insults whenever oxidative stress is involved. Here, we discuss evidence showing that (i) inhibition of PARP-1 overactivation by nicotinamide and (ii) inhibition of extrasynaptic NMDA receptor overactivation by memantine can prevent the short- and long-term consequences of PA. These hypotheses have been evaluated in a rat preclinical model of PA, aiming to identify the metabolic cascades responsible for the long-term consequences induced by the insult, also assessing postnatal vulnerability to recurrent oxidative insults. Thus, we present and discuss evidence demonstrating that PA induces long-term changes in metabolic pathways related to energy and oxidative stress, priming vulnerability of cells with both the neuronal and the glial phenotype. The effects induced by PA are region dependent, the substantia nigra being particularly prone to cell death. The issue of short- and long-term consequences of PA provides a framework for addressing a fundamental issue referred to plasticity of the CNS, since the perinatal insult triggers a domino-like sequence of events making the developing individual vulnerable to recurrent adverse conditions, decreasing his/her coping repertoire because of a relevant insult occurring at birth.

TI  - Evaluating the Practice and Outcomes of Applying Regenerative Development to a Large-Scale Project in Victoria, Australia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Regenerative development is one of the critical pathways or processes towards an ecological worldview and a built environment in synergy with the natural environment. This vision aims to restore and support environmental, social and economic flows from a systems perspective. While regenerative development has been discussed in theory and applied to some projects, very few studies have analysed the processes that support its emergence. Our study investigates the design process of an ongoing development project, "Seacombe West" in Victoria, Australia. It evaluates the design outputs, using the LENSES Framework (Living Environments in Natural, Social, and Economic Systems) which is specifically designed to facilitate the emergence of regenerative development thinking. The project included a series of four workshops that led to a set of guidelines that in turn were used to design a masterplan. We evaluate the resulting guidelines, the masterplan, and the experience of the participants through an online survey (70% response rate) and semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders. Our results show that using LENSES encouraged systems thinking and helps facilitate a transdisciplinary approach towards regenerative development. This evaluation provides insights into how regenerative development can emerge in projects and how the potential for net benefit can be embedded.

T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates various types of neutral density features developed in the cusp region during magnetically active and quiet times. Multi-instrument Challenging Minisatellite Payload data provide neutral density, electron temperature, neutral wind speed, and small-scale field-aligned current (SS-FAC) values. Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment neutral density data are also employed. During active times, cusp densities or density spikes appeared with their underlying flow channels (FCs) and enhanced SS-FACs implying upwelling, fueled by Joule heating, within/above FCs. Both the moderate nightside cusp enhancements under disturbed conditions and the minor dayside cusp enhancements under quiet conditions developed without any underlying FC and enhanced SS-FACs implying the role of particle precipitation in their development. Observations demonstrate the relations of FCs, density spikes, and upwelling-related divergent flows and their connections to the underlying (1) dayside magnetopause reconnection depositing magnetospheric energy into the high-latitude region and (2) Joule heating-driven disturbance dynamo effects. Results provide observational evidence that the moderate nightside cusp enhancements and the minor dayside cusp enhancements detected developed due to direct heating by weak particle precipitation. Chemical compositions related to the dayside density spike and low cusp densities are modeled by Naval Research Laboratory Mass Spectrometer Incoherent Scatter Radar Extended 2000. Modeled composition outputs for the dayside density spike's plasma environment depict some characteristic upwelling signatures. Oppositely, in the case of low dayside cusp densities, composition outputs show opposite characteristics due to the absence of upwelling.

TI  - Estimation of the Land Surface Temperature over the Tibetan Plateau by Using Chinese FY-2C Geostationary Satellite Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - During the process of land-atmosphere interaction, one of the essential parameters is the land surface temperature (LST). The LST has high temporal variability, especially in its diurnal cycle, which cannot be acquired by polar-orbiting satellites. Therefore, it is of great practical significance to retrieve LST data using geostationary satellites. According to the data of FengYun 2C (FY-2C) satellite and the measurements from the Enhanced Observing Period (CEOP) of the Asia-Australia Monsoon Project (CAMP) on the Tibetan Plateau (CAMP/Tibet), a regression approach was utilized in this research to optimize the split window algorithm (SWA). The thermal infrared data obtained by the Chinese geostationary satellite FY-2C over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) was used to estimate the hourly LST time series. To decrease the effects of cloud, the 10-day composite hourly LST data were obtained through the approach of maximal value composite (MVC). The derived LST was used to compare with the product of MODIS LST and was also validated by the field observation. The results show that the LST retrieved through the optimized SWA and in situ data has a better consistency (with correlation coefficient (R), mean absolute error (MAE), mean bias (MB), and root mean square error (RMSE) values of 0.987, 1.91 K, 0.83 K and 2.26 K, respectively) than that derived from Becker and Li's SWA and MODIS LST product, which means that the modified SWA can be applied to achieve plateau-scale LST. The diurnal variation of the LST and the hourly time series of the LST over the Tibetan Plateau were also obtained. The diurnal range of LST was found to be clearly affected by the influence of the thawing and freezing process of soil and the summer monsoon evolution. The comparison between the seasonal and diurnal variations of LST at four typical underlying surfaces over the TP indicate that the variation of LST is closely connected with the underlying surface types as well. The diurnal variation of LST is the smallest at the water (5.12 K), second at the snow and ice (5.45 K), third at the grasslands (19.82 K) and largest at the barren or sparsely vegetated (22.83 K).

TI  - NASA's MODIS and VIIRS Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity Products: A Long-Term and Consistent Earth System Data Record
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature and emissivity (LST&E) determine the total amount of upward long-wave infrared radiation emitted from the Earth's surface, making them key variables in a wide range of studies, including climate variability, land cover/use change, and the energy balance between the land and the atmosphere. LST&E products are currently produced on a routine basis using data from the MODIS instruments on the NASA EOS platforms and by the VIIRS instrument on the Suomi-NPP platform that serves as a bridge between NASA EOS and the nextgeneration JPSS platforms. Two new NASA LST&E products for MODIS (MxD21) and VIIRS (VNP21) will be produced during 2017 using a new approach that addresses discrepancies in accuracy and consistency between the current suite of MODIS and VIIRS LST split-window-based products. The new approach uses a temperature emissivity separation (TES) algorithm, originally developed for the ASTER instrument, to physically retrieve both LST and spectral emissivity consistently for both sensors with high accuracy and well-defined uncertainties. This study demonstrates continuity between the new MYD21 and VNP21 LST products at the <+/- 0.5 K level, with differences that are invariant to environmental conditions and land cover type. Furthermore, MYD21 and VNP21 retrieved emissivities matched closely in magnitude and temporal variation to within 1%-2% over two land validation sites consisting of quartz sands and grassland. Continuity between the new suite of MODIS and VIIRS LST&E products will ensure a consistent and well-characterized long-term LST&E data record for better monitoring and understanding trends in Earth system behavior.

TI  - Exploration of teacher life stories: Taiwanese history teachers' curricular gatekeeping of controversial public issues
T2  - TEACHING AND TEACHER EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explores teachers' personal practical knowledge and curricular-instructional gatekeeping as they relate to the teaching of contemporary controversial public issues in Taiwan (e.g., national identity, sovereignty, and ethnic issues). Using a case study design, this study documents how six social studies teachers make curricular decisions about teaching controversial public issues by making use of their personal practical knowledge. Findings illuminate that personal practical knowledge plays a role in teacher's curricular-instructional gate keeping in socially divisive contexts. In sum, this study, refracted through the national context of Taiwan, helps us understand the relationship between a teacher's own imaginative worldview, their sense of personal and professional identity, and their classroom teaching practices.

TI  - Incorporation of Stem Water Content into Vegetation Optical Depth for Crops and Woodlands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of vegetation water content (VWC) by optical remote sensing improves soil moisture retrievals from passive microwave radiometry. For a variety of vegetation types, the largest unknown for predicting VWC is stem water content, which is assumed to be allometrically related to the water content of the plant canopy. For maize and soybean, measured stem water contents were highly correlated to canopy water contents, so VWC was calculated directly from the normalized difference infrared index (NDII), which contrasts scattering at near-infrared wavelengths with absorption of shortwave infrared wavelengths by liquid water. Woodland tree height is linearly related to woody stem volume, and hence to stem water content. We hypothesized that tree height is positively correlated with canopy water content, and thus with NDII. Airborne color-infrared imagery was acquired at two study areas in a mixed agricultural and woodland landscape, and photogrammetric structure-from-motion point clouds were derived to estimate tree heights. However, estimated tree heights were only weakly correlated with measured data acquired for validation. NDII was calculated from Landsat 8 Operational Line Imager (30-m pixel) and WorldView-3 (7.5 m pixel); but contrary to the hypothesis, NDII was not correlated with woodland tree height. Lastly, the interaction of woodland and crops stem water contents on total VWC in a mixed landscape were simulated for 2 days, one in the early summer and one in the late summer. VWC for the region varied from 2.5 to 3.0 kg m(-2), which was just under a threshold for accuracy for soil moisture retrievals using Coriolis WindSat. Woodland tree height should be included as an ancillary data set along with land cover classification for soil moisture retrieval algorithms.

TI  - Morphodynamics of the Kulsi River Basin in the northern front of Shillong Plateau: Exhibiting episodic inundation and channel migration
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study is undertaken in the Kulsi River valley, a tributary of the Brahmaputra River that drains through the tectonically active Shillong Plateau in northeast India. Based on the fluvial geomorphic parameters and Landsat satellite images, it has been observed that the Kulsi River migrated 0.7-2 km westward in its middle course in the past 30 years. Geomorphic parameters such as longitudinal profile analysis, stream length gradient index (SL), ratio of valley floor width to valley height (Vf), steepness index (k(s)) indicate that the upstream segment of the Kulsi River is tectonically more active than the downstream segment which is ascribed to the tectonic activities along the Guwahati Fault. C-14 ages obtained from the submerged tree trunks of the Chandubi Lake, which is located in the central part of the Kulsi River catchment suggests inundation (high lake levels) during 160 +/- 50 AD, 970 +/- 50 AD, 1190 +/- 80 AD and 1520 +/- 30 AD, respectively. These periods broadly coincide with the late Holocene strengthened Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM), Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and the early part of the Little Ice Age (LIA). The debris which clogged the course of the river in the vicinity of the Chandubi Lake is attributed to tectonically induced increase in sediment supply during high magnitude flooding events.

TI  - The Correlation Coefficient as a Simple Tool for the Localization of Errors in Spectroscopic Imaging Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The correlation coefficient (CC) was substantiated as a simple, yet robust statistical tool in the quality assessment of hyperspectral imaging (HSI) data. The sensitivity of the metric was also characterized with respect to artificially-induced errors. The CC was found to be sensitive to spectral shifts and single feature modifications in hyperspectral ground data despite the high, artificially-induced, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 100:1. The study evaluated eight airborne hyperspectral images that varied in acquisition spectrometer, acquisition date and processing methodology. For each image, we identified a uniform ground target region of interest (ROI) that was comprised of a single asphalt road pixel from each column within the sensor field-of-view (FOV). A CC was calculated between the spectra from each of the pixels in the ROI and the data from the center pixel. Potential errors were located by reductions in the CCs below a designated threshold, which was derived from the results of the sensitivity tests. The spectral range associated with each error was established using a windowing technique where the CCs were recalculated after removing the spectral data within various windows. Errors were isolated in the spectral window that removed the previously-identified reductions in the CCs. Finer errors were detected by calculating the CCs across the ROI in the spectral range surrounding various atmospheric absorption features. Despite only observing deviations in the CCs from the 3rd-6th decimal places, non-trivial errors were detected in the imagery. An error was detected within a single band of the shortwave infrared imagery. Errors were also observed throughout the visible-near-infrared imagery, especially in the blue end. With this methodology, it was possible to immediately gauge the spectral consistency of the HSI data across the FOV. Consequently, the effectiveness of various processing methodologies and the spectral consistency of the imaging spectrometers themselves could be studied. Overall, the research highlights the utility of the CC as a simple, low monetary cost, analytical tool for the localization of errors in spectroscopic imaging data.

TI  - Ethical Concerns About Human Genetic Enhancement in the Malay Science Fiction Novels
T2  - SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING ETHICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Advancements in science and technology have not only brought hope to humankind to produce disease-free offspring, but also offer possibilities to genetically enhance the next generation's traits and capacities. Human genetic enhancement, however, raises complex ethical questions, such as to what extent should it be allowed? It has been a great challenge for humankind to develop robust ethical guidelines for human genetic enhancement that address both public concerns and needs. We believe that research about public concerns is necessary prior to developing such guidelines, yet the issues have not been thoroughly investigated in many countries, including Malaysia. Since the novel often functions as a medium for the public to express their concerns, this paper explores ethical concerns about human genetic enhancement expressed in four Malay science fiction novels namely Klon, Leksikon Ledang, Transgenesis Bisikan Rimba and Transgenik Sifar. Religion has a strong influence on the worldview of the Malays therefore some concerns such as playing God are obviously religious. Association of the negative image of scientists as well as the private research companies with the research on human genetic enhancement reflects the authors' concerns about the main motivations for conducting such research and the extent to which such research will benefit society.

TI  - Development of a support vector machine based cloud detection method for MODIS with the adjustability to various conditions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Common requirements for cloud detection methods including the adjustability with respect to incorrect results are clarified, and a method is proposed that satisfies the requirements by applying the support vector machine (SVM). Because the conditions of clouds and Earth's surfaces vary widely, incorrect results in actual cloud detection operations are unavoidable. Cloud detection methods therefore should be adjustable to easily reduce the frequency of incorrect results under certain conditions, without causing new incorrect results under other conditions. Cloud detection methods are also required to resolve a characteristic issue: the boundary between clear-sky and cloudy-sky areas in nature is vague, because the density of the cloud particles continuously varies. This vagueness makes the cloud definition subjective. Furthermore, the training dataset preparation for machine learning should avoid circular arguments. The SVM learning is generally less likely to result in overfitting: this study suggests that only typical data are sufficient for the SVM training dataset. By incorporating the discriminant analysis (DA), it is possible to subjectively determine the definition of typical cloudy and clear sky and to obtain typical cloud data without direct cloud detection. In an approach to adjust the classifier, data typical of certain conditions that lead to incorrect results are added to the training dataset. In this study, an adjustment procedure is proposed, which quantitatively judges, whether an addition is actually effective for reduction of the frequency of incorrect results. Another approach for the adjustment is improving feature space used for cloud detection. Indices as quantitative guidance to estimate whether an addition or elimination of a feature actually reduces the frequency of incorrect results can be obtained from the analysis of the support vectors. The cloud detection method incorporating the SVM is therefore able to integrate practical adjustment procedures. Applications of this method to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data demonstrate that the concept of the method satisfies the requirements and the adjustability to various conditions can be realized.

TI  - Preoperative Lymphedema-Related Risk Factors in Early-Stage Breast Cancer
T2  - LYMPHATIC RESEARCH AND BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Prolongation of survival in patients with breast cancer due to early diagnosis and modern methods of treatment has turned the attention on lymphedema, which is the most important morbidity secondary to the treatment of the disease. Determination of lymphedema and related risk factors in patients before a surgical intervention may provide protection for patients and early treatment. The aim of this study was to determine the presence of lymphedema before surgery by bioimpedance analysis in patients with breast cancer and to establish risk factors associated with lymphedema.Patients and Methods: A total of 277 patients who were diagnosed as having breast cancer, were planned to undergo a surgical intervention, and had no clinical lymphedema were included in the study. The presence of lymphedema was evaluated with clinical examination, measurement of arm circumference, and bioimpedance analysis.Results: Lymphedema was found in 59 (21.3%) patients with no detected differences in arm circumferences. A significant relationship was found between the presence of lymphedema and body mass index (BMI), number of positive lymph nodes, and capsule invasion of the tumor (p = 0.001, p = 0.003, p = 0.002, respectively). Multiple regression analysis revealed that BMI and the number of positive lymph nodes were independent variables (p = 0.024, p = 0.002). ROC curve analysis resulted in an increased risk of preoperative lymphedema when the number of positive lymph nodes was >= 8. Correlation analysis revealed a positive correlation between the number of positive lymph nodes and L-dex score (p = 0.001, r = 0.219).Conclusion: Preoperative bioimpedance analysis demonstrated that similar to 1/5 of the patients had subclinical lymphedema. Preoperative subclinical lymphedema is associated with obesity and the number of positive lymph nodes, and thus, treatment of the axilla in patients who are preoperatively detected to have subclinical lymphedema should be revised.

TI  - Mapping pasture management in the Brazilian Amazon from dense Landsat time series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Intensification of cattle ranching has the potential to reduce deforestation rates in the Brazilian Amazon by decreasing the demand for new agricultural land. Explicit spatial knowledge on where, when and how pastures are managed and intensification takes place is needed to better estimate potentials of more sustainable management. Monitoring the frequency of management practices like burning of pasture land and tillage treatment with adequate spatial resolution therefore offers novel indicators for describing land use intensity. With dense time series of Landsat data, it appears possible to quantify land use intensity also in heterogeneous landscapes where fine-scale processes cannot be monitored with previously available datasets.Our overarching goal is to describe the occurrence or absence of extensive or intensive management regimes over time. For this study, we focused on detecting fire and tillage events in the region of Novo Progresso, Para, Brazil, where deforested land is mostly used for cattle ranching by both largeholders and smallholders. We used a dense time series of Landsat-7 and Landsat-8 surface reflectance data to mitigate the problem of varying cloud cover. For each acquisition date, we extracted a temporal sequence of three subsequent clear observations at pixel level. The temporal variation in each clear observation sequence was characterized by a stack of spectral and temporal features. These feature stacks were classified with a random forest to identify the management events. We aggregated the classification results based on the random forest class probabilities and derived normalized annual class scores for land management events. The yielded class score maps show burned and tilled areas on a yearly basis and provide a measure of model confidence.We detected burned pastures with area adjusted user accuracies of 80-98%, burned secondary regrowth with 63-80% and tilled pastures with 74-78%. Our approach was able to discriminate management events even when they succeeded very fast. This way, the mapping approach with clear observation sequences allows us to contextualize management events directly from dense time series of high resolution satellite data. This opens new pathways to disentangle how management practices between smallholders and agribusinesses vary in the Brazilian Amazon. With sensor constellations from Sentinel-2 and Landsat data becoming a unified source for much denser time series soon, our method bears great potential to better understand and map pasture dynamics in the Amazon.

TI  - Extending the baseline of tropical dry forest loss in Ghana (1984-2015) reveals drivers of major deforestation inside a protected area
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical dry forests experience the highest deforestation rates on Earth, with major implications for the biodiversity of these ecosystems, as well as for its human occupants. Global remote sensing based forest cover data (2000 2012) point to the rapid loss of tropical dry forest in South America and Africa, also, if not foremost, inside formally protected areas. Here, we significantly extend the baseline of tropical dry forest loss inside a protected area in Ghana using a generalizable change detection technique. The forest cover change detection is based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from historical Landsat data (1984-2015). Field measurements were carried out in dry semi-deciduous forest and in the adjacent savanna and woodland. Estimates of the canopy area index and above ground woody biomass were related to NDVI derived from Landsat 8 data. The change detection indicated significant NDVI decrease in a large area initially covered by tropical dry forest, associated with deforestation. The peak in deforestation was found to have occurred between 1990 and 2002, hereafter, the conservation status of the area was improved. A combination of remote sensing data corroborated by secondary data sources provides evidence for the almost complete clearance of a tropical dry forest inside a strictly protected area, attributable to logging and land clearing for arable farming. The NDVI change detection also revealed NDVI increase in the adjacent woodlands from 2002 to 2015, demonstrating woody encroachment. Historical fire data from the MODIS burned area product indicate that the deforested area experienced a high frequency of anthropogenic burning since 2004, which may have caused further degradation and largely prevents forest regeneration. The results show the ongoing destruction of tropical ecosystems even within ostensibly protected areas and ask for the revision of protection and management strategies of such areas.

TI  - Assessment of hydrologic connectivity in an ungauged wetland with InSAR observations
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Cienaga Grande de Santa Marta (CGSM) is one of the world's most productive tropical wetlands and one that has witnessed some of the greatest recorded dieback of mangroves. Human-driven loss of hydrologic connectivity by roads, artificial channels and water flow regulation appears to be the reason behind mangrove mortality in this ungauged wetland. In this study, we determined the CGSM's current state of hydrologic connectivity by combining a remote sensing technique, termed as Wetland Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), with a hydrologic study of river water discharge. For this research, we processed 29 ALOS-PALSAR acquisitions taken during the period 2007-2011 and generated 66 interferograms that provide information on relative surface water level changes. We found that change in water discharge upstream on the main tributary of the CGSM could explain at most 17% of the variance of the change in water level in the CGSM. Fresh water inputs into the wetland were identified only when the mean daily water discharge in the river exceeded 700m(3) s(-1), which corresponds to only 30% of the days during the period. The interferogram analysis also revealed that artificial channels within the wetland serve as barriers to water flow and contribute to the overall loss in hydrologic connectivity. We recommend increasing fresh water inputs from the Magdalena River by reducing water regulation of fresh water from the river and improving connectivity on either side of the artificial channels crossing the CGSM. This study emphasizes the potential of the application of wetland InSAR to determine hydrologic connectivity in wetlands that are completely or poorly ungauged and to define the necessary guidelines for wetland hydrologic restoration.

AB  - The terms Internet of Things and Big Data are currently subject to much attention, though the specific impact of these terms in our practical lives are difficult to apprehend. Data-driven approaches do lead to new possibilities, and significant improvements within a broad range of domains can be achieved through a cloud-based infrastructure. In the agricultural sector, data-driven precision agriculture shows great potential in facilitating the increase in food production demanded by the increasing world population. However, the adoption rate of precision agriculture technology has been slow, and information and communications technology needed to promote the implementation of precision agriculture is limited by proprietary integrations and non-standardized data formats and connections. In this paper, an open geospatial data infrastructure is presented, based on standards defined by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). The emphasis in the design was on improved interoperability, with the capability of using sensors, performing cloud processing, carrying out regional statistics, and provide seamless connectivity to machine terminals. The infrastructure was implemented through open source software, and was complemented by open data from governmental offices along with ESA satellite imagery. Four use cases are presented, covering analysis of nearly 50 000 crop fields and providing seamless interaction with an emulated machine terminal. They act to showcase both for how the infrastructure enables modularity and interoperability, and for the new possibilities which arise from this new approach to data within the agricultural domain.

TI  - Evaluation of Three Techniques for Correcting the Spatial Scaling Bias of Leaf Area Index
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The correction of spatial scaling bias on the estimate of leaf area index (LAI) retrieved from remotely sensed data is an essential issue in quantitative remote sensing for vegetation monitoring. We analyzed three techniques, including Taylor's theorem (TT), Wavelet-Fractal technique (WF), and Fractal theory (FT), for correcting the scaling bias of LAI with empirical models in different functions (i.e., power, exponential, logarithmic and polynomial) on both simulated data and a real dataset over a cropland site. The results demonstrated that the scaling bias became greater when the model non-linearity increased. The spatial heterogeneity, which was characterized by the class-specific proportion, the between-class spectral difference and the number of classes within each coarse pixel, was found to be the primary factor in the scaling effect. These factors influenced the scaling effect collectively and existed dependently. With the RMSE less than 0.3 x 10(-6) m(2)/m(2), TT was suggested for the correction with a polynomial LAI-NDVI functions. WF was preferred for neighboring scales rather than continuous scales. FT was not recommended for correcting the scaling bias caused by the significant non-linearity in LAI estimation models. This study illustrates the main causes of the scaling effect and provides a reference of technique selection for scaling bias correction to improve the application of remotely sensed estimates.

TI  - CHLOROPHYLL CONCENTRATION DERIVED FROM MICROWAVE REMOTE SENSING MEASUREMENTS USING ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK ALGORITHM
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-TAIWAN
M3  - Article
AB  - Ocean color optic remote sensing has been used to estimate various biogeochemical constituents to monitor ocean environmental changes in coastal regions and global open oceans. However, the most problematic issue in utilizing ocean color measurements is cloud coverage. Thus, this study introduces a neural network (NN) algorithm to derive Chlorophyll a (Chl) concentrations, which are unavailable due to the presence of clouds. Because ocean color remote sensing depends on cloud coverage, microwave measurements, including sea-surface temperature, cloud, water vapor, precipitation, and winds, were used as inputs for the NN algorithm. Accordingly, the NN algorithm was designed to predict Chl using five inputs of microwave measurements and geolocation data. The correlation coefficient and root mean square error between the predicted and remotely sensed Chl concentrations were about 0.89 and 0.30 mg/m(3), respectively. Therefore, the developed NN algorithm enabled us to obtain Chl concentration during cloudy days, and even typhoon passages, as demonstrated in this study. However, Chl concentrations along coastal regions could not be predicted based on the inputs of the NN algorithm. Microwave remote sensing could not measure inhomogeneous emissivity for areas that were partially ocean and land, such as near-coastal regions.

TI  - Authoritarianism, Affective Polarization, and Economic Ideology
T2  - POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - I consider two theories of affective polarization between Democrats and Republicans in the United States: (1) ideological divergence on size-of-government issues (Webster & Abramowitz, ) and (2) authoritarianism-based partisan sorting (Hetherington & Weiler, ). I argue that these alternatives cannot be easily disentangled, because politically engaged citizens seek out and assimilate information about economic policy from elites who are perceived to share their core traits and cultural values. In this way, the economic preferences emphasized by the first view are partly endogenous to the worldview divide emphasized by the second. Elite position taking on economic issues may elicit strong emotions among citizens because it reliably signals a commitment to one worldview or the other. I review new and existing evidence for this claim in both observational survey data and two experimental studies. I also consider the broader implications of these results for the distribution of economic opinion across indicators of human capital.

TI  - A complete map of Greenland ice velocity derived from satellite data collected over 20 years
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - While numerous maps of Greenland ice flow velocity exist, most have gaps in coverage and/or accuracy is limited. We processed a large volume of synthetic aperture radar and Landsat 8 imagery collected between 1995 and 2015 to produce a nearly complete map of ice flow velocity for Greenland at a far greater accuracy than most prior products. We evaluated the accuracy of this map by comparing it with a variety of measured and estimated velocities. For the slow-moving interior of the ice sheet, where estimates are determined from interferometric phase, the errors are similar to 2 m a(-1) or better. For coastal areas, where estimates are determined entirely from speckle-or feature-tracking methods, errors are 2-3 m a(-1), which is in good agreement with the estimated formal errors. Especially for the slow-moving majority of the ice sheet, this map provides an important source of data for numerous types of glaciological studies.

TI  - Integrating System Dynamics and Remote Sensing to Estimate Future Water Usage and Average Surface Runoff in Lagos, Nigeria
T2  - CIVIL ENGINEERING JOURNAL-TEHRAN
M3  - Article
AB  - The goal of this study was twofold; first analyze the patterns of water consumption in Lagos, Nigeria and use them in a System Dynamics (SD) model to make projections about future demand. The second part used remote sensing to quantify the contribution of extensive land use/cover change to urban flooding. Land use/cover dynamics over the past decade was analyzed using satellite imagery provided by Landsat Thematic Mapping (TM). Unsupervised classification was performed with false color composite using the Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis (ISODATA) technique in a Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The study area was divided into four different land use types during image classification: bare land, built-up area, water bodies, and vegetation. For water demand, two different scenarios of population growth including 5.5% and 2.75 % annual increase were considered. The results showed that water demand dropped by 67% of its current value when losses in distribution were reduced by 20% and population annual growth rate kept at 2.75% over the study period. Bare land and water bodies lost 1.31% and 1.61% of their current area respectively while built-up area grew by 1.11%. These changes in land use/cover changes led to a 64% increase in average surface runoff, mostly attributable to increasing surface imperviousness and the absence of an adequate urban drainage system.

TI  - Spatial Upscaling of Sparse Soil Moisture Observations Based on Ridge Regression
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Available ground-based observation networks for the validation of soil moisture remote sensing products are commonly sparse; thus, ground truth determinations are difficult at the validated remote sensing pixel scale. Based on the consistency of temporal trends between ground truth and in situ measurements, it is feasible to estimate ground truth by building a linear relationship between temporal sparse ground observations and truth samples. Herein, auxiliary remote sensing data with a moderate spatial resolution can be transformed into truth samples depending on the stronger representation of remote sensing data to spatial heterogeneity in the validated pixel relative to limited sites. When solving weighting coefficients for the relationship model, the underlying correlations among the in situ measurements cause the multicollinearity problem, leading to failed predictions. An upscaling algorithm called ridge regression (RR) addresses this by introducing a regularization parameter. With sparse sites, the RR method is tested in two cases employing six and nine sites, and compared with the ordinary least squares and the arithmetic mean. The upscaling results of the RR method show higher prediction accuracies compared to the other two methods. When the RR method is used, the six-site case has the same estimation accuracy as the nine-site case due to maintaining the diversity of in situ measurements through the analysis of the ridge trace and variance inflation factor (VIF). Thus, the ridge trace and VIF analysis is considered as the optimal selection method for the existing observation networks if the RR method will be used in future validation work. With a different number of sites, the RR method always displays the best estimation accuracy and is not sensitive to the number of sites, which indicates that the RR method can potentially upscale sparse sites. However, if the sites are too few, e.g., one to four, it is difficult to perform the upscaling method.

TI  - A new NDVI measure that overcomes data sparsity in cloud-covered regions predicts annual variation in ground-based estimates of high arctic plant productivity
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Efforts to estimate plant productivity using satellite data can be frustrated by the presence of cloud cover. We developed a new method to overcome this problem, focussing on the high-arctic archipelago of Svalbard where extensive cloud cover during the growing season can prevent plant productivity from being estimated over large areas. We used a field-based time-series (2000-2009) of live aboveground vascular plant biomass data and a recently processed cloud-free MODIS-Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data set (2000-2014) to estimate, on a pixel-by-pixel basis, the onset of plant growth. We then summed NDVI values from onset of spring to the average time of peak NDVI to give an estimate of annual plant productivity. This remotely sensed productivity measure was then compared, at two different spatial scales, with the peak plant biomass field data. At both the local scale, surrounding the field data site, and the larger regional scale, our NDVI measure was found to predict plant biomass (adjusted R-2 = 0.51 and 0.44, respectively). The commonly used 'maximum NDVI' plant productivity index showed no relationship with plant biomass, likely due to some years having very few cloud-free images available during the peak plant growing season. Thus, we propose this new summed NDVI from onset of spring to time of peak NDVI as a proxy of large-scale plant productivity for regions such as the Arctic where climatic conditions restrict the availability of cloud-free images.

TI  - Characterization of AVHRR global cloud detection sensitivity based on CALIPSO-CALIOP cloud optical thickness information: demonstration of results based on the CM SAF CLARA-A2 climate data record
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The sensitivity in detecting thin clouds of the cloud screening method being used in the CM SAF cloud, albedo and surface radiation data set from AVHRR data (CLARA-A2) cloud climate data record (CDR) has been evaluated using cloud information from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) onboard the CALIPSO satellite. The sensitivity, including its global variation, has been studied based on collocations of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and CALIOP measurements over a 10-year period (2006-2015). The cloud detection sensitivity has been defined as the minimum cloud optical thickness for which 50% of clouds could be detected, with the global average sensitivity estimated to be 0.225. After using this value to reduce the CALIOP cloud mask (i.e. clouds with optical thickness below this threshold were interpreted as cloud-free cases), cloudiness results were found to be basically unbiased over most of the globe except over the polar regions where a considerable underestimation of cloudiness could be seen during the polar winter. The overall probability of detecting clouds in the polar winter could be as low as 50% over the highest and coldest parts of Greenland and Antarctica, showing that a large fraction of optically thick clouds also remains undetected here. The study included an in-depth analysis of the probability of detecting a cloud as a function of the vertically integrated cloud optical thickness as well as of the cloud's geographical position. Best results were achieved over oceanic surfaces at mid-to high latitudes where at least 50% of all clouds with an optical thickness down to a value of 0.075 were detected. Corresponding cloud detection sensitivities over land surfaces outside of the polar regions were generally larger than 0.2 with maximum values of approximately 0.5 over the Sahara and the Arabian Peninsula. For polar land surfaces the values were close to 1 or higher with maximum values of 4.5 for the parts with the highest altitudes over Greenland and Antarctica. It is suggested to quantify the detection performance of other CDRs in terms of a sensitivity threshold of cloud optical thickness, which can be estimated using active lidar observations. Validation results are proposed to be used in Cloud Feedback Model Intercomparison Project (CFMIP) Observation Simulation Package (COSP) simulators for cloud detection characterization of various cloud CDRs from passive imagery.

TI  - An empirical, integrated forest biomass monitoring system
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The fate of live forest biomass is largely controlled by growth and disturbance processes, both natural and anthropogenic. Thus, biomass monitoring strategies must characterize both the biomass of the forests at a given point in time and the dynamic processes that change it. Here, we describe and test an empirical monitoring system designed to meet those needs. Our system uses a mix of field data, statistical modeling, remotely-sensed time-series imagery, and small-footprint lidar data to build and evaluate maps of forest biomass. It ascribes biomass change to specific change agents, and attempts to capture the impact of uncertainty in methodology. We find that:A common image framework for biomass estimation and for change detection allows for consistent comparison of both state and change processes controlling biomass dynamics. Regional estimates of total biomass agree well with those from plot data alone.The system tracks biomass densities up to 450-500 Mg ha(-1) with little bias, but begins underestimating true biomass as densities increase further.Scale considerations are important. Estimates at the 30 m grain size are noisy, but agreement at broad scales is good. Further investigation to determine the appropriate scales is underway.Uncertainty from methodological choices is evident, but much smaller than uncertainty based on choice of allometric equation used to estimate biomass from tree data.In this forest-dominated study area, growth and loss processes largely balance in most years, with loss processes dominated by human removal through harvest. In years with substantial fire activity, however, overall biomass loss greatly outpaces growth.Taken together, our methods represent a unique combination of elements foundational to an operational landscape-scale forest biomass monitoring program.

TI  - Comparing the Potential of Multispectral and Hyperspectral Data for Monitoring Oil Spill Impact
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil spills from offshore drilling and coastal refineries often cause significant degradation of coastal environments. Early oil detection may prevent losses and speed up recovery if monitoring of the initial oil extent, oil impact, and recovery are in place. Satellite imagery data can provide a cost-effective alternative to expensive airborne imagery or labor intensive field campaigns for monitoring effects of oil spills on wetlands. However, these satellite data may be restricted in their ability to detect and map ecosystem recovery post-spill given their spectral measurement properties and temporal frequency. In this study, we assessed whether spatial and spectral resolution, and other sensor characteristics influence the ability to detect and map vegetation stress and mortality due to oil. We compared how well three satellite multispectral sensors: WorldView2, RapidEye and Landsat EMT+, match the ability of the airborne hyperspectral AVIRIS sensor to map oil-induced vegetation stress, recovery, and mortality after the DeepWater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. We found that finer spatial resolution (3.5 m) provided better delineation of the oil-impacted wetlands and better detection of vegetation stress along oiled shorelines in saltmarsh wetland ecosystems. As spatial resolution become coarser (3.5 m to 30 m) the ability to accurately detect and map stressed vegetation decreased. Spectral resolution did improve the detection and mapping of oil-impacted wetlands but less strongly than spatial resolution, suggesting that broad-band data may be sufficient to detect and map oil-impacted wetlands. AVIRIS narrow-band data performs better detecting vegetation stress, followed by WorldView2, RapidEye and then Landsat 15 m (pan sharpened) data. Higher quality sensor optics and higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) may also improve detection and mapping of oil-impacted wetlands; we found that resampled coarser resolution AVIRIS data with higher SNR performed better than either of the three satellite sensors. The ability to acquire imagery during certain times (midday, low tide, etc.) or a certain date (cloud-free, etc.) is also important in these tidal wetlands; WorldView2 imagery captured at high-tide detected a narrower band of shoreline affected by oil likely because some of the impacted wetland was below the tideline. These results suggest that while multispectral data may be sufficient for detecting the extent of oil-impacted wetlands, high spectral and spatial resolution, high-quality sensor characteristics, and the ability to control time of image acquisition may improve assessment and monitoring of vegetation stress and recovery post oil spills.

TI  - Feasibility of Preoperative Axillary Lymph Node Marking with a Clip in Breast Cancer Patients Before Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy: A Preliminary Study
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of image-guided marker-clip placement in axillary lymph nodes (ALNs) for breast cancer upon initial presentation and to assess the reliability of this method with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for axillary restaging after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC).Between June 2015 and August 2016, a marker clip was placed at a clinically positive ALN under ultrasonography (US) guidance before initiation of NAC in 20 patients. Preoperative localization of marker-clipped LNs was performed, and the localized LNs were removed by SLNB. We compared the postoperative results of the marker-clipped LNs, SLNs and ALNs.Image-guided marker-clip placements and localization of marker-clipped LNs were performed successfully in 20 patients. A total of 24 marker clips were inserted, and 23 marker-clipped LNs were successfully retrieved during surgery (identification rate, 23/24, 95.8%). In the 11 patients with pathologically confirmed metastatic marker-clipped LNs, four became negative after NAC, and seven maintained metastatic residues on the marker-clipped LNs. Three of the seven patients had metastatic residues on the ALNs, and two of the three patients also had negative SLNs. Marker-clipped nodes accurately predicted the axillary nodal status in these two patients compared with SLNs alone.Image-guided marker-clip placement on positive ALNs before NAC and removal with SLNB is technically feasible. This technique can improve the accuracy of the residual disease evaluation on the axilla, especially in patients with negative SLNB results, and can identify candidates for limited axillary surgery after NAC.

TI  - Ultrasound-Guided Restaging and Localization of Axillary Lymph Nodes After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy for Guidance of Axillary Surgery in Breast Cancer Patients: Experience with Activated Charcoal
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to review our experience with ultrasound (US)-guided localization of axillary lymph nodes using activated charcoal for the guidance of axillary surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in clinically node-positive breast cancer patients.Between April 2016 and April 2017, US-guided localization of the most suspicious axillary lymph nodes at restaging US using activated charcoal (Charcotrace (TM)) was performed in 45 consecutive, clinically node-positive breast cancer patients who had less than two suspicious nodes after NAC and axillary surgery with sentinel node biopsy. Sentinel nodes were defined as radioactive nodes or nodes containing blue dye. The concordance between final pathological results for both the tattooed and sentinel nodes was analyzed.Sentinel node biopsy failed in five patients (11%) in whom axillary surgery was performed under the guidance of the tattooed node. The tattooed nodes were identified in the surgical field in 44 patients (98%). Of the 44 tattooed nodes, 25 (57%) were concordant with the sentinel nodes and 19 (43%) were non-sentinel nodes, including the five nodes with failed sentinel node biopsy. In the final pathological results, 18 patients (40%) had metastatic nodes. The sensitivities for detecting axillary metastasis of the sentinel node biopsy, tattooed node biopsy, and the sentinel and/or tattooed node biopsy were 61% (11/18), 67% (12/18), and 78% (14/18), respectively.US-guided localization of axillary lymph nodes using activated charcoal at restaging after NAC in clinically node-positive breast cancer patients is a useful technique to guide axillary surgery, with a high identification rate.

TI  - Estimating Discharge in Low-Order Rivers With High-Resolution Aerial Imagery
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing of river discharge promises to augment in situ gauging stations, but the majority of research in this field focuses on large rivers (>50 m wide). We present a method for estimating volumetric river discharge in low-order (<50 m wide) rivers from remotely sensed data by coupling high-resolution imagery with one-dimensional hydraulic modeling at so-called virtual gauging stations. These locations were identified as locations where the river contracted under low flows, exposing a substantial portion of the river bed. Topography of the exposed river bed was photogrammetrically extracted from high-resolution aerial imagery while the geometry of the remaining inundated portion of the channel was approximated based on adjacent bank topography and maximum depth assumptions. Full channel bathymetry was used to create hydraulic models that encompassed virtual gauging stations. Discharge for each aerial survey was estimated with the hydraulic model by matching modeled and remotely sensed wetted widths. Based on these results, synthetic width-discharge rating curves were produced for each virtual gauging station. In situ observations were used to determine the accuracy of wetted widths extracted from imagery (mean error 0.36 m), extracted bathymetry (mean vertical RMSE 0.23 m), and discharge (mean percent error 7% with a standard deviation of 6%). Sensitivity analyses were conducted to determine the influence of inundated channel bathymetry and roughness parameters on estimated discharge. Comparison of synthetic rating curves produced through sensitivity analyses show that reasonable ranges of parameter values result in mean percent errors in predicted discharges of 12%-27%.

TI  - Hervey virus: Study on co-circulation with Henipaviruses in Pteropid bats within their distribution range from Australia to Africa
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2011, an unusually large number of independent Hendra virus outbreaks were recorded on horse properties in Queensland and New South Wales, Australia. Urine from bat colonies adjacent to the outbreak sites were sampled and screened for Hendra and other viruses. Several novel paramyxoviruses were also isolated at different locations. Here one of the novel viruses, named Hervey virus (HerPV), is fully characterized by genome sequencing, annotation, phylogeny and in vitro host range, and its serological cross-reactivity and neutralization patterns are examined. HerPV may have ecological and spatial and temporal patterns similar to Hendra virus and could serve as a sentinel virus for the surveillance of this highly pathogenic virus. The suitability of HerPV as potential sentinel virus is further assessed by determining the serological prevalence of HerPV antibodies in fruit-eating bats from Australia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Tanzania and the Gulf of Guinea, indicating the presence of similar viruses in regions beyond the Australian border.

AB  - Despite being the major dietary source for countless insects, plants have not only survived but thrived on earth and represent arguably the largest terrestrial biomass. This is because plants, instead of falling passive victims to the insects, have come to possess numerous defense strategies including production of insect poisons, deterrents, and other anti-nutritive compounds. A significant part of these built-in defenses are inducible and tactfully coordinated with plant growth in a manner that maximizes return on investment. The lipid-derived signal jasmonate (JA) orchestrates many of these inducible defense responses. JA has a similar evolutionary origin as eicosanoids which play critical roles in mammalian wound and inflammatory responses indicating cross-kingdom adoption of lipid-derived signals for use against tissue injuries. The molecular perception and signaling mechanism of JA indicates that the intracellular concentration of a derivative, jasmonoyl-l-isoleucine (JA-Ile), is the major determinant factor for the dynamic regulation of the JA signaling system. Interdisciplinary methods including recombinant enzyme assays, mass spectrometry based hormone profiling, genetics, genomics, and the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana have assisted in elucidating metabolic pathways controlling JA-Ile homeostasis. Along with the relatively well established biosynthetic enzymes, more recently discovered catabolic pathways as well as areas that need new discoveries are discussed herein. Knowledge obtained from the JA-dependent stress adaptive responses are expected to have agricultural and industrial impact in the future toward the development of environmentally friendly ways of managing pests and tapping into a largely unexplored treasure trove of plant-derived specialized metabolites for human use.

TI  - Reconstructing Large- and Mesoscale Dynamics in the Black Sea Region from Satellite Imagery and Altimetry DataA Comparison of Two Methods
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Two remote sensing methods, satellite altimetry and 4D-Var assimilation of satellite imagery, are used to compute surface velocity fields in the Black Sea region. Surface currents derived from the two methods are compared for several cases with intense mesoscale and large-scale dynamics during low wind conditions. Comparison shows that the obtained results coincide well quantitatively and qualitatively. However, satellite imagery provides more reasonable results on the spatial variability of coastal dynamics than altimetry data. In particular, this is related to the reconstruction of eddy coastal dynamics, such as Black Sea near-shore anticyclones. Current streamlines in these eddies are not closed near the coast in altimetry data, which we relate to the extrapolation during mapping procedure in the absence of coastal along-track measurements. On the other hand, in offshore areas, imagery-derived currents can be underestimated due to the absence of thermal contrasts and smoothing during the procedure of the 4D-Var assimilation. Wind drift currents are another source of inconsistency, as their impact is directly observed in satellite imagery but absent in altimetry data. The advantage of the 4D-Var method for reconstructing coastal dynamics is used to compute surface currents in the Marmara Sea on the base of 250 m resolution Modis optical data. The results reveal the very complex dynamics of the basin, with a large number of mesoscale and sub-mesoscale eddies. 4D-Var assimilation of Modis imagery is used to obtain information about dynamic characteristics of these small eddies with radiuses of 4-10 km.

TI  - Management Education and Transformational Learning: The Integration of Mindfulness in an MBA Course
T2  - JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Most management classes are taught by modified traditional techniques in which the acquisition of facts and rote skills is primary. However, traditional pedagogies fall short when the desired result is not inculcating knowledge about a subject, but rather constructively altering worldviews and behaviors. Leadership, ethics, strategic management, and communications are some of the subjects for which worldview change is imperative and traditional, knowledge-inculcating pedagogies are inadequate. The type of cognitive restructuring required for deep understanding of these subjects is termed transformational learning. This article presents an instructional innovation in which transformational learning is facilitated by incorporating mindfulness practice into an MBA course. Specifically, we suggest that mindfulness increases learners' awareness of their own and others' perspectives and decreases resistance to novel ways of seeing and doing things. This increases the likelihood that transformational learning will occur. We evaluate the effectiveness of mindfulness practice in inducing transformational learning in the course.

TI  - Retrieval of fractional snow covered area from MODIS data by multivariate adaptive regression splines
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, a novel approach to estimate fractional snow cover (FSC) from MODIS data in a complex and heterogeneous Alpine terrain is represented by using a state-of-the-art nonparametric spline regression method, namely, multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS). For this purpose, twenty MODIS - Landsat 8 image pairs acquired between April 2013 and December 2016 over European Alps are used. Fifteen of the image pairs are employed during model training and five images are reserved as an independent test dataset. MARS models are trained by using MODIS top-of-atmosphere reflectance values of bands 1-7, normalized difference snow index, normalized difference vegetation index and land cover class as predictor variables. Reference FSC maps are generated from higher spatial resolution Landsat 8 binary snow cover maps. Multilayer feedforward artificial neural network (ANN) models are also trained by using the same input data. During the training and the testing, the effects of the training data size and the sampling type on the predictive performance of ANN and MARS models are investigated. An additional search is also conducted to reveal whether the choice of the transfer function used in the output layer of ANN has a significant contribution to the network's FSC mapping performance. The final ANN and MARS FSC products are at 500 m spatial resolution. The results on the independent test scenes indicate that the developed ANN models with linear and hyperbolic tangent transfer functions in the output layer and the MARS models are in good agreement with reference FSC data with the same average values of R = 0.93. In contrast, the standard MODIS snow fraction product, namely, MOD10 FSC, exhibits slightly poorer performance with average R = 0.88. The proposed MARS approach is statistically proven to have the same performance with ANN, yet it is computationally more efficient in model building.

TI  - Chlorophyll-a Concentration Retrieval in the Optically Complex Waters of the St. Lawrence Estuary and Gulf Using Principal Component Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Empirical methods based on band ratios to infer chlorophyll-a concentration by satellite do not perform well over the optically complex waters of the St. Lawrence Estuary and Gulf. Using a dataset of 93 match-ups, we explore an alternative method relying on empirical orthogonal functions (EOF) to develop an algorithm that relates the satellite-derived remote sensing reflectances to in situ chlorophyll-a concentration for the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS). Results show that an accuracy of 41% at retrieving chlorophyll-a concentration can be reached using the EOF method compared to 140% for the widely-used Ocean Chlorophyll 4 (OC4v4) empirical algorithm, 53% for the Garver-Siegel-Maritorena (GSM01) and 54% for the Generalized Inherent Optical Property (GIOP) semi-analytical algorithms. This result is possible because the EOF approach is able to extract region-specific radiometric features from the satellite remote sensing reflectances that are related to absorption properties of optical components (water, coloured dissolved organic matter and chlorophyll-a) using the visible SeaWiFS channels. The method could easily be used with other ocean-colour satellite sensors (e.g., MODIS, MERIS, VIIRS, OLCI) to extend the time series for the St. Lawrence Estuary and Gulf waters.

TI  - Calibration of Spatially Distributed Hydrological Processes and Model Parameters in SWAT Using Remote Sensing Data and an Auto-Calibration Procedure: A Case Study in a Vietnamese River Basin
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, evapotranspiration (ET) and leaf area index (LAI) were used to calibrate the SWAT model, whereas remotely sensed precipitation and other climatic parameters were used as forcing data for the 6300 km(2) Day Basin, a tributary of the Red River in Vietnam. The efficacy of the Sequential Uncertainty Fitting (SUFI-2) parameter sensitivity and optimization model was tested with area specific remote sensing input parameters for every Hydrological Response Units (HRU), rather than with measurements of river flow representing a large set of HRUs, i.e., a bulk calibration. Simulated monthly ET correlations with remote sensing estimates showed an R-2 = 0.71, Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency NSE = 0.65, and Kling Gupta Efficiency KGE = 0.80 while monthly LAI showed correlations of R-2 = 0.59, NSE = 0.57 and KGE = 0.83 over a five-year validation period. Accumulated modelled ET over the 5-year calibration period amounted to 5713 mm compared to 6015 mm of remotely sensed ET, yielding a difference of 302 mm (5.3%). The monthly flow at two flow measurement stations were adequately estimated (R-2 = 0.78 and 0.55, NSE = 0.71 and 0.63, KGE = 0.59 and 0.75 for Phu Ly and Ninh Binh, respectively). This outcome demonstrates the capability of SWAT model to obtain spatial and accurate simulation of eco-hydrological processes, also when rivers are ungauged and the water withdrawal system is complex.

TI  - Activity-Independent Effects of CREB on Neuronal Survival and Differentiation during Mouse Cerebral Cortex Development
T2  - CEREBRAL CORTEX
M3  - Article
AB  - Neuronal survival and morphological maturation depends on the action of the transcription factor calcium responsive element binding protein (CREB), which regulates expression of several target genes in an activity-dependent manner. However, it remains largely unknown whether CREB-mediated transcription could play a role at early stages of neuronal differentiation, prior to the establishment of functional synaptic contacts. Here, we show that CREB is phosphorylated at very early stages of neuronal differentiation in vivo and in vitro, even in the absence of depolarizing agents. Using genetic tools, we also show that inhibition of CREB-signaling affects neuronal growth and survival in vitro without affecting cell proliferation and neurogenesis. Expression of A-CREB or M-CREB, 2 dominant-negative inhibitors of CREB, decreases cell survival and the complexity of neuronal arborization. Similar changes are observed in neurons treated with protein kinase A (PKA) and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) inhibitors, which also show decreased levels of pCREBSer133. Notably, expression of CREB-FY, a Tyr134Phe CREB mutant with a lower Km for phosphorylation, partly rescues the effects of PKA and CaMKII inhibition. Our data indicate that CREB-mediated signaling play important roles at early stages of cortical neuron differentiation, prior to the establishment of fully functional synaptic contacts.

TI  - Benchmarking the American Society of Breast Surgeon Member Performance for More Than a Million Quality Measure-Patient Encounters
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Nine breast cancer quality measures (QM) were selected by the American Society of Breast Surgeons (ASBrS) for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Quality Payment Programs (QPP) and other performance improvement programs. We report member performance.Surgeons entered QM data into an electronic registry. For each QM, aggregate "performance met" (PM) was reported (median, range and percentiles) and benchmarks (target goals) were calculated by CMS methodology, specifically, the Achievable Benchmark of Care (TM) (ABC) method.A total of 1,286,011 QM encounters were captured from 2011-2015. For 7 QM, first and last PM rates were as follows: (1) needle biopsy (95.8, 98.5%), (2) specimen imaging (97.9, 98.8%), (3) specimen orientation (98.5, 98.3%), (4) sentinel node use (95.1, 93.4%), (5) antibiotic selection (98.0, 99.4%), (6) antibiotic duration (99.0, 99.8%), and (7) no surgical site infection (98.8, 98.9%); all p values < 0.001 for trends. Variability and reasons for noncompliance by surgeon for each QM were identified. The CMS-calculated target goals (ABC (TM) benchmarks) for PM for 6 QM were 100%, suggesting that not meeting performance is a "never should occur" event.Surgeons self-reported a large number of specialty-specific patient-measure encounters into a registry for self-assessment and participation in QPP. Despite high levels of performance demonstrated initially in 2011 with minimal subsequent change, the ASBrS concluded "perfect" performance was not a realistic goal for QPP. Thus, after review of our normative performance data, the ASBrS recommended different benchmarks than CMS for each QM.

TI  - An Investigation of Ice Surface Albedo and Its Influence on the High-Altitude Lakes of the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Most high-altitude lakes are more sensitive to global warming than the regional atmosphere. However, most existing climate models produce unrealistic surface temperatures on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) lakes, and few studies have focused on the influence of ice surface albedo on high-altitude lakes. Based on field albedo measurements, moderate resolution imaging spectrometer (MODIS) albedo products and numerical simulation, this study evaluates the ice albedo parameterization schemes in existing lake models and investigates the characteristics of the ice surface albedo in six typical TP lakes, as well as the influence of ice albedo error in the FLake model. Compared with observations, several ice albedo schemes all clearly overestimate the lake ice albedo by 0.26 to 0.66, while the average bias of MODIS albedo products is only 0.07. The MODIS-observed albedo of a snow-covered lake varies with the snow proportion, and the lake surface albedo in a snow-free state is approximately 0.15 during the frozen period. The MODIS-observed ice surface (snow-free) albedos are concentrated within the ranges of 0.14-0.16, 0.08-0.10 and 0.10-0.12 in Aksai Chin Lake, Nam Co Lake and Ngoring Lake, respectively. The simulated lake surface temperature is sensitive to variations in lake ice albedo especially in the spring and winter.

TI  - The effect of a potentially tamper-resistant oxycodone formulation on opioid use and harm: main findings of the National Opioid Medications Abuse Deterrence (NOMAD) study
T2  - LANCET PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Escalation of pharmaceutical opioid use and harm in North America is well-documented, with similar issues emerging in Australia. One response is the development of tamper-resistant formulations of opioids. A potentially tamper-resistant formulation of controlled-release oxycodone was introduced in Australia in April, 2014, rapidly replacing the non-tamper-resistant formulation. Our study is the most systematic and comprehensive examination of the impact of a new opioid formulation to date, assessing the effect of tamper-resistant formulation of controlled-release oxycodone on population-level opioid use and opioid-related harm (ie, overdose, help-seeking, and treatment-seeking); and opioid use, tampering, and preference for the tamper-resistant formulation of controlled-release oxycodone compared with other drugs or formulations among sentinel populations likely to tamper with pharmaceutical opioids.Methods We conducted interrupted time-series analyses of opioid sales data and multiple routinely collected health datasets, followed up a cohort of people who tamper with pharmaceutical opioids before and after the introduction of the tamper-resistant formulation of controlled-release oxycodone, and analysed annual surveys of people who inject drugs. Data were collected from several Australian states: New South Wales, South Australia, and Tasmania. Meta-analyses (weighted Z tests) were conducted to synthesise across data sources providing evidence for a given indicator.Findings At the population level, we found reduced sales of higher strengths of controlled-release oxycodone and increased sales of other oxycodone formulations. No significant effect was observed among population-level indicators of opioid overdose, or help or treatment-seeking. Mortality data were not available for inclusion at the time of our study. Meta-analyses across sentinel populations (ie, prospective cohort, surveys of people who inject drugs, and clients of supervised injecting facilities or needle and syringe programmes) indicated reduced controlled-release oxycodone use via tampering (mainly injection), with no evidence of switching to heroin or other drug use.Interpretation This formulation of controlled-release oxycodone reduced tampering with pharmaceutical opioids among people who inject drugs, but did not affect population-level opioid use or harm.

TI  - Mapping Double and Single Crop Paddy Rice With Sentinel-1A at Varying Spatial Scales and Polarizations in Hanoi, Vietnam
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Paddy Rice is the prevalent land cover in the mosaicked landscape of the Hanoi Capital Region, Vietnam. In this study, we map double and single crop rice in Hanoi using a random forest algorithm and a time-series of Sentinel-1 SAR imagery at 10 and 20 m resolution using VV-only, VH-only, and both polarizations. We compare spatial and areal variation and quantify input band importance, estimate crop growth stages, estimate rice field/collective metrics using Fragstats with image segmentation, and highlight the importance of the results for land use and land cover. Results suggest double crop rice ranged from 208 000 to 220 000 ha with 20-m resolution imagery accounting for the most area in all polarizations. Based on accuracy assessment, we found 10 m data for VV/VH to have highest overall accuracy (93.5%, +/- 1.33%), while VV at 10 and 20 m had lowest overall accuracies (90.9%, +/- 1.57; 91.0%, +/- 2.75). Mean decrease in accuracy suggests for all but VV at 10 m, data from harvest and flooding stages are most critical for classification. Results suggest 20 m data for both VV and VH overestimates rice land cover, however 20 m data may be indicative of rice land use. Analysis of growing season suggests average estimated length of 93-104 days for each season. Commune-level results suggest up to 20% coefficient of variation between VV10m and VH10m with significant spatial variation in rice area. Landscape metrics show rice fields are typically plantedin groups of 3-4 fields with over 796 000 collectives and 2.69 millionfields estimated in the study area.

TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility in <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i> isolates from five sentinel surveillance sites in Zimbabwe, 2015-2016
T2  - SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives Gonorrhoea and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Neisseria gonorrhoeae are major public health concerns worldwide. Enhanced AMR surveillance for gonococci is essential globally. In Zimbabwe, very limited gonococcal AMR data were reported. Our aims were to (i) implement quality-assured gonococcal AMR surveillance in Zimbabwe and (ii) investigate gonococcal AMR at five health centres in 2015-2016.Methods Gonococcal isolates from 104 men with urethral discharge were tested for susceptibility to kanamycin, ceftriaxone, cefixime, ciprofloxacin and azithromycin using Etest.Results All isolates (102 possible to test) were susceptible to ceftriaxone and cefixime. The level of resistance (intermediate resistance) to kanamycin and ciprofloxacin was 2.0% (2.0%) and 18.6% (27.5%), respectively. The two kanamycin-resistant isolates (R128mg/L) had a kanamycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of >256mg/L. The ciprofloxacin resistance ranged from 9.5% to 30.8% in the five sentinel sites. Only 10 (9.6%) of the isolates were tested for susceptibility to azithromycin and 1 (10.0%) was resistant (MIC=4mg/L).Conclusions The emergence of multidrug-resistant gonorrhoea internationally is a major public health concern and gonococcal AMR surveillance is crucial globally. In Zimbabwe, gonococcal AMR surveillance has now been implemented and quality assured according to WHO standards. The results of this first surveillance will be used to directly inform revisions of the national treatment guidelines. It is imperative to further strengthen the surveillance of gonococcal AMR, and ideally also treatment failures, in Zimbabwe and most countries in the WHO African region, which requires continuous national and international support, including technical support, and political and financial commitment.

TI  - Assessment of Convolution Neural Networks for Surficial Geology Mapping in the South Rae Geological Region, Northwest Territories, Canada
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping of surficial geology is an important requirement for broadening the geoscience database of northern Canada. Surficial geology maps are an integral data source for mineral and energy exploration. Moreover, they provide information such as the location of gravels and sands, which are important for infrastructure development. Currently, surficial geology maps are produced through expert interpretation of aerial photography and field data. However, interpretation is known to be subjective, labour-intensive and difficult to repeat. The expert knowledge required for interpretation can be challenging to maintain and transfer. In this research, we seek to assess the potential of deep neural networks to aid surficial geology mapping by providing an objective surficial materials initial layer that experts can modify to speed map development and improve consistency between mapped areas. Such an approach may also harness expert knowledge in a way that is transferable to unmapped areas. For this purpose, we assess the ability of convolution neural networks (CNN) to predict surficial geology classes under two sampling scenarios. In the first scenario, a CNN uses samples collected over the area to be mapped. In the second, a CNN trained over one area is then applied to locations where the available samples were not used in training the network. The latter case is important, as a collection of in situ training data can be costly. The evaluation of the CNN was carried out using aerial photos, Landsat reflectance, and high-resolution digital elevation data over five areas within the South Rae geological region of Northwest Territories, Canada. The results are encouraging, with the CNN generating average accuracy of 76% when locally trained. For independent test areas (i.e., trained over one area and applied over other), accuracy dropped to 59-70% depending on the classes selected for mapping. In the South Rae region, significant confusion was found between till veneer and till blanket as well as glaciofluvial subclasses (esker, terraced, and hummocky ice-contact). Merging these classes respectively increased accuracy for independent test area to 68% on average. Relative to the more widely used Random Forest machine learning algorithm, this represents an improvement in accuracy of 4%. Furthermore, the CNN produced better results for less frequent classes with distinct spatial structure.

TI  - Groundwater monitoring of the deep aquifer for the construction phase of the Crossrail project
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND HYDROGEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Crossrail project is a new underground railway through the heart of London. It will connect with 110 km of new or upgraded sections of surface rail to Reading, Shenfield and Abbey Wood. The route runs through typical London Basin geology. Ground investigations began during the 1990s and continued to 2012. A total of 1314 groundwater monitoring devices were installed and monitored at regular intervals. The groundwater monitoring strategy adopted by the project in preparation for and during construction included (1) establishment of a robust baseline and system for measuring changes to the baseline, (2) establishment of a series of sentinel wells to monitor any possible migration of third-party contamination sources and provide advance warning for construction dewatering sites and (3) performance of pumping tests. The sentinel wells were located to provide sufficient time to allow mitigation measures to be put into place without cessation of construction dewatering, thereby minimizing risk to the project. The pumping tests were carried out to demonstrate constructability, aid in the design of construction dewatering systems and provide support for the consent submissions on the impact of dewatering. Instrumentation was transferred to, and monitored by, the construction contractors but data were collated centrally by Crossrail. Contractors added their own instruments located either within or immediately adjacent to the structure to confirm dewatering levels or risk of base heave. The data were used for regular reporting to the Environment Agency in support of the dewatering permits and ensuring no interruption of supply to licensed abstractors.

TI  - Operational Atmospheric Correction Method over Land Surfaces for GOCI Images
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The GOCI atmospheric correction over land surfaces is essential for the time-series analysis of terrestrial environments with the very high temporal resolution. We develop an operational GOCI atmospheric correction method over land surfaces, which is rather different from the one developed for ocean surface. The GOCI atmospheric correction method basically reduces gases absorption and Rayleigh and aerosol scatterings and to derive surface reflectance from at-sensor radiance. We use the 6S radiative transfer model that requires several input parameters to calculate surface reflectance. In the sensitivity analysis, aerosol optical thickness was the most influential element among other input parameters including atmospheric model, terrain elevation, and aerosol type. To account for the highly variable nature of aerosol within the GOCI target area in northeast Asia, we generate the spatio-temporal aerosol maps using AERONET data for the aerosol correction. For a fast processing, the GOCI atmospheric correction method uses the pre-calculated look up table that directly converts at-sensor radiance to surface reflectance. The atmospheric correction method was validated by comparing with in-situ spectral measurements and MODIS reflectance products. The GOCI surface reflectance showed very similar magnitude and temporal patterns with the in-situ measurements and the MODIS reflectance. The GOCI surface reflectance was slightly higher than the in-situ measurement and MODIS reflectance by 0.01 to 0.06, which might be due to the different viewing angles. Anisotropic effect in the GOCI hourly reflectance needs to be further normalized during the following cloud-free compositing.

TI  - Complex Relationships of the Effects of Topographic Characteristics and Susceptible Tree Cover on Burn Severity
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires and burn severity mosaics have profound impacts on the post-fire dynamics and complexity of forest ecosystems. Numerous studies have investigated the relationship between topographic variables and susceptible tree covers with regard to burn severity. However, these relationships have not been fully elucidated, because most studies have assumed linearity in these relationships. Therefore, we examined the linearity and the nonlinearity in the relationships between topographic variables and susceptible tree covers with burn severity by comparing linear and nonlinear models. The site of the Samcheok fire, the largest recorded forest fire in Korea, was used as the study area. We generated 802 grid cells with a 500-m resolution that encompassed the entire study area and collected a dataset that included the topographic variables and percentage of red pine trees, which are the most susceptible tree cover types in Korea. We used conventional linear models and generalized additive models to estimate the linear and the nonlinear models based on topographic variables and Japanese red pine trees. The results revealed that the percentage of red pine trees had linear effects on burn severity, reinforcing the importance of silviculture and forest management to lower burn severity. Meanwhile, the topographic variables had nonlinear effects on burn severity. Among the topographic variables, elevation had the strongest nonlinear effect on burn severity, possibly by overriding the effects of susceptible fuels over elevation effects or due to the nonlinear effects of topographic characteristics on pre-fire fuel conditions, including the spatial distribution and availability of susceptible tree cover. To validate and generalize the nonlinear effects of elevation and other topographic variables, additional research is required at different fire sites with different tree cover types in different geographic locations.

TI  - Drought Impact on Phenology and Green Biomass Production of Alpine Mountain ForestCase Study of South Tyrol 2001-2012 Inspected with MODIS Time Series
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological balance and biodiversity of the alpine forest is endangered by global and local climatic extremes. It spurs a need for comprehensive forest monitoring, including in depth analyses of drought impact on the alpine woodland ecosystems. Addressing an arising knowledge gap, we identified and analyzed 2002-2012 aridity related responses within the alpine mountain forest of South Tyrol. The study exploited a S-mode PCA (Principal Component Analysis) based synergy between meteorological conditions rendered by the scPDSI (self-calibrated Palmer Drought Severity Index) and forest status approximated through MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) derived NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and NDII7 (Normalized Difference Infrared Index based on MODIS band 7) time series. Besides characterizing predominant forest temporal response to drought, we identified corresponding spatial footprints of drought impact, as well as examined aridity-related changes in forest phenology and biomass production. The latter was further evaluated in relation to forest type, elevation, aspect and slope. Recognized meteorological conditions highlighted: prolonged 2003-2007 mild to extreme drought, and overall regional drying tendencies. Arising remotely sensed forest responses accounted on localized decline in foliage water content and/or photosynthetic activity, but also indicated regions where forest condition improved despite the meteorological stress. Perceived variability in the forest response to drought conditions was governed by geographic location, species structure, elevation and exposition, and featured complexity of the alpine forest ecosystem. Among the inspected biophysical factors elevation had the strongest influence on forest phenology and green biomass production under meteorological stress conditions. Stands growing above 1400 m a.s.l. demonstrated initial increase in annual biomass growth at the beginning of the dry spell in 2003. Conversely, woodlands at lower altitudes comprising considerable share of hardwood species were more prone to biomass decline in 2003, but experienced an overall upturn in biomass production during the following years of the dry spell. Aspect showed moderate effect on drought-related phenology and green biomass production responses. Diverse forest ecosystem responses identified in this study were in line with known local and regional analyses, but also shed some new light on drought induced alternation of forest status.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variation of snow cover over the Tibetan Plateau based on MODIS snow product, 2001-2014
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we investigate the spatiotemporal characteristics and trends of snow cover fraction (SCF) in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and seven upstream river basins (Yellow, Yangtze, Mekong, Salween, Brahmaputra, Indus and Yarkant) by employing the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data for 2001-2014. The possible linkage between the SCF, and temperature and precipitation changes over the TP and individual basins is also investigated. Results suggest that the distribution of snow cover over the TP exhibit a large spatiotemporal heterogeneity with high SCFs mainly concentrating on the southern and western edges which is strongly linked to the moist air supplies. The distribution of snow cover is highly dependent on the elevations, with a higher SCF and a later onset of snow melt at the higher elevation zones than at the lowers. There is an elevation threshold existing for separating two distinct snow cover regimes, which are 4000m for the western basins and 5000m for the southeastern basins. The snow cover over the TP has slightly decreased by about 1.1% during 2001-2014, with dramatic reductions mostly lying in the heavy snowy regions and some light increases occurring in the areas with annual mean SCFs mostly less than 10%. The reduction rates of snow cover increase with the rising of altitudes for the TP average, and the basins of Indus, Yarkant, Salween and Brahmaputra. At the same time, the Yellow and Yangtze basins exhibit larger increasing rates of snow cover at the higher elevations zones. The SCF variations are linked to the temperature and precipitation changes. Precipitation tends to be the major factor impacting the snow cover changes in the TP during 2001-2014.

T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Biomass burning substantially contributes to atmospheric aerosol and greenhouse gas emissions that influence climate and air quality. Fire radiative energy (FRE) (units: MJ) has been demonstrated to be linearly related to biomass consumption (units: kg) with potential for improving biomass burning emission estimation. The scalar constant, termed herein as the FRE biomass combustion coefficient (FBCC) (units: kg/MJ), which converts FRE to biomass consumption, has been estimated using field and laboratory experiments, varying from 0.368 to 0.453kg/MJ. However, quite different FBCC values, especially for satellite-based approaches, have been reported. This study investigated the FBCC with respect to 445 wildfires that occurred from 2011 to 2012 across the Conterminous United States (CONUS) considering both polar-orbiting and geostationary satellite data. The FBCC was derived by comparing satellite FRE estimates with biomass consumption for the CONUS. FRE was estimated using observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES); biomass consumption was estimated using Landsat-derived burned areas with fuel loadings from the Fuel Characteristic Classification System and using combustion completeness parameterized by Landsat burn severity and Fuel Characteristic Classification System fuelbed type. The reported results confirm the linearity of the empirical relationship between FRE and biomass consumption for wildfires. The CONUS FBCC was 0.374kg/MJ for GOES FRE, 0.266kg/MJ for MODIS FRE, and 0.320kg/MJ considering both GOES and MODIS FRE. Limited sensitivity analyses, comparing MODIS and GOES FRE with biomass consumption estimated in three different ways, indicated that the FBCC varied from 0.301 to 0.458kg/MJ.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Change Patterns of Coastlines in Zhejiang Province, China, Over the Last Twenty-Five Years
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal analysis of coastline land utilization is important for strengthening coastline resource management and promoting sustainable development in coastal zones. In this study, basic spatiotemporal characteristics of coastline land utilization in Zhejiang Province, China, were analyzed using remote sensing (RS) and GIS techniques. For this case, Landsat Thematic Mapper and Operational Land Imager remote-sensing image data acquired from 1990 to 2015 were collected and processed. Several indices and metrics used for quantifying and analyzing the coastline utilization in Zhejiang Province were defined and calculated through processing remote sensing data and using GIS tools. They included the intensity index of coastline change, fractal dimension of the coastline, subjectivity of coastline utilization, and the integrated coastline utilization index. The analysis results demonstrated that (1) significant coastline changes took place in Zhejiang Province, and the coastline moved seaward, while the total coastline length decreased continuously; (2) the average fractal dimension of the coastlines was 1.0922, and it was relatively stable before 2000, but declined continuously after 2000, reduced to 1.086 in 2015; (3) the artificialization index of the coastlines kept rising; (4) there were single, binary, and other multi-land use types in different coastline sections in the study area; and (5) the coastline land use intensity increased continuously from 0.25 to 0.38, and the coastline in the Xiangshan Harbour had the highest land use intensity index, reaching 0.53 in 2015, throughout the study period, and in the study area.

TI  - Entropy theory-integrated information model for the assessment of geothermal potential: a case study of Tengchong County, Southwest China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Geothermal energy remains a largely undeveloped natural resource because of the high risk associated with its development. An accurate prediction model for easy identification of potential regions can help to lower the risk and cost associated with development. In this study, geothermal potential regions were identified through the relationship between geothermal emergencies and their controlling factors in Tengchong County, China. Publicly available databases for this analysis including epicenters, active faults, Bouguer gravity, Landsat7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus images, the magnetic data and digital elevation model data were extracted as the b-value map, distance to faults map, distance to main grabens map, land surface temperature map, magnetic anomaly map and distance to rivers map, respectively. Based on the platforms within geographic information system, an entropy theory-integrated information model was established to evaluate the geothermal potential sites within the region. Moreover, factor analysis method was applied to test the conditional independence between the map pairs before modeling application. The results of the weighted information model show that the model shows perfect performance in discovering potential geothermal regions. In the final maps, undeveloped or unexploited geothermal regions can be observed along the Mingguang River and Nu River. Undeniably, these models will help to find undiscovered geothermal regions with limited geological information publically available.

TI  - A Genetic Algorithm-Based Urban Cluster Automatic Threshold Method by Combining VIIRS DNB, NDVI, and NDBI to Monitor Urbanization
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely information related to quantitative descriptions and spatial distributions of urban areas is crucial to understand urbanization dynamics and is also helpful to address environmental issues associated with rapid urban land-cover changes. Thresholding is acknowledged as the most popular and practical way to extract urban information from nighttime lights. However, the difficulty of determining optimal threshold remains challenging to applications of this method. In order to address the problem of selecting thresholds, a Genetic Algorithm-based urban cluster automatic threshold (GA-UCAT) method by combining Visible-Infrared Imager-Radiometer Suite Day/Night band (VIIRS DNB), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) is proposed to distinguish urban areas from dark rural background in NTL images. The key point of this proposed method is to design an appropriate fitness function of GA by means of integrating between-class variance and inter-class variance with all these three data sources to determine optimal thresholds. In accuracy assessments by comparing with ground truthLandsat 8 OLI images, this new method has been validated and results with OA (Overall Accuracy) ranging from 0.854 to 0.913 and Kappa ranging from 0.699 to 0.722 show that the GA-UCAT approach is capable of describing spatial distributions and giving detailed information of urban extents. Additionally, there is discussion on different classifications of rural residential spots in Landsat remote sensing images and nighttime light (NTL) and evaluations of spatial-temporal development patterns of five selected Chinese urban clusters from 2012 to 2017 on utilizing this proposed method. The new method shows great potential to map global urban information in a simple and accurate way and to help address urban environmental issues.

TI  - Calibration and decoupling of multi-axis robotic Force/Moment sensors
T2  - ROBOTICS AND COMPUTER-INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING
M3  - Article
AB  - force (Fx, Fy, and Fz), as well as the moments (Mx, My and Mz). This enables them to be frequently used in many robotic applications. Accurate, time-effective calibration and decoupling procedures are critical to the implementation of these sensors. This paper compares the effectiveness of decoupling methods based on Least-Squares (LS), BP Neural Network (BPNN), and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) methods for improving the performance of multi-axis robotic F/M sensors. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the decoupling methods, a calibration and decoupling experiment was performed on a five-axis robotic F/M sensor. The experiments demonstrate that the ELM based decoupling method is superior to LS and BPNN based methods. The presented theoretical and experimental demonstrations provide a comprehensive description of the calibration and decoupling procedures of multi -axis robotic F/M sensors. This work reveals that the ELM method is an appropriate and high performing decoupling procedure for multi -axis robotic F/M sensors. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - TS<SUP>2</SUP>uRF: A New Method for Sharpening Thermal Infrared Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermal infrared (TIR) imagery is normally acquired at coarser pixel resolution than that of shortwave sensors on the same satellite platform. TIR resolution is often not suitable for monitoring crop conditions of fragmented farming lands, e.g., the accurate estimates of evapotranspiration (ET) based on surface energy balance from remote sensing for irrigation water management. Consequently, thermal sharpening techniques have been developed to sharpen TIR imagery to a shortwave band pixel resolution. However, most methods concentrate on the visual effects of the thermal sharpened images, and they treat the pixels as independent samples without considering their spatial context, which can give rise to adverse effects such as artifacts. In this work, a new thermal sharpening method called TS(2)uRF is proposed. The potential of superpixels (SP) combined with regression random forest (RRF) have been used to augment the spatial resolution of the Landsat 8 TIR (100 m) imagery to their visible (VIS) spatial resolution (30 m). The SP has allowed the contextual information on the land cover to be integrated, and RRF has allowed the relationship between five spectral indices and TIR data to be integrated into a single model. The TIR sharpened images obtained using the TS(2)uRF were compared with images obtained using the TsHARP, one of the most classic thermal sharpening techniques, evaluating the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and structural similarity index (SSIM) for measuring image quality. In all of the cases evaluated, the RMSE and SSIM of the images sharpened using the TS(2)uRF method outperform those obtained using TsHARP. In particular, the TS(2)uRF method has an average error of 1.14 degrees C (RMSE) lower than TsHARP, regarding SSIM, TS(2)uRF outperforms TsHARP on average by 0.218. From the visual comparison, it has been shown that the TS(2)uRF methodology avoids the artifacts that appear in the enhanced images using the TsHARP method.

TI  - Ship Classification Based on MSHOG Feature and Task-Driven Dictionary Learning with Structured Incoherent Constraints in SAR Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we present a novel method for ship classification in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. The proposed method consists of feature extraction and classifier training. Inspired by SAR-HOG feature in automatic target recognition, we first design a novel feature named MSHOG by improving SAR-HOG, adapting it to ship classification, and employing manifold learning to achieve dimensionality reduction. Then, we train the classifier and dictionary jointly in task-driven dictionary learning (TDDL) framework. To further improve the performance of TDDL, we enforce structured incoherent constraints on it and develop an efficient algorithm for solving corresponding optimization problem. Extensive experiments performed on two datasets with TerraSAR-X images demonstrate that the proposed method, MSHOG feature and TDDL with structured incoherent constraints, outperforms other existing methods and achieves state-of-art performance.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Evaluation of Simulated Evapotranspiration and Streamflow over Texas Using the WRF-Hydro-RAPID Modeling Framework
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assesses a large-scale hydrologic modeling framework (WRF-Hydro-RAPID) in terms of its high-resolution simulation of evapotranspiration (ET) and streamflow over Texas (drainage area: 464,135 km(2)). The reference observations used include eight-day ET data from MODIS and FLUXNET, and daily river discharge data from 271 U.S. Geological Survey gauges located across a climate gradient. A recursive digital filter is applied to decompose the river discharge into surface runoff and base flow for comparison with the model counterparts. While the routing component of the model is pre-calibrated, the land component is uncalibrated. Results show the model performance for ET and runoff is aridity-dependent. ET is better predicted in a wet year than in a dry year. Streamflow is better predicted in wet regions with the highest efficiency similar to 0.7. In comparison, streamflow is most poorly predicted in dry regions with a large positive bias. Modeled ET bias is more strongly correlated with the base flow bias than surface runoff bias. These results complement previous evaluations by incorporating more spatial details. They also help identify potential processes for future model improvements. Indeed, improving the dry region streamflow simulation would require synergistic enhancements of ET, soil moisture and groundwater parameterizations in the current model configuration. Our assessments are important preliminary steps towards accurate large-scale hydrologic forecasts.

TI  - A Multi-Scale Validation Strategy for Albedo Products over Rugged Terrain and Preliminary Application in Heihe River Basin, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The issue for the validation of land surface remote sensing albedo products over rugged terrain is the scale effects between the reference albedo measurements and coarse scale albedo products, which is caused by the complex topography. This paper illustrates a multi-scale validation strategy specified for coarse scale albedo validation over rugged terrain. A Mountain-Radiation-Transfer-based (MRT-based) albedo upscaling model was proposed in the process of multi-scale validation strategy for aggregating fine scale albedo to coarse scale. The simulated data of both the reference coarse scale albedo and fine scale albedo were used to assess the performance and uncertainties of the MRT-based albedo upscaling model. The results showed that the MRT-based model could reflect the albedo scale effects over rugged terrain and provided a robust solution for albedo upscaling from fine scale to coarse scale with different mean slopes and different solar zenith angles. The upscaled coarse scale albedos had the great agreements with the simulated coarse scale albedo with a Root-Mean-Square-Error (RMSE) of 0.0029 and 0.0017 for black sky albedo (BSA) and white sky albedo (WSA), respectively. Then the MRT-based model was preliminarily applied for the assessment of daily MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Albedo Collection V006 products (MCD43A3 C6) over rugged terrain. Results showed that the MRT-based model was effective and suitable for conducting the validation of MODIS albedo products over rugged terrain. In this research area, it was shown that the MCD43A3 C6 products with full inversion algorithm, were generally in agreement with the aggregated coarse scale reference albedos over rugged terrain in the Heihe River Basin, with the BSA RMSE of 0.0305 and WSA RMSE of 0.0321, respectively, which were slightly higher than those over flat terrain.

TI  - First surface-based estimation of the aerosol indirect effect over a site in southeastern China
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The deployment of the U.S. Atmospheric Radiation Measurement mobile facility in Shouxian from May to December 2008 amassed the most comprehensive set of measurements of atmospheric, surface, aerosol, and cloud variables in China. This deployment provided a unique opportunity to investigate the aerosol-cloud interactions, which are most challenging and, to date, have not been examined to any great degree in China. The relationship between cloud droplet effective radius (CER) and aerosol index (AI) is very weak in summer because the cloud droplet growth is least affected by the competition for water vapor. Mean cloud liquid water path (LWP) and cloud optical depth (COD) significantly increase with increasing AI in fall. The sensitivities of CER and LWP to aerosol loading increases are not significantly different under different air mass conditions. There is a significant correlation between the changes in hourly mean AI and the changes in hourly mean CER, LWP, and COD. The aerosol first indirect effect (FIE) is estimated in terms of relative changes in both CER (FIECER) and COD (FIECOD) with changes in AI for different seasons and air masses. FIECOD and FIECER are similar in magnitude and close to the typical FIE value of similar to 0.23, and do not change much between summer and fall or between the two different air mass conditions. Similar analyses were done using spaceborne Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data. The satellite-derived FIE is contrary to the FIE estimated from surface retrievals and may have large uncertainties due to some inherent limitations.

TI  - Burned area detection based on Landsat time series in savannas of southern Burkina Faso
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - West African savannas are subject to regular fires, which have impacts on vegetation structure, biodiversity and carbon balance. An efficient and accurate mapping of burned area associated with seasonal fires can greatly benefit decision making in land management. Since coarse resolution burned area products cannot meet the accuracy needed for fire management and climate modelling at local scales, the medium resolution Landsat data is a promising alternative for local scale studies. In this study, we developed an algorithm for continuous monitoring of annual burned areas using Landsat time series. The algorithm is based on burned pixel detection using harmonic model fitting with Landsat time series and breakpoint identification in the time series data. This approach was tested in a savanna area in southern Burkina Faso using 281 images acquired between October 2000 and April 2016. An overall accuracy of 79.2% was obtained with balanced omission and commission errors. This represents a significant improvement in comparison with MODIS burned area product (67.6%), which had more omission errors than commission errors, indicating underestimation of the total burned area. By observing the spatial distribution of burned areas, we found that the Landsat based method misclassified cropland and cloud shadows as burned areas due to the similar spectral response, and MODIS burned area product omitted small and fragmented burned areas. The proposed algorithm is flexible and robust against decreased data availability caused by clouds and Landsat 7 missing lines, therefore having a high potential for being applied in other landscapes in future studies.

TI  - A Case Study of the Forced Invariance Approach for Soil Salinity Estimation in Vegetation-Covered Terrain Using Airborne Hyperspectral Imagery
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil spectroscopy is a promising technique for soil analysis, and has been successfully utilized in the laboratory. When it comes to space, the presence of vegetation significantly affects the performance of imaging spectroscopy or hyperspectral imaging on the retrieval of topsoil properties. The Forced Invariance Approach has been proven able to effectively suppress the vegetation contribution to the mixed image pixel. It takes advantage of scene statistics and requires no specific a priori knowledge of the referenced spectra. However, the approach is still mainly limited to lithological mapping. In this case study, the objective was to test the performance of the Forced Invariance Approach to improve the estimation accuracy of soil salinity for an agricultural area located in the semi-arid region of Northwest China using airborne hyperspectral data. The ground truth data was obtained from an eco-hydrological wireless sensing network. The relationship between Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and soil salinity is discussed. The results demonstrate that the Forced Invariance Approach is able to improve the retrieval accuracy of soil salinity at a depth of 10 cm, as indicated by a higher value for the coefficient of determination (R-2). Consequently, the vegetation suppression method has the potential to improve quantitative estimation of soil properties with multivariate statistical methods.

TI  - Global Land Surface Evapotranspiration Estimation From Meteorological and Satellite Data Using the Support Vector Machine and Semiempirical Algorithm
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is the combination process of the surface evaporation and plant transpiration, which occur simultaneously, and it links the terrestrial water cycles, carbon cycles, and energy exchange. In this study, based on the observations from 242 global FLUXnet sites, with daily mean temperature, relative humidity, net radiation, wind speed, incoming shortwave radiation, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, normalized difference vegetation index, altitude, difference in temperature, and observed ET as input data, we used a support vector machine and a semiempirical algorithm to estimate the land surface daily ET at nine different vegetation- type sites. Subsequently, based on the meteorological reanalysis data combined with remote sensing data, we estimated regional land surface ET of China during 1982-2010. The results showed that, for all vegetation-type sites, when the predicted ET was validated with the eddy covariance measurements, the support vector machine algorithm undervalued ET while the semiempirical algorithm overvalued ET. When five indicators and the second classification method were selected, the semiempirical algorithm probably could explain 56%-76% of the land surface ET change, whereas the support vector machine algorithm probably could explain 71%-85%. The regional values of annual daily average ET varied from 5.8 to 110.5 W/m(2), and the land surface ET overall trend decreased from the southeast to the northwest in China.

TI  - Monitoring desertification processes in Mongolian Plateau using MODIS tasseled cap transformation and TGSI time series
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Most remote sensing studies assess the desertification using vegetation monitoring method. But it has the insufficient precision of vegetation monitoring for the limited vegetation cover of the desertification region. Therefore, it offers an alternative approach for the desertification research to assess sand dune and sandy land change using remote sensing in the desertification region. In this study, the indices derived from the well-known tasseled cap transformation (TCT), tasseled cap angle (TCA), disturbance index (DI), process indicator (PI), and topsoil grain size index (TGSI) were integrated to monitor and assess the desertification at the thirteen study sites including sand dunes and sandy lands distributed in the Mongolian Plateau (MP) from 2000 to 2015. A decision tree was used to classify the desertification on a regional scale. The average overall accuracy of 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2015 desertification classification was higher than 90%. Results from this study indicated that integration of the advantages of TCA, DI and TGSI could better assess the desertification. During the last 16 years, Badain Jaran Desert, Tengger Desert, and Ulan Buh Desert showed a relative stabilization. Otindag Sandy Land and the deserts of Khar Nuur, Ereen Nuur, Tsagan Nuur, Khongoryn Els, Hobq, and Mu Us showed a slow increasing of desertification, whereas Bayan Gobi, Horqin and Hulun Buir sandy lands showed a slow decreasing of desertification. Compared with the other 11 sites, the fine sand dunes occupied the majority of the Tengger Desert, and the coarse sandy land occupied the majority of the Horqin Sandy Land. Our findings on a three or four years' periodical fluctuated changes in the desertification may possibly reflect changing precipitation and soil moisture in the MP. Further work to link the TCA, DI, TGSI, and PI values with the desertification characteristics is recommended to set the thresholds and improve the assessment accuracy with field investigation.

TI  - An Ensemble of Classifiers Based on Positive and Unlabeled Data in One-Class Remote Sensing Classification
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - One-class remote sensing classification refers to the situations when users are only interested in one specific land type without considering other types. The positive and unlabeled learning (PUL) algorithm, which trains a binary classifier from positive and unlabeled data, has been shown to be promising in one-class classification. The implementation of PUL by a single classifier has been investigated. However, implementing PUL using multiple classifiers and creating classifier ensembles based on PUL have not been studied. In this research, we investigate the implementations of PUL using several classifiers, including generalized linear model, generalized additive model, multivariate adaptive regression splines, maximum entropy, backpropagation neural network, and support vector machine, as well as three ensemble methods based on majority vote, weighted average, and weighted vote combination rules. These methods are applied in classifying the urban areas from four remote sensing imagery of different spatial resolutions, including aerial photograph, Landsat 8, WorldView-3, and Gaofen-1. Experimental results show that classifiers can successfully extract the urban areas with high accuracies, and the ensemble methods based on weighted average and weighted vote generally outperform the individual classifiers on different datasets. We conclude that PUL is a promising method in one-class remote sensing classification, and the classifier ensemble based on PUL can significantly improve the accuracy.

TI  - A remote sensing data management system for sea area usage management in China
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In China, remote sensing data play an important role in sea area usage management. With the enrichment of available remote sensing platforms and sensors, the volume constantly growing, and more and more complicated data processing operations on data products, remote sensing data overload has been an obvious problem for anyone who is trying to set planning policies and monitor sea area usage activities based on the valuable data products. In order to solve the problem, this paper presents a customized remote sensing data management system (RSDM) for archiving and distributing the remote sensing data products for sea area usage management. This paper has identified a set of key domain requirements by reviewing the workflow of sea area usage management. In the RSDM, a metadata interpreter tool allows data managers to classify the data products into categorical data types according to a set of domain-specific business rules, and a data model based on data lineage is developed to support tracing all relevant data products along processing chains. In addition, a unified procedure, which is used to create Quick Look images with transparent border areas from different remote sensing data sources, is developed. What is more, the system provides summary information about the available data suitable for auditing and exploratory data analysis by using a series of statistic graphs from different perspectives for data managers and users. This paper demonstrates that the RSDM improves data managers' day-to-day working arrangements, and facilitates the application of the remote sensing technology in sea area usage management.

TI  - An Unsupervised Change Detection Method Using Time-Series of PolSAR Images from Radarsat-2 and GaoFen-3
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The traditional unsupervised change detection methods based on the pixel level can only detect the changes between two different times with same sensor, and the results are easily affected by speckle noise. In this paper, a novel method is proposed to detect change based on time-series data from different sensors. Firstly, the overall difference image of the time-series PolSAR is calculated by omnibus test statistics, and difference images between any two images in different times are acquired by Rj test statistics. Secondly, the difference images are segmented with a Generalized Statistical Region Merging (GSRM) algorithm which can suppress the effect of speckle noise. Generalized Gaussian Mixture Model (GGMM) is then used to obtain the time-series change detection maps in the final step of the proposed method. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we carried out the experiment of change detection using time-series PolSAR images acquired by Radarsat-2 and Gaofen-3 over the city of Wuhan, in China. Results show that the proposed method can not only detect the time-series change from different sensors, but it can also better suppress the influence of speckle noise and improve the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient.

TI  - A Universal Destriping Framework Combining 1-D and 2-D Variational Optimization Methods
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Striping effects are a common phenomenon in remote-sensing imaging systems, and they can exhibit considerable differences between different sensors. Such artifacts can greatly degrade the quality of the measured data and further limit the subsequent applications in higher level remotesensing products. Although a lot of destriping methods have been proposed to date, a few of them are robust to different types of stripes. In this paper, we conduct a thorough feature analysis of stripe noise from a novel perspective. With regard to the problem of striping diversity and complexity, we propose a universal destriping framework. In the proposed destriping procedure, a 1-D variational method is first designed and utilized to estimate the statistical feature-based guidance. The guidance information is then incorporated into 2-D optimization to control the image estimation for a reliable and clean output. The iteratively reweighted least-squares method and alternating direction method of multipliers are exploited in the proposed approach to solve the minimization problems. Experiments under various cases of simulated and real stripes confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed model in terms of the qualitative and quantitative comparisons with other approaches.

TI  - Scene Classification Based on Two-Stage Deep Feature Fusion
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In convolutional neural networks (CNNs), higher layer information is more abstract and more task specific, so people usually concern themselves with fully connected (FC) layer features, believing that lower layer features are less discriminative. However, a few researchers showed that the lower layers also provide very rich and powerful information for image representation. In view of these study findings, in this letter, we attempt to adaptively and explicitly combine the activations from intermediate and FC layers to generate a new CNN with directed acyclic graph topology, which is called the converted CNN. After that, two converted CNNs are integrated together to further improve the classification performance. We validate our proposed two-stage deep feature fusion model over two publicly available remote sensing data sets, and achieve a state-of-the-art performance in scene classification tasks.

TI  - Low-Frequency Noise in Hybrid-Phase-Microstructure ITO-Stabilized ZnO Thin-Film Transistors
T2  - IEEE ELECTRON DEVICE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Low-frequency noise (LFN) in hybrid-phase-microstructure ITO-stabilized ZnO thin-film transistors is investigated. The measured drain current noise power spectral densities obey the classical 1/f(gamma) noise theory, with gamma about 0.9. When V-gs-V-th is low, the gate voltage dependent noise data closely follow the carrier number with correlated mobility fluctuation (Delta N - Delta mu) model, and the average Hooge's parameter in the channel is extracted to be about 1.1x10(-2). Moreover, the contribution of contact resistance to LFN is further studied. Dominated by the channel and the contact, the normalized noise varies with two slopes (m = -1. x and 0) with an increase of the effective gate voltage. Finally, the normalized noise versus drain current results are simulated by considering contact resistance.

TI  - Complex surface deformation monitoring and mechanism inversion over Qingxu-Jiaocheng, China with multi-sensor SAR images
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEODYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Qingxu-Jiaocheng, China has been suffering severe land subsidence along with the development of ground fissure, which are controlled by local fault and triggered by groundwater withdrawal. With multi-sensor SAR images, we study the spatiotemporal evolution of ground deformation over Qingxu-Jiaocheng with an IPTA InSAR technique and assess the role of groundwater withdrawal to the observed deformation. Discrete GPS measurements are applied to verify the InSAR results. The RMSE of the differences between InSAR and GPS, i.e. ALOS and GPS and Envisat and GPS, are 5.7 mm and 6.3 mm in the LOS direction, respectively. The east-west and vertical components of the observed deformation from 2007 to 2010 are decomposed by using descending track Envisat and ascending-track ALOS interferograms, indicating that the east-west component cannot be neglected when the deformation is large or the ground fissure is active. Four phases of land subsidence in the study region are successfully retrieved, and its spatiotemporal evolution is quantitatively analyzed. Lastly, a flat lying sill model with distributed contractions is implemented to model the InSAR deformation over Qingxu-Jiaocheng, which manifests that the ground deformation is mainly caused by groundwater withdrawal. This research provides new insights into the land subsidence monitoring and its mechanism inversion over Qingxu-Jiaocheng region.

TI  - Dynamic <SUP>18</SUP>F-FDG PET Lymphography for In Vivo Identification of Lymph Node Metastases in Murine Melanoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Positron lymphography using F-18-FDG followed by Cerenkov-guided resection of lymph nodes in healthy mice has previously been introduced by our group. Our aim in this study was to further assess the technique's potential beyond merely localizing sentinel lymph nodes. We now aimed to evaluate the potential of positron lymphography to characterize the nodes with respect to their tumor status in order to identify metastatic lymph nodes. We explored whether metastatic nodes could be distinguished from normal nodes via dynamic F-18-FDG lymphography, to then be resected under Cerenkov imaging guidance. Methods: A murine melanoma cell line highly metastatic to lymph nodes (B16F10) was implanted subcutaneously on the dorsal hind paw of C57 mice while the tumor-free contralateral leg served as an intraindividual control. A model of reactive lymph nodes after concanavalin A challenge served as an additional control to provide nonmalignant inflammatory lymphadenopathy. Dynamic PET/CT imaging was performed immediately after injection of F-18-FDG around the tumor or intracutaneously in the contralateral footpad. Furthermore, PET/CT and Cerenkov studies were performed repeatedly over time to follow the course of metastatic spread. In selected mice, popliteal lymph nodes underwent Cerenkov luminescence imaging. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was done to verify the presence of lymphatic melanoma infiltration. Results: Positron lymphography using F-18-FDG was successfully performed on tumor-bearing and non-tumor-bearing mice, as well as on controls bearing sites of inflammation; the results clearly identified the sentinel lymph node basin and delineated the lymphatic drainage. Significantly prolonged retention of activity was evident in metastatic nodes as compared with controls without tumor. On the basis of these results, the contrast in detection and identification of metastatic lymph nodes was distinct and could be used for guided lymph node resection, such as by using Cerenkov luminescence imaging. However, retention after F-18-FDG lymphography was also seen in acute inflammatory lymphadenopathy. Conclusion: In a tumor model, significantly longer retention of the radiotracer during F-18-FDG lymphography was seen in metastatic than nonmetastatic lymph nodes, allowing for differentiation between the two and for selective resection of tumor-bearing nodes using Cerenkov imaging. Inflammation can be better differentiated in a subacute state.

TI  - Spatial evaluation of Indonesia's 2015 fire-affected area and estimated carbon emissions using Sentinel-1
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Fires raged once again across Indonesia in the latter half of 2015, creating a state of emergency due to poisonous smoke and haze across Southeast Asia as well as incurring great financial costs to the government. A strong El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) led to drought in many parts of Indonesia, resulting in elevated fire occurrence comparable with the previous catastrophic event in 1997/1998. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data promise to provide improved detection of land use and land cover changes in the tropics as compared to methodologies dependent upon cloud- and haze-free images. This study presents the first spatially explicit estimates of burned area across Sumatra, Kalimantan, and West Papua based on high-resolution Sentinel-1A SAR imagery. Here, we show that 4,604,569 hectares (ha) were burned during the 2015 fire season (overall accuracy 84%), and compare this with other existing operational burned area products (MCD64, GFED4.0, GFED4.1s). Intersection of burned area with fine-scale land cover and peat layer maps indicates that 0.89gigatons carbon dioxide equivalents (GtCO(2)e) were released through the fire event. This result is compared to other estimates based on nonspatially explicit thermal anomaly measurements or atmospheric monitoring. Using freely available SAR C-band data from the Sentinel mission, we argue that the presented methodology is able to quickly and precisely detect burned areas, supporting improvement in fire control management as well as enhancing accuracy of emissions estimation.

TI  - Mapping Cropland Abandonment in the Aral Sea Basin with MODIS Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cropland abandonment is globally widespread and has strong repercussions for regional food security and the environment. Statistics suggest that one of the hotspots of abandoned cropland is located in the drylands of the Aral Sea Basin (ASB), which covers parts of post-Soviet Central Asia, Afghanistan and Iran. To date, the exact spatial and temporal extents of abandoned cropland remain unclear, which hampers land-use planning. Abandoned land is a potentially valuable resource for alternative land uses. Here, we mapped the abandoned cropland in the drylands of the ASB with a time series of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) from 2003-2016. To overcome the restricted ability of a single classifier to accurately map land-use classes across large areas and agro-environmental gradients, stratum-specific classifiers were calibrated and classification results were fused based on a locally weighted decision fusion approach. Next, the agro-ecological suitability of abandoned cropland areas was evaluated. The stratum-specific classification approach yielded an overall accuracy of 0.879, which was significantly more accurate ( < 0.05) than a global classification without stratification, which had an accuracy of 0.811. In 2016, the classification results showed that 13% (1.15 Mha) of the observed irrigated cropland in the ASB was idle (abandoned). Cropland abandonment occurred mostly in the Amudarya and Syrdarya downstream regions and was associated with degraded land and areas prone to water stress. Despite the almost twofold population growth and increasing food demand in the ASB area from 1990 to 2016, abandoned cropland was also located in areas with high suitability for farming. The map of abandoned cropland areas provides a novel basis for assessing the causes leading to abandoned cropland in the ASB. This contributes to assessing the suitability of abandoned cropland for food or bioenergy production, carbon storage, or assessing the environmental trade-offs and social constraints of recultivation.

TI  - Expansion Analysis of Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomeration Using DMSP/OLS Nighttime Light Imagery for 1993 to 2012
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Investigating the characteristics of urban expansion is helpful in managing the relationship between urbanization and the ecological and environmental issues related to sustainable development. The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program/Operational Line-scan System (DMSP/OLS) collects visible and near-infrared light from the Earth's surface at night without moonlight. It generates effective time series data for mapping the dynamics of urban expansion. As a major urban agglomeration in the world, the Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomeration (YRDUA) is an important intersection zone of both the Belt and Road Initiative and the Yangtze River Economic Belt in China. Therefore, this paper analyses urban expansion characteristics of the YRDUA for 1993-2012 from urban extents extracted from the DMSP/OLS for 1993, 1997, 2002, 2007, and 2012. First, calibration procedures are applied to DMSP/OLS data, including intercalibration, intra-annual composition, and inter-annual series correction procedures. Spatial extents are then extracted from the corrected DMSP/OLS data, and a threshold is determined via the spatial comparison method. Finally, three models are used to explore urban expansion characteristics of the YRDUA from expansion rates, expansion spatial patterns, and expansion evaluations. The results show that the urban expansion of the YRDUA occurred at an increasing rate from 1993-2007 and then declined after 2007 with the onset of the global financial crisis. The Suxichang and Ningbo metropolitan circles were seriously affected by the financial crisis, while the Hefei metropolitan circle was not. The urban expansion of the YRDUA moved from the northeast to the southwest over the 20-year period. Urban expansion involved internal infilling over the first 15 years and then evolved into external sprawl and suburbanization after 2007.

TI  - Rare, Uncommon, and Unusual Complications After Pancreaticoduodenal Resection
T2  - SURGICAL CLINICS OF NORTH AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Complications after pancreaticoduodenal resection (PDR) occur in at least 30% of patients. Most are a direct result of an intraoperative event, dissection, or anastomoses, which account for the most serious morbidities, sepsis, pseudoaneurysms, and hemorrhage. Rarely, complications are due to the systemic impact of the procedure even if the procedure itself was unremarkable. Rare systemic complications after PDR (transfusion-transmitted babesiosis, pituitary apoplexy, and TRALI) and a number of uncommon and unusual other complications are discussed. Pancreaticoduodenal resection is a significant operation with serious consequences. Decisions on selection of candidates and safe operations should be thoughtful and always in surgeons' minds.

TI  - An Object Similarity-Based Thresholding Method for Urban Area Mapping from Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite Day/Night Band (VIIRS DNB) Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Nighttime light data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Day/Night Band (DNB) provides a unique data source for mapping and monitoring urban areas at regional and global scales. This study proposes an object similarity-based thresholding method using VIIRS DNB data to map urban areas. The threshold for a target potential urban object was determined by comparing its similarity with all reference urban objects with known optimal thresholds derived from Landsat data. The proposed method includes four major steps: potential urban object generation, threshold optimization for reference urban objects, object similarity comparison, and urban area mapping. The proposed method was evaluated using VIIRS DNB data of China and compared with existing mapping methods in terms of threshold estimation and urban area mapping. The results indicated that the proposed method estimated thresholds and mapped urban areas accurately and generally performed better than the cluster-based logistic regression method. The correlation coefficients between the estimated thresholds and the reference thresholds were 0.9201-0.9409 (using Euclidean distance as similarity measure) and 0.9461-0.9523 (using Mahalanobis distance as similarity measure) for the proposed method and 0.9435-0.9503 for the logistic regression method. The average Kappa Coefficients of the urban area maps were 0.58 (Euclidean distance) and 0.57 (Mahalanobis distance) for the proposed method and 0.51 for the logistic regression method. The proposed method shows potential to map urban areas at a regional scale effectively in an economic and convenient way.

T2  - Journal of Experimental Biology
M3  - Article
AB  - Thecosomatous pteropods, a group of aragonite shell-bearing zooplankton, are becoming an important sentinel organism for understanding the influence of ocean acidification on pelagic organisms. These animals show vulnerability to changing carbonate chemistry conditions, are geographically widespread, and are both biogeochemically and trophically important. The objective of this study was to determine how increasing duration and severity of CO2 treatment influence the physiology of the thecosome Limacina retroversa, integrating both gene expression and organism-level (respiration and calcification) metrics. We exposed pteropods to over-saturated, near-saturated or under-saturated conditions and sampled individuals at 1, 3, 7, 14 and 21 days of exposure to test for the effect of duration. We found that calcification was affected by borderline and under-saturated conditions by week two, while respiration appeared to be more strongly influenced by an interaction between severity and duration of exposure, showing complex changes by one week of exposure. The organismal metrics were corroborated by specific gene expression responses, with increased expression of biomineralization-associated genes in the medium and high treatments throughout and complex changes in metabolic genes corresponding to both captivity and CO2 treatment. Genes associated with other physiological processes such as lipid metabolism, neural function and ion pumping had complex responses, influenced by both duration and severity. Beyond these responses, our findings detail the captivity effects for these pelagic organisms, providing information to contextualize the conclusions of previous studies, and emphasizing a need for better culturing protocols.

TI  - Use of Acupuncture in the United States Military Healthcare System
T2  - MEDICAL ACUPUNCTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: The Military Healthcare System (MHS) shows increasing interest in acupuncture as an alternative to opioids for pain control. However, specific factors associated with this procedure in the MHS are not well-described in literature. This study examines usage within the MHS to determine patterns among the diagnoses, provider types, and facilities associated with acupuncture.Materials and Methods: Acupuncture-treated patients were identified from TRICARE claims data in the MHS Data Repository as having at least one acupuncture treatment in fiscal year (FY) 2014. Bivariate analysis was performed to determine demographics, diagnoses, and number of visits, for both active-duty and nonactive-duty personnel. Descriptive statistics were used to show associated provider and facility types.Results: A total of 15,761 people received acupuncture in the MHS in FY 2014. Use of acupuncture was greater for Army service, white race, and senior enlisted rank overall, and for males ages 26-35 among active-duty and females ages 46-64 among nonactive-duty beneficiaries. A cumulative 76% of diagnoses were for musculoskeletal or nerve and system issues. Approximately 60% of patients received acupuncture from physicians, 16% from physical therapists or chiropractors, and 9.7% from physician extenders. Specific acupuncture techniques (traditional, auricular, etc.) could not be determined from the data set.Conclusions: The most common diagnoses associated with acupuncture are consistent with pain management. However, full analysis is hampered by inconsistent coding and lack of granularity regarding specific techniques. Given the popularity of acupuncture in the MHS, further research is necessary to explore the full scope of this intervention.

TI  - Cover crop termination techniques affect ground predation within an organic vegetable rotation system: A test with artificial caterpillars
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - We studied the impact that two agro-ecological service crops or ASC, (vetch and barley), and two different ASC termination techniques (using a roller crimper or green manure) had on predation pressure in an organic vegetable system. We compared these two ASC termination techniques with a biodegradable plastic mulch, commonly used to control weeds in vegetable organic systems, over two consecutive growing seasons (2014-2015).Predation pressure was evaluated by means of artificial caterpillars made of green plasticine. Attack marks left on them were assigned to predators including chewing insects, birds and mammals. The frequencies of attack were significantly correlated with the activity density of carabids. In both experiments, carabid activity density was higher in ASC terminations than in the biodegradable plastic mulch control.Predation rate was significantly higher in the field with vetch flattened by roller crimper, while no significant difference was detected between termination techniques or in comparison with the control when barley was used as an ASC. The rate of ASC decomposition was higher in vetch than in barley and this could be the reason for the higher activity density of springtails in vetch. Carabid activity density was also positively correlated with springtail abundance.In conclusion, our field experiments showed that artificial caterpillars could represent a good standardized method to assess predation pressure in different habitats.

TI  - Using PS-InSAR to detect surface deformation in geothermal areas of West Java in Indonesia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, the Persistent Scatterer InSAR (PS-InSAR) technique is applied in order to investigate the ground deformation in and around two geothermal areas in West Java, Indonesia. Two time-series of ALOS PALSAR and Sentinel-1A acquisitions, covering the period from 2007 to 2009 and 2015-2016, are analysed. The first case study examines the Wayang Windu geothermal zone where the PS-InSAR analysis provides an overview of the surface deformation around a geothermal reservoir. Uplift is observed around the injection wells in the area. The second example involves the use of the PS-InSAR technique over a more recent geothermal system in Patuha field. Again, a pattern of uplift was observed around the only available injection well in the area. Due to the dense vegetation coverage of the geothermal areas in West Java, the longer wavelength ALOS PALSAR data is provides better results by identifying a larger number of PS points. Additionally, experiments have been carried out to compare the resulting deformation with another example of the fluid migration process i.e. water extraction in Bandung basin. The potential of sentinel-1A and ALOS PALSR data are compared in all the experiments.

TI  - Semi-Automatic Operational Service for Drought Monitoring and Forecasting in the Tuscany Region
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - A drought-monitoring and forecasting system developed for the Tuscany region was improved in order to provide a semi-automatic, more detailed, timely and comprehensive operational service for decision making, water authorities, researchers and general stakeholders. Ground-based and satellite data from different sources (regional meteorological stations network, MODIS Terra satellite and CHIRPS/CRU precipitation datasets) are integrated through an open-source, interoperable SDI (spatial data infrastructure) based on PostgreSQL/PostGIS to produce vegetation and precipitation indices that allow following of the occurrence and evolution of a drought event. The SDI allows the dissemination of comprehensive, up-to-date and customizable information suitable for different end-users through different channels, from a web page and monthly bulletins, to interoperable web services, and a comprehensive climate service. The web services allow geospatial elaborations on the fly, and the geo-database can be increased with new input/output data to respond to specific requests or to increase the spatial resolution.

TI  - BIOLOGICAL METAPHYSICAL SCIENTISM IN ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF ALTRUISM AND EGOISM
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this research is philosophical analysis of the most influential approach to the explanation of altruism and egoism as phenomena of natural and cultural human existence, which are represented by biology. Nowadays biology is the leader of the scientific avantgarde. The research focuses on the most debatable parts of biology (sociobiology, evolutionary ethics and psychology, human etiology), and offers a solution to the problem of altruism and egoism, their functional characteristics in nature and culture. The methodology of the analysis has been determined by a look at the ongoing scientism of culture and philosophy from the standpoint of the dialectical method. The problem solved in the given article is connected with the contrariety and ambiguity of the understanding of altruism and egoism in humanitarian knowledge and with the specific apology of naturalism caused by confident claims to explain these phenomena by the rapidly developing complex of biological sciences. This problem can be formulated in the following questions: What does the "Bio Big Bang" observed in the Humanities mean? How can we explain the apparent lack of alternatives to naturalism in solving the problem of altruism and egoism? It is proved that the conceptualization and absolutization of models of altruism and egoism that have been developed in these areas of knowledge are, in fact, a methodological and worldview expansion of biology which can be qualified as a biological form of metaphysic scientism and denoted by the term "biocracy". The authors have revealed two types of such scientism: traditional, where nature is a subject which exceeds a human in its power and wisdom, and innovative, where nature is an object which can be technically modernized up to a biotechnological modernization of morality ("ethic eugenics"). The authors have shown that sociobiology is a kind of a reverse toward traditional biological scientism and has the meaning of a preventive measure. It implicitly expresses concern for the modern scale of innovative transformations of human nature and articulates the request for "naturalization". It contributes to the formation of a different, "biophilic" attitude to nature, which increases our chances for survival as a minimum, for salvation as a maximum. Sociobiology reminds that the mind and the altruistic-moral principle had a common genesis. If altruism performs the function of species protection in the animal world, it performs the functions of protection of humans and culture in human society. But the tension of the long "leash", by which nature constrains culture, becomes critical. If it breaks, this aromorphosis in the history of our species will be the last on the way to a posthuman future in which, obviously, there will be no problem of altruism and egoism.

TI  - Elevation and Mass Changes of the Southern Patagonia Icefield Derived from TanDEM-X and SRTM Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The contribution to sea level rise from Patagonian icefields is one of the largest mass losses outside the large ice sheets of Antarctica and Greenland. However, only a few studies have provided large-scale assessments in a spatially detailed way to address the reaction of individual glaciers in Patagonia and hence to better understand and explain the underlying processes. In this work, we use repeat radar interferometric measurements of the German TerraSAR-X-Add-on for Digital Elevation Measurements (TanDEM-X) satellite constellation between 2011/12 and 2016 together with the digital elevation model from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) in 2000 in order to derive surface elevation and mass changes of the Southern Patagonia Icefield (SPI). Our results reveal a mass loss rate of -11.84 +/- 3.3 Gta(-1) (corresponding to 0.033 +/- 0.009 mma(-1) sea level rise) for an area of 12573 km(2) in the period 2000-2015/16. This equals a specific glacier mass balance of -0.941 +/- 0.19 m w.e.a(-1) for the whole SPI. These values are comparable with previous estimates since the 1970s, but a magnitude larger than mass change rates reported since the Little Ice Age. The spatial pattern reveals that not all glaciers respond similarly to changes and that various factors need to be considered in order to explain the observed changes. Our multi-temporal coverage of the southern part of the SPI (south of 50.3 degrees S) shows that the mean elevation change rates do not vary significantly over time below the equilibrium line. However, we see indications for more positive mass balances due to possible precipitation increase in 2014 and 2015. We conclude that bi-static radar interferometry is a suitable tool to accurately measure glacier volume and mass changes in frequently cloudy regions. We recommend regular repeat TanDEM-X acquisitions to be scheduled for the maximum summer melt extent in order to minimize the effects of radar signal penetration and to increase product quality.

TI  - Evaluating meander shifting dynamics (1977-2017) of the Bhagirathi river course in Murshidabad District, West Bengal, India
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Discernibility of Bhagirathi river course change detection was prepared via Remote Sensing and GIS in Murshidabad district among 41 years of period (1977-2017). Landsat MSS, TM, ETM+, TM, OLI sensor data from 1977, 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2017 respectively were considered to demarcate the chronological changes of the river course. Normalized Difference Water Index was used to extract the surface water bodies. Seventy-seven cross sections have been drawn to delimit the river course shifting pattern. The results shows that he Bhagirathi river course has been shifting towards south and west direction in different places, particularly in the lower and middle courses of the river. The adjacent riverine region has remained undeveloped due to infrastructure damaged by flood, changing course. Therefore, present study may be helpful for the overall management and planning for future prevention of flood, changing course, loss of properties.

T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluated the opportunities and challenges of using drones to obtain multispectral orthomosaics at ultra-high resolution that could be useful for monitoring large and heterogeneous burned areas. We conducted a survey using an octocopter equipped with a Parrot SEQUOIA multispectral camera in a 3000 ha framework located within the perimeter of a megafire in Spain. We assessed the quality of both the camera raw imagery and the multispectral orthomosaic obtained, as well as the required processing capability. Additionally, we compared the spatial information provided by the drone orthomosaic at ultra-high spatial resolution with another image provided by the WorldView-2 satellite at high spatial resolution. The drone raw imagery presented some anomalies, such as horizontal banding noise and non-homogeneous radiometry. Camera locations showed a lack of synchrony of the single frequency GPS receiver. The georeferencing process based on ground control points achieved an error lower than 30 cm in X-Y and lower than 55 cm in Z. The drone orthomosaic provided more information in terms of spatial variability in heterogeneous burned areas in comparison with the WorldView-2 satellite imagery. The drone orthomosaic could constitute a viable alternative for the evaluation of post-fire vegetation regeneration in large and heterogeneous burned areas.

TI  - Retrieval of Land-surface Temperature from AMSR2 Data Using a Deep Dynamic Learning Neural Network
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - It is more difficult to retrieve land surface temperature (LST) from passive microwave remote sensing data than from thermal remote sensing data, because the emissivities in the passive microwave band can change more easily than those in the thermal infrared band. Thus, it is very difficult to build a stable relationship. Passive microwave band emissivities are greatly influenced by the soil moisture, which varies with time. This makes it difficult to develop a general physical algorithm. This paper proposes a method to utilize multiple-satellite, sensors and resolution coupled with a deep dynamic learning neural network to retrieve the land surface temperature from images acquired by the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2), a sensor that is similar to the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer Earth Observing System (AMSR-E). The AMSR-E and MODIS sensors are located aboard the Aqua satellite. The MODIS LST product is used as the ground truth data to overcome the difficulties in obtaining large scale land surface temperature data. The mean and standard deviation of the retrieval error are approximately 1.4A degrees and 1.9A degrees when five frequencies (ten channels, 10.7, 18.7, 23.8, 36.5, 89 V/H GHz) are used. This method can effectively eliminate the influences of the soil moisture, roughness, atmosphere and various other factors. An analysis of the application of this method to the retrieval of land surface temperature from AMSR2 data indicates that the method is feasible. The accuracy is approximately 1.8A degrees through a comparison between the retrieval results with ground measurement data from meteorological stations.

TI  - Drought and Spatiotemporal Variability of Forest Fires Across Mexico
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the spatiotemporal links between drought and forest fire occurrence is crucial for improving decision-making in fire management under current and future climatic conditions. We quantified forest fire activity in Mexico using georeferenced fire records for the period of 2005-2015 and examined its spatial and temporal relationships with a multiscalar drought index, the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). A total of 47 975 fire counts were recorded in the 11-year long study period, with the peak in fire frequency occurring in 2011. We identified four fire clusters, i.e., regions where there is a high density of fire records in Mexico using the Getis-Ord G spatial statistic. Then, we examined fire frequency data in the clustered regions and assessed how fire activity related to the SPEI for the entire study period and also for the year 2011. Associations between the SPEI and fire frequency varied across Mexico and fire-SPEI relationships also varied across the months of major fire occurrence and related SPEI temporal scales. In particular, in the two fire clusters located in northern Mexico (Chihuahua, northern Baja California), drier conditions over the previous 5 months triggered fire occurrence. In contrast, we did not observe a significant relationship between drought severity and fire frequency in the central Mexico cluster, which exhibited the highest fire frequency. We also found moderate fire-drought associations in the cluster situated in the tropical southern Chiapas where agriculture activities are the main causes of forest fire occurrence. These results are useful for improving our understanding of the spatiotemporal patterns of fire occurrence as related to drought severity in megadiverse countries hosting many forest types as Mexico.

TI  - Clinical trials in menopause
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
M3  - Review
AB  - Objective:Clinical trials in menopause have undergone much scrutiny over the years. This has led to significant shifts in the treatment of symptomatic menopause and a substantial impact on women. We aim to delineate the key studies contributing to this controversy and highlight new directions specifically related to menopausal hormone therapy (HT) and vascular disease risk.Methods:We performed a search of sentinel studies delineating the risks and benefits of HT in otherwise healthy postmenopausal women. Using PubMed we input the following search terms: hormone replacement therapy, cardiovascular disease, coronary artery disease, coronary atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, angina, coronary heart calcification, carotid intimal thickness, lipids, and/or lipoproteins. We included studies of menopausal women (surgical or natural) using combined estrogen/progestogen therapy or estrogen-only therapy that looked at cardiovascular disease risk factors or outcomes. Studies were evaluated for inclusion by the authors; however, this is not intended to be a systematic or an exhaustive analysis.Results:In women close to the time of menopause, there is a decreased risk of subclinical and clinical coronary heart disease with menopausal HT. Additionally, HT confers a significant benefit to vasomotor symptoms of menopause, bone health, and colorectal cancer. There is an increased risk of venous thromboembolism with oral formulations that appears mitigated with transdermal estradiol. Mixed data regarding breast cancer risk are available, with some studies suggesting an increased risk of invasive breast cancer with estrogen/progestogen therapy and a null effect with estrogen-only therapy. Other more long-term epidemiologic studies identify a decreased risk.Conclusions:The available literature suggests that HT is a viable option for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in postmenopausal women. Newer trials will likely verify this assessment. If this is enough to change clinical practice, however, remains to be seen given the general fear of HT by many with prescriptive authority, and also the women in our care.

TI  - Ecology-based evaluation of groundwater ecosystems under intensive agriculture: A combination of community analysis and sentinel exposure
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological criteria are needed for a comprehensive evaluation of groundwater ecosystem health by including biological components with the physical and chemical properties that are already required by European directives. Two methodological approaches to assess the ecological status of groundwater ecosystems were combined in two alluvial plains (the Ariege and Hers Rivers, southwestern France) varying in agriculture intensity (from grassland to crop rotation including maize and sunflower, and to maize monoculture). In the first approach, the composition of invertebrate assemblages (only obligate-groundwater crustaceans, i.e. stygobionts) sampled in 28 wells differing in their land use contexts was analysed. Abundance, species richness, and assemblage composition significantly changed with agricultural land use or urbanization around the wells. In the second approach, we tested an in situ exposure of sentinel organisms to quantify their response to the environmental pressures. The epigean and native amphipod species Gammarus cf. orinos was used as the sentinel species. Amphipods (30 individuals in each of 10 wells) were exposed for one week to the in situ conditions at two seasons with contrasted concentrations of pollutants. The Ecophysiological Index (EPI) synthetizing the survival rates and energetic storage decreased in wells with low oxygen and high nitrate concentrations, but only during the highest contamination period. Atrazine-related compounds negatively impacted sentinel health whatever the season. The combination of these two approaches may have major applications for orientating groundwater ecosystem management. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Lava flows and cinder cones at Barren Island volcano, India (2005-2017): a spatio-temporal analysis using satellite images
T2  - BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Barren Island volcano erupted during January-February 2017. Located near the Andaman trench and over a subduction zone, it is the only active volcano in India. It comprises a prominent caldera within which there is a polygenetic intra-caldera cinder cone system, with a record of eruptive events which date back to eighteenth century (1787-1832). Major eruptions occurred in 1991, 1994-1995, 2005 and, since 2008, the volcano has been showing near continuous activity with periodic eruptions. We used coarse spatial resolution "fire" products (Band I4) from Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite to detect days of eruption during the January-February 2017 period. Moderate spatial resolution (23.5 m) short-wavelength infrared (SWIR) data of Resourcesat-2 Linear Imaging Self Scanning Sensor-III available for specific days during this period were used to verify signatures of volcanic eruption. Thermal infrared band data fromthe Landsat series over the 2005-2017 periods were used to estimate the brightness temperature and location of the active vent within the polygenetic cinder cone field. High-spatial resolution images (1-5.8 m) in the visible bands (Resourcesat-2 LISS-IV, Cartosat-1 and 2) were used to delineate the changes in overall morphology of the volcano and to identify an inner crater ring fault, new paths of lava flow and the formation of a new cinder cone on the old crater. These multitemporal data sets show significant changes in the paths of lava flows from 2005 to 2017. The observations also document periodic shifts in the location of effusive vents. Morphogenetic changes in recent eruptive phases of the Barren Island volcano were successfully delineated using a combination of multi-temporal and multi-resolution satellite images in visible, SWIR and thermal infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.

TI  - Comparison of RS/GIS analysis with classic mapping approaches for siting low-yield boreholes for hand pumps in crystalline terrains. An application to rural communities of the Caimbambo province, Angola
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In poverty-stricken regions of Sub-Saharan Africa, groundwater for supply is often obtained by means of hand pumps, which means that low-yield boreholes are acceptable. However, boreholes are often sited without sufficient hydrogeological information due to budget constraints, which leads to high failure rates. Cost-effective techniques for borehole siting need to be developed in order to maximize the success rate. In regions underlain by granite, weathered formations are usually targeted for drilling, as these are generally presented as a better cost-benefit ratio than the fractured basement. Within this context, this research focuses on a granite region of Angola. A comparison of two mapping techniques for borehole siting-groundwater prospect is presented. A classic hydrogeomorphological map was developed first based on aerial photographs, field mapping and a geophysical survey. This map represents a considerable time investment and was developed by qualified technicians. The second map (RS/GIS) is considerably simpler and more cost-effective. It was developed by the integration in a GIS platform of six maps of equal importance-slope, drainage density, vegetation vigor, presence of clay in the soil, lineaments and rock outcrops-prepared from Landsat 8 imagery and a Digital Elevation Model (DEM). Similar results were obtained in both cases. By means of a supervised classification of Landsat images, RS/GIS analysis allows for the identification of granitic outcrops, house clusters and sandy alluvial valleys. This in turn allows for the delineation of low-interest or contamination-prone areas, thus contributing additional qualitative information. The position of a well that is going to be powered by a handpump is chosen also upon social and local matters as the distance to the stakeholders, information that are not difficult to integrate in the GIS. Although the second map needs some field inputs (i.e. surveys to determine the thickness of the weathered pack), results show that RS/GIS analyses such as this one provide a valuable and cost-effective alternative for siting low-yield boreholes in remote regions.

TI  - Dynamics and patterns of land levelling for agricultural reclamation of erosional badlands in Chambal Valley (Madhya Pradesh, India)
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Gully and badland erosion constitute important land-degradation processes with severe on-site and off-site effects above all in sedimentary deposits and alluvial soils of the arid and semi-arid regions. Agricultural use of the affected land is impeded both by the irreversible loss of topsoil and the morphological dissection of the terrain. In various badland regions around the world, a solution to the latter problem is attempted by infilling of gullies and levelling of badland topography in order restore a morphology suitable for agricultural cultivation. Gully and badland levelling for agricultural reclamation has been conducted for decades in the large ravine lands of India. This study aims at analysing the distribution and dynamics of land levelling within the Chambal badlands in Morena district, Madhya Pradesh, between 1971 and 2015. Using high to medium resolution satellite images from the Corona, Landsat, Aster and RapidEye missions and a multi-temporal classification approach, we have mapped and quantified areas that were newly levelled within eight observation periods. We analysed the spatial relation of levelled land to several physical and socio-economic factors that potentially influence the choice of reclamation site by employing geographic information system (GIS) analysis methods and results from focus-group discussions in selected villages. Results show that nearly 38km(2) or 23% of the badlands in the study area have been levelled within 45years. The levelling rate generally increases during the observation period, but the annual variability is high. We have found spatial relationships to badland morphology, vicinity of existing cropland and proximity to villages and drainage lines. From a socio-economic point of view, availability of financial and technical means, access rights to the badland and ownership issues play an important role. Considering studies on soil degradation caused by levelling of badlands in other regions, the sustainability of the newly reclaimed fields in the Chambal badlands is questionable.

TI  - Directional probe for radio-guided surgery: A pilot study
T2  - MEDICAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: The sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy technique has highly evolved during the last 20 yr. Consequently, the intraoperative use of Gamma Probes (GPs) for SLN mapping is increased. This preliminary study evaluates a novel directional GP prototype. This proof-of-concept prototype is designed to identify the direction of radiopharmaceuticals uptakes, by combining the information from multiple detectors. The purpose of this work is to develop a tool able to effectively guide the surgeon reducing the surgery time.Methods: The proposed prototype consists of three CsI(Tl) scintillation crystals, each coupled with an S10931 silicon photomultiplier (Hamamatsu Photonics K. K., Hamamatsu, JP). The three detectors lie on the same plane with an angle of 30 degrees between them. The central detector is placed as in a common GP, so it can be used to pinpoint the target tissue. Meanwhile, the lateral sensors provide a broader view of the surgical field. A dedicated data acquisition system digitizes and processes the signals from the front-end electronics. Finally, an embedded system, based on ARM processor, calculates and displays the acquired count rates. In order to assess the prototype behavior, the isosensitivity curves for the three detectors were measured. Meanwhile, for the central one, the main quality criteria measurements were also performed (i.e., sensitivity, radial sensitivity, and spatial resolution).Results: For the central detector, the measured sensitivity at the tip of the probe is better than 5 cps/kBq. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the radial sensitivity is less than 30 degrees and the FWHM of the lateral sensitivity (spatial resolution) is about 7.2 mm. The central detector measured isosensitivity distribution shows a narrow profile in agreement with the spatial resolution measured. On the contrary, the two lateral detectors exhibit widespread isosensitivity distributions that mean a larger field of view. The system had shown satisfactory performance and reliability, meeting the minimal requirements of gamma probe systems.Conclusions: The prototype presented in this paper allows a rapid localization by the use of the whole system, while the sole central detector can be used to pinpoint the target source. This device, unlike common GPs, allows localizing simultaneously different areas of radiopharmaceuticals uptake, thus precisely guiding the surgeon to the region of interest. These preliminary results encourage to develop a further prototype for intraoperative validation. (C) 2017 American Association of Physicists in Medicine

TI  - Water Quality Drivers in 11 Gulf of Mexico Estuaries
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal water-quality is both a primary driver and also a consequence of coastal ecosystem health. Turbidity, a measure of dissolved and particulate water-quality matter, is a proxy for water quality, and varies on daily to interannual periods. Turbidity is influenced by a variety of factors, including algal particles, colored dissolved organic matter, and suspended sediments. Identifying which factors drive trends and extreme events in turbidity in an estuary helps environmental managers and decision makers plan for and mitigate against water-quality issues. Efforts to do so on large spatial scales have been hampered due to limitations of turbidity data, including coarse and irregular temporal resolution and poor spatial coverage. We addressed these issues by deriving a proxy for turbidity using ocean color satellite products for 11 Gulf of Mexico estuaries from 2000 to 2014 on weekly, monthly, seasonal, and annual time-steps. Drivers were identified using Akaike's Information Criterion and multiple regressions to model turbidity against precipitation, wind speed, U and V wind vectors, river discharge, water level, and El Nino Southern Oscillation and North Atlantic Oscillation climate indices. Turbidity variability was best explained by wind speed across estuaries for both time-series and extreme turbidity events, although more dynamic patterns were found between estuaries over various time steps.

TI  - Spatiotemporal patterns of unburned areas within fire perimeters in the northwestern United States from 1984 to 2014
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - A warming climate, fire exclusion, and land cover changes are altering the conditions that produced historical fire regimes and facilitating increased recent wildfire activity in the northwestern United States. Understanding the impacts of changing fire regimes on forest recruitment and succession, species distributions, carbon cycling, and ecosystem services is critical, but challenging across broad spatial scales. One important and understudied aspect of fire regimes is the unburned area within fire perimeters; these areas can function as fire refugia across the landscape during and after wildfire by providing habitat and seed sources. With increasing fire activity, there is speculation that fire intensity and combustion completeness are also increasing, which we hypothesized would yield smaller unburned proportions and changes in fire refugia patterns. We sought to determine (1) whether the unburned proportion of wildfires decreased across the northwestern United States from 1984 to 2014 and (2) whether patterns of unburned patches were significantly different across ecoregions, land cover type, and land ownership. We utilized a Landsat-derived geospatial database of unburned islands within 2298 fires across the inland northwestern USA (including eastern Washington, eastern Oregon, and Idaho) from 1984 to 2014. We evaluated patterns of the total unburned proportion and spatial patterns of unburned patches of the fires across different ecoregions, land cover types, and land ownership. We found that unburned area proportion exhibited no change over the three decades, suggesting that recent trends in area burned and overall severity have not affected fire refugia, important to post-fire ecosystem recovery. There were ecoregional differences in mean unburned proportion, patch area, and patch density, suggesting influences of vegetation and topography on the formation of unburned area. These foundation findings suggest that complex drivers control unburned island formation, and yield insights to locate potential important fire refugia across the inland northwest.

T2  - INFECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Influenza with its annual epidemic waves is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. However, only little whole genome data are available regarding the molecular epidemiology promoting our understanding of viral spread in human populations.We implemented a RT-PCR strategy starting from patient material to generate influenza A whole genome sequences for molecular epidemiological surveillance. Samples were obtained within the Bavarian Influenza Sentinel. The complete influenza virus genome was amplified by a one-tube multiplex RT-PCR and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq.We report whole genomic sequences for 50 influenza A H3N2 viruses, which was the predominating virus in the season 2014/15, directly from patient specimens. The dataset included random samples from Bavaria (Germany) throughout the influenza season and samples from three suspected transmission clusters. We identified the outbreak samples based on sequence identity. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was superior in resolution compared to analysis of single segments or partial segment analysis. Additionally, we detected manifestation of substantial amounts of viral quasispecies in several patients, carrying mutations varying from the dominant virus in each patient.Our rapid whole genome sequencing approach for influenza A virus shows that WGS can effectively be used to detect and understand outbreaks in large communities. Additionally, the genomic data provide in-depth details about the circulating virus within one season.

TI  - Estimation of Leaf Area Index in a Mountain Forest of Central Japan with a 30-m Spatial Resolution Based on Landsat Operational Land Imager Imagery: An Application of a Simple Model for Seasonal Monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An accurate estimation of the leaf area index (LAI) by satellite remote sensing is essential for studying the spatial variation of ecosystem structure. The goal of this study was to estimate the spatial variation of LAI over a forested catchment in a mountainous landscape (ca. 60 km(2)) in central Japan. We used a simple model to estimate LAI using spectral reflectance by adapting the Monsi-Saeki light attenuation theory for satellite remote sensing. First, we applied the model to Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery to estimate the spatial variation of LAI in spring and summer. Second, we validated the model's performance with in situ LAI estimates at four study plots that included deciduous broadleaf, deciduous coniferous, and evergreen coniferous forest types. Pre-processing of the Landsat OLI imagery, including atmospheric correction by elevation-dependent dark object subtraction and Minnaert topographic correction, together with application of the simple model, enabled a satisfactory 30-m spatial resolution estimation of forest LAI with a maximum of 5.5 +/- 0.2 for deciduous broadleaf and 5.3 +/- 0.2?for evergreen coniferous forest areas. The LAI variation in May (spring) suggested an altitudinal gradient in the degree of leaf expansion, whereas the LAI variation in August (mid-summer) suggested an altitudinal gradient of yearly maximum forest foliage density. This study demonstrated the importance of an accurate estimation of fine-resolution spatial LAI variations for ecological studies in mountainous landscapes, which are characterized by complex terrain and high vegetative heterogeneity.

TI  - Modeling of Alpine Grassland Cover Based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Technology and Multi-Factor Methods: A Case Study in the East of Tibetan Plateau, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Grassland cover and its temporal changes are key parameters in the estimation and monitoring of ecosystems and their functions, especially via remote sensing. However, the most suitable model for estimating grassland cover and the differences between models has rarely been studied in alpine meadow grasslands. In this study, field measurements of grassland cover in Gannan Prefecture, from 2014 to 2016, were acquired using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology. Single-factor parametric and multi-factor parametric/non-parametric cover inversion models were then constructed based on 14 factors related to grassland cover, and the dynamic variation of the annual maximum cover was analyzed. The results show that (1) nine out of 14 factors (longitude, latitude, elevation, the concentrations of clay and sand in the surface and bottom soils, temperature, precipitation, enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)) exert a significant effect on grassland cover in the study area. The logarithmic model based on EVI presents the best performance, with an R-2 and RMSE of 0.52 and 16.96%, respectively. Single-factor grassland cover inversion models account for only 1-49% of the variation in cover during the growth season. (2) The optimum grassland cover inversion model is the artificial neural network (BP-ANN), with an R-2 and RMSE of 0.72 and 13.38%, and SDs of 0.062% and 1.615%, respectively. Both the accuracy and the stability of the BP-ANN model are higher than those of the single-factor parametric models and multi-factor parametric/non-parametric models. (3) The annual maximum cover in Gannan Prefecture presents an increasing trend over 60.60% of the entire study area, while 36.54% is presently stable and 2.86% exhibits a decreasing trend.

TI  - Spring Flood Forecasting Based on the WRF-TSRM Mode
T2  - TEHNICKI VJESNIK-TECHNICAL GAZETTE
M3  - Article
AB  - The snowmelt process is becoming more complex in the context of global warming, and the current existing studies are not effective in using the short-term prediction model to drive the distributed hydrological model to predict snowmelt floods. In this study, we selected the Juntanghu Watershed in Hutubi County of China on the north slope of the Tianshan Mountains as the study area with which to verify the snowmelt flood prediction accuracy of the coupling model. The weather research and forecasting (WRF) model was used to drive a double-layer distributed snowmelt runoff model called the Tianshan Snowmelt Runoff Model (TSRM), which is based on multi-year field snowmelt observations. Moreover, the data from NASA's moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) was employed to validate the snow water equivalent during the snow-melting period. Results show that, based on the analysis of the flow lines in 2009 and 2010, the WRF-driven TSRM has an overall 80% of qualification ratios (QRs), with determination coefficients of 0.85 and 0.82 for the two years, respectively, which demonstrates the high accuracy of the model. However, due to the influence of the ablation of frozen soils, the forecasted flood peak is overestimated. This problem can be solved by an improvement to the modeled frozen soil layers. The conclusion reached in this study suggests that the WRF-driven TSRM can be used to forecast short-term snowmelt floods on the north slope of the Tianshan Mountains, which can effectively improve the local capacity for the forecasting and early warning of snowmelt floods.

AB  - The surface-wind speed influences on aerosol optical depth (AOD), derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua daily observations over the central North Pacific during the period 2003-2016, have been investigated in this study. The cloud coverage is relatively low over the present investigation area compared to other marine areas, which favors AOD derived from passive remote sensing from space. In this study, we have combined MODIS AOD with 2 m wind speed (U-2m) on a satellite-pixel basis, which has been interpolated from National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis. In addition, daily averaged AOD derived from Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) measurements in the free-troposphere at the Mauna Loa Observatory (3397 m above sea level), Hawaii, was subtracted from the MODIS column AOD values. The latter was to reduce the contribution of aerosols above the planetary boundary layer. This study shows relatively strong power-law relationships between MODIS mean AOD and surface-wind speed for marine background conditions in summer, fall and winter of the current period. However, previous established relationships between AOD and surface-wind speed deviate substantially. Even so, for similar marine conditions the present relationship agrees reasonable well with a power-law relationship derived for north-east Atlantic conditions. The present MODIS retrievals of AOD in the marine atmosphere agree reasonably well with ground-based remote sensing of AOD.

TI  - Thermal Anomalies Detect Critical Global Land Surface Changes
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Measurements that link surface conditions and climate can provide critical information on important biospheric changes occurring in the Earth system. As the direct driving force of energy and water fluxes at the surface-atmosphere interface, land surface temperature (LST) provides information on physical processes of land-cover change and energy-balance changes that air temperature cannot provide. Annual maximum LST (LSTmax) is especially powerful at minimizing synoptic and seasonal variability and highlighting changes associated with extreme climatic events and significant land-cover changes. The authors investigate whether maximum thermal anomalies from satellite observations could detect heat waves and droughts, a melting cryosphere, and disturbances in the tropical forest from 2003 to 2014. The 1-km(2) LSTmax anomalies peaked in 2010 when 20% of the global land area experienced anomalies of greater than 1 standard deviation and over 4% of the global land area was subject to positive anomalies exceeding 2 standard deviations. Positive LSTmax anomalies display complex spatial patterns associated with heat waves and droughts across the global land area. The findings presented herein show that entire biomes are experiencing shifts in their LSTmax distributions driven by extreme climatic events and large-scale land surface changes, such as melting of ice sheets, severe droughts, and the incremental effects of forest loss in tropical forests. As climate warming and land-cover changes continue, it is likely that Earth's maximum surface temperatures will experience greater and more frequent directional shifts, increasing the possibility that critical thresholds in Earth's ecosystems and climate system will be surpassed, resulting in profound and irreversible changes.

TI  - Multi-Temporal InSAR Structural Damage Assessment: The London Crossrail Case Study
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spaceborne multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (MT-InSAR) is a monitoring technique capable of extracting line of sight (LOS) cumulative surface displacement measurements with millimeter accuracy. Several improvements in the techniques and datasets quality led to more effective, near real time assessment and response, and a greater ability of constraining dynamically changing physical processes. Using examples of the COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) system, we present a methodology that bridges the gaps between MT-InSAR and the relative stiffness method for tunnel-induced subsidence damage assessment. The results allow quantification of the effect of the building on the settlement profile. As expected the greenfield deformation assessment tends to provide a conservative estimate in the majority of cases (similar to 71% of the analyzed buildings), overestimating tensile strains up to 50%. With this work we show how these two techniques in the field of remote sensing and structural engineering can be synergistically used to complement and replace the traditional ground based analysis by providing an extended coverage and a temporally dense set of data.

TI  - Monitoring Flooding Damages in Vegetation Caused by Mining Activities Using Optical Remote Sensing
T2  - PFG-JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY REMOTE SENSING AND GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground removal during the mineral extraction in mine galleries provokes permanent changes in ground compacting during mine exploitation and after mine closure. In extreme cases, the loss of cohesion in ground layer over mines causes surface subsidence and eventually the emergence of flooded areas on the surface. Mining companies are obligated to the surveillance and mending of damages caused by the mines during and after the exploitation of the mine. For that reason, it is necessary to determine accurately if the causes of a flooding are related to their activity or to other causes. The objective of the present study is to locate mine-related flooding using a two-step workflow that involves remote sensing data. First, a screening on water bodies was applied using multispectral data at landscape level followed by a multi-temporal analysis to detect changes in the distribution of water bodies. A second step addressed the differentiation of mine-related flooded areas from other dynamic water bodies using high-resolution hyperspectral data over vegetation affected by flooding. The proposed workflow reduces costs of monitoring for mining companies by identifying potential flooding areas, while an exhaustive study can be done in few selected areas to assure the causes of the flooding using technology that is more sophisticated. Even though supervision by experts is required at some steps of the workflow, the proposed methods can be integrated in a geoportal to permit a broad spectrum of users the access to the information.

TI  - Outdoor light at night and the prevalence of depressive symptoms and suicidal behaviors: A cross-sectional study in a nationally representative sample of Korean adults
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Outdoor light at night (LAN) is an increasingly prevalent type of environmental pollution. Studies have demonstrated that outdoor LAN can disrupt circadian rhythms, potentially contributing to insomnia, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic changes in humans. We investigated the association of outdoor LAN with depressive symptoms and suicidal behaviors in South Korean adults.Methods: This study used data from the 2009 Korean Community Health Survey, a representative sample dataset. Study population consisted of 113,119 participants for the assessment of depressive symptoms and 152,159 participants for the assessment of suicidal behavior. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Korean version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (depressive symptoms, score of > 16). Suicidal behaviors were defined as the experience of suicidal ideation or attempt. Outdoor LAN was estimated by satellite data from the National Centers for Environmental Information.Results: Participants with depressive symptoms or history of suicidal behaviors were more likely to have exposure to outdoor LAN than those without depressive symptoms or suicidal behaviors. Compared with adults living in areas exposed to the lowest outdoor LAN, those living in areas exposed to the highest levels had higher likelihood depressive symptoms (OR = 1.29; 95% CI: 1.15-1.46) or suicidal behaviors (OR = 1.27; 95% CI: 1.16-1.39). Significant dose-response relationships were observed between outdoor LAN and the odds of depressive symptoms and suicidal behaviors.Conclusion: Outdoor LAN was found to be significantly associated with depressive symptoms and suicidal behaviors, suggesting that it may be an environmental contributor to mental health problems.

TI  - Satellite Images Combined with Field Data Reveal Negative Changes in the Distribution of Babassu Palms after Clearing off Amazonian Forests
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - When the Amazonian rain forest is cut to create pasture, some of the original vegetal species survive clearing, even expressing their ability to invade agro-systems. It is true of the babassu palm, which can be considered, paradoxically, a natural resource by the "Interstate Movement of Babassu Fruit Breaker Women" or as native weed by land owners-farmers. To manage potential conflict of land uses, we study here the current density of this palm tree in different habitats, based on a combination of field data and remote sensing data. Firstly, we checked that the field survey methodology (i.e., counting free-trunk palm trees over 20 cm in circumference) provides density values compatible with those stemming from satellite images interpretation. We can see then that, a PA-Benfica Brazilian territory revealed an average density of the babassu lower in pastures (2.86 ind/ha) than in the dense forest (4.72 ind/ha) from which they originate and than in fallow land (4.31 ind/ha). We analyze in detail density data repartition in three habitats and we discuss results from the literature on the density of this palm tree versus its resilience at different developmental stages after forest clearing, depending on anthropogenic-or not-factors, including solar radiation, fire, weeding, clear cutting, burying fruit, and competition with forage grass. All these results can be exploited for the design of future management plans for the babassu palm and we think that the linked methodology and interdisciplinary approach can be extended to others palms and trees species in similar problematic issues.

TI  - Remote Sensing Image Classification With Large-Scale Gaussian Processes
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Current remote sensing image classification problems have to deal with an unprecedented amount of heterogeneous and complex data sources. Upcoming missions will soon provide large data streams that will make land cover/use classification difficult. Machine-learning classifiers can help at this, and many methods are currently available. A popular kernel classifier is the Gaussian process classifier (GPC), since it approaches the classification problem with a solid probabilistic treatment, thus yielding confidence intervals for the predictions as well as very competitive results to the state-of-theart neural networks and support vector machines. However, its computational cost is prohibitive for large-scale applications, and constitutes the main obstacle precluding wide adoption. This paper tackles this problem by introducing two novel efficient methodologies for GP classification. We first include the standard random Fourier features approximation into GPC, which largely decreases its computational cost and permits large-scale remote sensing image classification. In addition, we propose a model which avoids randomly sampling a number of Fourier frequencies and alternatively learns the optimal ones within a variational Bayes approach. The performance of the proposed methods is illustrated in complex problems of cloud detection from multispectral imagery and infrared sounding data. Excellent empirical results support the proposal in both computational cost and accuracy.

TI  - Calculating the proportion of avoidable attendances at UK emergency departments: analysis of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine's Sentinel Site Survey data
T2  - EMERGENCY MEDICINE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Avoidable attendances (AAs; defined as non-urgent, self-referred patients who could be managed more effectively and efficiently by other services) have been identified as a contributor to ED crowding. Internationally, AAs have been estimated to constitute 10%-90% of ED attendances, with the UK 2013 Urgent and Emergency Care Review suggesting a figure of 40%.Methods This pilot study used data from the Royal College of Emergency Medicine's Sentinel Site Survey to estimate the proportion of AAs in 12 EDs across England on a standard day (20 March 2014). AAs were defined by an expert panel using questions from the survey. All patients attending the EDs were recorded with details of investigations and treatments received, and the proportion of patients meeting criteria for AA was calculated.Results Visits for 3044 patients were included. Based on these criteria, a mean of 19.4% (95% CI 18.0% to 20.8%) of attendances could be deemed avoidable. The lowest proportion of AAs reported was 10.7%, while the highest was 44.3%. Younger age was a significant predictor of AA with mean age of 38.6 years for all patients attending compared with 24.6 years for patients attending avoidably (p <= 0.001).Discussion The proportion of AAs in this study was lower than many estimates in the literature, including that reported by the 2013 Urgent and Emergency Care Review. This suggests the ED is the most appropriate healthcare setting for many patients due to comprehensive investigations, treatments and capability for urgent referrals. The proportion of AAs is dependent on the defining criteria used, highlighting the need for a standardised, universal definition of an appropriate/avoidable ED attendance. This is essential to understanding how AAs contribute to the overall issue of crowding.

TI  - Evolving Roles of Histologic Evaluation and Molecular/Genomic Profiling in the Management of Endometrial Cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL COMPREHENSIVE CANCER NETWORK
M3  - Review
AB  - Endometrial cancers are the most common gynecologic malignancies. The staging of endometrial cancer has evolved from a clinical-based system to a comprehensive surgical-pathologic approach that allows for better risk stratification and treatment planning. Over the past few years, use of NCCN's sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping algorithm for the surgical staging of endometrial cancer has gained significant acceptance and is now commonly applied in many practices. However, pathologic evaluation of prognostic factors is beset by challenges, including the reproducibility of histologic classification and FIGO's grading, as well as the questionable clinical significance of low-volume tumor in SLNs. With the revelation of major genomic classes of endometrial cancer comes the potential for improved, reproducible, and prognostically relevant classification schemes, which integrate traditional pathologic parameters with genomic findings, to aid in treatment decisions. Pathologic identification of new variants of endometrial cancer, such as undifferentiated carcinoma, continues to advance the phenotypic spectrum of these tumors, spurring genomic and functional studies to further characterize their mechanistic underpinnings and potentially reveal new avenues for treatment. In the era of precision medicine, pathologic assessment of biomarkers (eg, mismatch repair proteins) and recognition of phenotypes that are amenable to specific targeted therapies (such as POLE-mutated tumors) have become integral to the management of women with endometrial carcinoma.

TI  - Studying the Association between Green Space Characteristics and Land Surface Temperature for Sustainable Urban Environments: An Analysis of Beijing and Islamabad
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing trends of urbanization lead to vegetation degradation in big cities and affect the urban thermal environment. This study investigated (1) the cooling effect of urban green space spatial patterns on Land Surface Temperature (LST); (2) how the surrounding environment influences the green space cool islands (GCI), and vice versa. The study was conducted in two Asian capitals: Beijing, China and Islamabad, Pakistan by utilizing Gaofen-1 (GF-1) and Landsat-8 satellite imagery. Pearson's correlation and normalized mutual information (NMI) were applied to investigate the relationship between green space characteristics and LST. Landscape metrics of green spaces including Percentage of Landscape (PLAND), Patch Density (PD), Edge Density (ED), and Landscape Shape Index (LSI) were selected to calculate the spatial patterns of green spaces, whereas GCI indicators were defined by Green Space Range (GR), Temperature Difference (TD), and Temperature Gradient (TG). The results indicate that both vegetation composition and configuration influence LST distributions; however, vegetation composition appeared to have a slightly greater effect. The cooling effect can be produced more effectively by increasing green space percentage, planting trees in large patches with equal distribution, and avoiding complex-shaped green spaces. The GCI principle indicates that LST can be decreased by increasing the green space area, increasing the water body fraction, or by decreasing the fraction of impervious surfaces. GCI can also be strengthened by decreasing the fraction of impervious surfaces and increasing the fraction of water body or vegetation in the surrounding environment. The cooling effect of vegetation and water could be explained based on their thermal properties. Beijing has already enacted the green-wedge initiative to increase the vegetation canopy. While designing the future urban layout of Islamabad, the construction of artificial lakes within the urban green spaces would also be beneficial, as is the case with Beijing.

TI  - Scheduling algorithms for rapid imaging using agile Cubesat constellations
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Distributed Space Missions such as formation flight and constellations, are being recognized as important Earth Observation solutions to increase measurement samples over space and time. Cubesats are increasing in size (27U, similar to 40 kg in development) with increasing capabilities to host imager payloads. Given the precise attitude control systems emerging in the commercial market, Cubesats now have the ability to slew and capture images within short notice. We propose a modular framework that combines orbital mechanics, attitude control and scheduling optimization to plan the time-varying, full-body orientation of agile Cubesats in a constellation such that they maximize the number of observed images and observation time, within the constraints of Cubesat hardware specifications. The attitude control strategy combines bang-bang and PD control, with constraints such as power consumption, response time, and stability factored into the optimality computations and a possible extension to PID control to account for disturbances. Schedule optimization is performed using dynamic programming with two levels of heuristics, verified and improved upon using mixed integer linear programming. The automated scheduler is expected to run on ground station resources and the resultant schedules uplinked to the satellites for execution, however it can be adapted for onboard scheduling, contingent on Cubesat hardware and software upgrades. The framework is generalizable over small steerable spacecraft, sensor specifications, imaging objectives and regions of interest, and is demonstrated using multiple 20 kg satellites in Low Earth Orbit for two case studies rapid imaging of Landsat's land and coastal images and extended imaging of global, warm water coral reefs. The proposed algorithm captures up to 161% more Landsat images than nadir-pointing sensors with the same field of view, on a 2-satellite constellation over a 12-h simulation. Integer programming was able to verify that optimality of the dynamic programming solution for single satellites was within 10%, and find up to 5% more optimal solutions. The optimality gap for constellations was found to be 22% at worst, but the dynamic programming schedules were found at nearly four orders of magnitude better computational speed than integer programming. The algorithm can include cloud cover predictions, ground downlink windows or any other spatial, temporal or angular constraints into the orbital module and be integrated into planning tools for agile constellations.

TI  - Spatial prediction of wildfire probability in the Hyrcanian ecoregion using evidential belief function model and GIS
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimates of wildfire probability and production of distribution maps are the first important steps in wildfire management and risk assessment. In this study, geographical information system (GIS)-automated techniques were integrated with the quantitative data-driven evidential belief function (EBF) model to predict spatial pattern of wildfire probability in a part of the Hyrcanian ecoregion, northern Iran. The historical fire events were identified using earlier reports and MODIS hot spot product as well as by carrying out multiple field surveys. Using the GIS-based EBF model, the relationships among existing fire events and various predictor variables predisposing fire ignition were analyzed. Model results were used to produce a distribution map of wildfire probability. The derived probability map revealed that zones of moderate, high, and very high probability covered nearly 60% of the landscape. Further, the probability map clearly demonstrated that the probability of a fire was strongly dependent upon human infrastructure and associated activities. By comparing the probability map and the historical fire events, a satisfactory spatial agreement between the five probability levels and fire density was observed. The probability map was further validated by receiver operating characteristic using both success rate and prediction rate curves. The validation results confirmed the effectiveness of the GIS-based EBF model that achieved AUC values of 84.14 and 81.03% for success and prediction rates, respectively.

In an era of increasing computed tomography scan availability the number of nodules that are identified that are suspicious for malignancy is rising, and thoracic surgeons require a reliable method to locate these nodules intraoperatively.Methods: Our aim was to evaluate, for the first time in the UK, resection of pulmonary nodules using radioactive dye labelling. Local research ethics approval was obtained and the study was submitted to the Integrated Research Application System (IRAS). All data were prospectively collected in our dedicated thoracic surgical database and analyzed at the conclusion of the study. This represents a consecutive series of patients, from January 2016 and until April 2017, who underwent this procedure at our institution: James Cook University Hospital, Middlesbrough, United Kingdom. The primary outcome measured was successful resection rate of the target nodules.Results: Twenty-three patients underwent radiolabeled excision of pulmonary nodules, their average age was 61 years (range, 28-79 years), 13 women and 10 men. The average maximum diameter of the nodule was 8 mm (range, 3-16 mm). All patients underwent successful excision of the target lesion (success rate 100%). One patient (4.3%) sustained pneumothorax following the CT-guided injection of the radio-labelled dye and this required chest drainage prior to general anesthesia.Conclusions: We conclude that technetium guided pulmonary nodule resection is a very reliable method for localization and resection of subcentimetre nodules which may be otherwise be difficult to identify.

TI  - Sensitivity and Limitation in Damage Detection for Individual Buildings Using InSAR CoherenceA Case Study in 2016 Kumamoto Earthquakes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, evaluation results are presented for multi-temporal interferometric coherence analysis using a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) for damage assessment in an urban area. The latest space-borne SARs potentially have a high enough spatial resolution to assess individual buildings. However, interferometric coherence analysis has not been evaluated for its limitation in sensitivity and size of damaged buildings. In particular, the correlation between the coherence analysis and the damage level referred to by architectural assessments has been an open question. In this paper, analytical results using ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 datasets are presented from the 2016 Kumamoto earthquakes in Japan. For reference, building damage was assessed throughout the central urban area and specifically at a catastrophically damaged district. The results show that the buildings should be larger than a window size of the coherence for damage detection, and the damage level should be larger than Level-2 of 5, classified with the European Macroseismic Scale 1998 (EMS-98).

TI  - Integrating subsurface stratigraphic records with satellite images to investigate channel change and bar evolution: a case study of the Padma River, Bangladesh
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat data and stratigraphic records were employed to determine channel changes and bar evolution of a selected reach of the Padma River in Bangladesh. Analysis of multi-temporal images showed that the selected reach of the Padma River has undergone significant morphological changes since 1973. The mean width of the river has almost doubled, having increased from 5458 m in 1973 to 10,638 m in 2014. Bank erosion, totalling 281 km(2), was more than double the accretion (123 km(2)), and the left bank experienced higher levels of erosion than the right bank. Analysis of the stratigraphy of the bar head, middle and tail sections revealed that erosion occurred in the head section, but that the middle section seemed to be stable, whereas accretion was estimated to be high in the tail section of the bar. Sedimentary facies analysis indicated that bar evolution is largely influenced by the variation of both water and sediment flows, as bar areas tend to accrete substantially following large floods. However, the erosion-accretion process of both bars and river banks appeared to be stable during the periods when the river experiences no major flooding. The relationship between bank erosion and bar area expansion showed a moderately positive correlation (r(2) = 0.64, p = 0.016), while a strong correlation was observed (r(2) = 0.80; p = 0.008) between channel width and area of the bar, suggesting that river width is highly influenced by bank erosion. This implies that the growth of bars within the reach is largely determined by materials flowing from bank failure.

TI  - Imaging and pathology features to predict axillary tumor load in breast cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNAECOLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - AimWe investigated if imaging and pathology features could help to identify a high axillary tumor burden (ATB) in breast cancer patients, in order to individualize decisions on axillary lymph node (ALN) dissection (ALND).MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed patients primarily treated with surgery in our unit between 2011 and 2014. We divided the patients in two groups: low ATB (LATB) if 2 ALN were infiltrated and high ATB (HATB) if > 2 ALN were infiltrated.ResultsData of 105 patients was included in the study. Axillary ultrasound (AUS) features associated with HATB were any sign of ALN infiltration (76 vs 24%, P=0.027) and > 2 suspicious ALNs (73% vs 27%, P=0.018); however, when AUS revealed 2 suspicious ALNs, 39% of these patients had HATB. Any sign of ALN infiltration on magnetic resonance imaging was associated with HATB (48% vs 52%, P=0.031). Positive preoperative ALN cytology or biopsy was associated with HATB (53% vs 47%, P=0.008), while p53 positivity (80% vs 20%) and high histological grade (68% vs. 32%) correlated with LATB (P=0.05 and P=0.02, respectively). In multivariate analysis, only positive preoperative ALN cytology or biopsy was associated with HATB (P=0.038).ConclusionsAUS was useful for detecting HATB but was not as effective in patients with LATB. Proving axillary infiltration with AUS-directed cytology or biopsy is the most effective method to predict HATB.

TI  - Permafrost Distribution along the Qinghai-Tibet Engineering Corridor, China Using High-Resolution Statistical Mapping and Modeling Integrated with Remote Sensing and GIS
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Permafrost distribution in the Qinghai-Tibet Engineering Corridor (QTEC) is of growing interest due to the increase in infrastructure development in this remote area. Empirical models of mountain permafrost distribution have been established based on field sampled data, as a tool for regional-scale assessments of its distribution. This kind of model approach has never been applied for a large portion of this engineering corridor. In the present study, this methodology is applied to map permafrost distribution throughout the QTEC. After spatial modelling of the mean annual air temperature distribution from MODIS-LST and DEM, using high-resolution satellite image to interpret land surface type, a permafrost probability index was obtained. The evaluation results indicate that the model has an acceptable performance. Conditions highly favorable to permafrost presence (70%) are predicted for 60.3% of the study area, declaring a discontinuous permafrost distribution in the QTEC. This map is useful for the infrastructure development along the QTEC. In the future, local ground-truth observations will be required to confirm permafrost presence in favorable areas and to monitor permafrost evolution under the influence of climate change.

TI  - Changes in Gross Primary Production (GPP) over the Past Two Decades Due to Land Use Conversion in a Tourism City
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the changes in gross primary production (GPP), which is the total carbon fixation by terrestrial ecosystems through vegetation photosynthesis, due to land use conversion in a tourism city is important for carbon cycle studies. Satellite data from Landsat 5, Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 and meteorological data are used to calculate annual GPP for 1995, 2003 and 2014, respectively, using the vegetation production model (VPM) in the tourism city Denpasar, Bali, Indonesia. Five land use types generated from topographic maps in three different years over the past two decades are used to quantify the impacts of land use changes on GPP estimation values. Analysis was performed for two periods to determine changes in land use and GPP value as well as their speed. The results demonstrated that urban land development, namely, the increase of settlement areas due to tourism activity, had overall negative effects on terrestrial GPP. The total GPP of the whole area decreased by 7793.96 tC year(-1) (12.65%) during the study period. The decline is due to the conversion of agriculture and grassland area into settlements, which caused the city to lose half of its ability to uptake carbon through vegetation. However, although forest area is declining, forest maintenance and restoration by making them protection areas has been helpful in preventing a drastic decline in GPP value over the past two decades. This study provides information that is useful for carbon resource management, tourism, policy making and scholars concerned about carbon reduction in a tourism city.

TI  - Snowmelt timing, phenology, and growing season length in conifer forests of Crater Lake National Park, USA
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic climate change is having significant impacts on montane and high-elevation areas globally. Warmer winter temperatures are driving reduced snowpack in the western USA with broad potential impacts on ecosystem dynamics of particular concern for protected areas. Vegetation phenology is a sensitive indicator of ecological response to climate change and is associated with snowmelt timing. Human monitoring of climate impacts can be resource prohibitive for land management agencies, whereas remotely sensed phenology observations are freely available at a range of spatiotemporal scales. Little work has been done in regions dominated by evergreen conifer cover, which represents many mountain regions at temperate latitudes. We used moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data to assess the influence of snowmelt timing and elevation on five phenology metrics (green up, maximum greenness, senescence, dormancy, and growing season length) within Crater Lake National Park, Oregon, USA from 2001 to 2012. Earlier annual mean snowmelt timing was significantly correlated with earlier onset of green up at the landscape scale. Snowmelt timing and elevation have significant explanatory power for phenology, though with high variability. Elevation has a moderate control on early season indicators such as snowmelt timing and green up and less on late-season variables such as senescence and growing season length. PCA results show that early season indicators and late season indicators vary independently. These results have important implications for ecosystem dynamics, management, and conservation, particularly of species such as whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) in alpine and subalpine areas.

TI  - Estimation of surface energy fluxes from remotely sensed data over Akure, Nigeria
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial variation and composition of surface energy fluxes across different land use over Akure, Nigeria has been investigated using the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) approach. In 1984, built up area had the lowest net radiation with a mean value of 472.56 W/m(2), while the highest net radiation was over the forested area (mean value of 528.93 W/m(2)). For sensible heat flux, the highest values were observed over the built-up areas with a mean of 245.5 W/m(2) and the lowest values over the forested areas (mean value of 160.5 W/m(2)). Latent heat flux was highest over the forested area with a mean value of 304.1 W/m(2) while the built-up area had the lowest latent heat (mean value of 164.3 W/m(2)). Similar spatial distribution of the surface energy fluxes was observed in 2014. This shows that the distribution of the surface energy fluxes across Akure varies based on the features of the different land covers. Error analysis showed poor estimation of soil heat flux from SEBAL. SEBAL model can be applied for the estimation of surface energy fluxes in areas of sparse ground station data and can also reveal the spatial variation of the energy fluxes.

TI  - Linguistic Conceptualizations of Disease Among the Luo of Kenya
T2  - QUALITATIVE HEALTH RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The region inhabited by the Luo ethnic group in Kenya is disease endemic. However, disease awareness initiatives register low acceptance due to the sociocultural images of disease and illness conceptualized in the local Dholuo language in ways that may contradict modern biomedical knowledge and practice. This article evaluates the sociocultural basis of encoding descriptions of disease in the Luo indigenous knowledge system and their implications for modern medical practice. The methodology entailed use of qualitative interviews of purposively sampled Dholuo-speaking patient escorts in a provincial referral hospital. Nonparticipant observation was also conducted at funerals to monitor contextualized usage of the discourse of disease, illness, and death. The data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis and categorized into emergent themes and categories. The results revealed that Dholuo is replete with expressions that emphasize the vulnerability and discrimination of the sick. Such attitudes cause rejection of interventions and negatively influence health-seeking behavior. The expressions were relevant and acceptable to cultural insiders; hence, they could determine their understanding of health conditions thereby influencing how they make medical decisions. It emerges that the unique Luo worldview controls their perceptions on the causes of disease and prescribes community-driven remedies which may depart from the expectations of the biomedical model.

TI  - Applications of satellite 'hyper-sensing' in Chinese agriculture: Challenges and opportunities
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Review
AB  - Ensuring adequate food supplies to a large and increasing population continues to be the key challenge for China. Given the increasing integration of China within global markets for agricultural products, this issue is of considerable significance for global food security. Over the last 50 years, China has increased the production of its staple crops mainly by increasing yield per unit land area. However, this has largely been achieved through inappropriate agricultural practices, which have caused environmental degradation, with deleterious consequences for future agricultural productivity. Hence, there is now a pressing need to intensify agriculture in China using practices that are environmentally and economically sustainable. Given the dynamic nature of crops over space and time, the use of remote sensing technology has proven to be a valuable asset providing end-users in many countries with information to guide sustainable agricultural practices. Recently, the field has experienced considerable technological advancements reflected in the availability of 'hyper-sensing' (high spectral, spatial and temporal) satellite imagery useful for monitoring, modelling and mapping of agricultural crops. However, there still remains a significant challenge in fully exploiting such technologies for addressing agricultural problems in China. This review paper evaluates the potential contributions of satellite 'hyper-sensing' to agriculture in China and identifies the opportunities and challenges for future work. We perform a critical evaluation of current capabilities in satellite 'hyper-sensing' in agriculture with an emphasis on Chinese sensors. Our analysis draws on a series of in-depth examples based on recent and on-going projects in China that are developing 'hyper-sensing' approaches for (i) measuring crop phenology parameters and predicting yields; (ii) specifying crop fertiliser requirements; (iii) optimising management responses to abiotic and biotic stress in crops; (iv) maximising yields while minimising water use in arid regions; (v) large-scale crop/cropland mapping; and (vi) management zone delineation. The paper concludes with a synthesis of these application areas in order to define the requirements for future research, technological innovation and knowledge exchange in order to deliver yield sustainability in China.

TI  - Spatiotemporal monitoring of land surface temperature and estimated radiation using remote sensing: human health implications for East London, South Africa
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Increase in land surface temperature (LST) and area radiation (R) has serious health implications on human life. Therefore, investigating LST and R changes is fundamental in providing crucial information for human survival. Remote sensing was used to assess the LST and estimated radiation of East London city in Eastern Cape Province of South Africa from Landsat thematic mapper images for 1986, 1996, 2006, and operational land imager, thermal infrared sensor for 2016 spanning a period of 30 years. Rapid urbanization and land cover changes in this area have contributed significantly to this drastic change in the natural surface characteristics (increased land surface temperature and surface solar radiation). For instance, vegetation cover declined by about 358.812 km(2) and built-up increased built-up area by 175.473 km(2) during this period, which correlates with the area thermal characteristics changes. Also, the radiation increased over the years with values exceeding the global solar radiation index. Exposure to increased ultraviolet radiation possesses risks of heat stroke, skin cancer, and heart disease to the local population. Consequently, this study provides pertinent information for human health sustainability and epidemiological cases management. Further investigation is needed in established case-specific causes. This study also epitomises the significance of remote sensing climate variability studies.

TI  - Surface Reflectance Climate Data Records (CDRs) is a Reliable Landsat ETM plus Source to Study Chlorophyll Content in Pecan Orchards
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We evaluated the relationships among three Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) datasets, top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance, surface reflectance climate data records (surface reflectance-(CDR)) and atmospherically corrected images using Fast Line-of-Sight atmospheric analysis of Spectral Hypercubes model (surface reflectance-(FLAASH)) and their linkto pecan foliar chlorophyll content(chl-cont). Foliar chlorophyll content as determined with a SPAD meter, and remotely-sensed data were collected from two mature pecan orchards (one grown in a sandy loam and the other in clay loam soil) during the experimental period. Enhanced vegetation index derived from remotely sensed data was correlated to chl-cont. At both orchards, TOA reflectance was significantly lower than surface reflectance within the 550-2400 nm wavelength range. Reflectance from atmospherically corrected images (surface reflectance-(CDR) and surface reflectance-(FLAASH)) was similar in the shortwave infrared (SWIR: 1550-1750 and 2080-2350 nm) and statistically different in the visible (350-700 nm). Enhanced vegetation index derived from surface reflectance-(CDR) and surface reflectance-(FLAASH) had higher correlation with chl-cont than TOA. Accordingly, surface reflectance is an essential prerequisite for using Landsat ETM+ data and TOA reflectance could lead to miss-/or underestimate chl-cont in pecan orchards. Interestingly, the correlation comparisons (Williams t test) between surface reflectance-(CDR) and chl-cont was statistically similar to the correlation between chl-cont and commercial atmospheric correction model. Overall, surface reflectance-(CDR), which is freely available from the earth explorer portal, is a reliable atmospherically corrected Landsat ETM+ image source to study foliar chlorophyll content in pecan orchards.

TI  - Combined impacts of land use and soil property changes on soil erosion in a mollisol area under long-term agricultural development
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion exhibits special characteristics in the process of agricultural development. Understanding the combined impacts of land use and soil property changes on soil erosion, especially in the area under long-term agricultural cultivations, is vital to watershed agricultural and soil management. This study investigated the temporal-spatial patterns of the soil erosion based on a modified version of Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) and conducted a soil erosion contribution analysis. The land use datawere interpreted fromLandsat series images, and soil properties were obtained from field sampling, laboratory tests and SPAW (Soil-Plant-Atmosphere- Water) model calculations. Over a long period of agricultural development, the average erosionmodulus decreased from 187.7 t km(-2) a(-1) in 1979 to 158.4 t km(-2) a(-1) in 2014. The land use types were transformed mainly in the reclamation of paddy fields and the shrinking of wetlands on a large scale. Most of the soils were converted to loam from silty or clay loam and the saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) of most soil types decreased by 1.11% to 43.6%. The rapidly increasing area of 49.8 km(2) of paddy fields together with themoderate decrease of 14.0 km2 of forests, as well as Ks values explained 87.4% of the total variance in soil erosion. Although changes in soil physical and water characteristics indicated that soil erosion loads should have become higher, the upsurge in paddy fields played an important role in mitigating soil erosion in this study area. These results demonstrated that land use changes had more significant impacts than soil property changes on soil erosion. This study suggested that rational measures should be taken to extend paddy fields and control the dry land farming. These findings will benefit watershed agricultural targeting and management.

TI  - The "Just Too Different" Objection to Normative Naturalism
T2  - PHILOSOPHY COMPASS
M3  - Article
AB  - Consider normative properties and facts, such as facts consisting in something's being what you ought to do, or the property of being morally wrong. Normative naturalism is the view that normative properties and facts such as these exist, and that they are natural properties and facts. Some suspect, however, that normativity is incompatible with a wholly naturalistic worldview: that the normative couldn't be natural because it's somehow just too different from the natural. I critically examine recent forms of this just too different objection to normative naturalism, with a view to making the debate accessible to a general philosophical audience.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variability of the optical depth of aerosols in areas of the savannah and of the pantanal in the central region of Brazil
T2  - NATIVA
M3  - Article
AB  - The analyses of the optical properties of atmospheric aerosols assist in the understanding of the direct and indirect effects of these particles in the Earth-atmosphere energy system flows. This study evaluates the spatial and temporal variation of the values of the Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) in a region in the midwest of Brazil using remote sensing products (MYD08_D3.051, C005 version 5.1, Level 3 of MODIS), between 2010 and 2013. The temporal analysis showed seasonal variations of the AOD 550 nm, that are justified by the occurrence of numerous records of biomass burning all over Brazil, especially in the year of 2010, whose AOD values reached a peak in the analyzed period. Regarding the spatial variation, the highest AOD 550 nm values were obtained in a seasonally flooded region, the Pantanal in the state of Mato Grosso, which, compared to the Savannah, presents nearly no records of fires during the dry season. The HYSPLIT trajectory model was used to explain the possible external contributions. Evidences was found that the Pantanal region is highly influenced by air movements originated from the southeast and north of Brazil were found -these are precisely regions with high levels of biomass burning during the dry season.

TI  - Fusion of Landsat-8/OLI and GOCI Data for Hourly Mapping of Suspended Particulate Matter at High Spatial Resolution: A Case Study in the Yangtze (Changjiang) Estuary
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentrations ([SPM]) in the Yangtze estuary, which has third-order bifurcations and four outlets, exhibit large spatial and temporal variations. Studying the characteristics of these variations in [SPM] is important for understanding sediment transport and pollutant diffusion in the estuary as well as for the construction of port and estuarine engineering structures. The 1-h revisit frequency of the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) sensor and the 30-m spatial resolution of the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (L8/OLI) provide a new opportunity to study the large spatial and temporal variations in the [SPM] in the Yangtze estuary. In this study, [SPM] images with a temporal resolution of 1 h and a spatial resolution of 30 m are generated through the product-level fusion of [SPM] data derived from L8/OLI and GOCI images using the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM). The results show that the details and accuracy of the spatial and temporal variations are maintained well in the [SPM] images that are predicted based on the fused images. Compared to the [SPM] observations at fixed field stations, the mean relative error (MRE) of the predicted SPM is 17.7%, which is lower than that of the GOCI-derived [SPM] (27.5%). In addition, thanks to the derived high-resolution [SPM] with high spatiotemporal dynamic changes, both natural phenomena (dynamic variation of the maximum turbid zone) and human engineering changes leading to the dynamic variability of SPM in the channel are observed.

TI  - Comparison between AMSR2 Sea Ice Concentration Products and Pseudo-Ship Observations of the Arctic and Antarctic Sea Ice Edge on Cloud-Free Days
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, much attention has been paid to the behavior of passive microwave sea ice concentration (SIC) products for marginal ice zones. Based on the definition of ice edges from ship observations, we identified pseudo-ship observations (PSO) and generated PSO ice edges from twelve cloud-free moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) images. Two SIC products of the advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 (AMSR2) were compared at the PSO ice edges: ARTIST (arctic radiation and turbulence interaction study) sea ice (ASI-SIC) and bootstrap (BST-SIC). The mean values of ASI-SIC pixels located at ice edges were 10.5% and 10.3% for the Arctic and the Antarctic, respectively, and are below the commonly applied 15% threshold, whereas the mean values of corresponding BST-SIC pixels were 23.6% and 27.3%, respectively. The mean values of both ASI-SIC and BST-SIC were lower in summer than in winter. The spatial gaps among the 15% ASI-SIC ice edge, the 15% BST-SIC ice edge and the PSO ice edge were mostly within 35 km, whereas the 15% ASI-SIC ice edge matched better with the PSO ice edge. Results also show that the ice edges were located in the thin ice region, with a mean ice thickness of around 5-8 cm. We conclude that the 15% threshold well determines the ice edge from passive microwave SIC in both the Arctic and the Antarctic.

TI  - Evaluation of Using Remote Sensing Evapotranspiration Data in SWAT
T2  - WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study applied a time series evapotranspiration (ET) data derived from the remote sensing to evaluate Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model calibration, which is a unique method. The SWAT hydrologic model utilized monthly stream flow data from two US Geological Survey (USGS) stations within the Big Sunflower River Watershed (BSRW) in Northwestern, Mississippi. Surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL), which utilized MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) to generate monthly ET time series data images were evaluated with the SWAT model. The SWAT hydrological model was calibrated and validated using monthly stream flow data with the default, flow only, ET only, and flow-ET modeling scenarios. The flow only and ET only modeling scenarios showed equally good model performances with the coefficient of determination (R-2) and Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) from 0.71 to 0.86 followed by flow-ET only scenario with the R-2 and NSE from 0.66 to 0.83, and default scenario with R-2 and NSE from 0.39 to 0.78 during model calibration and validation at Merigold and Sunflower gage stations within the watershed. The SWAT model over-predicted ET when compared with the Modis-based ET. The ET-based ET had the closest ET prediction (similar to 8% over-prediction) as followed by flow-ET-based ET (similar to 16%), default-based ET (similar to 27%) and flow-based ET (similar to 47%). The ET-based modeling scenario demonstrated consistently good model performance on streamflow and ET simulation in this study. The results of this study demonstrated use of Modis-based remote sensing data to evaluate the SWAT model streamflow and ET calibration and validation, which can be applied in watersheds with the lack of meteorological data.

TI  - Assessing the Accuracy of Automatically Extracted Shorelines on Microtidal Beaches from Landsat 7, Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper evaluates the accuracy of shoreline positions obtained from the infrared (IR) bands of Landsat 7, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2 imagery on natural beaches. A workflow for sub-pixel shoreline extraction, already tested on seawalls, is used. The present work analyzes the behavior of that workflow and resultant shorelines on a micro-tidal (<20 cm) sandy beach and makes a comparison with other more accurate sets of shorelines. These other sets were obtained using differential GNSS surveys and terrestrial photogrammetry techniques through the C-Pro monitoring system. 21 sub-pixel shorelines and their respective high-precision lines served for the evaluation. The results prove that NIR bands can easily confuse the shoreline with whitewater, whereas SWIR bands are more reliable in this respect. Moreover, it verifies that shorelines obtained from bands 11 and 12 of Sentinel-2 are very similar to those obtained with bands 6 and 7 of Landsat 8 (-0.75 +/- 2.5 m; negative sign indicates landward bias). The variability of the brightness in the terrestrial zone influences shoreline detection: brighter zones cause a small landward bias. A relation between the swell and shoreline accuracy is found, mainly identified in images obtained from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2. On natural beaches, the mean shoreline error varies with the type of image used. After analyzing the whole set of shorelines detected from Landsat 7, we conclude that the mean horizontal error is 4.63 m (+/- 6.55 m) and 5.50 m (+/- 4.86 m), respectively, for high and low gain images. For the Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 shorelines, the mean error reaches 3.06 m (+/- 5.79 m).

TI  - Remote sensing of mangrove forest phenology and its environmental drivers
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forest phenology at the regional scale have been poorly investigated and its driving factors remain unclear. Multi-temporal remote sensing represents a key tool to investigate vegetation phenology, particularly in environments with limited accessibility and lack of in situ measurements. This paper presents the first characterisation of mangrove forest phenology from the Yucatan Peninsula, south east Mexico. We used 15-year time-series of four vegetation indices (EVI, NDVI, gNDVI and NDWI) derived from MODIS surface reflectance to estimate phenological parameters which were then compared with in situ climatic variables, salinity and litterfall. The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) was used to smooth the raw data and four phenological parameters were estimated: start of season (SOS), time of maximum greenness (Max Green), end of season (EOS) and length of season (LOS). Litterfall showed a distinct seasonal pattern with higher rates during the end of the dry season and during the wet season. Litterfall was positively correlated with temperature (r = 0.88, p < 0.01) and salinity (r = 0.70, p < 0.01). The results revealed that although mangroves are evergreen species the mangrove forest has clear greenness seasonality which is negatively correlated with litterfall and generally lagged behind maximum rainfall. The dates of phenological metrics varied depending on the choice of vegetation indices reflecting the sensitivity of each index to a particular aspect of vegetation growth. NDWI, an index associated to canopy water content and soil moisture had advanced dates of SOS, Max Green and EOS while gNDVI, an index primarily related to canopy chlorophyll content had delayed dates. SOS ranged between day of the year (DOY) 144 (late dry season) and DOY 220 (rainy season) while the EOS occurred between DOY 104 (mid-dry season) to DOY 160 (early rainy season). The length of the growing season ranged between 228 and 264 days. Sites receiving a greater amount of rainfall between January and March showed an advanced SOS and Max Green. This phenological characterisation is useful to understand the mangrove forest dynamics at the landscape scale and to monitor the status of mangrove. In addition the results will serve as a baseline against which to compare future changes in mangrove phonology due to natural or anthropogenic causes.

TI  - Long-distance flights and high-risk breeding by nomadic waterbirds on desert salt lakes
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding and conserving mobile species presents complex challenges, especially for animals in stochastic or changing environments. Nomadic waterbirds must locate temporary water in arid biomes where rainfall is highly unpredictable in space and time. To achieve this they need to travel over vast spatial scales and time arrival to exploit pulses in food resources. How they achieve this is an enduring mystery. We investigated these challenges in the colonial-nesting Banded Stilt (Cladorhynchus leucocephalus), a nomadic shorebird of conservation concern. Hitherto, Banded Stilts were hypothesized to have only 1-2 chances to breed during their long lifetime, when flooding rain fills desert salt lakes, triggering mass-hatching of brine shrimp. Over 6 years, we satellite tagged 57 individuals, conducted 21 aerial surveys to detect nesting colonies on 14 Australian desert salt lakes, and analyzed 3 decades of Landsat and MODIS satellite imagery to quantify salt-lake flood frequency and extent. Within days of distant inland rainfall, Banded Stilts flew 1,000-2,000 km to reach flooded salt lakes. On arrival, females laid over half their body weight in eggs. We detected nesting episodes across the species' range at 7 times the frequency reported during the previous 80 years. Nesting colonies of thousands formed following minor floods, yet most were subsequently abandoned when the water rapidly evaporated prior to egg hatching. Satellite imagery revealed twice as many flood events sufficient for breeding-colony initiation as recorded colonies, suggesting that nesting at remote sites has been underdetected. Individuals took risk on uncertain breeding opportunities by responding to frequent minor flood events between infrequent extensive flooding, exemplifying the extreme adaptability and trade-offs of species exploiting unstable environments. The conservation challenges of nest predation by overabundant native gulls and anthropogenic modifications to salt lakes filling frequencies require investigation, as do the physiological and navigational mechanisms that enable such extreme strategies.

TI  - Palliative care service use by older people: Time trends from a mortality follow-back study between 2005 and 2014
T2  - PALLIATIVE MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The need for increased use and timely initiation of palliative care for all people, not just those who die with cancer, has been advocated worldwide over the past decade.Aim: To investigate whether there has been a time trend in the use of palliative care services and the timing of their initiation for older people.Design: Mortality follow-back survey among general practitioners in a nationally representative Sentinel Network in 2005-2010, 2013 and 2014 in Belgium.Setting/participants: Of all their patients who died non-suddenly aged 65+years, general practitioners reported sociodemographic and clinical data, use of any of the palliative care services available in Belgium and when the first of these services was initiated.Results: General practitioners identified 5344 deaths. Overall, palliative care service use increased from 39% in 2005 to 63% in 2014 (p<0.001). The use of a reference person for palliative care in a care home increased from 12% to 26% (p<0.001) and of a palliative homecare team from 14% to 17.5% (p<0.01), but hospital-based palliative care services did not increase. Controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, no differences were obtained over time in the proportion of cancer/non-cancer patients for whom they provided care. The timing of initiation of palliative care services remained unchanged at a median of 15days before death.Conclusion: Palliative care service use has increased mostly in care homes, possibly as a result of policy changes, while hospital-based palliative care services lag behind. Contrary to recommendations, access for non-cancer patients may remain difficult and palliative care is often initiated late in the disease trajectory.

TI  - Sensitivity Analysis of Arctic Sea Ice Extent Trends and Statistical Projections Using Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An ice-free Arctic summer would have pronounced impacts on global climate, coastal habitats, national security, and the shipping industry. Rapid and accelerated Arctic sea ice loss has placed the reality of an ice-free Arctic summer even closer to the present day. Accurate projection of the first Arctic ice-free summer year is extremely important for business planning and climate change mitigation, but the projection can be affected by many factors. Using an inter-calibrated satellite sea ice product, this article examines the sensitivity of decadal trends of Arctic sea ice extent and statistical projections of the first occurrence of an ice-free Arctic summer. The projection based on the linear trend of the last 20 years of data places the first Arctic ice-free summer year at 2036, 12 years earlier compared to that of the trend over the last 30 years. The results from a sensitivity analysis of six commonly used curve-fitting models show that the projected timings of the first Arctic ice-free summer year tend to be earlier for exponential, Gompertz, quadratic, and linear with lag fittings, and later for linear and log fittings. Projections of the first Arctic ice-free summer year by all six statistical models appear to converge to the 2037 +/- 6 timeframe, with a spread of 17 years, and the earliest first ice-free Arctic summer year at 2031.

TI  - The urban heat island in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in the last 30 years using remote sensing data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this work is to study urban heat island (UHI) in Metropolitan Area of Rio de Janeiro (MARJ) based on the analysis of land-surface temperature (LST) and land-use patterns retrieved from Landsat-5/Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat-7/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM +) and Landsat-8/Operational Land Imager (011) and Thermal Infrared Sensors (TIRS) data covering a 32-year period between 1984 and 2015. LST temporal evolution is assessed by comparing the average LST composites for 1984-1999 and 2000-2015 where the parametric Student t-test was conducted at 5% significance level to map the pixels where LST for the more recent period is statistically significantly greater than the previous one. The non-parametric Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon rank sum test has also confirmed at the same 5% significance level that the more recent period (2000-2015) has higher LST values. UHI intensity between "urban" and "rural/urban low density" ("vegetation") areas for 1984-1999 and 2000-2015 was established and confirmed by both parametric and non-parametric tests at 1% significance level as 3.3 degrees C (5.1 degrees C) and 4.4 degrees C (7.1 degrees C), respectively. LST has statistically significantly (p-value < 0.01) increased over time in two of three land cover classes ("urban" and "urban low density"), respectively by 1.9 degrees C and 0.9 degrees C, except in "vegetation" class. A spatial analysis was also performed to identify the urban pixels within MARJ where UHI is more intense by subtracting the LST of these pixels from the LST mean value of "vegetation" land-use class.

TI  - Current standards of surgical management in primary melanoma
T2  - GIORNALE ITALIANO DI DERMATOLOGIA E VENEREOLOGIA
M3  - Review
AB  - Melanoma accounts for the majority of skin cancer-related deaths, and its incidence continues to rise worldwide. While advanced disease has historically been associated with poor long-term survival, early-stage disease has a favorable prognosis and therefore, early diagnosis is paramount. Resection of primary melanoma requires a balance of maximizing oncological outcome while minimizing morbidity. Wide excision with 1-2 cm margins, depending on depth of the tumor, is the standard of care for surgical treatment of primary, invasive melanoma. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is indicated for patients with clinically node-negative, intermediate-thickness primary melanomas but should also be considered in selected patients with thin and thick primaries. In this article, historical perspectives and key clinical trials regarding the current guidelines for the surgical management of primary melanoma are discussed.

TI  - Exploring Machine Learning to Correct Satellite-Derived Sea Surface Temperatures
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Machine learning techniques are attractive tools to establish statistical models with a high degree of non linearity. They require a large amount of data to be trained and are therefore particularly suited to analysing remote sensing data. This work is an attempt at using advanced statistical methods of machine learning to predict the bias between Sea Surface Temperature (SST) derived from infrared remote sensing and ground truth from drifting buoy measurements. A large dataset of collocation between satellite SST and in situ SST is explored. Four regression models are used: Simple multi-linear regression, Least Square Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Generalised Additive Model (GAM) and random forest. In the case of geostationary satellites for which a large number of collocations is available, results show that the random forest model is the best model to predict the systematic errors and it is computationally fast, making it a good candidate for operational processing. It is able to explain nearly 31% of the total variance of the bias (in comparison to about 24% for the multi-linear regression model).

TI  - On the Impact Origin of Phobos and Deimos. III. Resulting Composition from Different Impactors
T2  - ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The origin of Phobos and Deimos in a giant impact-generated disk is gaining larger attention. Although this scenario has been the subject of many studies, an evaluation of the chemical composition of the Mars's moons in this framework is missing. The chemical composition of Phobos and Deimos is unconstrained. The large uncertainties about the origin of the mid-infrared features; the lack of absorption bands in the visible and nearinfrared spectra; and the effects of secondary processes on the moons' surfaces make the determination of their composition very difficult using remote sensing data. Simulations suggest a formation of a disk made of gas and melt with their composition linked to the nature of the impactor and Mars. Using thermodynamic equilibrium, we investigate the composition of dust (condensates from gas) and solids (from a cooling melt) that result from different types of Mars impactors (Mars-, CI-, CV-, EH-, and comet-like). Our calculations show a wide range of possible chemical compositions and noticeable differences between dust and solids, depending on the considered impactors. Assuming that Phobos and Deimos resulted from the accretion and mixing of dust and solids, we find that the derived assemblage (dust-rich in metallic iron, sulfides and/or carbon, and quenched solids rich in silicates) can be compatible with the observations. The JAXA's Martian Moons eXploration (MMX) mission will investigate the physical and chemical properties of Phobos and Deimos, especially sampling from Phobos, before returning to Earth. Our results could be then used to disentangle the origin and chemical composition of the pristine body that hit Mars and suggest guidelines for helping in the analysis of the returned samples.

TI  - Evidence from field measurements and satellite imaging of impact of Earth rotation on Lake Iseo chemistry
T2  - JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - During an initial field survey in 2012, we observed an unexpected asymmetry of dissolved oxygen distribution between the western and eastern side in northern Lake Iseo. Motivated by this apparent anomaly, we conducted a detailed field investigation, and we used a physical model of the northern part of the lake to understand the influences that might affect the distribution of material in the northern section of the lake. These investigations suggested that the Earth's rotation has significant influence on the inflow of the lake's two main tributaries. In order to further crosscheck the validity of these results, we conducted a careful analysis at a synoptic scale using images acquired during thermally unstratified periods by Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 satellites. We retrieved and post processed a large set of images, providing conclusive evidence of the role exerted by the Earth's rotation on pollutant transport in Lake Iseo and of the greater environmental vulnerability of the north-west shore of this lake, where important settlements are located. Our study confirms the necessity for three-dimensional hydrodynamic models including Coriolis effect in order to effectively predict local impacts of inflows on nearshore water quality of medium-sized elongated lakes of similar scale to Lake Iseo.

TI  - Temporal Change Detection in SAR Images Using Log Cumulants and Stacked Autoencoder
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This letter proposes a change detection algorithm for damage assessment caused by fires in Ireland using Sentinel 1 data. The novelty, in this letter, is a feature extraction within tunable Q discrete wavelet transform (TQWT) using higher order log cumulants of fractional Fourier transform (FrFT), which were fed into a stacked autoencoder (SAE) to distinguish changed and unchanged areas. The extracted features were used to train the SAE layerwise using an unsupervised learning algorithm. After training the decoding layer was replaced by a logistic regression layer to perform supervised fine-tuning and classification. The proposed algorithm was compared with the algorithm that used log cumulants of FrFT within the oriented dual-tree wavelet transform using support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The experimental results showed that the proposed combination of algorithms decreased the overall error (OE) for real synthetic aperture radar images by 6%, when TQWT was used instead of oriented dual-tree wavelet transform and OE was decreased by another 5% when SAE was used instead of the SVM classifier.

TI  - A Fully Automatic Burnt Area Mapping Processor Based on AVHRR ImageryA TIMELINE Thematic Processor
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The German Aerospace Center's (DLR) TIMELINE project (Time Series Processing of Medium Resolution Earth Observation Data Assessing Long-Term Dynamics in our Natural Environment) aims to develop an operational processing and data management environment to process 30 years of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) raw data into Level (L) 1b, L2, and L3 products. This article presents the current status of the fully automated L3 burnt area mapping processor, which is based on multi-temporal datasets. The advantages of the proposed approach are (I) the combined use of different indices to improve the classification result, (II) the provision of a fully automated processor, (III) the generation and usage of an up-to-date cloud-free pre-fire dataset, (IV) classification with adaptive thresholding, and (V) the assignment of five different probability levels to the burnt areas detected. The results of the AVHRR data-based burn scar mapping processor were validated with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) burnt area product MCD64 at four different European study sites. In addition, the accuracy of the AVHRR-based classification and that of the MCD64 itself were assessed by means of Landsat imagery.

TI  - Estimating the Creation and Removal Date of Fracking Ponds Using Trend Analysis of Landsat Imagery
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is a process of introducing liquid at high pressure to create fractures in shale rock formations, thus releasing natural gas. Flowback and produced water from fracking operations is typically stored in temporary open-air earthen impoundments, or frack ponds. Unfortunately, in the United States there is no public record of the location of impoundments, or the dates that impoundments are created or removed. In this study we use a dataset of drilling-related impoundments in Pennsylvania identified through the FrackFinder project led by SkyTruth, an environmental non-profit. For each impoundment location, we compiled all low cloud Landsat imagery from 2000 to 2016 and created a monthly time series for three bands: red, near-infrared (NIR), and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). We identified the approximate date of creation and removal of impoundments from sudden breaks in the time series. To verify our method, we compared the results to date ranges derived from photointerpretation of all available historical imagery on Google Earth for a subset of impoundments. Based on our analysis, we found that the number of impoundments built annually increased rapidly from 2006 to 2010, and then slowed from 2010 to 2013. Since newer impoundments tend to be larger, however, the total impoundment area has continued to increase. The methods described in this study would be appropriate for finding the creation and removal date of a variety of industrial land use changes at known locations.

TI  - Lake Chad Total Surface Water Area as Derived from Land Surface Temperature and Radar Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake Chad, located in the middle of the African Sahel belt, underwent dramatic decreases in the 1970s and 1980s leaving less than ten percent of its 1960s surface water extent as open water. In this paper, we present an extended record (dry seasons 1988-2016) of the total surface water area of the lake (including both open water and flooded vegetation) derived using Land Surface Temperature (LST) data (dry seasons 2000-2016) from the NASA Terra MODIS sensor and EUMETSAT Meteosat-based LST measurements (dry seasons 1988-2001) from an earlier study. We also examine the total surface water area for Lake Chad using radar data (dry seasons 2015-2016) from the ESA Sentinel-1a mission. For the limited number of radar data sets available to us (18 data sets), we find on average a close match between the estimates from these data and the corresponding estimates from LST, though we find spatial differences in the estimates using the two types of data. We use these spatial differences to adjust the record (dry seasons 2000-2016) from MODIS LST. Then we use the adjusted record to remove the bias of the existing LST record (dry seasons 1988-2001) derived from Meteosat measurements and combine the two records. From this composite, extended record, we plot the total surface water area of the lake for the dry seasons of 1988-1989 through 2016-2017. We find for the dry seasons of 1988-1989 to 2016-2017 that the maximum total surface water area of the lake was approximately 16,800 sq. km (February and May, 2000), the minimum total surface water area of the lake was approximately 6400 sq. km (November, 1990), and the average was approximately 12,700 sq. km. Further, we find the total surface water area of the lake to be highly variable during this period, with an average rate of increase of approximately 143 km(2) per year.

TI  - Gondwana-Derived Terranes Structural Mapping Using PALSAR Remote Sensing Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Gondwana-derived terranes are now separated by major faults or suture zone, which are rarely simple and easily recognizable lineaments. Different association of ore mineral systems such as deposits of sediment-hosted/orogenic gold and granite-related minerals is discovered in collision and subduction zones of the Gondwana-derived terranes. They are associated with large-scale, terrane-bounding fault systems and broad areas of deformation. Mineralization mostly associated with structurally-controlled complex lodes, veins, sheeted veins and veinlets in diverse orientations. Recognizing the structural significance of lineaments and curvilinear is very difficult in tropical, arid and Antarctic regions due to environmental obstacles. Remote sensing data could be used to detect geological structures associated with suture zones between Gondwana-derived terranes especially for large inaccessible regions where fieldwork is limited or nonexistent. In this investigation, the Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) satellite remote sensing data were used to map major geological structures in the Bentong-Raub Suture Zone of Peninsular Malaysia. It is one of the major structural zones in Sundaland, Southeast Asia, which forms the boundary between the Gondwana-derived the Sibumasu terrane and Sukhothai-Indochina arc. Structural features associated with sediment-hosted/orogenic gold deposits in the Central Gold Belt and tin mineralization in S-type granites in the Main Range were investigated using PALSAR data and comprehensive fieldwork. Results indicate that main faults strike along 340A degrees to 350A degrees that are intersected by many shear or lateral fault zones are high potential zone for gold mineralization in the Central Gold Belt. Hydrothermally alteration mineral zones and cataclastic rocks are also the other indicators of gold mineralized veins in the gold belt. High potential zones for tin mineralization are N-S strike-slip faults, fault zones and shear zones trending E-W, NE-SW and WNW-ESE in dissected crystalline granitic rocks that are associated with hydrothermal alteration zones in the Western Tin Belt. Lineament analysis using PALSAR satellite remote sensing data is a useful tool for mapping major geological structural features and detection of the boundary between the Gondwana-derived terranes and detailed structural analysis of fault systems and deformation with high potential for a variety of mineral resources, especially in tropical, arid and Antarctic regions.

TI  - Atmospheric and Radiometric Correction Algorithms for the Multitemporal Assessment of Grasslands Productivity
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A key step in the processing of satellite imagery is the radiometric correction of images to account for reflectance that water vapor, atmospheric dust, and other atmospheric elements add to the images, causing imprecisions in variables of interest estimated at the earth's surface level. That issue is important when performing spatiotemporal analyses to determine ecosystems' productivity. In this study, three correction methods were applied to satellite images for the period 2010-2014. These methods were Atmospheric Correction for Flat Terrain 2 (ATCOR2), Fast Line-of-Sight Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hypercubes (FLAASH), and Dark Object Substract 1 (DOS1). The images included 12 sub-scenes from the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and the Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensors. The images corresponded to three Permanent Monitoring Sites (PMS) of grasslands, Teseachi', Eden', and El Sitio', located in the state of Chihuahua, Mexico. After the corrections were applied to the images, they were evaluated in terms of their precision for biomass estimation. For that, biomass production was measured during the study period at the three PMS to calibrate production models developed with simple and multiple linear regression (SLR and MLR) techniques. When the estimations were made with MLR, DOS1 obtained an R-2 of 0.97 (p < 0.05) for 2012 and values greater than 0.70 (p < 0.05) during 2013-2014. The rest of the algorithms did not show significant results and DOS1, which is the simplest algorithm, resulted in the best biomass estimator. Thus, in the multitemporal analysis of grassland based on spectral information, it is not necessary to apply complex correction procedures. The maps of biomass production, elaborated from images corrected with DOS1, can be used as a reference point for the assessment of the grassland condition, as well as to determine the grazing capacity and thus the potential animal production in such ecosystems.

TI  - Nine-year spatial and temporal evolution of desert dust aerosols over South and East Asia as revealed by CALIOP
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a 3-D climatology of the desert dust distribution over South and East Asia derived using CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation) data. To distinguish desert dust from total aerosol load we apply a methodology developed in the framework of EARLINET (European Aerosol Research Lidar Network). The method involves the use of the particle linear depolarization ratio and updated lidar ratio values suitable for Asian dust, applied to multiyear CALIPSO observations (January 2007-December 2015). The resulting dust product provides information on the horizontal and vertical distribution of dust aerosols over South and East Asia along with the seasonal transition of dust transport pathways. Persistent high D_AOD (dust aerosol optical depth) values at 532 nm, of the order of 0.6, are present over the arid and semi-arid desert regions. Dust aerosol transport (range, height and intensity) is subject to high seasonality, with the highest values observed during spring for northern China (Taklimakan and Gobi deserts) and during summer over the Indian subcontinent (Thar Desert). Additionally, we decompose the CALIPSO AOD (aerosol optical depth) into dust and non-dust aerosol components to reveal the non-dust AOD over the highly industrialized and densely populated regions of South and East Asia, where the non-dust aerosols yield AOD values of the order of 0.5. Furthermore, the CALIPSO-based short-term AOD and D_AOD time series and trends between January 2007 and December 2015 are calculated over South and East Asia and over selected subregions. Positive trends are observed over northwest and east China and the Indian subcontinent, whereas over southeast China trends are mostly negative. The calculated AOD trends agree well with the trends derived from Aqua MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), although significant differences are observed over specific regions.

TI  - A GIS-based modeling of snow accumulation and melt processes in the Votkinsk reservoir basin
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Coupled hydrological and atmospheric modeling is an efficient method for snowmelt runoff forecast in large basins. We use short-range precipitation forecasts of mesoscale atmospheric Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model combining them with ground-based and satellite observations for modeling snow accumulation and snowmelt processes in the Votkinsk reservoir basin (184,319 km(2)). The method is tested during three winter seasons (2012-2015). The MODIS-based vegetation map and leaf area index data are used to calculate the snowmelt intensity and snow evaporation in the studied basin. The GIS-based snow accumulation and snowmelt modeling provides a reliable and highly detailed spatial distribution for snow water equivalent (SWE) and snow-covered areas (SCA). The modelling results are validated by comparing actual and estimated SWE and SCA data. The actual SCA results are derived from MODIS satellite data. The algorithm for assessing the SCA by MODIS data (ATBD-MOD 10) has been adapted to a forest zone. In general, the proposed method provides satisfactory results for maximum SWE calculations. The calculation accuracy is slightly degraded during snowmelt periods. The SCA data is simulated with a higher reliability than the SWE data. The differences between the simulated and actual SWE may be explained by the overestimation of the WRF-simulated total precipitation and the unrepresentativeness of the SWE measurements (snow survey).

TI  - Forecasting wheat and barley crop production in arid and semi-arid regions using remotely sensed primary productivity and crop phenology: A case study in Iraq
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop production and yield estimation using remotely sensed data have been studied widely, but such information is generally scarce in arid and semi-arid regions. In these regions, inter-annual variation in climatic factors (such as rainfall) combined with anthropogenic factors (such as civil war) pose major risks to food security. Thus, an operational crop production estimation and forecasting system is required to help decision-makers to make early estimates of potential food availability. Data from NASA'sMODIS with official crop statistics were combined to develop an empirical regression-based model to forecast winter wheat and barley production in Iraq. The study explores remotely sensed indices representing crop productivity over the crop growing season to find the optimal correlation with crop production. The potential of three different remotely sensed indices, and information related to the phenology of crops, for forecasting crop production at the governorate level was tested and their results were validated using the leave-one-year-out approach. Despite testing several methodological approaches, and extensive spatio-temporal analysis, this paper depicts the difficulty in estimating crop yield on an annual base using current satellite low-resolution data. However, more precise estimates of crop production were possible. The result of the current research implies that the date of the maximum vegetation index (VI) offered the most accurate forecast of crop production with an average R-2= 0.70 compared to the date of MODIS EVI (Avg R-2 = 0.68) and a NPP (Avg R-2 = 0.66). When winter wheat and barley production were forecasted using NDVI, EVI and NPP and compared to official statistics, the relative error ranged from -20 to 20%, -45 to 28% and -48 to 22%, respectively. The research indicated that remotely sensed indices could characterize and forecast crop production more accurately than simple cropping area, which was treated as a null model against which to evaluate the proposed approach.

TI  - Dendritic cells in the regulation of immunity and inflammation
T2  - SEMINARS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - As potent antigen-presenting cells, dendritic cells (DCs) comprise the most heterogeneous cell population with significant cellular phenotypic and functional plasticity. They form a sentinel network to modulate immune responses, since intrinsic cellular mechanisms and complex external, environmental signals endow DCs with the distinct capacity to induce protective immunity or tolerance to self. Interactions between DCs and other cells of the immune system mediate this response. This interactive response depends on DC maturation status and subtype, as well as the microenvironment of the tissue location and DC-intrinsic regulators. Dysregulated DCs can initiate and perpetuate various immune disorders, which creates attractive therapeutic targets. In this review, we provide a detailed outlook on DC ontogeny and functional specialization. We highlight recent advances on the regulatory role that DCs play in immune responses, the putative molecular regulators that control DC functional responding and the contribution of DCs to inflammatory disease physiopathology.

TI  - Combination of Landsat and Sentinel-2 MSI data for initial assessing of burn severity
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays Earth observation satellites, in particular Landsat, provide a valuable help to forest managers in post-fire operations; being the base of post-fire damage maps that enable to analyze fire impacts and to develop vegetation recovery plans. Sentinel-2A MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) records data in similar spectral wavelengths that Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), and has higher spatial and temporal resolutions. This work compares two types of satellite-based maps for evaluating fire damage in a large wildfire (around 8000 ha) located in Sierra de Gata (central-western Spain) on 6-11 August 2015. 1) burn severity maps based exclusively on Landsat data; specifically, on differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) and on its relative versions (Relative dNBR, RdNBR, and Relativized Burn Ratio, RBR) and 2) burn severity maps based on the same indexes but combining pre-fire data from Landsat 8 OLI with post-fire data from Sentinel-2A MSI data. Combination of both Landsat and Sentinel-2 data might reduce the time elapsed since forest fire to the availability of an initial fire damage map. Interpretation of ortho-photograph Pleiades 1 B data (1:10,000) provided us the ground reference data to measure the accuracy of both burn severity maps. Results showed that Landsat based burn severity maps presented an adequate assessment of the damage grade (kappa statistic = 0.80) and its spatial distribution in wildfire emergency response. Further using both Landsat and Sentinel-2 MSI data the accuracy of burn severity maps, though slightly lower (kappa statistic = 0.70) showed an adequate level for be used by forest managers.

TI  - Prolonged exposure does not increase soil microbial community compositional response to warming along geothermal gradients
T2  - FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Global change is expected to affect soil microbial communities through their responsiveness to temperature. It has been proposed that prolonged exposure to elevated temperatures may lead to progressively larger effects on soil microbial community composition. However, due to the relatively short-term nature of most warming experiments, this idea has been challenging to evaluate. The present study took the advantage of natural geothermal gradients (from +1 degrees C to +19 degrees C above ambient) in two subarctic grasslands to test the hypothesis that long-term exposure (>50 years) intensifies the effect of warming on microbial community composition compared to short-term exposure (5-7 years). Community profiles from amplicon sequencing of bacterial and fungal rRNA genes did not support this hypothesis: significant changes relative to ambient were observed only starting from the warming intensity of +9 degrees C in the long termand +7 degrees C/+3 degrees C in the short term, for bacteria and fungi, respectively. Our results suggest that microbial communities in high-latitude grasslands will not undergo lasting shifts in community composition under the warming predicted for the coming 100 years (+2.2 degrees C to +8.3 degrees C).

T2  - IFOREST-BIOGEOSCIENCES AND FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Woodlots outside forests play a significant role in diversifying household income, reducing poverty, supplying timber and fuel-wood, and regulating the local environment in many countries with low forest cover. This study aimed to develop a method for delineating the spatial footprint of woodlots outside forests and assessing their changes over time. The test site was located in the Jhalokati District of south-western Bangladesh, one of the world's most densely populated regions. Landsat images from 2010 were classified using a supervised method. Woodlots were extracted, converted to vector layers, and manually edited. The overall accuracy of the 2010 land cover map was 87%-89%. A change vector layer was generated by further updating of the vector layer by overlaying a 1989 Landsat image. The total coverage of woodlots in the district increased between 1989 and 2010, from 19,638 ha (27%) to 27,836 ha (39%). The study identified two primary reasons for changes in woodlot coverage: (i) woodlot expansion associated with the population growth and establishment of new households; and (ii) conversion of cropland to orchards because of economic reasons. The results will improve understanding of the spatial distribution of woodlot coverage in the study area and their dynamics over time.

TI  - SATELLITE DERIVED EXTRACTION OF SPATIO - TEMPORAL VARIABILITY OF UPWELLING AND ITS INFLUENCE ON MARINE FISHERY RESOURCES
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-TAIWAN
M3  - Article
AB  - Upwelling is an essential mesoscale phenomenon as it contributes to regional as well as global marine biological productivity. The present study deals with utilization of QuikSCAT derived wind speed and wind direction for delineating the potential zones of coastal upwelling with its spatio-temporal variability and its corresponding influence on fishery resources. The Ekman mass transport and Ekman depth were used as the signatures to locate and extract the mesoscale properties of upwelling such as spatial extent and temporal persistence. The upwelling process is known to modulate the physical and biological properties of the ocean surface. In order to confirm the existence of upwelling, the extracted upwelling filaments were related with the satellite derived chlorophyll concentration (CC) and sea surface temperature (SST), the process so called synergistic analysis. It was observed from the synergistic analysis that the upwelling is associated with reduced SST and elevated CC which is an indication of suitable environment for fishes. The two to three fold increase was confirmed within the upwelling zone as compared to outside region. The presence of demersal species in the 30-50 m depth zone gives evidence for the aggregation of fishes in the upwelling zone. The combined analysis of upwelling, CC, SST and fishery catch data sets manifests that the upwelling support the large quantity of fishes as compared to other regions and the satellite based delineation and extraction of upwelling properties is useful for exploration of fishery resources.

TI  - Explaining Leaf Nitrogen Distribution in a Semi-Arid Environment Predicted on Sentinel-2 Imagery Using a Field Spectroscopy Derived Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf nitrogen concentration (leaf N, %) is an essential component for understanding biogeochemical cycling. Leaf N is a good indicator of grass or forage quality, which is important for understanding the movements and feeding patterns of herbivores. Leaf N can be used as input for rangeland carrying capacity and stocking rate models. The estimation of leaf N has been successful using hyperspectral and commercial high spatial resolution satellite data such as WorldView-2 and RapidEye. Empirical methods have been used successfully to estimate leaf N, on the basis that it correlates with leaf chlorophyll. As such, leaf N was estimated using red edge based indices. The new Sentinel-2 sensor has two red edge bands, is freely available, and could further improve the estimation of leaf N at a regional scale. The objective of this study is to develop red edge based Sentinel-2 models derived from an analytical spectral device (ASD) spectrometer to map and monitor leaf N using Sentinel-2 images. Field work for leaf N and ASD data were collected in 2014 (December) in and around Kruger National Park, South Africa. ASD data were resampled to the Sentinel-2 spectral configuration using the spectral response function. The Sentinel-2 data for various dates were acquired from the European Space Agency (ESA) portal. The Sentinel-2 atmospheric correction (Sen2Cor) process was implemented. Simple empirical regression was used to estimate leaf N. High leaf N prediction accuracy was achieved at the ASD level and the best model was inverted on Sentinel-2 images to explain leaf N distribution at a regional scale over time. The spatial distribution of leaf N is influenced by the underlying geological substrate, fire frequency and other environmental variables. This study is a demonstration of how ASD data can be used to calibrate Sentinel-2 for leaf N estimation and mapping.

TI  - Atypical ALK-positive Spitz tumors with 9p21 homozygous deletion: Report of two cases and review of the literature
T2  - JOURNAL OF CUTANEOUS PATHOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - ALK rearrangements occur in up to 10% of spitzoid melanocytic neoplasms. No reported cases have shown homozygous deletion of 9p21 (CDKN2A) or gains of 6p25 (RREB1) or 11q13 (CCND1), which have been associated with aggressive clinical behavior. Here we report 2 unique cases. Case 1 occurred in a 9-year-old male with a 14-mm nodule on the anterior left thigh. Biopsy revealed an ALK-positive Spitz tumor containing an irregular nodule of densely packed melanocytes with increased mitoses and loss of p16 immunoreactivity. FISH analysis showed homozygous deletion of 9p21 and gain of 6p25. Sentinel lymph node biopsy revealed small subcapsular foci of tumor. Case 2 occurred in a 7-year-old female with a 12-mm nodule on the anterior right ankle. Biopsy revealed an ALK-positive Spitz tumor containing an expansile nodule of pleomorphic epithelioid melanocytes with numerous mitoses and loss of p16 immunoreactivity. By FISH, the nodule showed homozygous deletion of 9p21 and gains of 6p25 and 11q13. Our cases show the transformation of tumors produced by an activating kinase fusion gene (ALK) through secondary genetic changes including loss of tumor suppressor activity (CDKN2A). Long-term follow up will be important to further define the behavior of these unique Spitz tumors.

TI  - Evaluating snow cover changing trends of the Western Indian Himalaya
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The extent of snow cover in the Western Indian Himalaya determines the fluctuations in river discharge during the summer months and affects the water supply for hydroelectric generation, agriculture and related socio-economic systems which further affect the livelihood of the population in the area and downstream. Despite this importance, there is a lack of information about this region primarily due to the complexities of the processes involved in snow hydrology and the lack of snow cover and depth data in the high elevation areas. Periodical monitoring of the snow cover area (SCA) is an indispensable demand for short-term forecasts of the daily river flows and seasonal forecasts of run-off volume. Therefore, this study is an attempt to assess the annual, seasonal and monthly variations in the extent of snow cover of the Western Indian Himalaya. SCA was estimated using the MODIS/Terra Snow Cover 8-Day L3 Global 500 m (MOD10A2) data for the period 2000-2015. Monthly composite maps of SCA were prepared from 8 days composite snow cover area maps for the Kashmir, Himachal and Kumaon Himalaya. The study found a reduction in snow cover in the Indian Western Himalaya. The inter-seasonal variation in SCA was also observed in the study area. The study found an inter-regional variations in the extent of snow cover in the Western Indian Himalaya during the period of analysis. Emerging changes in the extent of snow cover would influence the availability of water in the near future.

TI  - A Holistic Concept to Design Optimal Water Supply Infrastructures for Informal Settlements Using Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ensuring access to water and sanitation for all is Goal No. 6 of the 17 UN Sustainability Development Goals to transform our world. As one step towards this goal, we present an approach that leverages remote sensing data to plan optimal water supply networks for informal urban settlements. The concept focuses on slums within large urban areas, which are often characterized by a lack of an appropriate water supply. We apply methods of mathematical optimization aiming to find a network describing the optimal supply infrastructure. Hereby, we choose between different decentral and central approaches combining supply by motorized vehicles with supply by pipe systems. For the purposes of illustration, we apply the approach to two small slum clusters in Dhaka and Dar es Salaam. We show our optimization results, which represent the lowest cost water supply systems possible. Additionally, we compare the optimal solutions of the two clusters (also for varying input parameters, such as population densities and slum size development over time) and describe how the result of the optimization depends on the entered remote sensing data.

TI  - A review of the empirical literature on the use of limpets <i>Patella</i> spp. (Mollusca: Gastropoda) as bioindicators of environmental quality
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
M3  - Review
AB  - The need to carry out monitoring programs for environmental pollution of coastal ecosystems makes it necessary to increase the number of indicator species in order to have a wide range of suitable organisms for most of the possible toxic substances and ways of exposure. With the purpose of analyzing the suitability of limpets (Patella spp.) for their use in biomonitoring programs, a literature review was performed on 88 cases found in the Web of Science online platform. The capacity of limpets to accumulate metals and hydrocarbons has been examined in several field studies. In most cases there is a clear relationship between body content of a pollutant in soft tissues of limpets and the corresponding environmental level. Likewise, different responses to pollutants have been reported in limpets, including induction of DNA damage, induction of metallothioneins, oxidative stress, decrease of Neutral Red retention or variations in heart rate. Regarding the study of changes in community structure, an uneven response to disturbances (e.g. oil spills, wastewater discharge) by species of the genus Patella has been documented. Moreover, generally limpets respond to pollutants similarly to, or even more effectively than, mussels; therefore, their inclusion as sentinel organisms in regional monitoring plans seems appropriate.

TI  - Improving Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity Retrieval From the Chinese Gaofen-5 Satellite Using a Hybrid Algorithm
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a key surface feature parameter. Temperature and emissivity separation (TES) and split-window (SW) algorithms are two typical LST estimation algorithms that have been applied to a variety of sensors to generate LST products. The TES algorithm can synchronously obtain LST and emissivity, but it requires high accuracy for atmospheric correction of the thermal infrared (TIR) data and does not perform well for surfaces with low spectral emissivity contrast. On the contrary, the SW algorithm can retrieve LST without detailed atmospheric data because the linear or nonlinear combination of brightness temperatures in the two adjacent TIR channels can reduce the atmospheric effect; however, this algorithm requires prior accurate pixel emissivity. Combining the two algorithms can improve the accuracy of LST estimation because the emissivity calculated from the TES algorithm can be used in the SW algorithm, and the LST from the SW algorithm can then be applied to the TES algorithm as an initial value to refine emissivity and LST. This paper investigates the aforementioned hybrid algorithm using Chinese Gaofen-5 satellite data, which will provide four-channel data for TIR at 40 m for synchronously retrieving LST and emissivity. The results showed that the hybrid algorithm was less sensitive to instrument noise and atmospheric data error, and can obtain LST and emissivity with an error less than 1 K and 0.015, respectively, which is better than those obtained with the single TES or SW algorithm. Finally, the hybrid algorithm was tested in simulated image and ground-measured data, and obtained accurate results.

TI  - A methodology for mapping native and invasive vegetation coverage in archipelagos: An example from the Galapagos Islands
T2  - PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study develops a mixed, systematic, low-cost methodology to define and map native vegetation and the spread of the most aggressive invasive species in islands biomes, focusing on the Galapagos National Park (GNP). Based on preliminary legends defined by experts, Landsat 8/OLI fusion imagery was used for object-oriented classification to obtain the vegetation map of this archipelago. This technique was later verified and validated using high-resolution images from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, i.e., drones) and dedicated satellites, ground truthing, and visual confirmation around GNP coasts. This mixed methodology allowed mapping of nine native ecosystems, six invasive-dominated vegetation units, and two types of lavas. Around 53.63% of GNP is covered by native ecosystems and approximate to 2.2% is canopy dominated by invasive species to date. Native-dominated deciduous forest types cover approximate to 40.8% of the GNP and only approximate to 12.8% of the protected area is nowadays covered by humid and transitional type native ecosystems. Among humid native ecosystems, those distributed in the highlands only cover 4.8% and are highly threatened by invasive species, which are mostly distributed in these summit areas. Of the five islands (out of 18) recording invasive-dominated units, Isabela and Santa Cruz were the most infested. Cedrela odorata, Pennisetum purpureum, and Psidium guajava were the main invasive plants dominating the GNP canopy. Highly noxious Rubus niveus was the only invasive species dominating areas among the five infested islands. Methodology detailed here proved useful to provide accurate spatially-explicit islands vegetation data, potential for replication in time, and is expected to aid suitable management of highly endangered and unique biotas in this and other tropical island biomes.

TI  - Surface runoff prediction regarding LULC and climate dynamics using coupled LTM, optimized ARIMA, and GIS-based SCS-CN models in tropical region
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 1st Global Civil Engineering Conference (GCEC)
CL  - Kuala Lumpur, MALAYSIA
AB  - The effects of climate and land use/land cover (LULC) dynamics have directly affected the surface runoff and flooding events. Hence, current study proposes a full-packaged model to monitor the changes in surface runoff in addition to forecast of the future surface runoff based on LULC and precipitation variations. On one hand, six different LULC classes were extracted from Spot-5 satellite image. Conjointly, land transformation model (LTM) was used to detect the LULC pixel changes from 2000 to 2010 as well as predict the 2020 ones. On the other hand, the time series-autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was applied to forecast the amount of rainfall in 2020. The ARIMA parameters were calibrated and fitted by latest Taguchi method. To simulate the maximum probable surface runoff, distributed soil conservation service-curve number (SCS-CN) model was applied. The comparison results showed that firstly, deforestation and urbanization have been occurred upon the given time, and they are anticipated to increase as well. Secondly, the amount of rainfall has non-stationary declined since 2000 till 2015 and this trend is estimated to continue by 2020. Thirdly, due to damaging changes in LULC, the surface runoff has been also increased till 2010 and it is forecasted to gradually exceed by 2020. Generally, model calibrations and accuracy assessments have been indicated, using distributed-GIS-based SCS-CN model in combination with the LTM and ARIMA models are an efficient and reliable approach for detecting, monitoring, and forecasting surface runoff.

TI  - Frequency and Cost of Vaccinations Administered Outside Minimum and Maximum Recommended Ages-2014 Data From 6 Sentinel Sites of Immunization Information Systems
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To quantify vaccinations administered outside minimum and maximum recommended ages and to determine attendant costs of revaccination by analyzing immunization information system (IIS) records.Study design We analyzed deidentified records of doses administered during 2014 to persons aged <18 years within 6 IIS sentinel sites (10% of the US population). We quantified doses administered outside of recommended ages according to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices childhood immunization schedule and prescribing information in package inserts, and calculated revaccination costs. To minimize misreporting bias, we analyzed publicly funded doses for which reported lot numbers and vaccine types were consistent.Results Among 3 394 047 doses with maximum age recommendations, 9755 (0.3%) were given after the maximum age. One type of maximum age violation required revaccination: 1344 (0.7%) of 194 934 doses of the 0.25-mL prefilled syringe formulation of quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (Fluzone Quadrivalent, Sanofi Pasteur, Swiftwater, PA) were administered at age >= 36 months (revaccination cost, $111 964). We identified a total of 7 529 165 childhood, adolescent, and lifespan doses with minimum age recommendations, 9542 of which (0.1%) were administered before the minimum age. The most common among these violations were quadrivalent injectable influenza vaccines (3835, or 0.7% of 526 110 doses administered before age 36 months) and Kinrix (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium; DTaP-IPV) (2509, or 1.2% of 208 218 doses administered before age 48 months). The cost of revaccination for minimum age violations (where recommended) was $179 179.Conclusion Administration of vaccines outside recommended minimum and maximum ages is rare, reflecting a general adherence to recommendations. Error rates were higher for several vaccines, some requiring revaccination. Vaccine schedule complexity and confusion among similar products might contribute to errors. Minimization of errors reduces wastage, excess cost, and inconvenience for parents and patients.

TI  - Distinct Ezrin Truncations Differentiate Metastases in Sentinel Lymph Nodes from Unaffected Lymph Node Tissues, from Primary Breast Tumors, and from Healthy Glandular Breast Tissues
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lymph node metastasis status is a prognostic factor for further lymph node involvement and for patient survival in breast cancer patients. Frozen section analysis of lymph nodes is a reliable method for detection of macro-metastases. However, this method is far less effective in detecting micro-metastases, requesting improved diagnostic procedures. METHODS: We investigated expression and truncation of ezrin in (i) sentinel lymph node metastases, (ii) unaffected axillary lymph nodes, (iii) primary breast tumors, and (iv) healthy glandular breast tissues using 2D gel electrophoresis, SDS-PAGE, and mass spectrometry in addition to Western blotting. RESULTS: Full-length ezrin (E1; amino acids 1-586) is present in all four investigated tissues. Two truncated ezrin forms, one missing about the first hundred amino acids (E2a) and the other lacking about 150 C-terminal amino acids (E2b) were detectable in primary tumor tissues and in sentinel lymph node metastases but not in glandular tissues. Strikingly, an ezrin truncation (E3) which consists approximately of amino acids 238-586 was found strongly expressed in all sentinel lymph node metastases. Moreover, an N-terminal ezrin fragment (E4) that consists approximately of amino acids 1-273 was identified in sentinel lymph node metastases as well. CONCLUSIONS: We show for the first time the existence of tissue-dependent specific ezrin truncations. The distinguished strong Western blot staining of ezrin E3 in sentinel lymph node metastases underlines its capability to substantiate the occurrence of lymph node (micro) metastases in breast cancer patients.

TI  - Building an exposed soil composite processor (SCMaP) for mapping spatial and temporal characteristics of soils with Landsat imagery (1984-2014)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil information with high spatial and temporal resolution is crucial to assess potential soil degradation and to achieve sustainable productivity and ultimately food security. The spatial resolution of existing soil maps can commonly be too coarse to account for local soil variations and owing to the cost and resource needs required to update information these maps lack temporal information. With improved computational processing capabilities, increased data storage and most recently, the increasing amount of freely available data (e.g. Landsat, Sentinel-2A/B), remote sensing imagery can be integrated into existing soil mapping approaches to increase temporal and spatial resolution of soil information. Satellite multi-temporal data allows for generating cloud free, radiometrically and phenologically consistent pixel based image composites of regional scale. Such data sets are of particular use for extracting soil information in areas of intermediate climate where soils are rarely exposed. The Soil Composite Mapping Processor (SCMaP) is a new approach designed to make use of per-pixel compositing to overcome the issue of limited soil exposure. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the automated processors ability to handle large image databases to build multispectral reflectance composite base data layers that can support large scale top soil analyses. The functionality of the SCMaP is demonstrated using Landsat imagery over Germany from 1984 to 2014 applied over 5 year periods. Three primary product levels are generated that will allow for a long term assessment and distribution of soils that include the distribution of exposed soils, a statistical information related to soil use and intensity and the generation of exposed soil reflectance image composites. The resulting composite maps provide useful value-added information on soils with the exposed soil reflectance composites showing high spatial coverage that correlate well with existing soil maps and the underlying geological structural regions.

TI  - Thin Sea Ice, Thick Snow, and Widespread Negative Freeboard Observed During N-ICE2015 North of Svalbard
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, sea-ice conditions in the Arctic Ocean changed substantially toward a younger and thinner sea-ice cover. To capture the scope of these changes and identify the differences between individual regions, in situ observations from expeditions are a valuable data source. We present a continuous time series of in situ measurements from the N-ICE2015 expedition from January to June 2015 in the Arctic Basin north of Svalbard, comprising snow buoy and ice mass balance buoy data and local and regional data gained from electromagnetic induction (EM) surveys and snow probe measurements from four distinct drifts. The observed mean snow depth of 0.53 m for April to early June is 73% above the average value of 0.30 m from historical and recent observations in this region, covering the years 1955-2017. The modal total ice and snow thicknesses, of 1.6 and 1.7 m measured with ground-based EM and airborne EM measurements in April, May, and June 2015, respectively, lie below the values ranging from 1.8 to 2.7 m, reported in historical observations from the same region and time of year. The thick snow cover slows thermodynamic growth of the underlying sea ice. In combination with a thin sea-ice cover this leads to an imbalance between snow and ice thickness, which causes widespread negative freeboard with subsequent flooding and a potential for snow-ice formation. With certainty, 29% of randomly located drill holes on level ice had negative freeboard.

TI  - A Population-Based Study of Syncope in the Young
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The prevalence, hospitalization patterns, and outcomes of pediatric and adolescent syncope have not been rigorously characterized.Methods: Patients < 20 years presenting to an emergency department (ED) with a primary diagnosis of syncope (International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision, code R55) between fiscal year (FY) 2006/2007 and FY 2013/2014 in the province of Alberta, Canada were grouped according to discharge status from the ED, ie, (1) admitted to hospital and (2) discharged without admission. Temporal trends and differences in baseline characteristics, medication use, and outcomes between admitted and discharged patients were examined.Results: The prevalence of syncope increased from 143/100,000 population in FY 2006/2007 to 166/100,000 population in FY 2013/2014 (P < 0.01). The majority of the 11,488 patients who presented to the ED with syncope were discharged home (n = 11,214 [98%]). Cardiac disease was present in 12.7% and thoracic conditions were present in 8% of the study population. A majority of patients (66.2% admitted and 56.4% discharged; P = 0.018) were taking a prescription drug in the year before presentation. By 30 days, 26.1% of admitted patients had a second ED presentation and 8.1% had a rehospitalization. Among discharged patients, the 30-day repeated ED presentation rate was 11.7% and the hospitalization rate was 1.1%. By 1 year, the rates of repeated ED visits increased to 64.1% and 47.5%, and rehospitalization rates increased to 21.4% and 6.8% among admitted and discharged patients, respectively.Conclusions: Our data suggest that pediatric and adolescent syncope is increasing in prevalence and represents a growing public health problem. This population has a high burden of comorbidities that likely contribute to increased health care resource use and polypharmacy.

TI  - Eddy-induced cross-shelf export of high Chl-a coastal waters in the SE Bay of Biscay
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Different remote sensing data were combined to characterise a winter anticyclonic eddy in the southeastern Bay of Biscay and to infer its effects on cross-shelf exchanges, in a period when typical along shelf-slope currents depict a cyclonic pattern. While the joint analysis of available satellite data (infrared, visible and altimetry) permitted the characterisation and tracking of the anticyclone properties and path, data from a coastal high-frequency radar system enabled a quantitative analysis of the surface cross-shelf transports associated with this anticyclone. The warm core anticyclone had a diameter of around 50 km, maximum azimuthal velocities near 50 cm s(-1) and a relative vorticity of up to -0.45f. The eddy generation occurred after the relaxation of a cyclonic wind-driven current regime over the shelf-slope; then, the eddy remained stationary for several weeks until it started to drift northwards along the shelf break. The surface signature of this eddy was observed by means of high-frequency radar data for 20 consecutive days, providing a unique opportunity to characterise and quantify, from a Lagrangian perspective, the associated transport and its effect on the Chl-a surface distribution. We observed the presence of mesoscale structures with similar characteristics in the area during different winters within the period 2011-2014. Our results suggest that the eddy-induced recurrent cross-shelf export is an effective mechanism for the expansion of coastal productive waters into the adjacent oligotrophic ocean basin.

TI  - Seasonal and multi-year surface displacements measured by DInSAR in a High Arctic permafrost environment
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Arctic landscapes undergo seasonal and long-term changes as the active layer thaws and freezes, which can result in localized or irregular subsidence leading to the formation of thermokarst terrain. Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) is a technique capable of measuring ground surface displacements resulting from thawing permafrost at centimetre precision and is quickly gaining acceptance as a means of measuring ground displacement in permafrost regions. Using RADARSAT-2 stacked DInSAR data from 2013 and 2015 we determined the magnitude and patterns of land surface change in a continuous permafrost environment. At our study site situated in the Canadian High Arctic, DInSAR seasonal ground displacement patterns were consistent with field observations of permafrost degradation. As expected, many DInSAR values are close to the detection threshold (i.e., 1 cm) and therefore do not indicate significant change; however, DInSAR seasonal ground displacement patterns aligned well with climatological and soil conditions and offer geomorphological insight into subsurface processes in permafrost environments. While our dataset is limited to two years of data representing a three-year time period, the displacements derived from DInSAR provide insight into permafrost change in a High Arctic environment and demonstrate that DInSAR is an applicable tool for understanding environmental change in remote permafrost regions.

TI  - Method for estimating modulation transfer function from sample images
T2  - MICRON
M3  - Article
AB  - The modulation transfer function (MTF) represents the frequency domain response of imaging modalities. Here, we report a method for estimating the MTF from sample images. Test images were generated from a number of images, including those taken with an electron microscope and with an observation satellite. These original images were convolved with point spread functions (PSFs) including those of circular apertures. The resultant test images were subjected to a Fourier transformation. The logarithm of the squared norm of the Fourier transform was plotted against the squared distance from the origin. Linear correlations were observed in the logarithmic plots, indicating that the PSF of the test images can be approximated with a Gaussian. The MTF was then calculated from the Gaussian-approximated PSF. The obtained MTF closely coincided with the MTF predicted from the original PSF. The MTF of an x-ray microtomographic section of a fly brain was also estimated with this method. The obtained MTF showed good agreement with the MTF determined from an edge profile of an aluminum test object. We suggest that this approach is an alternative way of estimating the MTF, independently of the image type.

TI  - Representation of solar tides in the stratosphere and lower mesosphere in state-of-the-art reanalyses and in satellite observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric solar tides in the stratosphere and the lower mesosphere are investigated using temperature data from five state-of-the-art reanalysis data sets (MERRA-2, MERRA, JRA-55, ERA-Interim, and CFSR) as well as TIMED SABER and Aura MLS satellite measurements. The main focus is on the period 2006-2012 during which the satellite observations are available for direct comparison with the reanalyses. Diurnal migrating tides, semidiurnal migrating tides, and nonmigrating tides are diagnosed. Overall the reanalyses agree reasonably well with each other and with the satellite observations for both migrating and nonmigrating components, including their vertical structure and the seasonality. However, the agreement among reanalyses is more pronounced in the lower stratosphere and relatively weaker in the upper stratosphere and mesosphere. A systematic difference between SABER and the reanalyses is found for diurnal migrating tides in the upper stratosphere and the lower mesosphere; specifically, the amplitude of trapped modes in reanalyses is significantly smaller than that in SABER, although such difference is less clear between MLS and the reanalyses. The interannual variability and the possibility of long-term changes in migrating tides are also examined using the reanalyses during 1980-2012. All the reanalyses agree in exhibiting a clear quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) in the tides, but the most significant indications of long-term changes in the tides represented in the reanalyses are most plausibly explained by the evolution of the satellite observing systems during this period. The tides are also compared in the full reanalyses produced by the Japan Meteorological Agency (i.e., JRA-55) and in two parallel data sets from this agency: one (JRA-55C) that repeats the reanalysis procedure but without any satellite data assimilated and one (JRA-55AMIP) that is a free-running integration of the model constrained only by observed sea surface temperatures. Many aspects of the tides are closer in JRA-55C and JRA-55AMIP than these are to the full reanalysis JRA-55, demonstrating the importance of the assimilation of satellite data in representing the diurnal variability of the middle atmosphere. In contrast to the assimilated data sets, the freerunning model has no QBO in equatorial stratospheric mean circulation and our results show that it displays no quasi-biennial variability in the tides.

TI  - Assessment of agricultural groundwater users in Iran: a cultural environmental bias
T2  - HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Many environmental problems are rooted in human behavior. This study aimed to explore the causal effect of cultural environmental bias on 'sustainable behavior' among agricultural groundwater users in Fars province, Iran, according to Klockner's comprehensive model. A survey-based research project was conducted to gathering data on the paradigm of environmental psychology. The sample included agricultural groundwater users (n = 296) who were selected at random within a structured sampling regime involving study areas that represent three (higher, medium and lower) bounds of the agricultural-groundwater-vulnerability spectrum. Results showed that the "environment as ductile (EnAD)" variable was a strong determinant of sustainable behavior as it related to groundwater use, and that EnAE had the highest causal effect on the behavior of agricultural groundwater users. The adjusted model explained 41% variance of "groundwater sustainable behavior". Based on the results, the groundwater sustainable behaviors of agricultural groundwater users were found to be affected by personal and subjective norm variables and that they are influenced by casual effects of the "environment as ductile (EnAD)" variable. The conclusions reflect the Fars agricultural groundwater users' attitude or worldview on groundwater as an unrecoverable resource; thus, it is necessary that scientific disciplines like hydrogeology and psycho-sociology be considered together in a comprehensive approach for every groundwater study.

TI  - Quantifying the Severity of Phytophthora Root Rot Disease in Avocado Trees Using Image Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Phytophthora root rot (PRR) infects the roots of avocado trees, resulting in reduced uptake of water and nutrients, canopy decline, defoliation, and, eventually, tree mortality. Typically, the severity of PRR disease (proportion of canopy decline) is assessed by visually comparing the canopy health of infected trees to a standardised set of photographs and a corresponding disease rating. Although this visual method provides some indication of the spatial variability of PRR disease across orchards, the accuracy and repeatability of the ranking is influenced by the experience of the assessor, the visibility of tree canopies, and the timing of the assessment. This study evaluates two image analysis methods that may serve as surrogates to the visual assessment of canopy decline in large avocado orchards. A smartphone camera was used to collect red, green, and blue (RGB) colour images of individual trees with varying degrees of canopy decline, with the digital photographs then analysed to derive a canopy porosity percentage using a combination of Canny edge detection' and Otsu's' methods. Coinciding with the on-ground measure of canopy porosity, the canopy reflectance characteristics of the sampled trees measured by high resolution Worldview-3 (WV-3) satellite imagery was also correlated against the observed disease severity rankings. Canopy porosity values (ranging from 20-70%) derived from RGB images were found to be significantly different for most disease rankings (p < 0.05) and correlated well (R-2 = 0.89) with the differentiation of three disease severity levels identified to be optimal. From the WV-3 imagery, a multivariate stepwise regression of 18 structural and pigment-based vegetation indices found the simplified ratio vegetation index (SRVI) to be strongly correlated (R-2 = 0.96) with the disease rankings of PRR disease severity, with the differentiation of four levels of severity found to be optimal.

TI  - Alteration, mass analysis, and magmatic compositions of the Sentinel Bluffs Member, Columbia River flood basalt province
T2  - GEOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate characterization of the magmatic compositions of flood basalt lavas is fundamental to interpretations of magma genesis, stratigraphy, and correlation across these extensive provinces. Analysis of the geochemistry of the Sentinel Bluffs Member of the Grande Ronde Basalt, Columbia River Basalt Group (northwestern USA), demonstrates that a mass-based methodology, similar to those routinely used in studies of weathering and soil formation, enables the identification of subtle and previously unrecognized low-temperature alteration, and the determination of primary magmatic geochemical characteristics in rocks modified by secondary processes. This methodology, here termed mass analysis, employs concentrations and ratios of immobile elements, which are not transported by low-temperature alteration processes, to show that alteration has resulted in loss of rock mass due to mineral dissolution in anoxic groundwater. Immobile element abundances corrected for mass loss permit the identification and province-wide correlation of individual flows and flow packages, even for rocks that have undergone nearly 50% mass loss. The methodology developed with Sentinel Bluffs lavas is applicable to other lavas of the Columbia River flood basalt province, and most likely to other volcanic provinces in which lavas have undergone long-term interaction with groundwater.

TI  - A CNN-Based Fusion Method for Feature Extraction from Sentinel Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sensitivity to weather conditions, and specially to clouds, is a severe limiting factor to the use of optical remote sensing for Earth monitoring applications. A possible alternative is to benefit from weather-insensitive synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. In many real-world applications, critical decisions are made based on some informative optical or radar features related to items such as water, vegetation or soil. Under cloudy conditions, however, optical-based features are not available, and they are commonly reconstructed through linear interpolation between data available at temporally-close time instants. In this work, we propose to estimate missing optical features through data fusion and deep-learning. Several sources of information are taken into accountoptical sequences, SAR sequences, digital elevation modelso as to exploit both temporal and cross-sensor dependencies. Based on these data and a tiny cloud-free fraction of the target image, a compact convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained to perform the desired estimation. To validate the proposed approach, we focus on the estimation of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), using coupled Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 time-series acquired over an agricultural region of Burkina Faso from May-November 2016. Several fusion schemes are considered, causal and non-causal, single-sensor or joint-sensor, corresponding to different operating conditions. Experimental results are very promising, showing a significant gain over baseline methods according to all performance indicators.

TI  - Cast Shadow Detection to Quantify the Aerosol Optical Thickness for Atmospheric Correction of High Spatial Resolution Optical Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The atmospheric correction of optical remote sensing data requires the determination of aerosol and gas optical properties. A method is presented which allows the detection of the aerosol scattering effects from optical remote sensing data at spatial sampling intervals below 5 m in cloud-free situations from cast shadow pixels. The derived aerosol optical thickness distribution is used for improved atmospheric compensation. In a first step, a novel spectral cast shadow detection algorithm determines the shadow areas using spectral indices. Evaluation of the cast shadow masks shows an overall classification accuracy on an 80% level. Using the such derived shadow map, the ATCOR atmospheric compensation method is iteratively applied on the shadow areas in order to find the optimum aerosol amount. The aerosol optical thickness is found by analyzing the physical atmospheric correction of fully shaded pixels in comparison to directly illuminated areas. The shadow based aerosol optical thickness estimation method (SHAOT) is tested on airborne imaging spectroscopy data as well as on photogrammetric data. The accuracy of the reflectance values from atmospheric correction using the such derived aerosol optical thickness could be improved from 3-4% to a level of better than 2% in reflectance for the investigated test cases.

AB  - The application and utility of melanoma sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has evolved significantly since its inception over two decades ago. The current focus has shifted from a staging modality to potentially a therapeutic intervention. Recent research to include large multi-institutional randomized trials have attempted to answer the question: is a completion lymph node dissection (CLND) required following a positive SLNB? This review provides an evidence-based, contemporary review of the utility of CLND for SLNB positive head and neck cutaneous melanoma patients.

TI  - Investigation on the separability of slums by multi-aspect TerraSAR-X dual-co-polarized high resolution spotlight images based on the multi-scale evaluation of local distributions
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Following recent advances in distinguishing settlements vs. non-settlement areas from latest SAR data, the question arises whether a further automatic intra-urban delineation and characterization of different structural types is possible. This paper studies the appearance of the structural type "slums" in high resolution SAR images. Geocoded Kennaugh elements are used as backscatter information and Schmittlet indices as descriptor of local texture. Three cities with a significant share of slums (Cape Town, Manila, Mumbai) are chosen as test sites. These are imaged by TerraSAR-X in the dual-co-polarized high resolution spotlight mode in any available aspect angle. Representative distributions are estimated and fused by a robust approach. Our observations identify a high similarity of slums throughout all three test sites. The derived similarity maps are validated with reference data sets from visual interpretation and ground truth. The final validation strategy is based on completeness and correctness versus other classes in relation to the similarity. High accuracies (up to 87%) in identifying morphologic slums are reached for Cape Town. For Manila (up to 60%) and Mumbai (up to 54%), the distinction is more difficult due to their complex structural configuration. Concluding, high resolution SAR data can be suitable to automatically trace potential locations of slums. Polarimetric information and the incidence angle seem to have a negligible impact on the results whereas the intensity patterns and the passing direction of the satellite are playing a key role. Hence, the combination of intensity images (brightness) acquired from ascending and descending orbits together with Schmittlet indices (spatial pattern) promises best results. The transfer from the automatically recognized physical similarity to the semantic interpretation remains challenging.

TI  - A data assimilation system combining CryoSat-2 data and hydrodynamic river models
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - There are numerous hydrologic studies using satellite altimetry data from repeat-orbit missions such as Envisat or Jason over rivers. This study is one of the first examples for the combination of altimetry from drifting-ground track satellite missions, namely CryoSat-2, with a river model. CryoSat-2 SARIn Level 2 data is used to improve a 1D hydrodynamic model of the Brahmaputra River in South Asia, which is based on the Saint-Venant equations for unsteady flow and set up in the MIKE HYDRO River software. After calibration of discharge and water level the hydrodynamic model can accurately and bias-free represent the spatio-temporal variations of water levels. A data assimilation framework has been developed and linked with the model. It is a flexible framework that can assimilate water level data which are arbitrarily distributed in time and space. The setup has been used to assimilate CryoSat-2 water level observations over the Assam valley for the years 2010-2015, using an Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (ETKF). Performance improvement in terms of discharge forecasting skill was then evaluated. For experiments with synthetic CryoSat-2 data the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) was improved by up to 32%, whilst for experiments assimilating real data it could be improved by up to 10%. The developed methods are expected to be transferable to other rivers and altimeter missions. The model setup and calibration is based almost entirely on globally available remote sensing data.

TI  - Targeted exome sequencing defines novel and rare variants in complex blood group serology cases for a red blood cell reference laboratory setting
T2  - TRANSFUSION
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUNDWe previously demonstrated that targeted exome sequencing accurately defined blood group genotypes for reference panel samples characterized by serology and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping. Here we investigate the application of this approach to resolve problematic serology and SNP-typing cases.STUDY DESIGN AND METHODSThe TruSight One sequencing panel and MiSeq platform was used for sequencing. CLC Genomics Workbench software was used for data analysis of the blood group genes implicated in the serology and SNP-typing problem. Sequence variants were compared to public databases listing blood group alleles. The effect of predicted amino acid changes on protein function for novel alleles was assessed using SIFT and PolyPhen-2.RESULTSAmong 29 unresolved samples, sequencing defined SNPs in blood group genes consistent with serologic observation: 22 samples exhibited SNPs associated with varied but known blood group alleles and one sample exhibited a chimeric RH genotype. Three samples showed novel variants in the CROM, LAN, and RH systems, respectively, predicting respective amino acid changes with possible deleterious impact. Two samples harbored rare variants in the RH and FY systems, respectively, not previously associated with a blood group allele or phenotype. A final sample comprised a rare variant within the KLF1 transcription factor gene that may modulate DNA-binding activity.CONCLUSIONTargeted exome sequencing resolved complex serology problems and defined both novel blood group alleles (CD55:c.203G>A, ABCB6:c.1118_1124delCGGATCG, ABCB6:c.1656-1G>A, and RHD:c.452G>A) and rare variants on blood group alleles associated with altered phenotypes. This study illustrates the utility of exome sequencing, in conjunction with serology, as an alternative approach to resolve complex cases.

TI  - Impact of Gene Expression Profiling on Decision-Making in Clinically Node Negative Melanoma Patients after Surgical Staging
T2  - JOURNAL OF DRUGS IN DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction:The surgeon's role in the follow-up of pathologic stage I and II melanoma patients has traditionally been minimal. Melanoma genetic expression profile (GEP) testing provides binary risk assessment (Class 1-low risk, Class 2-high risk), which can assist in predicting metastasis and formulating appropriate follow up. We sought to determine the impact of GEP results on the management of clinically node negative cutaneous melanoma patients staged with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB).Methods: A retrospective review of prospectively gathered data consisting of patients seen from September 2015 - August 2016 was performed to determine whether GEP class influenced follow-up recommendations. Patients were stratified into four groups based on recommended follow-up plan: Dermatology alone, Surgical Oncology, Surgical Oncology with recommendation for adjuvant clinical trial, or Medical and Surgical Oncology.Results: Of ninety-one patients, 38 were pathologically stage I, 42 stage II, 10 stage III, and 1 stage IV. Combining all stages, GEP Class 1 patients were more likely to be followed by Dermatology alone and less like to be followed by Surgical Oncology with recommendation for adjuvant trial compared to Class 2 patients (P < 0.001). Among stage 1 patients, Class 1 were more likely to follow up with Dermatology alone compared to Class 2 patients (82 vs. 0%; P < 0.001). Among stage II patients, GEP Class 1 were more likely to follow up with Dermatology alone (21 vs 0%) and more Class 2 patients followed up with surgery and recommendations for adjuvant trial (36 vs 64%; P < 0.05).There was no difference in follow up for stage III patients based on the GEP results (P=0.76).Conclusion: GEP results were significantly associated with the management of stage I-II melanoma patients after staging with SLNB. For node negative patients, Class 2 results led to more aggressive follow up and management.

TI  - Endoscopic Delayed Breast Reconstruction With Expanders and Implants via the Axillary Incision Made for Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy or Lymphadenectomy
T2  - ANNALS OF PLASTIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Classic techniques of delayed prosthetic breast reconstruction use the mastectomy scar as an access route. As a result, the filling of the expander must be postponed until the wounds have healed. This creates an asymmetry between the breasts with the volume changes caused by the filling of the expander, which may occur over several weeks and cause considerable discomfort.Methods: Delayed breast reconstruction was performed via the axillary incision made for sentinel lymph node biopsy or lymphadenectomy with endoscopic assistance and detachment of the pectoralis major muscle. The filling of the expander and symmetrization with the contralateral breast was performed in the first stage.The expander was replaced with the definitive prosthesis 3 months later, after endoscopic capsulotomy. Fat grafting was performed to create a lipobed around the implant and to improve tissue quality.Results: Sixty-two patients underwent surgery. Mean follow-up was 19 months. There were no major complications in the reconstructed breast. One case of hematoma in a contralateral breast reduction and an oil cystic mass secondary to fat grafting were recorded. In all cases, the filling of the expander with the definitive volume was possible during the first stage.Conclusions: Endoscopic delayed breast reconstruction with insertion of implants through the axillary incision for sentinel node biopsy or lymphadenectomy is safe and feasible. It achieves complete intraoperative expansion, symmetry between the volumes of the breasts during the first stage, and avoids problems with the scar and the risk of extrusion, as the scar is placed remotely in the axilla.

TI  - Spatial Rice Yield Estimation Based on MODIS and Sentinel-1 SAR Data and ORYZA Crop Growth Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop insurance is a viable solution to reduce the vulnerability of smallholder farmers to risks from pest and disease outbreaks, extreme weather events, and market shocks that threaten their household food and income security. In developing and emerging countries, the implementation of area yield-based insurance, the form of crop insurance preferred by clients and industry, is constrained by the limited availability of detailed historical yield records. Remote-sensing technology can help to fill this gap by providing an unbiased and replicable source of the needed data. This study is dedicated to demonstrating and validating the methodology of remote sensing and crop growth model-based rice yield estimation with the intention of historical yield data generation for application in crop insurance. The developed system combines MODIS and SAR-based remote-sensing data to generate spatially explicit inputs for rice using a crop growth model. MODIS reflectance data were used to generate multitemporal LAI maps using the inverted Radiative Transfer Model (RTM). SAR data were used to generate rice area maps using MAPScape-RICE to mask LAI map products for further processing, including smoothing with logistic function and running yield simulation using the ORYZA crop growth model facilitated by the Rice Yield Estimation System (Rice-YES). Results from this study indicate that the approach of assimilating MODIS and SAR data into a crop growth model can generate well-adjusted yield estimates that adequately describe spatial yield distribution in the study area while reliably replicating official yield data with root mean square error, RMSE, of 0.30 and 0.46 t ha(-1) (normalized root mean square error, NRMSE of 5% and 8%) for the 2016 spring and summer seasons, respectively, in the Red River Delta of Vietnam, as evaluated at district level aggregation. The information from remote-sensing technology was also useful for identifying geographic locations with peculiarity in the timing of rice establishment, leaf growth, and yield level, and thus contributing to the spatial targeting of further investigation and interventions needed to reduce yield gaps.

AB  - In this study, we combined remote sensing data and in situ observations to explore the potential habitats of macroalgae at Libukang Island, Indonesia. High-resolution satellite images from the GeoEye-1 were used to estimate and to map the geomorphological structures together with macroalgal species in the study area. Seasonal variations of percentage cover and biomass of macroalgae associated with substrates were investigated in May and November 2014, and June 2015, using quadrats as sampling unit. A total of nine common genera were found in the study area with three dominant genera: Sargassum, Padina, and Turbinaria. Most of macroalgae was observed in the eastern part of the Island, on several substrate types and particular oceanographic conditions (wave and current). Mean biomasses of Sargassum and Padina were high in May (1189.6 +/- 455 and 166.7 +/- 15.4 g DW.m(-2), respectively), while the biomass of Turbinaria was high in November (3245 +/- 599.8 g DW.m(-2)). The map accuracy of image classification for all typology substrates was 74.19%. Overall, approximately 62.3% of the total study area can be considered as potential for natural macroalgae habitats. Spectral response characteristic of shallow water substrates at study area based on GeoEye-1 is also presented. The results of this study exhibit a potential utilization of natural macroalgae in the study area, and provide information for a possible diversification of the use of macroalgae in Indonesia. The method could be useful for habitat management and future biomonitoring in the study area or other similar areas in Indonesia.

TI  - Management of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer in Older Patients: How Is It Different?
T2  - ONCOLOGY-NEW YORK
M3  - Article
AB  - Triple-negative breast cancer, which affects about 10% of older women with breast cancer, represents a major treatment challenge in this population. Treatment decisions for these patients can best be made based on geriatric assessment, estimated life expectancy, whether the treatment goal is prolonged survival or palliation, the potential benefits and toxicities of a specific treatment, and the patient's personal goals for treatment. Treatment outcomes for healthy older and younger women are similar, but great challenges exist in managing the vulnerable and frail patient. The cornerstone of therapy for early-stage triple-negative breast cancer is local therapy (surgery and radiation) and, for most patients, adjuvant chemotherapy. In the management of metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, all therapy is palliative and chemotherapy is the treatment of choice. Since all treatment modalities in older patients-especially chemotherapy-can affect physical and mental function, a geriatric assessment is key in selecting the most appropriate treatment strategy. Many older patients (older than 70 years) are poor candidates for state-of-the-art therapy, and some who have substantial comorbidities not related to breast cancer may opt for palliative and hospice care. In this review, we will discuss the role of geriatric assessment, alternative treatment modalities for older women with triple-negative breast cancer, and other special considerations for this patient population.

TI  - Development of Wind Speed Retrieval from Cross-Polarization Chinese Gaofen-3 Synthetic Aperture Radar in Typhoons
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of our work is to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of retrieving sea surface wind speeds from C-band cross-polarization (herein vertical-horizontal, VH) Chinese Gaofen-3 (GF-3) SAR images in typhoons. In this study, we have collected three GF-3 SAR images acquired in Global Observation (GLO) and Wide ScanSAR (WSC) mode during the summer of 2017 from the China Sea, which includes the typhoons Noru, Doksuri and Talim. These images were collocated with wind simulations at 0.12 degrees grids from a numeric model, called the Regional Assimilation and Prediction System-Typhoon model (GRAPES-TYM). Recent research shows that GRAPES-TYM has a good performance for typhoon simulation in the China Sea. Based on the dataset, the dependence of wind speed and of radar incidence angle on normalized radar cross (NRCS) of VH-polarization GF-3 SAR have been investigated, after which an empirical algorithm for wind speed retrieval from VH-polarization GF-3 SAR was tuned. An additional four VH-polarization GF-3 SAR images in three typhoons, Noru, Hato and Talim, were investigated in order to validate the proposed algorithm. SAR-derived winds were compared with measurements from Windsat winds at 0.25 degrees grids with wind speeds up to 40 m/s, showing a 5.5 m/s root mean square error (RMSE) of wind speed and an improved RMSE of 5.1 m/s wind speed was achieved compared with the retrieval results validated against GRAPES-TYM winds. It is concluded that the proposed algorithm is a promising potential technique for strong wind retrieval from cross-polarization GF-3 SAR images without encountering a signal saturation problem.

TI  - Assessment of ecosystem resilience to hydroclimatic disturbances in India
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent studies have shown an increasing trend in hydroclimatic disturbances like droughts, which are anticipated to become more frequent and intense under global warming and climate change. Droughts adversely affect the vegetation growth and crop yield, which enhances the risks to food security for a country like India with over 1.2 billion people to feed. Here, we compared the response of terrestrial net primary productivity (NPP) to hydroclimatic disturbances in India at different scales (i.e., at river basins, land covers, and climate types) to examine the ecosystems' resilience to such adverse conditions. The ecosystem water use efficiency (WUEe: NPP/Evapotranspiration) is an effective indicator of ecosystem productivity, linking carbon (C) and water cycles. We found a significant difference (p<.05) in WUEe across India at different scales. The ecosystem resilience analysis indicated that most of the river basins were not resilient enough to hydroclimatic disturbances. Drastic reduction in WUEe under dry conditions was observed for some basins, which highlighted the cross-biome incapability to withstand such conditions. The ecosystem resilience at land cover and climate type scale did not completely relate to the basin-scale ecosystem resilience, which indicated that ecosystem resilience at basin scale is controlled by some other ecohydrological processes. Our results facilitate the identification of the most sensitive regions in the country for ecosystem management and climate policy making, and highlight the need for taking sufficient adaptation measures to ensure sustainability of ecosystems.

TI  - Analysis of Hydrological Sensitivity for Flood Risk Assessment
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In order for the Indian government to maximize Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM), the Brahmaputra River has played an important role in the undertaking of the Pilot Basin Study (PBS) due to the Brahmaputra River's annual regional flooding. The selected Kulsi Rivera part of Brahmaputra sub-basinexperienced severe floods in 2007 and 2008. In this study, the Rainfall-Runoff-Inundation (RRI) hydrological model was used to simulate the recent historical flood in order to understand and improve the integrated flood risk management plan. The ultimate objective was to evaluate the sensitivity of hydrologic simulation using different Digital Elevation Model (DEM) resources, coupled with DEM smoothing techniques, with a particular focus on the comparison of river discharge and flood inundation extent. As a result, the sensitivity analysis showed that, among the input parameters, the RRI model is highly sensitive to Manning's roughness coefficient values for flood plains, followed by the source of the DEM, and then soil depth. After optimizing its parameters, the simulated inundation extent showed that the smoothing filter was more influential than its simulated discharge at the outlet. Finally, the calibrated and validated RRI model simulations agreed well with the observed discharge and the Moderate Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-detected flood extents.

TI  - Research on Synthetic Aperture Radar Processing for the Spaceborne Sliding Spotlight Mode
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Gaofen-3 (GF-3) is China' first C-band multi-polarization synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite, which also provides the sliding spotlight mode for the first time. Sliding-spotlight mode is a novel mode to realize imaging with not only high resolution, but also wide swath. Several key technologies for sliding spotlight mode in spaceborne SAR with high resolution are investigated in this paper, mainly including the imaging parameters, the methods of velocity estimation and ambiguity elimination, and the imaging algorithms. Based on the chosen Convolution BackProjection (CBP) and PFA (Polar Format Algorithm) imaging algorithms, a fast implementation method of CBP and a modified PFA method suitable for sliding spotlight mode are proposed, and the processing flows are derived in detail. Finally, the algorithms are validated by simulations and measured data.

TI  - Statistical Model and Estimation of Inland Riverine Turbidity with Landsat 8 OLI Images: A Case Study
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) was investigated for its performance in monitoring dynamic riverine surface water turbidity. China's Hanjiang River, the largest tributary of the Yangtze River, was used as a case study. Field surveys conducted between April 2013 and January 2014 show a wide range of turbidity (15.8-130.2 nephelometric turbidity units). A practical exponential retrieval algorithm used in conjunction with OLI bands on Landsat 8 was developed to assess compatibility between satellite remote sensing reflectance and in situ measured data. Results obtained for the study area accurately match in situ data at most stations (R-2 > 0.90) for the validation phase. It was found that Landsat 8 OLI imagery can be used to estimate turbidity in inland riverine systems when a suitable retrieval algorithm is applied. In addition, algal blooms in the riverine system can be detected by OLI imagery.

TI  - Land Use and Cover Change during the Rapid Economic Growth Period from 1990 to 2010: A Case Study of Shanghai
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - China has experienced a period of rapid economic growth during the past few decades especially in Shanghai. The rapid urbanization has caused great change for land use and cover change (LUCC), which is a prominent feature of global change. This paper focuses on land use history and the driving forces of LUCC in Shanghai from 1990 to 2010. We evaluated the LUCC of Shanghai based on three period Landsat images using the land use transition matrix model, the land use dynamic degree model, and the land use degree model. Then we analyzed the potential driving forces from different dimensions. The results show that the most obvious pattern of LUCC is the increase of built-up area and the decrease of arable land. The land use change dynamic from 2000 to 2010 is much greater than that from 1990 to 2010. The main driving forces of LUCC are human activity and social economic development.

TI  - A Novel Ship Detection Method Based on Gradient and Integral Feature for Single-Polarization Synthetic Aperture Radar Imagery
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid development of remote sensing technologies, SAR satellites like China's Gaofen-3 satellite have more imaging modes and higher resolution. With the availability of high-resolution SAR images, automatic ship target detection has become an important topic in maritime research. In this paper, a novel ship detection method based on gradient and integral features is proposed. This method is mainly composed of three steps. First, in the preprocessing step, a filter is employed to smooth the clutters and the smoothing effect can be adaptive adjusted according to the statistics information of the sub-window. Thus, it can retain details while achieving noise suppression. Second, in the candidate area extraction, a sea-land segmentation method based on gradient enhancement is presented. The integral image method is employed to accelerate computation. Finally, in the ship target identification step, a feature extraction strategy based on Haar-like gradient information and a Radon transform is proposed. This strategy decreases the number of templates found in traditional Haar-like methods. Experiments were performed using Gaofen-3 single-polarization SAR images, and the results showed that the proposed method has high detection accuracy and rapid computational efficiency. In addition, this method has the potential for on-board processing.

TI  - Permafrost Presence/Absence Mapping of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau Based on Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) is known as the Third Polar of the earth and the Water Tower of Asia, with more than 70% of the area on the QTP is covered by permafrost possibly. An accurate permafrost distribution map based on valid and available methods is indispensable for the local environment evaluation and engineering constructions planning. Most of the previous permafrost maps have employed traditional mapping method based on field surveys and borehole investigation data. However their accuracy is limited because it is extremely difficulties in obtaining mass data in the high-altitude and cold regions as the QTP; moreover, the mapping method, which would effectively integrate many factors, is still facing great challenges. With the rapid development of remote sensing technology in permafrost mapping, spatial data derived from the satellite sensors can recognize the permafrost environment features and quantitatively estimate permafrost distribution. Until now there is no map indicated permafrost presence/absence on the QTP that has been generated only by remote sensing data as yet. Therefore, this paper used permafrost-influencing factors and examined distribution features of each factor in permafrost regions and seasonally frozen ground regions. Then, using the Decision Tree method with the environmental factors, the 1 km resolution permafrost map over the QTP was obtained. The result shows higher accuracy compared to the previous published map of permafrost on the QTP and the map of the glaciers, frozen ground and deserts in China, which also demonstrates that making comprehensive use of remote sensing technology in permafrost mapping research is fast, macro and feasible. Furthermore, this result provides a simple and valid method for further permafrost research.

TI  - Sensitivity Experiment of Surface Reflectance to Error-inducing Variables Based on the GEMS Satellite Observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE KOREAN EARTH SCIENCE SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The information of surface reflectance (R-sfc) is important for the heat balance and the environmental/climate monitoring. The R-sfc sensitivity to error-induced variables for the Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) retrieval from geostationary-orbit satellite observations at 300-500 nm was investigated, utilizing polar-orbit satellite data of the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Ozone Mapping Instrument (OMI), and the radiative transfer model (RTM) experiment. The variables in this study can be cloud, Rayleigh-scattering, aerosol, ozone and surface type. The cloud detection in high-resolution MODIS pixels (1 kmxl km) was compared with that in GEMS-scale pixels (8 kmx 7 km). The GEMS detection was consistent (similar to 79%) with the MODIS result. However, the detection probability in partially-cloudy (<= 40%) GEMS pixels decreased due to other effects (i.e., aerosol and surface type). The Rayleigh-scattering effect in RGB images was noticeable over ocean, based on the RTM calculation. The reflectance at top of atmosphere (R-toa) increased with aerosol amounts in case of R-sfc<0.2, but decreased in R-sfc >= 0.2. The R-sfc errors due to the aerosol increased with wavelength in the UV, but were constant or slightly decreased in the visible. The ozone absorption was most sensitive at 328 nm in the UV region (328-354 nm). The R-sfc error was +0.1 because of negative total ozone anomaly (-100 DU) under the condition of R-sfc=0.15. This study can be useful to estimate R sic uncertainties in the GEMS retrieval.

AB  - Despite more than a half century of "safe" cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), the evidence base surrounding the conduct of anticoagulation therapy for CPB has not been organized into a succinct guideline. For this and other reasons, there is enormous practice variability relating to the use and dosing of heparin, monitoring heparin anticoagulation, reversal of anticoagulation, and the use of alternative anticoagulants. To address this and other gaps, The Society of Thoracic Surgeons, the Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists, and the American Society of Extracorporeal Technology developed an Evidence Based Workgroup. This was a group of interdisciplinary professionals gathered to summarize the evidence and create practice recommendations for various aspects of CPB. To date, anticoagulation practices in CPB have not been standardized in accordance with the evidence base. This clinical practice guideline was written with the intent to fill the evidence gap and to establish best practices in anticoagulation therapy for CPB using the available evidence. To identify relevant evidence, a systematic review was outlined and literature searches were conducted in PubMed using standardized medical subject heading (MeSH) terms from the National Library of Medicine list of search terms. Search dates were inclusive of January 2000 to December 2015. The search yielded 833 abstracts, which were reviewed by two independent reviewers. Once accepted into the full manuscript review stage, two members of the writing group evaluated each of 286 full papers for inclusion eligibility into the guideline document. Ninety-six manuscripts were included in the final review. In addition, 17 manuscripts published before 2000 were included to provide method, context, or additional supporting evidence for the recommendations as these papers were considered sentinel publications. Members of the writing group wrote and developed recommendations based on review of the articles obtained and achieved more than two thirds agreement on each recommendation. The quality of information for a given recommendation allowed assessment of the level of evidence as recommended by the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines. Recommendations were written in the three following areas: ( 1) heparin dosing and monitoring for initiation and maintenance of CPB; ( 2) heparin contraindications and heparin alternatives; and ( 3) reversal of anticoagulation during cardiac operations. It is hoped that this guideline will serve as a resource and will stimulate investigators to conduct more research and to expand on the evidence base on the topic of anticoagulation therapy for CPB.

Once accepted into the full manuscript review stage, two members of the writing group evaluated each of 286 full papers for inclusion eligibility into the guideline document. Ninety-six manuscripts were included in the final review. In addition, 17 manuscripts published before 2000 were included to provide method, context, or additional supporting evidence for the recommendations as these papers were considered sentinel publications.Members of the writing group wrote and developed recommendations based on review of the articles obtained and achieved more than two thirds agreement on each recommendation. The quality of information for a given recommendation allowed assessment of the level of evidence as recommended by the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines. Recommendations were written in the three following areas: (1) heparin dosing and monitoring for initiation and maintenance of CPB; (2) heparin contraindications and heparin alternatives; and (3) reversal of anticoagulation during cardiac operations. It is hoped that this guideline will serve as a resource and will stimulate investigators to conduct more research and to expand on the evidence base on the topic of anticoagulation therapy for CPB.

TI  - Late Quaternary glaciation history of monsoon-dominated Dingad basin, central Himalaya, India
T2  - QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - The study presents the Late Quaternary glaciation history of monsoon-dominated Dokriani Glacier valley, Dingad basin, central Himalaya, India. The basin is tested for the mechanism of landforms preservation in high relief and abundant precipitation regimes of the Higher Himalaya. Field geomorphology and remote sensing data, supported by Optical Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dating enabled identification of five major glacial events of decreasing magnitude. The oldest glacial stage, Dokriani Glacial Stage I (DGS-I), extended down to similar to 8 km (2883 m asl) from present-day snout (3965 m asl) followed by other four glaciatious events viz. DGS-II, DGS-III, DGS-IV and DGS-V terminating at similar to 3211, 3445, 3648 and similar to 3733 m asl respectively. The DGS-I glaciation (similar to 25-similar to 22 ka BP) occurred during early Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) -2, characterized as Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) extension of the valley. Similarly, DGS-II stage (similar to 14-similar to 11 ka BP) represents the global cool and dry Older Dryas and Younger Dryas event glaciation. The DGS-III glaciation (similar to 8 ka BP) coincides with early Holocene 8.2 ka cooling event, the DGS-lV glaciations (similar to 4-3.7 ka BP) corresponds to 4.2 ka cool and drier event, DGS-V (similar to 2.7-similar to 1 ka BP) represents the cool and moist late Holocene glacial advancement of the valley. This study suggests that the Dokriani Glacier valley responded to the global lowering of temperature and variable precipitation conditions. This study also highlights the close correlation between the monsoon-dominated valley glaciations and Northern Hemisphere cooling events influenced by North Atlantic climate. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - An intercomparison of different topography effects on discrimination performance of fuzzy change vector analysis algorithm
T2  - METEOROLOGY AND ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Detection of snow cover changes is vital for avalanche hazard analysis and flood flashes that arise due to variation in temperature. Hence, multitemporal change detection is one of the practical mean to estimate the snow cover changes over larger area using remotely sensed data. There have been some previous studies that examined how accuracy of change detection analysis is affected by different topography effects over Northwestern Indian Himalayas. The present work emphases on the intercomparison of different topography effects on discrimination performance of fuzzy based change vector analysis (FCVA) as change detection algorithm that includes extraction of change-magnitude and change-direction from a specific pixel belongs multiple or partial membership. The qualitative and quantitative analysis of the proposed FCVA algorithm is performed under topographic conditions and topographic correction conditions. The experimental outcomes confirmed that in change category discrimination procedure, FCVA with topographic correction achieved 86.8% overall accuracy and 4.8% decay (82% of overall accuracy) is found in FCVA without topographic correction. This study suggests that by incorporating the topographic correction model over mountainous region satellite imagery, performance of FCVA algorithm can be significantly improved up to great extent in terms of determining actual change categories.

TI  - Mapping the Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Europe's Land Surface Temperatures
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The land surface temperature (LST) drives many terrestrial biophysical processes and varies rapidly in space and time primarily due to the earth's diurnal and annual cycles. Models of the diurnal and annual LST cycle retrieved from satellite data can be reduced to several gap-free parameters that represent the surface's thermal characteristics and provide a generalized characterization of the LST temporal dynamics. In this letter, we use such an approach to map Europe's annual and diurnal LST dynamics. In particular, we reduce a five-year time series (2009-2013) of diurnal LST from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) to 48 sets of half-hourly annual cycle parameters (ACPs), namely, the mean annual LST, the yearly amplitude of LST, and the LST phase shift from the spring equinox. The derived data provide a complete representation of how mainland Europe responds to the heating of the sun and the nighttime LST decay and reveal how Europe's biogeographic regions differ in that respect. We further argue that the SEVIRI ACP can provide an observation-based spatially consistent background for studying and characterizing the thermal behavior of the surface and also a data set to support climate classification at a finer spatial resolution.

AB  - Using a test-negative design, we assessed interim vaccine effectiveness (VE) for the 2017/18 epidemic of co-circulating influenza A(H3N2) and B(Yamagata) viruses. Adjusted VE for influenza A(H3N2), driven by a predominant subgroup of clade 3C.2a viruses with T131K + R142K + R261Q substitutions, was low at 17% (95% confidence interval (CI): -14 to 40). Adjusted VE for influenza B was higher at 55% (95% CI: 38 to 68) despite prominent use of trivalent vaccine containing lineage-mismatched influenza B(Victoria) antigen, suggesting cross-lineage protection.

AB  - The paper discusses certain limitations on applicability of Spectral Deconvolution Algorithm (SDA) to aerosol optical depth spectral measurements contaminated by cirrus clouds. Analysis of the synthetic data demonstrates that application of SDA to cloud contaminated measurements can produce significant errors in the apparent optical depth fine mode retrievals. Such application can produce results that just look reasonable and physically admissible but in fact can be relatively far from the truth and therefore can be misleading. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Multisensor Analysis of Spectral Dimensionality and Soil Diversity in the Great Central Valley of California
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Planned hyperspectral satellite missions and the decreased revisit time of multispectral imaging offer the potential for data fusion to leverage both the spectral resolution of hyperspectral sensors and the temporal resolution of multispectral constellations. Hyperspectral imagery can also be used to better understand fundamental properties of multispectral data. In this analysis, we use five flight lines from the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) archive with coincident Landsat 8 acquisitions over a spectrally diverse region of California to address the following questions: (1) How much of the spectral dimensionality of hyperspectral data is captured in multispectral data?; (2) Is the characteristic pyramidal structure of the multispectral feature space also present in the low order dimensions of the hyperspectral feature space at comparable spatial scales?; (3) How much variability in rock and soil substrate endmembers (EMs) present in hyperspectral data is captured by multispectral sensors? We find nearly identical partitions of variance, low-order feature space topologies, and EM spectra for hyperspectral and multispectral image composites. The resulting feature spaces and EMs are also very similar to those from previous global multispectral analyses, implying that the fundamental structure of the global feature space is present in our relatively small spatial subset of California. Finally, we find that the multispectral dataset well represents the substrate EM variability present in the study area - despite its inability to resolve narrow band absorptions. We observe a tentative but consistent physical relationship between the gradation of substrate reflectance in the feature space and the gradation of sand versus clay content in the soil classification system.

TI  - Supporting energy regulation by monitoring land motion on a regional and national scale: A case study of Scotland
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART A-JOURNAL OF POWER AND ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The advent of new satellite and data processing techniques have meant that routine, operational and reliable surveys of land motion on a regional and national scale are now possible. In this paper, we apply a novel satellite remote sensing technique, the Intermittent Small Baseline Subset method, to data from a new satellite mission, Sentinel-1, and demonstrate that a wide area map of ground deformation can be generated that supports the regulation of a range of energy-related activities. The area for the demonstration is mainland Scotland (similar to 75,000 km(2)) and the land motion map required the processing of some 627 images acquired from March 2015 to April 2017. The results show that land motion is encountered almost everywhere across Scotland, dominated by subsidence over peatland areas. However, many other phenomena are also encountered including landslides and deformation associated with mining and civil engineering activities. Considering specifically Petroleum Exploration and Development Licence areas offered under the 14th Onshore Licensing Round in the UK, examples of the types of land motion are shown, including an example related to soil restoration by a wind farm. It is demonstrated that, in Scotland at least, almost all licence areas contain deformation of one form or another and, furthermore, the causes of that subsidence are dynamic and likely to be changing from year-to-year. Therefore, maps like this are likely to be of enormous use in a regulatory framework to scope out pre-existing problems in a licence area and to ensure that the correct monitoring framework is put in place once activities begin. They can also provide evidence of good practice and give assurance against litigation by third parties.

TI  - Land-atmosphere interaction patterns in southeastern South America using satellite products and climate models
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In regions of strong Land-Atmosphere (L-A) interaction, soil moisture (SM) conditions can impact the atmosphere through modulating the land surface fluxes. The importance of the identification of L-A interaction regions lies in the potential improvement of the weather/seasonal forecast and the better understanding of the physical mechanisms involved. This study aims to compare the terrestrial segment of the L-A interaction from satellite products and climate models, motivated by previous modeling studies pointing out southeastern South America (SESA) as a L-A hotspot during austral summer. In addition, the L-A interaction under dry or wet anomalous conditions over SESA is analyzed. To identify L-A hotspots the AMSRE-LPRM SM and MODIS land surface temperature products; coupled climate models and uncoupled land surface models were used. SESA highlights as a strong L-A interaction hotspot when employing different metrics, temporal scales and independent datasets, showing consistency between models and satellite estimations. Both AMSRE-LPRM bands (X and C) are consistent showing a strong L-A interaction hotspot over the Pampas ecoregion. Intensification and a larger spatial extent of the L-A interaction for dry summers was observed in both satellite products and models compared to wet summers. These results, which were derived from measured physical variables, are encouraging and promising for future studies analyzing L-A interactions.L-A interaction analysis is proposed here as a meeting point between remote sensing and climate modelling communities of Argentina, within a region with the highest agricultural and livestock production of the continent, but with an important lack of in-situ SM observations.

TI  - Land Cover Change Simulations in Yangon Under Several Scenarios of Flood and Earthquake Vulnerabilities with Master Plan
T2  - JOURNAL OF DISASTER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Yangon is the largest city and major economic area in Myanmar. However, it is considered to have a high risk of floods and earthquakes. In order to mitigate future flood and earthquake damage in Yangon, land cover change simulations considering flood and earthquake vulnerabilities are needed to support urban planning and management. This paper proposes land cover change simulations in Yangon from 2020 to 2040 under various scenarios of flood and earthquake vulnerabilities with a master plan. In our methodology, we used a dynamic statistical model to predict urban expansion in Yangon from 2020 to 2040. We employed a master plan as the future dataset to enhance the prediction of urban expansion. We applied flood and earthquake vulnerabilities based on multi-criteria analysis as the areas vulnerable to disaster. We simulated land cover changes from 2020 to 2040 considering the vulnerable areas with a master plan for multiple scenarios. The experiments indicated that by using a master plan, some of the predicted urban areas are still located in areas highly vulnerable to floods and earthquakes. By integrating the prediction of urban expansion with flood and earthquake vulnerabilities, the predicted urban areas can effectively avoid areas highly vulnerable to floods and earthquakes.

TI  - Awe and Humility
T2  - JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Humility is a foundational virtue that counters selfish inclinations such as entitlement, arrogance, and narcissism (Tangney, 2000). We hypothesize that experiences of awe promote greater humility. Guided by an appraisal-tendency framework of emotion, we propose that when individuals encounter an entity that is vast and challenges their worldview, they feel awe, which leads to self-diminishment and subsequently humility. In support of these claims, awe-prone individuals were rated as more humble by friends (Study 1) and reported greater humility across a 2-week period (Study 2), controlling for other positive emotions. Inducing awe led participants to present a more balanced view of their strengths and weaknesses to others (Study 3) and acknowledge, to a greater degree, the contribution of outside forces in their own personal accomplishments (Study 4), compared with neutral and positive control conditions. Finally, an awe-inducing expansive view elicited greater reported humility than a neutral view (Study 5). We also elucidated the process by which awe leads to humility. Feelings of awe mediated the relationship between appraisals (perceptions of vastness and a challenge to one's world view) and humility (Study 4), and self-diminishment mediated the relationship between awe and humility (Study 5). Taken together, these results reveal that awe offers one path to greater humility.

TI  - A Triangular Theory of Creativity
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY OF AESTHETICS CREATIVITY AND THE ARTS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents a triangular theory of creativity. The triangular theory builds upon 2 earlier accounts, namely, a 3-facet model of creativity and an investment theory of creativity. According to the triangular theory, creative individuals defy the crowd (other people and their conscious beliefs), themselves (the individual), and/or the Zeitgeist (the shared and often unconscious worldview of their field). Different combinations of kinds of defiance lead to different manifestations of creativity. Creativity is viewed basically as an attitude toward life and one's work, but also has cognitive, affective, motivational, and environmental components. The article opens with a general introduction to creativity and what it is, and then describes the earlier theories upon which the triangular theory builds. Then it describes the triangular theory in some detail. Next it compares the triangular theory with other theories. Then it discusses how the triangular theory could be directly tested empirically. Finally the article draws conclusions.

TI  - Use of indocyanine green angiography in oncological and reconstructive breast surgery
T2  - ANNALES DE CHIRURGIE PLASTIQUE ESTHETIQUE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Indocyanine green (ICG) is a soluble dye that is eliminated by the liver and excreted in bile. When illuminated by an near-infrared light, the ICG emits fluorescence in the near-infrared spectrum, which can be captured by a near-infrared camera-handled device. In case of intravenous injection, ICG may be used as a marker of skin perfusion. In case of interstitial injection, it may be useful for lymphatic network mapping. In oncological and reconstructive breast surgery, ICG is used for sentinel lymph node identification, to predict mastectomy skin flap necrosis, to assess the perfusion of free flaps in autologous reconstruction and for diagnosis and treatment of upper limb secondary lymphedema. Intraoperative indocyanine green fluorescence might also be used to guide the excision of nonpalpable breast cancer. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI  - Improved Co-Registration of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 Imagery for Earth Surface Motion Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The constellation of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 optical satellites offers opportunities for a wide range of Earth Observation (EO) applications and scientific studies in Earth sciences mainly related to geohazards. The multi-temporal co-registration accuracy of images provided by both missions is, however, currently not fully satisfactory for change detection, time-series analysis and in particular Earth surface motion measurements. The objective of this work is the development, implementation and test of an automatic processing chain for correcting co-registration artefacts targeting accurate alignment of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 imagery for time series analysis. The method relies on dense sub-pixel offset measurements and robust statistics to correct for systematic offsets and striping artefacts. Experimental evaluation at sites with diverse environmental settings is conducted to evaluate the efficiency of the processing chain in comparison with previously proposed routines. The experimental evaluation suggests lower residual offsets than existing methods ranging between = 2.30 and 2.91 m remaining stable for longer time series. A first case study demonstrates the utility of the processor for the monitoring of continuously active landslides. A second case study demonstrates the use of the processor for measuring co-seismic surface displacements indicating an accuracy of 1/5 th of a pixel after corrections and 1/10th of a pixel after calibration with ground measurements. The implemented processing chain is available as an open source tool to support a better exploitation of the growing archives of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8.

M3  - Article
AB  - The uptake of Cd and some biomarkers of exposure and effects have been investigated in specimens of land snail Cornu aspersum exposed to vaporized CdCl2 (10 mg/L) for 7 days. The Cd levels quantified in snail's whole bodies confirmed Cd bioavailability trough vaporization and an higher accumulation in the midgut gland compared to the foot. Biological responses investigated showed a reduction of destabilization time of lysosomal membranes (NRRT) in hemocytes and an induction of catalase activities (CAT) in midgut gland. A further evidence of CdCl2 vaporized exposure was given by an increase in MT protein content as well as induction of Cd-MT gene expression, highlighting the central role of the midgut gland in Cd detoxification. These biomarkers can thus be considered as sensitive tools for the assessment of Cd contamination in the air using land snails as bioindicators. No changes in of GST activity and MDA were observed. From the overall results, the land snail, C. aspersum, could be used as good bioindicator of air quality for pollution monitoring purposes having shown clear signs of exposure and effects due Cd exposure by air.

TI  - Anatomy of the Lymphatic System and the Lymphosome Concept with Reference to Lymphedema
T2  - SEMINARS IN PLASTIC SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Precise knowledge of the lymphatic system normal anatomy is essential for understanding what structural changes occur in patients with lymphedema. In this article, the authors first review previous anatomical studies and summarize the general anatomy of the lymphatic system and lymphatic pathways in the upper and lower extremities. Second, they introduce their new anatomical concept, the "lymphosome," which describes how the lymphatic vessels in a particular region connect to the same subgroup of regional lymph nodes. In addition, they describe the anatomical relationship between the perforating lymphatic vessels and arteries. In the last section, they explain the anatomical changes in the lymphatics after lymph node dissection, with reference to secondary lymphedema.

TI  - Glacier changes in the Qilian Mountains in the past half-century: Based on the revised First and Second Chinese Glacier Inventory
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers are the most important fresh-water resources in arid and semi-arid regions of western China. According to the Second Chinese Glacier Inventory (SCGI), primarily compiled from Landsat TM/ETM+ images, the Qilian Mountains had 2684 glaciers covering an area of 1597.81 +/- 70.30 km2 and an ice volume of similar to 84.48 km(3) from 2005 to 2010. While most glaciers are small (85.66% are < 1.0 km(2)), some larger ones (12.74% in the range 1.0-5.0 km(2)) cover 42.44% of the total glacier area. The Laohugou Glacier No.12 (20.42 km(2)) located on the north slope of the Daxue Range is the only glacier > 20 km(2) in the Qilian Mountains. Median glacier elevation was 4972.7 m and gradually increased from east to west. Glaciers in the Qilian Mountains are distributed in Gansu and Qinghai provinces, which have 1492 glaciers (760.96 km(2)) and 1192 glaciers (836.85 km(2)), respectively. The Shule River basin contains the most glaciers in both area and volume. However, the Heihe River, the second largest inland river in China, has the minimum average glacier area. A comparison of glaciers from the SCGI and revised glacier inventory based on topographic maps and aerial photos taken from 1956 to 1983 indicate that all glaciers have receded, which is consistent with other mountain and plateau areas in western China. In the past half-century, the area and volume of glaciers decreased by 420.81 km(2) (-20.88%) and 21.63 km(3) (-20.26%), respectively. Glaciers with areas < 1.0 km(2) decreased the most in number and area recession. Due to glacier shrinkage, glaciers below 4000 m completely disappeared. Glacier changes in the Qilian Mountains presented a clear longitudinal zonality, i.e., the glaciers rapidly shrank in the east but slowly in the central-west. The primary cause of glacier recession was warming temperatures, which was slightly mitigated with increased precipitation.

TI  - Lessons learnt from implementation of the International Health Regulations: a systematic review
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION
M3  - Review
AB  - Objective To respond to the World Health Assembly call for dissemination of lessons learnt from countries that have begun implementing the International Health Regulations, 2005 revision; IHR (2005).Methods In November 2015, we conducted a systematic search of the following online databases and sources: PubMed (R), Embase (R), Global Health, Scopus, World Health Organization (WHO) Global Index Medicus, WHO Bulletin on IHR Implementation and the International Society for Disease Surveillance. We included identified studies and reports summarizing national experience in implementing any of the IHR (2005) core capacities or their components. We excluded studies that were theoretical or referred to IHR (1969). Qualitative systematic review methodology, including meta-ethnography, was used for qualitative synthesis.Findings We analysed 51 articles from 77 countries representing all WHO Regions. The meta-syntheses identified a total of 44 lessons learnt across the eight core capacities of IHR (2005). Major themes included the need to mobilize and sustain political commitment; to adapt global requirements based on local sociocultural, epidemiological, health system and economic contexts; and to conduct baseline and follow-up assessments to monitor the status of IHR (2005) implementation.Conclusion Although experiences of IHR (2005) implementation covered a wide global range, more documentation from Africa and Eastern Europe is needed. We did not find specific areas of weakness in monitoring IHR (2005); sustained monitoring of all core capacities is required to ensure effective systems. These lessons learnt could be adapted by countries in the process of meeting IHR (2005) requirements.

TI  - Script Analysis of Open-air Drug Selling: A Systematic Social Observation of CCTV Footage
T2  - JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN CRIME AND DELINQUENCY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Through the use of closed-circuit television (CCTV) video footage, the current study builds upon the drug transaction work of Piza and Sytsma by developing a crime script for open-air drug selling.Methods: Researchers conducted a systematic social observation of CCTV footage of open-air drug markets in Newark, NJ. The data were used to identify sequential stages of drug transactions. Fisher's exact tests measured whether buyer and seller activities during specific acts of the drug transaction event were related to activities seen in subsequent stages.Results: This study finds three distinct acts to open-air drug events. During the pretransaction act, one party (usually the buyer) initiates the transaction. There must then be an exchange of narcotics for money, which typically occurs in one simultaneous transfer and in one location. There is necessarily posttransaction mobility, with sellers most commonly maintaining their anchor point within the drug territoryparticularly when the interactions are buyer initiated.Conclusions: Results of this study contribute to the crime script and situational crime prevention literatures by demonstrating acts inherent in public drug selling and by advocating for a focus on the posttransaction period and seller anchor points within drug markets through leveraging the sentinel role of police officers.

TI  - Determining the role of lineaments in underground hydrodynamics using Landsat 7 ETM+ data, case of the Chott El Gharbi Basin (western Algeria)
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper attempts an overview of the application of remote sensing to groundwater studies. Its objective is to define the role of the geological features in the underground hydrodynamic in the aquifer system of the Chott El Gharbi Basin (Algerian western high plains) and identify a link between the fracturing and the meteoric water supply of this deep aquifer. The methodology followed consists to study the fracturing map of studied area which is obtained after Landsat 7 ETM+ processing images. It is based on structural lineaments mapping. The obtained map has been validated by geophysical results and geological map. Statistical analysis of the lineaments network shows the presence of about 537 lineaments divided into four families oriented according to the following directions NE-SW, NW-SE, N-S, and E-W. The lineament analysis of the studied basin provides important information on subsurface fractures that may control the circulation and storage of groundwater. These fractures have an undeniable hydrogeological interest because of their size, a priori favorable for the aquifers recharge in the region. The probable link between the Chott El Gharbi implementation and the presence of mega fractures which some of them correspond actually to Wadis is confirmed. The correlation between the productivity of high debit drillings and the closest lineament confirms that these lineaments are surface traces of regional discontinuities and act as main groundwater flow paths.

TI  - An Identification Method for Spring Maize in Northeast China Based on Spectral and Phenological Features
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate data about the spatial distribution and planting area of maize is important for policy making, economic development, environmental protection and food security under climate change. This paper proposes a new identification method for spring maize based on spectral and phenological features derived from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface reflectance time-series data. The method focused on the spectral differences of different land cover types in the specific phenological phases of spring maize by testing the selections and combinations of classification metrics, feature extraction methods and classifiers. Taking Liaoning province, a representative planting region of spring maize in Northeast China, as the study area, the results indicated that the combined multiple metrics, including the red reflectance, near-infrared reflectance and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), were conducive to the maize identification and were better than any single metric. With regard to the feature extraction and selection, maize identification based on different phenological features selected with prior knowledge was more efficient than that based on statistical features derived from the principal component analysis. Compared with the maximum likelihood classification method, the decision tree classification based on expert knowledge was more suitable for phenological features selected from some prior knowledge. In summary, discriminant rules were defined with those phenological features from multiple metrics, and the decision tree classification was used to identify maize in the study area. The producer's accuracy of maize identification was 98.57%, and the user's accuracy was 81.18%. This method can be potentially applied to an operational identification of maize at large scales based on remote sensing time-series data.

TI  - Big Geospatial Data Analytics for Global Mangrove Biomass and Carbon Estimation
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study is to estimate the biomass and carbon of global-level mangroves as a special type of wetland. Mangrove ecosystems play an important role in regulating carbon cycling, thus having a significant impact on global environmental change. Extensive studies have been conducted for the estimation of mangrove biomass and carbon stock. However, this estimation at a global level has been insufficiently investigated because the spatial scale of interest is large and most existing studies are based on physically challenging fieldwork surveys that are limited to local scales. Over the past few decades, high-resolution geospatial data related to mangroves have been increasingly collected and processed using remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technologies. While these geospatial data create potential for the estimation of mangrove biomass and carbon, the processing and analysis of these data represent a big data-driven challenge. In this study, we present a spatially explicit approach that integrates GIS-based geospatial analysis and high-performance parallel computing for the estimation of mangrove biomass and carbon at the global level. This integrated approach provides support for enabling and accelerating the global-level estimation of mangrove biomass and carbon from existing high-resolution geospatial data. With this integrated approach, the total area, biomass (including above-and below-ground), and associated carbon stock of global mangroves are estimated as 130,420 km(2), 1.908 Pg, and 0.725 Pg C for the year of 2000. The averaged aboveground biomass density of global mangroves is estimated as 146.3 Mg ha(-1). Our analysis results demonstrate that this integrated geospatial analysis approach is efficacious for the computationally challenging estimation of global mangrove metrics based on high-resolution data. This global-level estimation and associated results are of great assistance for promoting our understanding of complex geospatial dynamics in mangrove forests.

TI  - Evaluating environmental equities of urban forest in terms of cooling services using ETM plus and Google data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban forest plays an important role in mitigating the urban heat island. However, the cooling effects of different types of urban forest are unclear. In addition, the fairness of the cooling effect of the urban forest has not been discussed. In this study, the land surface temperature (LST) of Changchun City, China was obtained from Landsat ETM+ data and then correlated with detailed urban forest information derived from the high-spatial-resolution Google Maps in order to determine the cooling intensity and cooling distance of different types of urban forest. In addition, the Gini coefficient was used to evaluate the equity of cooling services provided by the urban forest. The results indicated that (1) the total area of urban forest in Changchun City is 106.69 km(2) and is composed of attached forest (AF, 45.83 km(2)), road forest (RF, 23.87 km(2)), ecological public welfare forest (EF, 23.24 km(2)) and landscape forest (LF, 13.75 km(2)); (2) the cooling effect of different types of urban forest varies. The cooling intensity and cooling distance are 3.2 A degrees C and 125 m (LF), 0.2 A degrees C and 150 m (EF) and 0.6 A degrees C and 5 m (AF), and RF had no cooling effect; and (3) the cooling effect of urban forest benefits approximately 760,000 people in Changchun City, and the Gini coefficient of the cooling services of urban forest was 0.29, indicating that the cooling service was reasonable. Therefore, we demonstrated that ETM+ and Google data are a convenient and affordable approach to study the LST on an urban scale, and the Gini coefficient could be a meaningful indicator to evaluate urban ecological services.

TI  - A Two-Stage Deep Neural Network Framework for Precipitation Estimation from Bispectral Satellite Information
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Compared to ground precipitation measurements, satellite-based precipitation estimation products have the advantage of global coverage and high spatiotemporal resolutions. However, the accuracy of satellite-based precipitation products is still insufficient to serve many weather, climate, and hydrologic applications at high resolutions. In this paper, the authors develop a state-of-the-art deep learning framework for precipitation estimation using bispectral satellite information, infrared (IR), and water vapor (WV) channels. Specifically, a two-stage framework for precipitation estimation from bispectral information is designed, consisting of an initial rain/no-rain (R/NR) binary classification, followed by a second stage estimating the nonzero precipitation amount. In the first stage, the model aims to eliminate the large fraction of NR pixels and to delineate precipitation regions precisely. In the second stage, the model aims to estimate the pointwise precipitation amount accurately while preserving its heavily skewed distribution. Stacked denoising autoencoders (SDAEs), a commonly used deep learning method, are applied in both stages. Performance is evaluated along a number of common performance measures, including both R/NR and real-valued precipitation accuracy, and compared with an operational product, Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information Using Artificial Neural Networks-Cloud Classification System (PERSIANN-CCS). For R/NR binary classification, the proposed two-stage model outperforms PERSIANN-CCS by 32.56% in the critical success index (CSI). For real-valued precipitation estimation, the two-stage model is 23.40% lower in average bias, is 44.52% lower in average mean squared error, and has a 27.21% higher correlation coefficient. Hence, the two-stage deep learning framework has the potential to serve as a more accurate and more reliable satellite-based precipitation estimation product. The authors also provide some future directions for development of satellite-based precipitation estimation products in both incorporating auxiliary information and improving retrieval algorithms.

M3  - Article
AB  - Psittacosis is a rare but potentially fatal zoonosis caused by Chlamydia psittaci, an organism that is typically associated with bird contact. However C.psittaci is capable of infecting other non-avian hosts, such as horses, sheep, cattle and goats. Stud staff and veterinarians have significant exposure to parturient animals and reproductive materials in their routine work. To investigate the zoonotic potential associated with the emergence of C.psittaci as an abortifacient agent in horses, we established a programme of joint human and animal surveillance in a sentinel horse-breeding region in Australia. This programme comprised cross-notification of equine cases to public health agencies, and active follow-up of known human contacts, including stud workers, foaling staff, veterinarians and laboratory staff. We identified no confirmed cases of acute psittacosis despite intensive surveillance and testing of heavily exposed contacts; however, further work in the area is needed.

TI  - Analyzing long-term spatio-temporal patterns of land surface temperature in response to rapid urbanization in the mega-city of Tehran
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Analyzing and monitoring spatial and temporal urbanization is vital for a better understanding of land surface temperature (LST) variations. Only a few studies have examined LST variations in mega-cities regarding longterm spatial and temporal scales. First, this study compared heat differences between urban and sub-urban areas (referred to hereafter as the regional scale) in the entire mega-city of Tehran and urban heat variation among 22 regions located within Tehran (referred to hereafter as the local scale) during last three decades. Second, we examined how land cover, climate and elevation data were correlated with urban heat for regional and local scales in the mega-city of Tehran. A series of six Landsat TM images of Tehran in 1986, 1991, 1994, 2001, 2008, and 2011 were classified into four land cover classes (built-up, crop, open space, and green lands). These images were also used to calculate land surface temperature (LST) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). We used 30 m elevation data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission. We also downloaded 1 km climate data including temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, vapor pressure and wind speed from Global Climate. At the regional scale, we found that urbanization in the mega-city of Tehran doubled during last three decades increasing from 21% in 1986-43% in 2011. Moreover, the mean LST difference among various land cover classes was on average 5.70 degrees C in each time point. Furthermore, the mean LST for various land cover classes increased on average 6.46 degrees C from 1986 to 2011. We also found that mean NDVI, mean elevation and mean climate were more effective in reducing mean LST inside Tehran than outside Tehran. At the local scale, regions north of Tehran experienced the lowest mean LST values while regions south and southwest of Tehran experienced the highest mean LST values from 1986 to 2011. Moreover, the mean LST difference among the 22 regions in each time point observed was 6.77 degrees C on average. Furthermore, the mean LSTs for all regions increased on average 3.75 degrees C from 1986 to 2011. As the mean LST increased, the mean NDVI became a stronger factor in mitigating the mean LSTs in all 22 regions. Finally, mean NDVI, mean elevation and mean climate across 22 regions played significant role to control LST variations inside Tehran. We concluded that long-term spatial and temporal analysis can inform decision-makers for better planning to mitigate and control urban heat variations in the mega-city of Tehran.

TI  - MODIS-derived EVI, NDVI and WDRVI time series to estimate phenological metrics in French deciduous forests
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring forest phenology allows us to study the effects of climate change on vegetated land surfaces. Daily and composite time series (TS) of several vegetation indices (VIs) from MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data have been widely used in scientific works for phenological studies since the beginning of the MODIS mission. The objective of this work was to use MODIS data to find the best VI/TS combination to estimate start-of-season (SOS) and end-of-season (EOS) dates across 50 temperate deciduous forests. Our research used as inputs 2001-2012 daily reflectance from MODO9GQ/MODO9GA products and 16 day composite VIs from the MOD13Q1 dataset. The 50 pixels centered on the 50 forest plots were extracted from the above-mentioned MODIS imagery; we then generated 5 different types of TS (1 daily from MODO9 and 4 composite from MOD13Q1) and used all of them to implement 6 VIs, obtaining 30 VI/TS combinations. SOS and EOS estimates were determined for each pixel/year and each VI/TS combination. SOS/EOS estimations were then validated against ground phonological observations. Results showed that, in our test areas, composite TS, if actual acquisition date is considered, performed mostly better than daily TS. EVI, WDRVI0.20 and NDVI were more suitable to SOS estimation, while VVDRVI0.05 and EVI were more convenient in estimating early and advanced EOS, respectively.

TI  - Retrieval of Aerosol Optical Depth in the Arid or Semiarid Region of Northern Xinjiang, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing has been widely used to retrieve aerosol optical depth (AOD), which is an indicator of air quality as well as radiative forcing. The dark target (DT) algorithm is applied to low reflectance areas, such as dense vegetation, and the deep blue (DB) algorithm is adopted for bright-reflecting regions. However, both DT and DB algorithms ignore the effect of surface bidirectional reflectance. This paper provides a method for AOD retrieval in arid or semiarid areas, in which the key points are the accurate estimation of surface reflectance and reasonable assumptions of the aerosol model. To reduce the uncertainty in surface reflectance, a minimum land surface reflectance database at the spatial resolution of 500 m for each month was constructed based on the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectance product. Furthermore, a bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) correction model was adopted to compensate for the effect of surface reflectance anisotropy. The aerosol parameters, including AOD, single scattering albedo, asymmetric factor, angstrom ngstrom exponent and complex refractive index, are determined based on the observation of two sunphotometers installed in northern Xinjiang from July to August 2014. The AOD retrieved from the MODIS images was validated with ground-based measurements and the Terra-MODIS aerosol product (MOD04). The 500 m AOD retrieved from the MODIS showed high consistency with ground-based AOD measurements, with an average correlation coefficient of similar to 0.928, root mean square error (RMSE) of similar to 0.042, mean absolute error (MAE) of similar to 0.032, and the percentage falling within the expected error (EE) of the collocations is higher than that for the MOD04 DB product. The results demonstrate that the new AOD algorithm is more suitable to represent aerosol conditions over Xinjiang than the DB standard product.

TI  - Forecasting the spatial and seasonal dynamic of <i>Aedes albopictus</i> oviposition activity in Albania and Balkan countries
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing spread of the Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, in Europe and US raises public health concern due to the species competence to transmit several exotic human arboviruses, among which dengue, chikungunya and Zika, and urges the development of suitable modeling approach to forecast the spatial and temporal distribution of the mosquito. Here we developed a dynamical species distribution modeling approach forecasting Ae. albopictus eggs abundance at high spatial (0.01 degree WGS84) and temporal (weekly) resolution over 10 Balkan countries, using temperature times series of Modis data products and altitude as input predictors. The model was satisfactorily calibrated and validated over Albania based observed eggs abundance data weekly monitored during three years. For a given week of the year, eggs abundance was mainly predicted by the number of eggs and the mean temperature recorded in the preceding weeks. That is, results are in agreement with the biological cycle of the mosquito, reflecting the effect temperature on eggs spawning, maturation and hatching. The model, seeded by initial egg values derived from a second model, was then used to forecast the spatial and temporal distribution of eggs abundance over the selected Balkan countries, weekly in 2011, 2012 and 2013. The present study is a baseline to develop an easy-handling forecasting model able to provide information useful for promoting active surveillance and possibly prevention of Ae. albopictus colonization in presently non-infested areas in the Balkans as well as in other temperate regions.

TI  - Combining Multi-Date Airborne Laser Scanning and Digital Aerial Photogrammetric Data for Forest Growth and Yield Modelling
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing availability of highly detailed three-dimensional remotely-sensed data depicting forests, including airborne laser scanning (ALS) and digital aerial photogrammetric (DAP) approaches, provides a means for improving stand dynamics information. The availability of data from ALS and DAP has stimulated attempts to link these datasets with conventional forestry growth and yield models. In this study, we demonstrated an approach whereby two three-dimensional point cloud datasets (one from ALS and one from DAP), acquired over the same forest stands, at two points in time (circa 2008 and 2015), were used to derive forest inventory information. The area-based approach (ABA) was used to predict top height (H), basal area (BA), total volume (V), and stem density (N) for Time 1 and Time 2 (T1, T2). We assigned individual yield curves to 20 x 20 m grid cells for two scenarios. The first scenario used T1 estimates only (approach 1, single date), while the second scenario combined T1 and T2 estimates (approach 2, multi-date). Yield curves were matched by comparing the predicted cell-level attributes with a yield curve template database generated using an existing growth simulator. Results indicated that the yield curves using the multi-date data of approach 2 were matched with slightly higher accuracy; however, projections derived using approach 1 and 2 were not significantly different. The accuracy of curve matching was dependent on the ABA prediction error. The relative root mean squared error of curve matching in approach 2 for H, BA, V, and N, was 18.4, 11.5, 25.6, and 27.53% for observed (plot) data, and 13.2, 44.6, 50.4 and 112.3% for predicted data, respectively. The approach presented in this study provides additional detail on sub-stand level growth projections that enhances the information available to inform long-term, sustainable forest planning and management.

TI  - An approach for flood monitoring by the combined use of Landsat 8 optical imagery and COSMO-SkyMed radar imagery
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing techniques offer potential for effective flood detection with the advantages of low-cost, large-scale, and real-time surface observations. The easily accessible data sources of optical remote sensing imagery provide abundant spectral information for accurate surface water body extraction, and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems represent a powerful tool for flood monitoring because of their all-weather capability. This paper introduces a new approach for flood monitoring by the combined use of both Landsat 8 optical imagery and COSMO-SkyMed radar imagery. Specifically, the proposed method applies support vector machine and the active contour without edges model for water extent determination in the periods before and during the flood, respectively. A map difference method is used for the flood inundation analysis. The proposed approach is particularly suitable for large-scale flood monitoring, and it was tested on a serious flood that occurred in northeastern China in August 2013, which caused immense loss of human lives and properties. High overall accuracies of 97.46% for the optical imagery and 93.70% for the radar imagery are achieved by the use of the techniques presented in this study. The results show that about 12% of the whole study area was inundated, corresponding to 5466 km(2) of land surface. (C) 2017 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc. (ISPRS).

TI  - Habitat suitability mapping for sand cat (<i>Felis margarita</i>) in Central Iran using remote sensing techniques
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the primary reason of species extinction especially rare species with very specific requirements, is habitat destruction. To protect these species, habitat suitability evaluation plays a central role. Hence, an attempt is made in this study to evaluate the suitability of sand cat's habitat in a sand dune-dominated landscape in Iran. Four Landsat-derived indices including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Weighted Difference Vegetation Index, Brightness Index (BI) and Salinity Index were combined to characterize sand cat's habitat requirements through a land use land cover (LULC) map. Furthermore, a set of landscape metrics were employed to explore the spatial pattern LULC classes. Sand cat's habitat suitability map was generated by linear combination of the standardized and relatively weighted NDVI and BI indices and then categorized into five classes of most suitable, highly suitable, moderately suitable, least suitable and not suitable. The results showed that about 75% of the total area is suitable for sand cat. Although this region is rich in biodiversity, it has not yet been subject to any conservation planning and should be granted more conservation attentions.

TI  - An Energy-Based Model Encoding Nonlocal Pairwise Pixel Interactions for Multisensor Change Detection
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Image change detection (CD) is a challenging problem, particularly when images come from different sensors. In this paper, we present a novel and reliable CD model, which is first based on the estimation of a robust similarity-feature map generated from a pair of bitemporal heterogeneous remote sensing images. This similarity-feature map, which is supposed to represent the difference between the multitemporal multisensor images, is herein defined, by specifying a set of linear equality constraints, expressed for each pair of pixels existing in the before-and-after satellite images acquired through different modalities. An estimation of this overconstrained problem, also formulated as a nonlocal pairwise energy-based model, is then carried out, in the least square sense, by a fast linear-complexity algorithm based on a multidimensional scaling mapping technique. Finally, the fusion of different binary segmentation results, obtained from this similarity-feature map by different automatic thresholding algorithms, allows us to precisely and automatically classify the changed and unchanged regions. The proposed method is tested on satellite data sets acquired by real heterogeneous sensor, and the results obtained demonstrate the robustness of the proposed model compared with the best existing state-of-the-art multimodal CD methods recently proposed in the literature.

TI  - Assimilation of MODIS Snow Cover Fraction Observations into the NASA Catchment Land Surface Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The NASA Catchment land surface model (CLSM) is the land model component used for the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA). Here, the CLSM versions of MERRA and MERRA-Land are evaluated using snow cover fraction (SCF) observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Moreover, a computationally-efficient empirical scheme is designed to improve CLSM estimates of SCF, snow depth, and snow water equivalent (SWE) through the assimilation of MODIS SCF observations. Results show that data assimilation (DA) improved SCF estimates compared to the open-loop model without assimilation (OL), especially in areas with ephemeral snow cover and mountainous regions. A comparison of the SCF estimates from DA against snow cover estimates from the NOAA Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System showed an improvement in the probability of detection of up to 28% and a reduction in false alarms by up to 6% (relative to OL). A comparison of the model snow depth estimates against Canadian Meteorological Centre analyses showed that DA successfully improved the model seasonal bias from -0.017 m for OL to -0.007 m for DA, although there was no significant change in root-mean-square differences (RMSD) (0.095 m for OL, 0.093 m for DA). The time-average of the spatial correlation coefficient also improved from 0.61 for OL to 0.63 for DA. A comparison against in situ SWE measurements also showed improvements from assimilation. The correlation increased from 0.44 for OL to 0.49 for DA, the bias improved from -0.111 m for OL to -0.100 m for DA, and the RMSD decreased from 0.186 m for OL to 0.180 m for DA.

TI  - Survey of Hyperspectral Earth Observation Applications from Space in the Sentinel-2 Context
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - In the last few decades, researchers have developed a plethora of hyperspectral Earth Observation (EO) remote sensing techniques, analysis and applications. While hyperspectral exploratory sensors are demonstrating their potential, Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite remote sensing is now providing free, open, global and systematic high resolution visible and infrared imagery at a short revisit time. Its recent launch suggests potential synergies between multi- and hyper-spectral data. This study, therefore, reviews 20 years of research and applications in satellite hyperspectral remote sensing through the analysis of Earth observation hyperspectral sensors' publications that cover the Sentinel-2 spectrum range: Hyperion, TianGong-1, PRISMA, HISUI, EnMAP, Shalom, HyspIRI and HypXIM. More specifically, this study (i) brings face to face past and future hyperspectral sensors' applications with Sentinel-2's and (ii) analyzes the applications' requirements in terms of spatial and temporal resolutions. Eight main application topics were analyzed including vegetation, agriculture, soil, geology, urban, land use, water resources and disaster. Medium spatial resolution, long revisit time and low signal-to-noise ratio in the short-wave infrared of some hyperspectral sensors were highlighted as major limitations for some applications compared to the Sentinel-2 system. However, these constraints mainly concerned past hyperspectral sensors, while they will probably be overcome by forthcoming instruments. Therefore, this study is putting forward the compatibility of hyperspectral sensors and Sentinel-2 systems for resolution enhancement techniques in order to increase the panel of hyperspectral uses.

TI  - Variations of Climate, Surface Energy Budget, and Minimum Snow/Ice Extent over Canadian Arctic Landmass for 2000-16
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow and ice over land are important hydrological resources and sensitive indicators of climate change. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) dataset at 250-m spatial resolution generated at the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing (CCRS) is used to derive the annual minimum snow and ice (MSI) extent over the Canadian Arctic landmass over a 17-yr time span (2000-16). The smallest MSI extent (1.53 x 10(5) km(2)) was observed in 2012, the largest (2.09 x 10(5) km(2)) was observed in 2013; the average value was 1.70 x 10(5) km(2). Several reanalyses and observational datasets are assessed to explain the derived MSI variations: the ERA-Interim reanalysis, North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR), Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) radiative fluxes, and European Space Agency's GlobSnow dataset. Comparison with the Randolph Glacier Inventory (RGI) showed two important facts: 1) the semipermanent snowpack in the Canadian Arctic that persists through the entire melting season is a significant component relative to the ice caps and glacier-covered areas (up to 36% or 5.58x10(4) km(2)), and 2) the MSI variations are related to variations in the local climate dynamics such as warm season average temperature, energy fluxes, and snow cover. The correlation coefficients (absolute values) can be as high as 0.77. The reanalysis-based MSI estimates agree with satellite MSI results (average bias of 2.2 x 10(3) km(2) or 1.3% of the mean value).

TI  - Improving Accuracy Estimation of Forest Aboveground Biomass Based on Incorporation of ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 and Sentinel-2A Imagery and Machine Learning: A Case Study of the Hyrcanian Forest Area (Iran)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The main objective of this research is to investigate the potential combination of Sentinel-2A and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 (Advanced Land Observing Satellite -2 Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2) imagery for improving the accuracy of the Aboveground Biomass (AGB) measurement. According to the current literature, this kind of investigation has rarely been conducted. The Hyrcanian forest area (Iran) is selected as the case study. For this purpose, a total of 149 sample plots for the study area were documented through fieldwork. Using the imagery, three datasets were generated including the Sentinel-2A dataset, the ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 dataset, and the combination of the Sentinel-2A dataset and the ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 dataset (Sentinel-ALOS). Because the accuracy of the AGB estimation is dependent on the method used, in this research, four machine learning techniques were selected and compared, namely Random Forests (RF), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Networks (MPL Neural Nets), and Gaussian Processes (GP). The performance of these AGB models was assessed using the coefficient of determination (R-2), the root-mean-square error (RMSE), and the mean absolute error (MAE). The results showed that the AGB models derived from the combination of the Sentinel-2A and the ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data had the highest accuracy, followed by models using the Sentinel-2A dataset and the ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 dataset. Among the four machine learning models, the SVR model (R-2 = 0.73, RMSE = 38.68, and MAE = 32.28) had the highest prediction accuracy, followed by the GP model (R-2 = 0.69, RMSE = 40.11, and MAE = 33.69), the RF model (R-2 = 0.62, RMSE = 43.13, and MAE = 35.83), and the MPL Neural Nets model (R-2 = 0.44, RMSE = 64.33, and MAE = 53.74). Overall, the Sentinel-2A imagery provides a reasonable result while the ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 imagery provides a poor result of the forest AGB estimation. The combination of the Sentinel-2A imagery and the ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 imagery improved the estimation accuracy of AGB compared to that of the Sentinel-2A imagery only.

TI  - The Pastor and Fiction: The Integrity of the Pastoral Narrative and the Implications for Pastoral Supervision and Education
T2  - PASTORAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article examines the experience of pastors when their functioning appears incongruent with their imagined or desired narrative for themselves, leading the pastors to feel, or consider themselves, inauthentic. The author addresses holistically the threat of "fictional" experience to pastoral well-being and functioning. In response to a pastoral case, the author examines three types of fictional experience related to worldview, identity, and sense of belonging and argues that narrative restructuring can be conducive to authenticity and integrity. Finally, he proposes the broad outlines of a strategy for pastoral supervision and education.

TI  - Wavelength feature mapping as a proxy to mineral chemistry for investigating geologic systems: An example from the Rodalquilar epithermal system
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The final product of a geologic remote sensing data analysis using multi spectral and hyperspectral images is a mineral (abundance) map. Multispectral data, such as ASTER, Landsat, SPOT, Sentinel-2, typically allow to determine qualitative estimates of what minerals are in a pixel, while hyperspectral data allow to quantify this. As input to most image classification or spectral processing approach, endmembers are required. An alternative approach to classification is to derive absorption feature characteristics such as the wavelength position of the deepest absorption, depth of the absorption and symmetry of the absorption feature from hyperspectral data. Two approaches are presented, tested and compared in this paper: the 'Wavelength Mapper' and the 'QuanTools'. Although these algorithms use a different mathematical solution to derive absorption feature wavelength and depth, and use different image post-processing, the results are consistent, comparable and reproducible. The wavelength images can be directly linked to mineral type and abundance, but more importantly also to mineral chemical composition and subtle changes thereof. This in turn allows to interpret hyperspectral data in terms of mineral chemistry changes which is a proxy to pressure-temperature of formation of minerals. We show the case of the Rodalquilar epithermal system of the southern Spanish Gabo de Gata volcanic area using HyMAP airborne hyperspectral images.

AB  - The floodplain geomorphology of large lowland rivers is intricately related to aquatic ecosystems dependent upon flood pulse dynamics. The alligator gar (Atractosteus spatula) is native to the Lower Mississippi River and dependent upon floodplain backwater areas for spawning. In this study we utilize a geospatial approach to develop a habitat suitability index for alligator gar that explicitly considers hydrologic connectivity and the floodplain geomorphology along a frequently inundated segment of the Lower Mississippi River. The data sets include Landsat imagery, a high-resolution LiDAR digital elevation model (DEM), National Hydrography Dataset (NHD), and hydrologic and geomorphic data. A habitat suitability index is created based on the extent and frequency of inundation, water depth, temperature, and vegetation. A comparison between the remote sensing approach and the NHD revealed substantial differences in the area and location of water bodies available for alligator gar spawning. The final habitat suitability index indicates that a modest proportion (19%) of the overall embanked floodplain is available for alligator gar spawning. Opportunities exist for management efforts to utilize engineered and natural geomorphic features to facilitate hydrologic connectivity at flow levels below flood stage that would expand the habitat of alligator gar across the floodplain. The study results have direct implications regarding environmental restoration of the Lower Mississippi, an iconic example of an embanked meandering river floodplain. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Hue-Angle Product for Low to Medium Spatial Resolution Optical Satellite Sensors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the European Citclops project, with a prime aim of developing new tools to involve citizens in the water quality monitoring of natural waters, colour was identified as a simple property that can be measured via a smartphone app and by dedicated low-cost instruments. In a recent paper, we demonstrated that colour, as expressed mainly by the hue angle (), can also be derived accurately and consistently from the ocean colour satellite instruments that have observed the Earth since 1997. These instruments provide superior temporal coverage of natural waters, albeit at a reduced spatial resolution of 300 m at best. In this paper, the list of algorithms is extended to the very first ocean colour instrument, and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 500-m resolution product. In addition, we explore the potential of the hue angle derivation from multispectral imaging instruments with a higher spatial resolution but reduced spectral resolution: the European Space Agency (ESA) multispectral imager (MSI) on Sentinel-2 A,B, the Operational Land Imager (OLI) on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Landsat-8, and its precursor, the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) on Landsat-7. These medium-resolution imagers might play a role in an upscaling from point measurements to the typical 1-km pixel size from ocean colour instruments. As the parameter (the colour hue angle) is fairly new to the community of water remote sensing scientists, we present examples of how colour can help in the image analysis in terms of water-quality products.

TI  - The influence of data characteristics on detecting wetland/stream surface-water connections in the Delmarva Peninsula, Maryland and Delaware
T2  - WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The dependence of downstream waters on upstream ecosystems necessitates an improved understanding of watershed-scale hydrological interactions including connections between wetlands and streams. An evaluation of such connections is challenging when, (1) accurate and complete datasets of wetland and stream locations are often not available and (2) natural variability in surface-water extent influences the frequency and duration of wetland/stream connectivity. The Upper Choptank River watershed on the Delmarva Peninsula in eastern Maryland and Delaware is dominated by a high density of small, forested wetlands. In this analysis, wetland/stream surface water connections were quantified using multiple wetland and stream datasets, including headwater streams and depressions mapped from a lidar-derived digital elevation model. Surface-water extent was mapped across the watershed for spring 2015 using Landsat-8, Radarsat-2 and Worldview-3 imagery. The frequency of wetland/stream connections increased as a more complete and accurate stream dataset was used and surface-water extent was included, in particular when the spatial resolution of the imagery was finer (i.e., < 10 m). Depending on the datasets used, 12-60% of wetlands by count (21-93% of wetlands by area) experienced surface-water interactions with streams during spring 2015. This translated into a range of 50-94% of the watershed contributing direct surface water runoff to streamflow. This finding suggests that our interpretation of the frequency and duration of wetland/stream connections will be influenced not only by the spatial and temporal characteristics of wetlands, streams and potential flowpaths, but also by the completeness, accuracy and resolution of input datasets.

TI  - Historical analysis of interannual rainfall variability and trends in southeastern Brazil based on observational and remotely sensed data
T2  - CLIMATE DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazilian Southeast is considered a humid region. It is also prone to landslides and floods, a result of significant increases in rainfall during spring and summer caused by the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ). Recently, however, the region has faced a striking rainfall shortage, raising serious concerns regarding water availability. The present work endeavored to explain the meteorological drought that has led to hydrological imbalance and water scarcity in the region. Hodrick-Prescott smoothing and wavelet transform techniques were applied to long-term hydrologic and sea surface temperature (SST)-based climate indices monthly time series data in an attempt to detect cycles and trends that could help explain rainfall patterns and define a framework for improving the predictability of extreme events in the region. Historical observational hydrologic datasets available include monthly precipitation amounts gauged since 1888 and 1940 and stream flow measured since the 1930s. The spatial representativeness of rain gauges was tested against gridded rainfall satellite estimates from 2000 to 2015. The analyses revealed variability in four time scale domains-infra-annual, interannual, quasi-decadal and inter-decadal or multi-decadal. The strongest oscillations periods revealed were: for precipitation-8 months, 2, 8 and 32 years; for Pacific SST in the Nio-3.4 region-6 months, 2, 8 and 35.6 years, for North Atlantic SST variability-6 months, 2, 8 and 32 years and for Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) index-6.19 months, 2.04, 8.35 and 27.31 years. Other periodicities less prominent but still statistically significant were also highlighted.

TI  - Regional climate forcing and topographic influence on glacier shrinkage: eastern cordilleras of Peru
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assessed the influence of regional climate variability and topography on surface area changes at glacierized mountain peaks of four eastern tropical Andes cordilleras between 10.5 degrees and 13.5 degrees S, namely, Huaguruncho, Huaytapallana, Urubamba and Vilcabamba, during the period 1985-2015 using satellite data. Time series analysis of three key climate variables (temperature, precipitation and relative humidity) at 500 hPa level was also included. Decreasing trends in precipitation and increasing relative humidity trends were observed at the northern region. Further analysis on mean distribution of wind at 500 hPa level showed significant rising trend southwards during the austral winter. Glacierized surfaces at lower altitudes were shrinking faster than those at high altitudes as expected. However, spatial orientation of glacier retreat was not similar to nearby cordilleras such as Vilcanota and Carabaya excepting for Cordillera Urubamba. Despite the high rate of precipitation due to the humidity transport from the Amazon Basin on the eastern slopes, glaciers on the eastern and north-eastern slopes in the Cordillera Urubamba retreated at a higher rate compared with those glaciers on western and south-western sides. Whether higher retreat on the eastern sides towards the south is controlled by precipitation phase changes (rain or snow) or by increased humidity levels was discussed. Furthermore, there was a predominant snowline altitude (SLA) rising trend varying between 56 and 129 m for the studied glaciers. A sharp rise in SLAs for periods 1995-2000 and 2010-2015 was attested, coinciding with warming trends in the Pacific. The relative stability in observed SLAs between 2000 and 2010 also coincided with cooling trends in the Pacific.

T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pansharpening usually refers to the fusion of a high spatial resolution panchromatic (PAN) image with a higher spectral resolution but coarser spatial resolution multispectral (MS) image. Owing to the wide applicability of related products, the literature has been populated by many papers proposing several approaches and studies about this issue. Many solutions require a preliminary spectral matching phase wherein the PAN image is matched with the MS bands. In this paper, we propose and properly justify a new approach for performing this step, demonstrating that it yields state-of-the-art performance. The comparison with existing spectral matching procedures is performed by employing four data sets, concerning different kinds of landscapes, acquired by the Pleiades, WorldView-2, and GeoEye-1 sensors.

TI  - Artificial Mangrove Species Mapping Using Pleiades-1: An Evaluation of Pixel-Based and Object-Based Classifications with Selected Machine Learning Algorithms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the dwindling natural mangrove today, mangrove reforestation projects are conducted worldwide to prevent further losses. Due to monoculture and the low survival rate of artificial mangroves, it is necessary to pay attention to mapping and monitoring them dynamically. Remote sensing techniques have been widely used to map mangrove forests due to their capacity for large-scale, accurate, efficient, and repetitive monitoring. This study evaluated the capability of a 0.5-m Pleiades-1 in classifying artificial mangrove species using both pixel-based and object-based classification schemes. For comparison, three machine learning algorithmsdecision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF)were used as the classifiers in the pixel-based and object-based classification procedure. The results showed that both the pixel-based and object-based approaches could recognize the major discriminations between the four major artificial mangrove species. However, the object-based method had a better overall accuracy than the pixel-based method on average. For pixel-based image analysis, SVM produced the highest overall accuracy (79.63%); for object-based image analysis, RF could achieve the highest overall accuracy (82.40%), and it was also the best machine learning algorithm for classifying artificial mangroves. The patches produced by object-based image analysis approaches presented a more generalized appearance and could contiguously depict mangrove species communities. When the same machine learning algorithms were compared by McNemar's test, a statistically significant difference in overall classification accuracy between the pixel-based and object-based classifications only existed in the RF algorithm. Regarding species, monoculture and dominant mangrove species Sonneratia apetala group 1 (SA1) as well as partly mixed and regular shape mangrove species Hibiscus tiliaceus (HT) could well be identified. However, for complex and easily-confused mangrove species Sonneratia apetala group 2 (SA2) and other occasionally presented mangroves species (OT), only major distributions could be extracted, with an accuracy of about two-thirds. This study demonstrated that more than 80% of artificial mangroves species distribution could be mapped.

TI  - Characterizing the encroachment of juniper forests into sub-humid and semi-arid prairies from 1984 to 2010 using PALSAR and Landsat data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past few decades, wide encroachment of eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana) and Ashe juniper (Juniperus ashei) into the prairies of the U.S. Great Plains has affected wildlife habitats, forage and livestock production, and biogeochemical cycles. This study investigates the spatio-temporal dynamics of juniper forest encroachment into tallgrass prairies by generating juniper forest encroachment maps from 1984 to 2010 at 30 m spatial resolution. A pixel and phenology-based mapping algorithm was used to produce the time series maps of juniper forest encroachment using a combination of Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) mosaic data from 2010 and Landsat 5 and 7 data (10,871 images from 1984 to 2010). We analyzed the resultant maps to understand the dynamics of juniper forest encroachment at state and county spatial scales and examined juniper occurrence by geographic region and soil type. The juniper forest maps were generated over five multi-year periods: the late 1980s (1984-1989), early 1990s (1990-1994), late 1990s (1995-1999), early 2000s (2000-2004), and late 2000s (2005-2010). We also produced a map of time since stand detection of juniper forests in 2010. Our major findings include: (1) juniper forests have expanded linearly in time at an annual rate of similar to 40 km(2)/year since 1984; (2) juniper forests had notable spatial clusters in its expansion process; (3) similar to 65% of juniper forests in 2010 were < 15 years after stands have been detected; and (4) juniper forests in 2010 were mainly distributed in sandy and loamy soils with relatively low available water storage in the top soils. This study demonstrates the potential of combining a cloud computing platform (Google Earth Engine), time series optical images (Landsat), and microwave images to document the spatial-temporal dynamics of juniper forest encroachment into prairies since the 1980s at the regional scale. The results can be used to study the causes, consequences, and potential future distribution of juniper encroachment, which are relevant to the sustainable management of prairie ecosystems.

TI  - Estimation of Forest Canopy Height and Aboveground Biomass from Spaceborne LiDAR and Landsat Imageries in Maryland
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping the regional distribution of forest canopy height and aboveground biomass is worthwhile and necessary for estimating the carbon stocks on Earth and assessing the terrestrial carbon flux. In this study, we produced maps of forest canopy height and the aboveground biomass at a 30 m spatial resolution in Maryland by combining Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) data and Landsat spectral imageries. The processes for calculating the forest biomass included the following: (i) processing the GLAS waveform and calculating spatially discrete forest canopy heights; (ii) developing canopy height models from Landsat imagery and extrapolating them to spatially contiguous canopy heights in Maryland; and, (iii) estimating forest aboveground biomass according to the relationship between canopy height and biomass. In our study, we explore the ability to use the GLAS waveform to calculate canopy height without ground-measured forest metrics (R-2 = 0.669, RMSE = 4.82 m, MRE = 15.4%). The machine learning models performed better than the principal component model when mapping the regional forest canopy height and aboveground biomass. The total forest aboveground biomass in Maryland reached approximately 160 Tg. When compared with the existing Biomass_CMS map, our biomass estimates presented a similar distribution where higher values were in the Western Shore Uplands region and Folded Application Mountain section, while lower values were located in the Delmarva Peninsula and Allegheny Mountain regions.

TI  - Complex surface deformation of Akutan volcano, Alaska revealed from InSAR time series
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Akutan volcano is one of the most active volcanoes in the Aleutian arc. An intense swarm of volcano-tectonic earthquakes occurred across the island in 1996. Surface deformation after the 1996 earthquake sequence has been studied using Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), yet it is hard to determine the detailed temporal behavior and spatial extent of the deformation due to decorrelation and the sparse temporal sampling of SAR data. Atmospheric delay anomalies over Akutan volcano are also strong, bringing additional technical challenges. Here we present a time series InSAR analysis from 2003 to 2016 to reveal the surface deformation in more detail. Four tracks of Envisat data acquired from 2003 to 2010 and one track of TerraSAR-X data acquired from 2010 to 2016 are processed to produce high-resolution surface deformation, with a focus on studying two transient episodes of inflation in 2008 and 2014. For the TerraSAR-X data, the atmospheric delay is estimated and removed using the common-master stacking method. These derived deformation maps show a consistently uplifting area on the northeastern flank of the volcano. From the TerraSAR-X data, we quantify the velocity of the subsidence inside the caldera to be as high as 10 mm/year, and identify another subsidence area near the ground cracks created during the 1996 swarm.

TI  - Cloudy-sky land surface longwave downward radiation (LWDR) estimation by integrating MODIS and AIRS/AMSU measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Longwave downward radiation (LWDR) is another major energy source received by the earth's surface apart from solar radiation. Its importance in regulating air temperature and balancing surface energy is enlarged especially under cloudy-sky conditions. Unfortunately, to date, a large number of efforts have been made to derive LWDR from space under only clear-sky conditions leading to difficulty in utilizing space-based LWDR in most models due to its spatio-temporal discontinuity. Currently, only a few studies are focused on LWDR estimation under cloudy skies, while their global application is still questionable. In this paper, an alternative strategy is proposed aiming to derive high-resolution (1 km) cloudy-sky LWDR by fusing collocated satellite multi-sensor measurements. The results show that the newly developed method works well and can derive LWDR at a better accuracy with RMSE < 27 W/m(2) and bias < 10 W/m(2) even under cloudy skies and at 1 km scales. By comparing the CCCM and SSF products of CERES, MERRA, ERA-interim and NCEP-CSFR over the Tibetan Plateau region, the new approach demonstrates its superiority in terms of accuracy, temporal variation and spatial distribution patterns of LWDR. Comprehensive comparison analysis also reveals that, except for the proposed product, the other four products (CERES, MERRA, ERA-interim and NCEP-CSFR) show a big difference from each other in the LWDR spatio-temporal distribution pattern and magnitude. The difference between these products can still be up to 60 W/m(2) even at the monthly scale, implying that large uncertainties exist in current LWDR estimations. More importantly, besides the higher accuracy of the proposed method, it provides unprecedented possibilities for jointly generating high-resolution global LWDR datasets by connecting the NASA's Earth Observing System-(EOS) mission (MODIS-AIRS/AMSU) and the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership-(NPP) mission (VIIRS-CrIS/ATMS). Meanwhile, the scheme proposed in this study also gives some clues towards multiple data fusing in the remote sensing community.

TI  - Toward operational shortwave radiation modeling and retrieval over rugged terrain
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Shortwave radiation (0.3-3.0 mu m) is a dominant component of land surface all-wave radiation budget. Reliable estimation of shortwave radiation throughout the globe is particularly important for an in-depth understanding of global changes. Unfortunately, a large number of existing space-based algorithms ignore the effects of topography by simply assuming that the surface is ideally flat. As pointed out by many studies, such neglect toward topographic effects leads to significant errors in derived radiation. This study proposes a shortwave topographic radiation model (SWTRM) by quantifying solar direct radiation shielding, occlusion of sky radiation, reflected radiation from nearby terrain, and invisibility of certain targets. To drive the SWTRM, an artificial neural network (ANN) approach was employed to generate multiple components of the shortwave radiation budget. The new model was run over the Tibetan Plateau region and used MODIS products coupled with digital elevation data (DEM). Topographically corrected shortwave fluxes were derived by coupling SWTRM and ANN outputs. The results show that: (1) the proposed SWTRM works well over mountainous regions; (2) the ANN-based shortwave model provides reasonable retrieval accuracy (RMSE < 60 W/m(2), bias < 13 W/m(2) for all shortwave radiation components). More importantly, the ANN model can simultaneously provide all radiation components that are indispensable for driving the SWTRM; (3) over mountainous areas, the induced error can exceed 600 W/m(2) for shortwave net flux. Hence, topographic effects cannot be neglected; and (4) topography and solar illumination angle are key modulators in deriving shortwave radiation from space, which control the magnitude and spatial distribution of shortwave radiation over mountainous regions.

TI  - Stable Water Isotopologues in the Stratosphere Retrieved from Odin/SMR Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Stable Water Isotopologues (SWIs) are important diagnostic tracers for understanding processes in the atmosphere and the global hydrological cycle. Using eight years (2002-2009) of retrievals from Odin/SMR (Sub-Millimetre Radiometer), the global climatological features of three SWIs, (H2O)-O-16, HDO and (H2O)-O-18, the isotopic composition D and O-18 in the stratosphere are analysed for the first time. Spatially, SWIs are found to increase with altitude due to stratospheric methane oxidation. In the tropics, highly depleted SWIs in the lower stratosphere indicate the effect of dehydration when the air comes through the cold tropopause, while, at higher latitudes, more enriched SWIs in the upper stratosphere during summer are produced and transported to the other hemisphere via the Brewer-Dobson circulation. Furthermore, we found that more (H2O)-O-16 is produced over summer Northern Hemisphere and more HDO is produced over summer Southern Hemisphere. Temporally, a tape recorder in (H2O)-O-16 is observed in the lower tropical stratosphere, in addition to a pronounced downward propagating seasonal signal in SWIs from the upper to the lower stratosphere over the polar regions. These observed features in SWIs are further compared to SWI-enabled model outputs. This helped to identify possible causes of model deficiencies in reproducing main stratospheric features. For instance, choosing a better advection scheme and including methane oxidation process in a specific model immediately capture the main features of stratospheric water vapor. The representation of other features, such as the observed inter-hemispheric difference of isotopic component, is also discussed.

TI  - Evaluation of satellite-derived building height extraction by CFD simulations: A case study of neighborhood-scale ventilation in Hong Kong
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques, such as large-eddy simulation (LES), are widely used in urban ventilation studies. Unfortunately, realistic building data required in CFD studies are not always available. In this study, LES of urban ventilation is used to assess building height extraction from different satellite images. As a case study, three sets of digital elevation data extracted from satellite images in an urban area of Mong Kok, Hong Kong, are assessed. Simulations of velocity ratio from the LES model are first validated by wind tunnel measurements, yielding a recommended local roughness length of 0.02 m. Wind characteristics in urban elevations extracted from two single satellite images and the fused result are then compared with those from realistic data in the same area, using identical LES settings. It is found that building height data retrieved from the WorldView-2 optical (stereo) images are of poor quality, as they underestimate higher buildings, which are deemed to be more important for pedestrian-level velocity ratios. The TerraSAR-X synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image and the fused results of SAR and stereo images are sufficient for CFD simulations of urban ventilation. This fusion provides a slight improvement over SAR images alone in reproducing urban geometric parameters, and it is superior in simulating more accurate wind profiles in the urban canopy.

TI  - Low-frequency snow changes over the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow change over the Tibetan Plateau may exert a large influence on climate variability in the surrounding regions. However, the characteristics of snow changes at different time scales and the factors for these changes are still not clear. The present study documents linear trends in snow cover and snow water equivalent over the Tibetan Plateau and their relationship to surface air temperature changes during 1979-2006 based on satellite data. The long-term snow variations display a remarkable regional difference and an obvious seasonal dependence. A significant decreasing trend is observed in the western part for snow cover and snow water equivalent in summer and fall and in the southern part for snow cover in all the four seasons. A significant increasing trend is identified in the central-eastern part for snow cover in fall, winter, and spring and in the eastern and far western parts for snow water equivalent in winter and spring. The relationship between snow and surface air temperature changes features regional disparity. The temperature increase is accompanied by snow cover decrease in the southern and western parts, but by snow cover and snow water equivalent increase in the central-eastern part. The reasons for the snow changes vary with the season. The increase in snowmelt following the temperature increase may be the reason for the snow cover decrease in the western and southern parts in summer. The snowfall change induced by vertical motion change appears to be a factor for the snow water equivalent increase in the far western part and the snow cover decrease in the southern part in winter. The increase in snowfall induced by the increase in atmospheric moisture following the temperature increase and the enhanced upward motion may contribute to the snow increase in the eastern part in winter.

TI  - Estimation of Chlorophyll-<i>a</i> Concentration from Optimizing a Semi-Analytical Algorithm in Productive Inland Waters
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The high nutrient concentrations coming from non-point and point pollution have been linked to algae blooms, especially in hydroelectric plant reservoirs, due to higher residence time compared to rivers. The monitoring of algae is important to prevent risk of contamination by toxins in reservoirs used for drinking water supply. In this context, a physical model-based approach was adopted to retrieve chlorophyll-a (chl a) concentration, a photosynthetic pigment found in all phytoplankton species. We assumed that a semi-analytical algorithm parameterized to a eutrophic reservoir could also be applied to other eutrophic reservoirs, at least the specific inherent optical properties (SIOPs) are not similar. The parameterization was carried out based on Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) bands aboard Sentinel-3 spacecraft. In our study, the semi-analytical approach showed good performance in retrieving chl a content, with a normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of 18.7%. The findings encourage the use of a unique semi-analytical algorithm in a reservoir cascade, where the impoundments present similar bio-optical status. The good performance of the algorithm indicates that this approach is rather useful in predicting trophic status in reservoirs.

TI  - Verification, improvement and application of aerosol optical depths in China Part I: Inter-comparison of NPP-VIIRS and Aqua-MODIS
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study is to evaluate typical aerosol optical depth (AOD) products in China, which experienced seriously increasing atmospheric particulate pollution. For this, the Aqua MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) AOD products (MYD04) at 10 km spatial resolution and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Environmental Data Record (EDR) AOD product at 6 km resolution for different Quality Flags (QF) are obtained for validation against AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) AOD measurements during 2013-2016. Results show that VIIRS EDR similarly Dark Target (DT) and MODIS DT algorithms perform worse with only 45.36% and 45.59% of the retrievals (QF = 3) falling within the Expected Error (EE +/- (0.05 + 15%)) compared to the Deep Blue (DB) algorithm (69.25%, QF 2). The DT retrievals perform poorly over the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) and Yangtze-River-Delta (TED) regions, which significantly overestimate the AOD observations, but the performance is better over the Pearl-River-Delta (PRD) region than DB retrievals, which seriously under-estimate the AOD loadings. It is not surprising that the DT algorithm performs better over vegetated areas, while the DB algorithm performs better over bright areas mainly depends on the accuracy of surface reflectance estimation over different land use types. In general, the sensitivity of aerosol to apparent reflectance reduces by about 34% with an increasing surface reflectance by 0.01. Moreover, VIIRS EDR and MODIS DT algorithms perform overall better in the winter as 64.53% and 72.22% of the retrievals are within the EE but with less retrievals. However, the DB algorithm performs worst (57.17%) in summer mainly affected by the vegetation growth but there are overall high accuracies with more than 62% of the collections falling within the EE in other three seasons. Results suggest that the quality assurance process can help improve the overall data quality for MYD04 DB retrievals, but it is not always true for VIIRS EDR and MYD04 DT AOD retrievals.

TI  - Multisite High-frequency Radiometric Calibration of GF-1 Wide Field of View
T2  - ACTA PHOTONICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - To increase the calibration frequency of Chinese optical remote sensing satellite sensor, a high- frequency calibration method based on domestic multisite was presented. And the in flight high-frequency absolute radiometric calibration of GF-1 Wide Field of View (WFV) was conducted using this method. The theory of high-frequency calibration based on multisite was intruduced. The optimized selection principle of domestic calibration site was presented according to the parameters and characteristics of GF-1 WFV. And the temporal stability of site surface was analyzed. MODIS land and atmosphere products were used to instead of in-situ measurements to increase the amount of available calibration data. The validation of MODIS land product was conducted using in-site measurements. The high-frequency calibration of GF-1 WFV4 based on Chinese multisite was carried out, and the calibration coefficients were compared with the official calibration coefficients. The result shows that time series calibration coefficients of GF-1 WFV can be obtained using the multisite high-frequency calibration method. The calibration results of GF-1 WFV4 are in good agreement with the results of the official calibration. The relative differences of GF-1 WFV4 all bands calibration coefficients of the two methods are -0.49%,1.33%, -1.01% and 3.86% respectively, which illustrates the availability of this method. The method can be used to improve the calibration frequency of Chinese remote sensing sensor, and timely track the changes of sensor.

TI  - Urban land use intensity assessment: The potential of spatio-temporal spectral traits with remote sensing
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - By adding attributes of space and time to the spectral traits (ST) concept we developed a completely new way of quantifying and assessing land use intensity and the hemeroby of urban landscapes. Calculating spectral traits variations (STV) from remote sensing data and regressing STV against hemeroby, we show how to estimate human land use intensity and the degree of hemeroby for large spatial areas with a dense temporal resolution for an urban case study. We found a linear statistical significant relationship (p = 0.01) between the annual amplitude in spectral trait variations and the degree of hemeroby. It was thereof possible to separate the different types of land use cover according to their degree of hemeroby and land use intensity, respectively. Moreover, since the concept of plant traits is a functional framework in which each trait can be assigned to one or more ecosystem functions, the assessment of STV is a promising step towards assessing the diversity of spectral traits in an ecosystem as a proxy of functional diversity.

TI  - Assessment of LiDAR and Spectral Techniques for High-Resolution Mapping of Sporadic Permafrost on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, Alaska
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Western Alaska's Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta (YKD) spans nearly 67,200 km(2) and is among the largest and most productive coastal wetland ecosystems in the pan-Arctic. Permafrost currently forms extensive elevated plateaus on abandoned floodplain deposits of the outer delta, but is vulnerable to disturbance from rising air temperatures, inland storm surges, and salt-kill of vegetation. As pan-Arctic air and ground temperatures rise, accurate baseline maps of permafrost extent are critical for a variety of applications including long-term monitoring, understanding the scale and pace of permafrost degradation processes, and estimating resultant greenhouse gas dynamics. This study assesses novel, high-resolution techniques to map permafrost distribution using LiDAR and IKONOS imagery, in tandem with field-based parameterization and validation. With LiDAR, use of a simple elevation threshold provided a permafrost map with 94.9% overall accuracy; this approach was possible due to the extremely flat coastal plain of the YKD. The addition of high spatial-resolution IKONOS satellite data yielded similar results, but did not increase model performance. The methods and the results of this study enhance high-resolution permafrost mapping efforts in tundra regions in general and deltaic landscapes in particular, and provide a baseline for remote monitoring of permafrost distribution on the YKD.

TI  - Detecting plague-host abundance from space: Using a spectral vegetation index to identify occupancy of great gerbil burrows
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In Kazakhstan, plague outbreaks occur when its main host, the great gerbil, exceeds an abundance threshold. These live in family groups in burrows, which can be mapped using remote sensing. Occupancy (percentage of burrows occupied) is a good proxy for abundance and hence the possibility of an outbreak. Here we use time series of satellite images to estimate occupancy remotely.In April and September 2013, 872 burrows were identified in the field as either occupied or empty. For satellite images acquired between April and August, 'burrow objects' were identified and matched to the field burrows. The burrow objects were represented by 25 different polygon types, then classified (using a majority vote from 10 Random Forests) as occupied or empty, using Normalized Difference Vegetation Indices (NDVI) calculated for all images. Throughout the season NDVI values were higher for empty than for occupied burrows. Occupancy status of individual burrows that were continuously occupied or empty, was classified with producer's and user's accuracy values of 63 and 64% for the optimum polygon.Occupancy level was predicted very well and differed 2% from the observed occupancy. This establishes firmly the principle that occupancy can be estimated using satellite images with the potential to predict plague outbreaks over extensive areas with much greater ease and accuracy than previously.

TI  - Interleukin 11 is upregulated in preeclampsia and leads to inflammation and preeclampsia features in mice
T2  - JOURNAL OF REPRODUCTIVE IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Preeclampsia is a dangerous pregnancy complication, which is often associated with fetal growth restriction and can have serious life-long effects for both mother and baby. While the establishment of the placenta in the first trimester is the sentinel event in the development of preeclampsia little is known of the critical mechanisms of placentation that lead to the syndrome. Locally produced inflammatory cytokines are thought to play a role in the development of preeclampsia. This review summarizes the evidence that interleukin 11 is dysregulated in preeclampsia and contributes to the initiation of preeclampsia via effects on placentation. It discusses the benefits and drawbacks of targeting IL11 as a novel treatment option for preeclampsia.

SLN biopsy may be considered for thin melanomas that are T1b (0.8 to 1.0 mm Breslow thickness or < 0.8 mm Breslow thickness with ulceration) after a thorough discussion with the patient of the potential benefits and risk of harms associated with the procedure. SLN biopsy is recommended for patients with intermediate-thickness melanomas (T2 or T3; Breslow thickness of > 1.0 to 4.0 mm). SLN biopsy may be recommended for patients with thick melanomas (T4; > 4.0 mm in Breslow thickness), after a discussion of the potential benefits and risks of harm. In the case of a positive SLN biopsy, CLND or careful observation are options for patients with low-risk micrometastatic disease, with due consideration of clinicopathological factors. For higher risk patients, careful observation may be considered only after a thorough discussion with patients about the potential risks and benefits of foregoing CLND. Important qualifying statements outlining relevant clinicopathological factors, and details of the reference patient populations are included within the guideline.

TI  - IL-2 and Beyond in Cancer Immunotherapy
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERFERON AND CYTOKINE RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - The development of the T- and natural killer (NK) cell growth factor IL-2 has been a sentinel force ushering in the era of immunotherapy in cancer. With the advent of clinical grade recombinant IL-2 in the mid-1980s, oncologists could for the first time directly manipulate lymphocyte populations with systemic therapy. By itself, recombinant IL-2 can induce clinical responses in up to 15% of patients with metastatic cancer or renal cell carcinoma. When administered with adoptively transferred tumor-reactive lymphocytes, IL-2 promotes T cell engraftment and response rates of up to 50% in metastatic melanoma patients. Importantly, these IL-2-driven responses can yield complete and durable responses in a subset of patients. However, the use of IL-2 is limited by toxicity and concern of the expansion of T regulatory cells. To overcome these limitations and improve response rates, other T cell growth factors, including IL-15 and modified forms of IL-2, are in clinical development. Administering T cell growth factors in combination with other agents, such as immune checkpoint pathway inhibitors, may also improve efficacy. In this study, we review the development of T- and NK cell growth factors and highlight current combinatorial approaches based on these reagents.

TI  - Impacts of Leaf Age on Canopy Spectral Signature Variation in Evergreen Chinese Fir Forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Significant gaps exist in our knowledge of the impact of leaf aging on canopy signal variability, which limits our understanding of vegetation status based on remotely sensed data. To understand the effects of leaf aging at the leaf and canopy scales, a combination of field, remote-sensing and physical modeling techniques was adopted to assess the canopy spectral signals of evergreen Cunninghamia forests. We observed an approximately 10% increase in Near-Infrared (NIR) reflectance for new leaves and a 35% increase in NIR transmittance for mature leaves from May to October. When variations in leaf optical properties (LOPs) of only mature leaves, or both new and mature leaves were considered, the Geometric Optical and Radiative Transfer (GORT) model-simulated canopy reflectance trajectory was more consistent with Landsat observations (R-2 increased from 0.37 to 0.82 similar to 0.89 for NIR reflectance, and from 0.35 to 0.67 similar to 0.88 for EVI2, with a small RMSE (0.01 to 0.02)). This study highlights the importance of leaf age on leaf spectral signatures, and provides evidence of age-dependent LOPs that have important impacts on canopy reflectance in the NIR band and EVI2, which are used to monitor canopy dynamics and productivity, with important implications for RS and forest ecosystem ecology.

TI  - Remote Sensing Image Fusion Based on Minimum Hausdorff Distance and Non-sampled Shearlet Transform
T2  - ACTA PHOTONICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to preserve both spectral and spatial information simultaneously in fused image, we introduce the minimum Hausdorff distance and Non-Sampled Shearlet Transform (NSST) to construct a new method for remote sensing image fusion. Firstly, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) transform is applied in the original multispectral image to obtain the first principal component, this component and the panchromatic image are decomposed by NSST respectively to obtain the corresponding low frequency subband coefficients and high frequency subband coefficients. Then, the low frequency subband coefficients are fused by sparse representation, the sparse coefficients of sparse representation are fused with the region space frequency; for the high frequency subband coefficients, the regional structure similarity is utilized, using the minimum Hausdorff distance to represent the correlation of regions and different fusion strategies are adopted according to the correlation. Finally, the fused coefficients are transformed by inverse NSST to obtain the new principal component, the new component and other higher order principal components are transformed by inverse PCA transform to obtain the fused image. In this paper, three QuickBird satellite images and one SPOT satellite image are selected for testing, the results show that compared with the traditional fusion strategy algorithms, the fusion results obtained by proposed method have better objective evaluation index and subjective visual effect.

TI  - Responses of Urban Land Surface Temperature on Land Cover: A Comparative Study of Vienna and Madrid
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The relationship between the land cover (LC) characteristics and the land surface temperature (LST) is significant for surface urban heat island (SUHI) study and for sustainability research. To better understand how the land surface temperature (LST) responds to LC, two urban areas, Vienna and Madrid, with different climatic conditions are selected and compared, using Landsat-8 OLI data and urban atlas data. To determine a suitable scale for analyzing the relationship between LC and LST, a correlation analysis at different sizes of spatial analytical scales is applied. To demonstrate the LC composition effects on LST, a regression analysis of the whole study area and in the specific circumstance is undertaken. The results show that: (1) In the summer, Vienna presents high temperature in the urban areas and low temperature in the surrounding rural areas, while Madrid displays the opposite appearance, being relatively cooler in the urban areas as compared to the rural areas, with the main different factors affecting elevated urban LST; (2) Suitable analytical scales are suggested in studying the LC LST relationship between different LC characteristics in the two study areas; (3) Negative effects on the LST appear when the area of cooling sources, such as water or urban greenery, reaches 10% at a 990 x 990 m(2) scale in Vienna. Built-up area is the main factor affecting elevated urban LST where such areas cover the majority at a 990 x 990 m(2) scale in Madrid. These findings provide a valuable view regarding how to balance the urban surface thermal environment through urban planning.

TI  - Effects of land use transitions due to underground coal mining on ecosystem services in high groundwater table areas: A case study in the Yanzhou coalfield
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coal resources play a strategic role in long-term development in China. However, underground mining activities in high groundwater table areas result in dramatic land use transition, putting both the ecosystem and the environment under great pressure. This paper examines the dynamic patterns of land use in high groundwater coal basins (HGCBs) using high-resolution Landsat TM (Thematic Mapper) data from 1985, 1995, 2005, 2010, and 2015, and socio-economic data from research institutes and government departments, and assesses the changes of ecosystem service value (ESV) by drawing a connection between the observed land use dynamics and the evaluation of ESV, based on the latest research of Xie et al. (2015) and some revisions adapted to the situation in the mining areas. The outcomes indicated that from 1985 to 2005, the ESV of the study area had a sustained growth, from 308.66 million RMBY in 1985-481.50 million RMBY in 2005. However, this growth has since stopped and turned into a decrease, with ESV dropping to 334.27 million RAM in 2015. The reasons for the changes in ESV were analyzed: the large transition of construction land and farmland to waterbody caused by mining subsidence and restoration activities play a positive role, while the urbanization process in mining areas leading to the expansion of cities, and drought for the past 5 years leading to the shrinkage of waterbody, bring negative efforts to ESV. Based on the analysis above, some of the major implications were discussed. It is argued that the mining-induced land use transition will continue in the near future in HGCBs. Therefore, in order to fully consider the future landscape and thus optimize land use and extend urban development space it is necessary: to make pre-subsidence plans to maximize the farmland and ensure food security; to restore the secondary waterbody; to protect regional ecosystem service function and maintain its stability; and to make urban planning on the basis of subsidence prediction at every stage. Only in this way can HGCBs realize the sustainable use of ecological resources, as well as the integration of economic, social and ecologic benefits.

TI  - Ensemble of ESA/AATSR Aerosol Optical Depth Products Based on the Likelihood Estimate Method With Uncertainties
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Within the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (CCI) project Aerosol_cci, there are three aerosol optical depth (AOD) data sets of Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) data. These are obtained using the ATSR-2/ATSR dual-view aerosol retrieval algorithm (ADV) by the Finnish Meteorological Institute, the Oxford-Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) Retrieval of Aerosol and Cloud (ORAC) algorithm by the University of Oxford/RAL, and the Swansea algorithm (SU) by the University of Swansea. The three AOD data sets vary widely. Each has unique characteristics: the spatial coverage of ORAC is greater, but the accuracy of ADV and SU is higher, so none is significantly better than the others, and each has shortcomings that limit the scope of its application. To address this, we propose a method for converging these three products to create a single data set with higher spatial coverage and better accuracy. The fusion algorithm consists of three parts: the first part is to remove the systematic errors; the second part is to calculate the uncertainty and fusion of data sets using the maximum likelihood estimate method; and the third part is to mask outliers with a threshold of 0.12. The ensemble AOD results show that the spatial coverage of fused data set after mask is 148%, 13%, and 181% higher than those of ADV, ORAC, and SU, respectively, and the root-mean-square error, mean absolute error, mean bias error, and relative mean bias are superior to those of the three original data sets. Thus, the accuracy and spatial coverage of the fused AOD data set masked with a threshold of 0.12 are improved compared to the original data set. Finally, we discuss the selection of mask thresholds.

TI  - Combining different spatio-temporal resolution images to depict landscape dynamics and guide wildlife management
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Raptors are emblematic species of high conservation value and significant ecological role. Their conservation is of particular importance and it relies on the conservation of their habitats and the constant monitoring of their dynamics. In the current study we investigate land cover changes over the period 2001-2011, in one of the most important reserves for raptor conservation in Europe, the Dadia-Lefldmi-Soufli Forest National Park. Very high and high spatial resolution satellite data were integrated in a single analysis, in order to exploit the high spatial accuracy of the former and the high temporal and spectral resolution of the latter. The results suggest that the applied method increases the overall accuracy of the mapping product from 73% to 89%, providing a tool to land managers and conservationists to study landscape dynamics and guide wildlife management. The analysis of land use changes revealed that wildfires of high intensity and large extent, constitute a new threat for the ecological integrity of the reserve. If the currently observed trend of wildfire behavior in Greece and southern Europe continues it is likely to affect the core zones of forest reserve, which consist primarily by dense forests with high fuel load, with detrimental effects for wildlife. The most important land cover change observed is the significant reduction of open areas, which form the main hunting areas for raptors. Open areas appear to be encroached by forest, leading to loss of heterogeneity which has been reported to be associated with high biodiversity. The results reveal the need for more active management measures that would decrease the risk of large stand replacing fires and would ensure a suitable landscape structure for raptors.

TI  - Analysis of Global LAI/FPAR Products from VIIRS and MODIS Sensors for Spatio-Temporal Consistency and Uncertainty from 2012-2016
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The operational Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Leaf Area Index (LAI) and Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation absorbed by vegetation (FPAR) algorithm has been successfully implemented for Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) observations by optimizing a small set of configurable parameters in Look-Up-Tables (LUTs). Our preliminary evaluation showed reasonable agreement between VIIRS and MODIS LAI/FPAR retrievals. However, there is a need for a more comprehensive investigation to assure continuity of multi-sensor global LAI/FPAR time series, as the preliminary evaluation was spatiotemporally limited. In this study, we use a multi-year (2012-2016) global LAI/FPAR product generated from VIIRS and MODIS to evaluate for spatiotemporal consistency. We also quantify uncertainty of the product by utilizing available ground measurements. For both consistency and uncertainty evaluation, we account for variations in biome type and temporal resolution. Our results indicate that the LAI/FPAR retrievals from VIIRS and MODIS are consistent at different spatial (i.e., global and site) and temporal (i.e., 8-day, seasonal and annual) scales. The estimate of mean discrepancy (-0.006 +/- 0.013 for LAI and -0.002 +/- 0.002 for FPAR) meets the stability requirement for long-term LAI/FPAR Earth System Data Records (ESDRs) from multi-sensors as suggested by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS). It is noteworthy that the rate of retrievals from the radiative transfer-based main algorithm is also comparable between two sensors. However, a relatively larger discrepancy over tropical forests was observed due to reflectance saturation and an unexpected interannual variation of main algorithm success was noticed due to instability in input surface reflectances. The uncertainties/relative uncertainties of VIIRS and MODIS LAI (FPAR) products assessed through comparisons to ground measurements are estimated to be 0.60/42.2% (0.10/24.4%) and 0.55/39.3% (0.11/26%), respectively. Note that the validated LAI were only distributed in low domains (similar to 2.5), resulting in large relative uncertainty. Therefore, more ground measurements are needed to achieve a more comprehensive evaluation result of product uncertainty. The results presented here generally imbue confidence in the consistency between VIIRS and MODIS LAI/FPAR products and the feasibility of generating long-term multi-sensor LAI/FPAR ESDRs time series.

TI  - Downscaling of Surface Soil Moisture Retrieval by Combining MODIS/Landsat and In Situ Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture, especially surface soil moisture (SSM), plays an important role in the development of various natural hazards that result from extreme weather events such as drought, flooding, and landslides. There have been many remote sensing methods for soil moisture retrieval based on microwave or optical thermal infrared (TIR) measurements. TIR remote sensing has been popular for SSM retrieval due to its fine spatial and temporal resolutions. However, because of limitations in the penetration of optical TIR radiation and cloud cover, TIR methods can only be used under clear sky conditions. Microwave SSM retrieval is based on solid physical principles, and has advantages in cases of cloud cover, but it has low spatial resolution. For applications at the local scale, SSM data at high spatial and temporal resolutions are important, especially for agricultural management and decision support systems. Current remote sensing measurements usually have either a high spatial resolution or a high temporal resolution, but not both. This study aims to retrieve SSM at both high spatial and temporal resolutions through the fusion of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Land Remote Sensing Satellite (Landsat) data. Based on the universal triangle trapezoid, this study investigated the relationship between land surface temperature (LST) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) under different soil moisture conditions to construct an improved nonlinear model for SSM retrieval with LST and NDVI. A case study was conducted in Iowa, in the United States (USA) (Lat: 42.2 degrees similar to 42.7 degrees, Lon: -93.6 degrees similar to-93.2 degrees), from 1 May 2016 to 31 August 2016. Daily SSM in an agricultural area during the crop-growing season was downscaled to 120-m spatial resolution by fusing Landsat 8 with MODIS, with an R-2 of 0.5766, and RMSE from 0.0302 to 0.1124 m(3)/m(3).

TI  - Continuously Tracking the Annual Changes of the Hengsha and Changxing Islands at the Yangtze River Estuary from 1987 to 2016 Using Landsat Imagery
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The evolution of estuarine islands is potentially controlled by sediment discharge, tidal currents, sea level rise, and intensive human activities. An understanding of the spatial and temporal changes of estuarine islands is needed for environmental change monitoring and assessment in estuarine and coastal areas. Such information can also help us better understand how estuarine islands respond to sea level rise in the context of global warming. The temporal changes of two estuarine islands in Shanghai near the Yangtze River Estuary were obtained using Landsat TM (Thematic Mapper) and ETM+ (Enhanced Thematic Mapper) images from 1987 to 2016 on an annual scale. First, a composite image was generated by using the multi-temporal Landsat images for each year. Then, a modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) was applied to the annual estuarine island maps using a threshold segmentation method. Finally, we obtained the temporal changes of the estuarine islands in Shanghai during the period 1987-2016. The results suggest that (1) Landsat TM/ETM+ images can be used for estuarine island mapping and change detection; (2) the two estuarine islands have expanded significantly during the past three decades; (3) human activities are the main driving factor that caused the expansion of the estuarine islands; and (4) the sea level can also partly explain the change in the estuarine islands. This study demonstrates that Landsat data are useful for determining the annual variations in the land area of two estuarine islands in Shanghai during the past 30 years. In the future, other factors and their contributions to estuarine island changes should be further investigated.

TI  - Multisource Remote Sensing Data Classification Based on Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As a list of remotely sensed data sources is available, how to efficiently exploit useful information from multisource data for better Earth observation becomes an interesting but challenging problem. In this paper, the classification fusion of hyperspectral imagery (HSI) and data from other multiple sensors, such as light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data, is investigated with the state-of-the-art deep learning, named the two-branch convolution neural network (CNN). More specific, a two-tunnel CNN framework is first developed to extract spectral-spatial features from HSI; besides, the CNN with cascade block is designed for feature extraction from LiDAR or high-resolution visual image. In the feature fusion stage, the spatial and spectral features of HSI are first integrated in a dual-tunnel branch, and then combined with other data features extracted from a cascade network. Experimental results based on several multisource data demonstrate the proposed two-branch CNN that can achieve more excellent classification performance than some existing methods.

TI  - Mapping Monthly Air Temperature in the Tibetan Plateau From MODIS Data Based on Machine Learning Methods
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed knowledge of air temperature (T-a) is desired for various scientific applications. However, in the Tibetan Plateau (TP), the meteorologically observed Ta is limited due to the low density and uneven distribution of stations. This paper aims to develop a 1-km resolution monthly mean T-a dataset over the TP during 2001-2015 from remote sensing and auxiliary data. 11 environmental variables were extracted from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM) data and topographic index data. Ten machine learning algorithms were implemented and compared to determine the optimal model for T-a estimation in the TP. The Cubist algorithm outperformed other methods, having the highest accuracy and the lowest sensitivity to cloud contamination. To minimize the overfitting problem, a simple forward variable selection method was introduced and six variables were selected from the original 11 environmental variables. Among these six variables, nighttime land surface temperature (T-s) was the most important predictor, followed by elevation and solar radiance. The seasonal performance of the Cubist model was also assessed. The model had good accuracies in all four seasons, with the highest accuracy in winter (R-2 = 0.98 and MAE = 0.63 degrees C) and the lowest accuracy in summer (R-2 = 0.91 and MAE = 0.86 degrees C). Due to the gaps in MODIS data caused by cloud cover, there were 0.39% missing values in the estimated Ta. To improve the data integrity, Delaunay triangulation interpolation was applied to fill the missing Ta values. The final monthly (2001-2015) Ta dataset had an overall accuracy of RMSE = 1.00 degrees C and MAE = 0.73 degrees C. It provides valuable information for climate change assessment and other environmental studies in the TP.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Analysis of Actual Evapotranspiration and Its Causes in the Hai Basin
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is an important component of the eco-hydrological process. Comprehensive analyses of ET change at different spatial and temporal scales can enhance the understanding of hydrological processes and improve water resource management. In this study, monthly ET data and meteorological data from 57 meteorological stations between 2000 and 2014 were used to study the spatiotemporal changes in actual ET and the associated causes in the Hai Basin. A spatial analysis was performed in GIS to explore the spatial pattern of ET in the basin, while parametric t-test and nonparametric Mann-Kendall test methods were used to analyze the temporal characteristics of interannual and annual ET. The primary causes of the spatiotemporal variations were partly explained by detrended fluctuation analysis. The results were as follows: (i) generally, ET increased from northwest to southeast across the basin, with significant differences in ET due to the heterogeneous landscape. Notably, the ET of water bodies was highest, followed by those of paddy fields, forests, cropland, brush, grassland and settlement; (ii) from 2000 to 2014, annual ET exhibited an increasing trend of 3.7 mm per year across the basin, implying that the excessive utilization of water resources had not been alleviated and the water resource crisis worsened; (iii) changes in vegetation coverage, wind speed and air pressure were the major factors that influenced interannual ET trends. Temperature and NDVI largely explained the increases in ET in 2014 and can be used as indicators to evaluate annual ET and provide early warning for associated issues.

TI  - Assessing the impacts of urban sprawl on net primary productivity using fusion of Landsat and MODIS data
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization has profoundly altered the terrestrial ecosystem carbon cycle, especially the net primary productivity (NPP). Many attempts have been made to assess the influence of urbanization on NPP at coarse resolutions (e.g., 250 m or larger), which may ignore many smaller and highly fragmented urban lands, and to a large extent, underestimate the NPP variations induced by urban sprawl. Hence, we attempted to analyze the NPP variations influenced by urban sprawl at a fine resolution (e.g., 30 m), toward which the accuracy of NPP was improved using remotely sensed data fusion algorithm. In this paper, this assumption was tested in the Pearl River Delta of China. The land cover datasets from the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM)/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) were acquired to quantify the urban sprawl. The synthetic Normal Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI) data was obtained by fusing Landsat and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI via spatiotemporal fusion algorithm. The Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model was driven by land cover map, synthetic NDVI and meteorological data to estimate the 30-m resolution NPP. Then, we analyzed the influence of urban sprawl on 30-m resolution NPP during the period of 2001-2009. Additionally, we also simulated the spatiotemporal change of future urban sprawl under different scenarios using the Future Land Use Simulation (FLUS) model, and further analyzed its influence on 30-m resolution NPP. Our results showed that the accuracy of 30-m resolution NPP from synthetic NDVI is better than 500-m resolution NPP from MODIS NDVI. The loss in 30-m resolution NPP due to urban sprawlwas much higher than 500-m resolution NPP. Moreover, the harmonious development scenario, characterized by a reasonable size of urban sprawl and a corresponding lower NPP loss from 2009 to 2050, would be considered as a more human-oriented and sustainable development strategy.

TI  - Estimating Surface Downward Shortwave Radiation over China Based on the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Downward shortwave radiation (DSR) is an essential parameter in the terrestrial radiation budget and a necessary input for models of land-surface processes. Although several radiation products using satellite observations have been released, coarse spatial resolution and low accuracy limited their application. It is important to develop robust and accurate retrieval methods with higher spatial resolution. Machine learning methods may be powerful candidates for estimating the DSR from remotely sensed data because of their ability to perform adaptive, nonlinear data fitting. In this study, the gradient boosting regression tree (GBRT) was employed to retrieve DSR measurements with the ground observation data in China collected from the China Meteorological Administration (CMA) Meteorological Information Center and the satellite observations from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) at a spatial resolution of 5 km. The validation results of the DSR estimates based on the GBRT method in China at a daily time scale for clear sky conditions show an R-2 value of 0.82 and a root mean square error (RMSE) value of 27.71 Wm(-2) (38.38%). These values are 0.64 and 42.97 Wm(-2) (34.57%), respectively, for cloudy sky conditions. The monthly DSR estimates were also evaluated using ground measurements. The monthly DSR estimates have an overall R-2 value of 0.92 and an RMSE of 15.40 Wm(-2) (12.93%). Comparison of the DSR estimates with the reanalyzed and retrieved DSR measurements from satellite observations showed that the estimated DSR is reasonably accurate but has a higher spatial resolution. Moreover, the proposed GBRT method has good scalability and is easy to apply to other parameter inversion problems by changing the parameters and training data.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Characterization of a Reclamation Settlement in the Shanghai Coastal Area with Time Series Analyses of X-, C-, and L-Band SAR Datasets
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale reclamation projects during the past decades have been recognized as one of the driving factors behind land subsidence in coastal areas. However, the pattern of temporal evolution in reclamation settlements has rarely been analyzed. In this work, we study the spatio-temporal evolution pattern of Linggang New City (LNC) in Shanghai, China, using space-borne synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) methods. Three data stacks including 11 X-band TerraSAR-X, 20 L-band ALOS PALSAR, and 35 C-band ENVISAT ASAR images were used to retrieve time series deformation from 2007 to 2010 in the LNC. An InSAR analysis from the three data stacks displays strong agreement in mean deformation rates, with coefficients of determination of about 0.9 and standard deviations for inter-stack differences of less than 4 mm/y. Meanwhile, validations with leveling data indicate that all the three data stacks achieved millimeter-level accuracies. The spatial distribution and temporal evolution of deformation in the LNC as indicated by these InSAR analysis results relates to historical reclamation activities, geological features, and soil mechanisms. This research shows that ground deformation in the LNC after reclamation projects experienced three distinct phases: primary consolidation, a slight rebound, and plateau periods.

TI  - Estimation of water consumption for ecosystems based on Vegetation Interfaces Processes Model: A case study of the Aksu River Basin, Northwest China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) -Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Vegetation Interfaces Processes (VIP) model simulated the spatio-temporal patterns of actual evapotranspiration (ET) and the water consumption of different ecosystems in the Aksu River Basin, Northwest China between 2000 and 2015. The results revealed that: (1) the applicability of the VIP model was confirmed, with good agreement (R-2= 0.79, P < 0.05) between the VIP-ET and water balance model (WB)-ET in the Aksu River Basin; (2) arable land showed the highest annual actual ET per unit pixel (362.4 mm/pixel), followed by forest (159.6 mm/pixel), and grass land (142.8 mm/pixel); (3) water consumption for arable, forest, and grass land were determined as 19.45 x 10(8), 1.94 x 10(8), and 28 x 10(8) m(3)/a, respectively; and (4) therewas a significant trend (P < 0.05) of increasing water consumption of 0.379 x 10(8) m(3)/a in the artificial ecosystem, but there was no significant trend in the time series of the natural ecosystem. Overall, the study demonstrated that the VIP model is able to supply important information for water resource management at the catchment-scale. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B. V.

TI  - The assessment of the changes of biomass and riparian buffer width in the terminal reservoir under the impact of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project in China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Reservoir and lake levels are susceptible to interference from inter-basin water transfer projects that are intended to alleviate increasing serious water resource crises. However, the impact of these transfers on riparian buffers as well as to water security is not clear. This paper considers the world's largest inter-basin water transfer, the South-to-North Water Diversion (SNWD), as an example for assessing changes in riparian buffer width and biomass in order to indicate the influence of the project on the ecological system of the receiving reservoir. The riparian buffer width is determined by Landsat NDWI. Basing on in situ survey, the method that combing unmanned aircraft vehicle (UAV) and remote sensing (Landsat) was employed to calculate riparian biomass. Results: show that water arriving from the SNWD directly decrease the existing buffer width due to the rising water level, and riparian biomass shows a negative response to elevated water levels. Therefore, the transferred water will impair the ecological functions of that buffer and increase risk to the security of the water resource. The vegetation cover in extant riparian buffer zones should be restored if the buffers are to be effective as usual. This study provides information useful to assess riparian impact from artificial inter-basin water projects prior to implementation.

TI  - Decline of N and P Uptake in the Inner Protection Zone of a Terminal Reservoir during Inter-Basin Water Transfers
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Inter-basin water transfer projects are designed to relieve water scarcity around the world. However, ecological problems relating to reductions in protection zone functions can occur during inter-basin transfers. This paper uses the largest inter-basin water transfer project in the world, namely, the South-to-North Water Transfer Project (SNWTP) in China, as an example to analyze the variation of Miyun Reservoir's inner protection zone functions when water is transferred. Specifically, a riparian model (RIPAM) coupled with remote sensing data were used to calculate the nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) losses due to plant uptake, and these results were validated by in situ survey data. Then, correlations between water levels and N and P removal were analyzed. The results show that water table disturbances resulting from elevated water levels strongly influence the growth of plants and have obvious negative impacts on N and P removal in the inner protection zone. With the implementation of the middle route of the SNWTP, the water level of Miyun will rise to 150 m in 2020, and subsequently, the total net primary productivity (NPP) could decline by more than 40.90% from the level in 2015, while the N and P uptake could decline by more than 53.03% and 43.49%, respectively, from the levels in 2015, according to the modeling results. This will lead to declines in the inner protection zone's defense effectiveness for N and P interception and increases in risks to the security of water resources. The results of this study provide useful knowledge for managing the defense function of the terminal reservoir's inner protection zone and for ensuring that water quality is maintained during the diversion process.

TI  - Monitoring rubber plantation expansion using Landsat data time series and a Shapelet-based approach
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The expansion of tree plantations in tropical forests for commercial rubber cultivation threatens biodiversity which may affect ecosystem services, and hinders ecosystem productivity, causing net carbon emission. Numerous studies refer to the challenge of reliably distinguishing rubber plantations from natural forest, using satellite data, due to their similar spectral signatures, even when phenology is incorporated into an analysis. This study presents a novel approach for monitoring the establishment and expansion of rubber plantations in Seima Protection Forest (SPF), Cambodia (1995-2015), by detecting and analyzing the 'shapelet' structure in a Landsat-NDVI time series. This paper introduces a new classification procedure consisting of two steps: (1) an exhaustive-searching algorithm to detect shapelets that represent a period for relatively low NDVI values within an image time series; and (2) a t-test used to determine if NDVI values of detected shapelets are significantly different than their non-shapelet trend, thereby indicating the presence of rubber plantations. Using this approach, historical rubber plantation events were mapped over the twenty-year timespan. The shapelet algorithm produced two types of information: (1) year of rubber plantation establishment; and (2) pre-conversion land-cover type (i.e., agriculture, or natural forest). The overall accuracy of the rubber plantation map for the year of 2015 was 89%. The multi temporal map products reveal that more than half of the rubber planting activity (57%) took place in 2010 and 2011, following the granting of numerous rubber concessions two years prior. Seventy-three percent of the rubber plantations were converted from natural forest and twenty-three percent were established on non-forest land-cover. The shapelet approach developed here can be used reliably to improve our understanding of the expansion of rubber production beyond Seima Protection Forest of Cambodia, and likely elsewhere in the tropics.

TI  - Estimating the spatiotemporal variation of NO<sub>2</sub> concentration using an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Statistical modelling has been successfully used to estimate the variations of NO2 concentration, but employing new modelling techniques can make these estimations far more accurate. To do so, for the first time in application to spatiotemporal air pollution modelling, we employed a soft computing algorithm called adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to estimate the NO2 variations. Comprehensive data sets were investigated to determine the most effective predictors for the modelling process, including land use, meteorological, satellite, and traffic variables. We have demonstrated that using selected satellite, traffic, meteorological, and land use predictors in modelling increased the R-2 by 21%, and decreased the root mean square error (RMSE) by 47% compared with the model only trained by land use and meteorological predictors. The ANFIS model found to have better performance and higher accuracy than the multiple regression model. Our best model, captures 91% of the spatiotemporal variability of monthly mean NO2 concentrations at 1 km spatial resolution (RMSE 1.49 ppb) in a selected area of Australia. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Intraoperative identification and analysis of lymph nodes at laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery using fluorescence imaging combined with rapid OSNA pathological assessment
T2  - SURGICAL ENDOSCOPY AND OTHER INTERVENTIONAL TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Standard surgical practice for colorectal cancer involves resection of the primary lesion and all draining lymph nodes. Accurate intraoperative assessment of nodal status could allow stratified resectional extent. One-step nucleic acid (OSNA) can provide a rapid method of interrogating nodal tissue, whilst near-infrared (NIR) laparoscopy together with indocyanine green (ICG) can identify relevant nodal tissue intraoperatively.Methods ICG was administered around the tumour endoscopically prior to the operation. Fluorescent nodes identified by NIR were marked and submitted for whole-node OSNA analysis. Further fresh lymph nodes dissected from the standard resection specimen were examined and analysed by both conventional histology and OSNA. In addition, the status of the fluorescent nodes was compared to that of non-ICG nodes to assess their predictive value.Results Sixteen patients were recruited with a total final lymph node count of 287. 78 fresh lymph nodes were identified on fresh dissection for both histological and OSNA assessment with an analytical concordance rate of 98.7% (77/78). OSNA sensitivity was 1 (0.81-1, 95% CI) and specificity 0.98 (0.91-1, 95% CI). Six patients had a total of nine nodes identified intraoperatively by ICG fluorescence. Of these nine nodes, one was positive for metastasis on OSNA. OSNA analysis of the ICG-labelled node matched the final histological nodal stage in 3/6 patients (two being N0 and one N1). The final pathological nodal stage of the other three was N1 or N2, while the ICG nodes were negative.Conclusion OSNA is highly concordant with standard histology, although only a minority of nodes identifiable by full pathological analysis were found for OSNA on fresh dissection. OSNA can be combined with NIR and ICG lymphatic mapping to provide intraoperative assessment of nodal tissue in patients with colorectal cancer.

TI  - Estimation of Global Vegetation Productivity from Global LAnd Surface Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately estimating vegetation productivity is important in research on terrestrial ecosystems, carbon cycles and climate change. Eight-day gross primary production (GPP) and annual net primary production (NPP) are contained in MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products (MOD17), which are considered the first operational datasets for monitoring global vegetation productivity. However, the cloud-contaminated MODIS leaf area index (LAI) and Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FPAR) retrievals may introduce some considerable errors to MODIS GPP and NPP products. In this paper, global eight-day GPP and eight-day NPP were first estimated based on Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) LAI and FPAR products. Then, GPP and NPP estimates were validated by FLUXNET GPP data and BigFoot NPP data and were compared with MODIS GPP and NPP products. Compared with MODIS GPP, a time series showed that estimated GLASS GPP in our study was more temporally continuous and spatially complete with smoother trajectories. Validated with FLUXNET GPP and BigFoot NPP, we demonstrated that estimated GLASS GPP and NPP achieved higher precision for most vegetation types.

TI  - CORRELATION BETWEEN ULTRASOUND APPEARANCE OF SMALL BREAST CANCER AND AXILLARY LYMPH NODE METASTASIS
T2  - ULTRASOUND IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - To study the correlation of ultrasonographic signs of small breast cancer (maximum diameter <= 2.0 cm) with axillary lymph node metastasis, pre-operative ultrasonographic images of 153 small breast malignant neoplasms in 143 breast cancer patients were analyzed according to their pathologic features. Of the small breast tumors included, 47 showed axillary lymph node metastasis. Diagnosis of all patients was obtained with radical axillary surgery or a sentinel lymph node biopsy procedure. Ultrasonographic signs included irregular shape, microlobulated contour, spiculation, microcalcification, posterior echo attenuation, blood-flow grade, perforating vessels, changes in fascia or cooper's ligament and maximum cortical thickness of lymph nodes. The relationship between ultrasonographic features and axillary lymph node metastasis was analyzed using a chi-square test for univariate distributions and logistic regression for multivariate analysis. A logistic regression model was established by taking the pathologic diagnosis of lymph node metastasis as the dependent variable and the ultrasonographic signs of each small breast cancer as independent variables. In small breast cancer, characteristics such as perforating vessels and maximum cortical thickness of lymph nodes >3.0 mm correlated well with axillary lymph node metastasis as determined by univariate analysis (chi(2) = 13.945, 51.276, respectively, p < 0.05) and multivariate analysis (OR = 48.783, 46.754, respectively, p < 0.05).

TI  - GIS Based Urban Area Spatiotemporal Change Evaluation Using Landsat and Night Time Temporal Satellite Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims at determining the spatiotemporal change in urban areas by using multi-temporal satellite images with geographic information systems integration. In this study, the city of Erzincan was selected as the sample case. The analyses of change were conducted by using the optical satellite images from LANSAT TM dated 1987 and the LANDSAT ETM+ dated 2006, besides the night images from 1998, 2006 and 2010. Spatial change maps were created for the qualitative analysis, and change matrixes were formed for the quantitative assessment of these changes. The outcomes of these change analyses were then evaluated and interpreted in the light of the demographics of the population living in the area. The results obtained from the Landsat satellite images indicate that the area of the city expanded at the annual average rate of 1.65% in 1987-2006. Night images indicate that the city area grew at an annual average rate of 4.04% in 1998-2006, while this rate was 20.28% in the period of 2006-2010. The results of the study demonstrate that the usability and contribution of satellite images is quite significant in tracking and monitoring temporal and spatial change in the area.

TI  - Monitoring of Historical Glacier Recession in Yulong Mountain by the Integration of Multisource Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Yulong Mountain, which is the southernmost snowcapped mountain in mainland Eurasia, has been confronted with significant glacier recession in the last decades due to global climate warming. The recession of these small-scale monsoonal temperate glaciers is a sensitive indicator of global warming. However, there have been few studies that have comprehensively monitored the historical glacier recession in Yulong Mountain area. This paper integrates multisource remote sensing data to monitor the glacial status on Yulong Mountain between 1957 and 2009. Integrating a topographic map, the long-term observed Landsat TM/ETM+images, and multitemporal digital elevation model datasets, both the area change and regional mass balance of the Yulong glaciers are analyzed. According to the results, the area of the Yulong glaciers decreased from 11.57 to 4.55 km(2) at a rate of -0.14 km(2) yr(-1) over the last 52 years between 1957 and 2009. The 1987-1999 specific mass balance was -0.31 +/- 0.33 m yr(-1) water equivalent, while the 1987-2008 mass balance was -0.27 +/- 0.35 m yr(-1) water equivalent. It can be interpreted from the results that the Yulong glaciers have experienced persistent glacier recession during the last decades. The glacier melting is still significant due to the continuously rising temperature. Furthermore, spatially heterogeneous glacier recession has been observed in this area. The glacier changes are spatially varied, which is probably due to the local temperature and precipitation, the glacier sizes, the terminus altitudes, and terrain factors. The influencing elements interacted with each other, and the climate conditions are the dominant factors affecting glacier status.

TI  - Seasonal assessment and classification of aerosols transported to Lahore using AERONET and MODIS deep blue retrievals
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Daily measurements of aerosol optical depth () and angstrom ngstrom wavelength exponent () acquired from Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) are analysed over Lahore-an urban city of Pakistan (period: 2010-2014) to investigate contribution of different types of aerosols originating from both local and regional source locations. The obtained annual averages (mean +/- standard deviation) for AERONET retrievals of (500nm) and (440-870nm) are 0.68 +/- 0.37 (0.08-2.91) and 0.99 +/- 0.33 (0-1.8), respectively. Of all the sources, 61% are found within Pakistan, 11% in India, 19% in Afghanistan, 6% in Iran and 2% in Saudi Arabia with seasonal contributions of 35, 25, 23 and 17% in pre-monsoon, monsoon, winter and post-monsoon, respectively. The bimodal distributions of show dominance of coarse-mode particles during pre-monsoon, fine-mode particles during post-monsoon and presence of both coarse-mode and fine-mode particles during winter and monsoon with winter showing more fine-mode particles. Two broad classes of aerosols namely desert dust (DD) and biomass burning/urban industrial (BU) are identified with criteria, e.g. 0.3 and 0.75 indicating presence of DD while 0.2 and 1.15 indicating BU. The frequency of occurrence (FOO) of DD and BU aerosols is further identified by applying classification criteria over Aqua-MODIS deep blue retrievals. The FOO identifies anthropogenic activity on-going throughout the year, disrupted with DD aerosols only during pre-monsoon and monsoon. The maximum dust activity is seen over Indo-Gangetic plains (IGP) (localized maxima: 35-45%) and the Arabian peninsula (>55%) during pre-monsoon, while maximum BU aerosols are found over IGP, central and south-eastern plains of India and the state of Gujarat (localized maxima: >70%) in winter and post-monsoon.

TI  - Wind Direction Extraction from SAR in Coastal Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper aims to illustrate and test a method, based on the Two-Dimensional Continuous Wavelet Transform (2D-CWT), developed to extract the wind directions from the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. The knowledge of the wind direction is essential to retrieve the wind speed by using the radar-backscatter versus wind speed algorithms. The method has been applied to 61 SAR images from different satellites (Envisat, COSMO-SkyMed, Radarsat-2 and Sentinel-1A,B), and the results have been compared with the analysis wind fields from the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) model, with in situ reports and with scatterometer data when available. The 2D-CWT method provides satisfactory results, both in areas a few kilometres from the coast and offshore. It is reliable as it produces good direction estimates, no matter what the characteristics of the SAR are. Statistics reports a success in the SAR wind direction estimates in 95% of cases (in 83% of cases the SAR-ECMWF wind direction difference is The SAR derived wind directions cannot be said to be validated, as the data available at present cannot be really representative of the wind field in the coastal area. However, the figures given by SAR winds are highly valuable even not properly validated, providing an independent and unique view of the spatial variability of the wind over the sea, which is possible by using the 2D-CWT method to derive the wind directions.

T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to explore the clinical usefulness of ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration cytology (USG-FNAC) for the evaluation of axillary lymph nodes in patients with early stage breast cancer (BC) among the Chinese Han female population.Around 124 patients with early stage BC were included in this retrospective study. All patients underwent USG-FNAC (group A). Patients with proven metastasis also underwent axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) (group B). In addition, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was performed 2 to 5hours prior to the surgery.The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and positive predictive value (PPV) of axillary ultrasound were 75.0%, 75.0%, 75.0%, and 82.6%, respectively, while for USG-FNAC, they were 80.8%, 100.0%, 88.7%, and 100.0%, respectively. Significant differences were found in specificity, accuracy, and PPV between the 2 procedures (P <.05).The results of this study demonstrated that USG-FNAC was effective for selecting patients with early stage BC using ALND or SLNB among the Chinese Han female population.

TI  - Change Detection of Land Surface Temperature (LST) and some Related Parameters Using Landsat Image: a Case Study of the Ebinur Lake Watershed, Xinjiang, China
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assesses and detects land use/cover (LUC) and land surface temperature (LST) change using multi-temporal Landsat TM satellite data. NDVI, albedo and MNDWI were used to analyze the LST qualitatively. The results revealed that the accuracy of LST measurements in watershed is within 1.5 A degrees C. Then, temperature changes between 1998 and 2011 were analyzed. The classifications of land surface temperatures lie in five categories as follows: lower (1.9-8.9 A degrees C), low (8.9-15.9 A degrees C), middle (15.9-22.9 A degrees C), high (22.9-29.9 A degrees C), higher (29.9-36.9 A degrees C), and highest (36.9-43.9 A degrees C). Second, east-west profiles of the characteristics of the distribution of LUC types were made based on 1998 and 2011 images. By comparing LSTs in these two years, one can conclude woodland-grassland has a very strong influence on temperature. Third, LST increased with the increases in the density of salinized and desert lands, but decreased with the increase in vegetation cover. The relationship between MNDWI and LST was significantly negatively correlated. Multiple regression analyses between LST and each index as well as elevation were created to evaluate the watershed thermal environment. This regression showed that NDVI, albedo, MNDWI and a digital elevation model were effective indicators for quantifying the effects of land use/cover change (LUCC) on LST, and the correlation coefficient R was 0.806. Finally, natural and human factors were important factors affecting temperature change. Generally, the temperature of the oasis was lower than the surroundings, which results in a 'cold island effect'.

TI  - Daily air temperature estimation on glacier surfaces in the Tibetan Plateau using MODIS LST data
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature (LST) data have been widely used for air temperature estimation in mountainous regions where station observations are sparse. However, the performance of MODIS LST in high-elevation glacierized areas remains unclear. This study investigates air temperature estimation in glacierized areas based on ground observations at four glaciers across the Tibetan Plateau. Before being used to estimate the air temperature, MODIS LST data are evaluated at two of the glaciers, which indicates that MODIS night-time LST is more reliable than MODIS daytime LST data. Then, linear models based on each of the individual MODIS LST products from two platforms (Terra and Aqua) and two overpasses (nighttime and daytime) are built to estimate daily mean, minimum and maximum air temperatures in glacierized areas. Regional glacier surface (RGS) models (mean /-mean-square differences: 3.3, 3.0 and 4.8 degrees C for daily mean, minimum and maximum air temperatures, respectively) show higher accuracy than local non-glacier surface models (mean root-mean-square differences: 4.2, 4.7 and 5.7 degrees C). In addition, the RGS models based on MODIS night-time LST perform better to estimate daily mean, minimum and maximum air temperatures than using temperature lapse rate derived from local stations.

TI  - Exploring the optimal integration levels between SAR and optical data for better urban land cover mapping in the Pearl River Delta
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Integrating synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical data to improve urban land cover classification has been identified as a promising approach. However, which integration level is the most suitable remains unclear but important to many researchers and engineers. This study aimed to compare different integration levels for providing a scientific reference for a wide range of studies using optical and SAR data. SAR data from TerraSAR-X and ENVISAT ASAR in both WSM and IMP modes were used to be combined with optical data at pixel level, feature level and decision levels using four typical machine learning methods. The experimental results indicated that: 1) feature level that used both the original images and extracted features achieved a significant improvement of up to 10% compared to that using optical data alone; 2) different levels of fusion required different suitable methods depending on the data distribution and data resolution. For instance, support vector machine was the most stable at both the feature and decision levels, while random forest was suitable at the pixel level but not suitable at the decision level. 3) By examining the distribution of SAR features, some features (e.g., homogeneity) exhibited a close-to-normal distribution, explaining the improvement from the maximum likelihood method at the feature and decision levels. This indicated the benefits of using texture features from SAR data when being combined with optical data for land cover classification. Additionally, the research also shown that combining optical and SAR data does not guarantee improvement compared with using single data source for urban land cover classification, depending on the selection of appropriate fusion levels and fusion methods.

TI  - Rape (<i>Brassica napus</i> L.) Growth Monitoring and Mapping Based on Radarsat-2 Time-Series Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, 27 polarimetric parameters were extracted from Radarsat-2 polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) at each growth stage of the rape crop. The sensitivity to growth parameters such as stem height, leaf area index (LAI), and biomass were investigated as a function of days after sowing. Based on the sensitivity analysis, five empirical regression models were compared to determine the best model for stem height, LAI, and biomass inversion. Of these five models, quadratic models had higher R-2 values than other models in most cases of growth parameter inversions, but when these results were related to physical scattering mechanisms, the inversion results produced overestimation in the performance of some parameters. By contrast, linear and logarithmic models, which had lower R-2 values than the quadratic models, had stable performance for growth parameter inversions, particularly in terms of their performance at each growth stage. The best biomass inversion performance was acquired by the volume component of a quadratic model, with an R-2 value of 0.854 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 109.93 g m(-2). The best LAI inversion was also acquired by a quadratic model, but used the radar vegetation index (Cloude), with an R-2 value of 0.8706 and RMSE of 0.56 m(2) m(-2). Stem height was acquired by scattering angle alphausing a logarithmic model, with an R-2 of 0.926 value and RMSE of 11.09 cm. The performances of these models were also analysed for biomass estimation at the second growth stage (P2), third growth stage (P3), and fourth growth stage (P4). The results showed that the models built at the P3 stage had better substitutability with the models built during all of the growth stages. From the mapping results, we conclude that a model built at the P3 stage can be used for rape biomass inversion, with 90% of estimation errors being less than 100 g m(-2).

TI  - Land Cover Change Detection in Urban Lake Areas Using Multi-Temporary Very High Spatial Resolution Aerial Images
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The availability of very high spatial resolution (VHR) remote sensing imagery provides unique opportunities to exploit meaningful change information in detail with object-oriented image analysis. This study investigated land cover (LC) changes in Shahu Lake of Wuhan using multi-temporal VHR aerial images in the years 1978, 1981, 1989, 1995, 2003, and 2011. A multi-resolution segmentation algorithm and CART (classification and regression trees) classifier were employed to perform highly accurate LC classification of the individual images, while a post-classification comparison method was used to detect changes. The experiments demonstrated that significant changes in LC occurred along with the rapid urbanization during 1978-2011. The dominant changes that took place in the study area were lake and vegetation shrinking, replaced by high density buildings and roads. The total area of Shahu Lake decreased from similar to 7.64 km(2) to similar to 3.60 km(2) during the past 33 years, where 52.91% of its original area was lost. The presented results also indicated that urban expansion and inadequate legislative protection are the main factors in Shahu Lake's shrinking. The object-oriented change detection schema presented in this manuscript enables us to better understand the specific spatial changes of Shahu Lake, which can be used to make reasonable decisions for lake protection and urban development.

T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite and human visual observation are two of the most important observation approaches for cloud cover. In this study, the total cloud cover (TCC) observed by MODIS onboard the Terra and Aqua satellites was compared with Synop meteorological station observations over the North China Plain and its surrounding regions for 11 years during daytime and 7 years during nighttime. The Synop data were recorded eight times a day at 3-h intervals. Linear interpolation was used to interpolate the Synop data to the MODIS overpass time in order to reduce the temporal deviation between the satellite and Synop observations. Results showed that MODIS-derived TCC had good consistency with the Synop observations; the correlation coefficients ranged from 0.56 in winter to 0.73 in summer for Terra MODIS, and from 0.55 in winter to 0.71 in summer for Aqua MODIS. However, they also had certain differences. On average, the MODIS-derived TCC was 15.16% higher than the Synop data, and this value was higher at nighttime (15.58%-16.64%) than daytime (12.74%-14.14%). The deviation between the MODIS and Synop TCC had large seasonal variation, being largest in winter (29.53%-31.07%) and smallest in summer (4.46%-6.07%). Analysis indicated that cloud with low cloud-top height and small cloud optical thickness was more likely to cause observation bias. Besides, an increase in the satellite view zenith angle, aerosol optical depth, or snow cover could lead to positively biased MODIS results, and this affect differed among different cloud types.

TI  - A Space-Time Periodic Task Model for Recommendation of Remote Sensing Images
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid development of remote sensing technology, the quantity and variety of remote sensing images are growing so quickly that proactive and personalized access to data has become an inevitable trend. One of the active approaches is remote sensing image recommendation, which can offer related image products to users according to their preference. Although multiple studies on remote sensing retrieval and recommendation have been performed, most of these studies model the user profiles only from the perspective of spatial area or image features. In this paper, we propose a spatiotemporal recommendation method for remote sensing data based on the probabilistic latent topic model, which is named the Space-Time Periodic Task model (STPT). User retrieval behaviors of remote sensing images are represented as mixtures of latent tasks, which act as links between users and images. Each task is associated with the joint probability distribution of space, time and image characteristics. Meanwhile, the von Mises distribution is introduced to fit the distribution of tasks over time. Then, we adopt Gibbs sampling to learn the random variables and parameters and present the inference algorithm for our model. Experiments show that the proposed STPT model can improve the capability and efficiency of remote sensing image data services.

T2  - ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) system is today a standard equipment on civil aircraft, transmitting periodically data packages containing information of key data such as aircraft ID, position, altitude and intention. It is designed for terrestrial based ground station to monitor air traffic flow in certain regions. Space based ADS-B is the idea to place sensitive receivers on board satellites in orbit, which can receive ADS-B packages and relay them the relevant ground stations. The terrestrial ADS-B receiver has been widely applied for airport information system, help monitor and control traffic flow, etc. However, its coverage is strongly limited by sea or mountain conditions. This paper first introduces the CubeSat mission, then discusses the integrated application of ADS-B data received from ground stations and from satellites, analyze their characteristics with statistical results of comparison, and explore the technologies to fuse these two different data resources for an integrated application. The satellite data is based on a Chinese CubeSat, STU-2C, being launched into space on Sept 25th 2015. The ADS-B data received from two different resources have shown a good complementary each other, such as to increase the coverage of space for air traffic, and to monitor the whole space in a better and complete way.

TI  - Analysis of Permafrost Region Coherence Variation in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau with a High-Resolution TerraSAR-X Image
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) is heavily affected by climate change and has been undergoing serious permafrost degradation due to global warming. Synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) has been a significant tool for mapping surface features or measuring physical parameters, such as soil moisture, active layer thickness, that can be used for permafrost modelling. This study analyzed variations of coherence in the QTP area for the first time with high-resolution SAR images acquired from June 2014 to August 2016. The coherence variation of typical ground targets was obtained and analyzed. Because of the effects of active-layer (AL) freezing and thawing, coherence maps generated in the Beiluhe permafrost area exhibits seasonal variation. Furthermore, a temporal decorrelation model determined by a linear temporal-decorrelation component plus a seasonal periodic-decorrelation component and a constant component have been proposed. Most of the typical ground targets fit this temporal model. The results clearly indicate that railways and highways can hold high coherence properties over the long term in X-band images. By contrast, mountain slopes and barren areas cannot hold high coherence after one cycle of freezing and thawing. The possible factors (vegetation, soil moisture, soil freezing and thawing, and human activity) affecting InSAR coherence are discussed. This study shows that high-resolution time series of TerraSAR-X coherence can be useful for understanding QTP environments and for other applications.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Triggered by earthquakes, rainfall, or anthropogenic activities, landslides represent widespread and problematic geohazards worldwide. In recent years, multiple remote sensing techniques, including synthetic aperture radar, optical, and light detection and ranging measurements from spaceborne, airborne, and ground-based platforms, have been widely applied for the analysis of landslide processes. Current techniques include landslide detection, inventory mapping, surface deformation monitoring, trigger factor analysis and mechanism inversion. In addition, landslide susceptibility modelling, hazard assessment, and risk evaluation can be further analyzed using a synergic fusion of multiple remote sensing data and other factors affecting landslides. We summarize the 19 articles collected in this special issue of Remote Sensing of Landslide, in the terms of data, methods and applications used in the papers.

TI  - Dynamic identification of soil erosion risk in the middle reaches of the Yellow River Basin in China from 1978 to 2010
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion has become a significant environmental problem that threatens ecosystems globally. The risks posed by soil erosion, the trends in the spatial distribution in soil erosion, and the status, intensity, and conservation priority level in the middle reaches of the Yellow River Basin were identified from 1978 to 2010. This study employed a multi-criteria evaluation method integrated with GIS and multi-source remote sensing data including land use, slope gradient and vegetation fractional coverage (VFC). The erosion status in the study region improved from 1978 to 2010; areas of extremely severe, more severe, and severe soil erosion decreased from 0.05%, 0.94%, and 11.25% in 1978 to 0.04%, 0.81%, and 10.28% in 1998, respectively, and to 0.03%, 0.59%, and 6.87% in 2010, respectively. Compared to the period from 1978 to 1998, the area classed as improvement grade erosion increased by about 47,210.18 km(2) from 1998 to 2010, while the area classed as deterioration grade erosion decreased by about 17,738.29 km(2). Almost all severe erosion regions fall in the 1st and 2nd conservation priority levels, which areas accounted for 3.86% and 1.11% of the study area in the two periods, respectively. This study identified regions where soil erosion control is required and the results provide a reference for policymakers to implement soil conservation measures in the future.

TI  - Impact of tropical cyclones on the evolution of the monsoon-driven upwelling system in the coastal waters of the northern South China Sea
T2  - OCEAN DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - An upwelling system exists in the coastal waters of the northern South China Sea (NSCS), a region that is frequently affected by tropical cyclones in summer. This study investigates the evolution of the NSCS monsoon-driven upwelling system and the effects of the Talim and Doksuri tropical cyclones on the system using in situ observational data obtained at three mooring stations, one land-based meteorological station, and concurrent satellite remote sensing data for the NSCS coastal waters from May to July 2012. The results show that the occurrence and evolution of the upwelling system were mainly controlled by the Asian southwest monsoon, while the eastward current also made important contributions to the upwelling intensity. A decrease in the bottom water temperature and shifts in the along-shore and cross-shore currents were direct evidence of the establishment, existence, and recovery of this upwelling. Tropical cyclones have significant impacts on hydrodynamics and can thus influence the evolution of the NSCS upwelling system by changing the local wind and current fields. Variations in water level and local current systems impeded the development of upwelling during tropical cyclones Talim and Doksuri in the study area, which have low-frequency fluctuations of approximately 2-10 days. These variations were the results of the coupled interactions between local wind fields, coastal trapped waves, and other factors. The hydrodynamic environment of the marine water (including coastal upwelling system) rapidly recovered to normal sea conditions after each cyclone passed due to the relatively short duration of the impact of a tropical cyclone on the dynamic environment of the waters.

TI  - Use of Breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Ultrasonography for Identifying Nonpalpable Axillae Metastases in Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer Patients
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - In newly diagnosed breast cancer patients, the status of axillary lymph node involvement should be confirmed. We show that ultrasonography exhibited better discriminative ability than breast magnetic resonance imaging in nonpalpable axillae metastases.Background: The metastasis of axillary lymph node (ALNs) is a critical step in the initial cancer staging of newly diagnosed breast cancer (BC) patients. Various imaging modalities can enhance the sensitivity of clinical examination in assessing the ALN status. Patients and Methods: We enrolled 135 patients with BC, confirmed via histopathology, including 4 bilateral BC cases. A total of 139 ipsilateral ALNs adjacent to the breast lesion were examined via physical examination, ultrasonography (US), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); of these, 100 were nonpalpable ALNs, as determined by experienced breast surgeons and physicians. The relative size parameters on MRI and US images were recorded. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were conducted, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was compared. Results: Of 139 ALNs, 67 (48%) were malignant and 72 (52%) were benign on pathological examination. In all of the ALNs, the US short diameter appeared to be the most discriminative quantitative measurement for detecting positive findings (AUC, 0.854). In nonpalpable ALNs as well, the US short diameter exhibited the greatest discriminability (AUC, 0.746). However, the 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional parameters on MRI did not exhibit any significant differences between the enrolled and nonpalpable ALNs (P > .05). Conclusion: The shortest diameter on US exhibited better discriminative ability than MRI for predicting positive ALNs in nonpalpable axillae. Moreover, the 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional parameters on MRI did not differ in terms of discriminability. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Impacts of Insufficient Observations on the Monitoring of Short- and Long-Term Suspended Solids Variations in Highly Dynamic Waters, and Implications for an Optimal Observation Strategy
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal water regions represent some of the most fragile ecosystems, exposed to both climate change and human activities. While remote sensing provides unprecedented amounts of data for water quality monitoring on regional to global scales, the performance of satellite observations is frequently impeded by revisiting intervals and unfavorable conditions, such as cloud coverage and sun glint. Therefore, it is crucial to evaluate the impacts of varied sampling strategies (time and frequency) and insufficient observations on the monitoring of short-term and long-term tendencies of water quality parameters, such as suspended solids (SS), in highly dynamic coastal waters. Taking advantage of the first high-frequency in situ SS dataset (at 30 min sampling intervals from 2007 to 2008), collected in Deep Bay, China, this paper presents a quantitative analysis of the influences of sampling strategies on the monitoring of SS, in terms of sampling frequency and time of day. Dramatic variations of SS were observed, with standard deviation coefficients of 48.9% and 54.1%, at two fixed stations; in addition, significant uncertainties were revealed, with the average absolute percent difference of approximately 13%, related to sampling frequency and time, using nonlinear optimization and random simulation methods. For a sampling frequency of less than two observations per day, the relative error of SS was higher than 50%, and stabilized at approximately 10%, when at least four or five samplings were conducted per day. The optimal recommended sampling times for SS were at around 9:00, 12:00, 14:00, and 16:00 in Deep Bay. The pseudo MODIS SS dataset was obtained from high-frequency in situ SS measurements at 10:30 and 14:00, masked by the temporal gap distribution of MODIS coverage to avoid uncertainties propagated from atmospheric correction and SS models. Noteworthy uncertainties of daily observations from the Terra/Aqua MODIS were found, with mean relative errors of 19.2% and 17.8%, respectively, whereas at the monthly level, the mean relative error of Terra/Aqua MODIS observations was approximately 10.7% (standard deviation of 8.4%). Sensitivity analysis between MODIS coverage and SS relative errors indicated that temporal coverage (the percentage of valid MODIS observations for a month) of more than 70% is required to obtain high-precision SS measurements at a 5% error level. Furthermore, approximately 20% of relative errors were found with the coverage of 30%, which was the average coverage of satellite observations over global coastal waters. These results highlight the need for high-frequency measurements of geostationary satellites like GOCI and multi-source ocean color sensors to capture the dynamic process of coastal waters in both the short and long term.

TI  - Estimation of High Spatial-Resolution Clear-Sky Land Surface-Upwelling Longwave Radiation from VIIRS/S-NPP Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface-upwelling longwave radiation (LWUP) is an important component of the surface radiation budget. Under the general framework of the hybrid method, the linear models and the multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) models are developed to estimate the 750 m instantaneous clear-sky LWUP from the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) channels M14, M15, and M16. Comprehensive radiative transfer simulations are conducted to generate a huge amount of representative samples, from which the linear model and the MARS model are derived. The two models developed are validated by the field measurements collected from seven sites in the Surface Radiation Budget Network (SURFRAD). The bias and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the linear models are -4.59 W/m(2) and 16.15 W/m(2), whereas those of the MARS models are -5.23 W/m(2) and 16.38 W/m(2), respectively. The linear models are preferable for the production of the operational LWUP product due to its higher computational efficiency and acceptable accuracy. The LWUP estimated by the linear models developed from VIIRS is compared to that retrieved from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). They agree well with each other with bias and RMSE of -0.15 W/m(2) and 25.24 W/m(2) respectively. This is the first time that the hybrid method has been applied to globally estimate clear-sky LWUP from VIIRS data. The good performance of the developed hybrid method and consistency between VIIRS LWUP and MODIS LWUP indicate that the hybrid method is promising for producing the long-term high spatial resolution environmental data record (EDR) of LWUP.

TI  - Multi-Feature Classification of Multi-Sensor Satellite Imagery Based on Dual-Polarimetric Sentinel-1A, Landsat-8 OLI, and Hyperion Images for Urban Land-Cover Classification
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper focuses on evaluating the ability and contribution of using backscatter intensity, texture, coherence, and color features extracted from Sentinel-1A data for urban land cover classification and comparing different multi-sensor land cover mapping methods to improve classification accuracy. Both Landsat-8 OLI and Hyperion images were also acquired, in combination with Sentinel-1A data, to explore the potential of different multi-sensor urban land cover mapping methods to improve classification accuracy. The classification was performed using a random forest (RF) method. The results showed that the optimal window size of the combination of all texture features was 9 x 9, and the optimal window size was different for each individual texture feature. For the four different feature types, the texture features contributed the most to the classification, followed by the coherence and backscatter intensity features; and the color features had the least impact on the urban land cover classification. Satisfactory classification results can be obtained using only the combination of texture and coherence features, with an overall accuracy up to 91.55% and a kappa coefficient up to 0.8935, respectively. Among all combinations of Sentinel-1A-derived features, the combination of the four features had the best classification result. Multi-sensor urban land cover mapping obtained higher classification accuracy. The combination of Sentinel-1A and Hyperion data achieved higher classification accuracy compared to the combination of Sentinel-1A and Landsat-8 OLI images, with an overall accuracy of up to 99.12% and a kappa coefficient up to 0.9889. When Sentinel-1A data was added to Hyperion images, the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient were increased by 4.01% and 0.0519, respectively.

TI  - Time-dependent postseismic slip following the 1978 <i>M<sub>w</sub></i> 7.3 Tabas-e-Golshan, Iran earthquake revealed by over 20 years of ESA InSAR observations
T2  - EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We use over 20 yrs (1996-2017) of the European Space Agency's (ESA) radar interferometry (InSAR) observations to investigate the postseismic deformation of the Tabas fold segment following the 1978 M-w 7.3 Tabas-e-Golshan earthquake in eastern Iran. We generated maps of satellite line-of-sight (LOS) velocity using two ERS descending tracks (1996-1999), one Envisat descending track (2003-2010), one Sentinel-1A descending track (2014-2017) and one Sentinel-1A ascending track (2014-2017). The LOS velocity shows afterslip continuing for at least 40 yrs after the earthquake. Elastic dislocation modelling based on the InSAR measurements reveals a decrease in postseismic velocities from 5.0 +/- 0.8 mm/yr in 1996-1999 to 3.9 +/- 0.6 mm/yr in 2003-2005, 3.0 +/- 0.4 mm/yr in 2006-2010, and a present rate of 2.3 +/- 0.6 mm/yr in 2014-2017. The rates decay with time, t, as 1/t, consistent with the predictions of a simple block-slider model. We then combine the InSAR rates and our previous estimates of the total earthquake slip derived from optical image matching and DEM differencing to explore the frictional behaviour of the Tabas fold. We obtained a rate-and-state parameter a- b approximate to 0.003, indicating rate-strengthening frictional behaviour of the Tabas fault. We also inferred a minimum coseismic slip of 4.7 m, which might have driven bedding-plane shear at shallow depth, resulting in distributed fold growth and secondary faulting observed in the field. The results imply that both coseismic slip and afterslip have occurred in the same location. One possible mechanism to explain such a phenomenon is that the frictional parameter a - b is small enough to allow dynamic ruptures to propagate into rate-strengthening regions.

TI  - Foliar and woody materials discriminated using terrestrial LiDAR in a mixed natural forest
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Separation of foliar and woody materials using remotely sensed data is crucial for the accurate estimation of leaf area index (LAI) and woody biomass across forest stands. In this paper, we present a new method to accurately separate foliar and woody materials using terrestrial LiDAR point clouds obtained from ten test sites in a mixed forest in Bavarian Forest National Park, Germany. Firstly, we applied and compared an adaptive radius near neighbor search algorithm with a fixed radius near-neighbor search method in order to obtain both radiometric and geometric features derived from terrestrial LiDAR point clouds. Secondly, we used a random forest machine learning algorithm to classify foliar and woody materials and examined the impact of understory and slope on the classification accuracy. An average overall accuracy of 84.4% (Kappa = 0.75) was achieved across all experimental plots. The adaptive radius near-neighbor search method outperformed the fixed radius near-neighbor search method. The classification accuracy was significantly higher when the combination of both radiometric and geometric features was utilized. The analysis showed that increasing slope and understory coverage had a significant negative effect on the overall classification accuracy. Our results suggest that the utilization of the adaptive radius near-neighbor search method coupling both radiometric and geometric features has the potential to accurately discriminate foliar and woody materials from terrestrial LiDAR data in a mixed natural forest.

TI  - Assessment of trends in inundation extent in the Barotse Floodplain, upper Zambezi River Basin: A remote sensing-based approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Study region: The annually flooded Barotse Floodplain in the upper Zambezi River Basin in the Western Province of Zambia, Southern Africa.Study focus: Discharge variability plays a significant role in inundation extent and thus it controls habitat conditions of river channels and the linked wetlands. The linkage between discharge and inundation extent in the Barotse Floodplain allowed us to analyse the trends in extent overtime using optical satellite imagery MODIS. The Desert Flood Index, a surface water extraction algorithm, was used to generate time series of inundation extent. For validation of the inundation extent we used a flood mask extracted from a supervised classification land cover map using Landsat imagery. The land cover map was validated using the error matrix method with ground truthed data. The estimated inundation extent time series enabled us to test the inundation correlation with discharge and water level using Pearson r correlation, a parametric statistical test. Based on the established correlation we used the Mann-Kendall, a non-parametric test, to analyse trends in the inundation extent and discharge and water level time series from which we made inferences on the direction of the historical trend in inundation extent.New hydrological insights for the region: The results revealed that there is observable inter-annual variability in inundation extent in the Barotse Floodplain with prominent differences demonstrated in both the flood ascending/peak and receding period. For the period 2003-2013 the results indicated a rising trend in inundation extent with a Mann-Kendall Z statistic of 1.71 and increase in magnitude of 33.1 km(2) at significance level alpha of 0.05. Strong correlations between inundation extent and water level and between inundation extent and discharge with correlation coefficients of determination of 0.86 and 0.89 respectively were observed. For the period 2000-2011 water level time series showed a rising trend with the Mann-Kendall Z statistic of 2.97 and increase in magnitude of 0.1m at significance level alpha of 0.05. Overall, during the period 1952-2004 discharge in the floodplain showed a declining trend with Mann-Kendall Z statistics of -2.88 and -3.38 at the inlet and outlet of the floodplain respectively. By correlation inference, the overall inundation extent trend in the floodplain was in a downward movement. Rainfall and discharge variability, high evapotranspiration and the changes in the land cover-use in the catchment of the floodplain are largely the factors affecting the observed variability and trends in inundation extent in the floodplain. The presented remote sensing based approach significantly reduces the need for the expensive and time limiting traditional physical field based

TI  - Differences of vegetation phenology monitoring by remote sensing based on different spectral vegetation indices
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation phenology is a comprehensive indictor for the responses of terrestrial ecosystem to climatic and environmental changes. Remote sensing spectrum has been widely used in the extraction of vegetation phenology information. However, there are many differences between phenology extracted by remote sensing and site observations, with their physical meaning remaining unclear. We selected one tile of MODIS data in northeastern China (2000-2014) to examine the SOS and EOS differences derived from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the simple ratio vegetation index (SR) based on both the red and near-infrared bands. The results showed that there were significant differences between NDVI-phenology and SR-phenology. SOS derived from NDVI averaged 18.9 days earlier than that from SR. EOS derived from NDVI averaged 19.0 days later than from SR. NDVI-phenology had a longer growing season. There were significant differences in the inter-annual variation of phenology from NDVI and SR. More than 20% of the pixel SOS and EOS derived from NDVI and SR showed the opposite temporal trend. These results caused by the seasonal curve characteristics and noise resistance differences of NDVI and SR. The observed data source of NDVI and SR were completely consistent, only the mathematical expressions were different, but phenology results were significantly different. Our results indicated that vegetation phenology monitoring by remote sensing is highly dependent on the mathematical expression of vegetation index. How to establish a reliable method for extracting vegetation phenology by remote sensing needs further research.

TI  - Attention Shifts Recruit the Monkey Default Mode Network
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - A unifying function associated with the default mode network (DMN), which is more active during rest than under active task conditions, has been difficult to define. The DMN is activated during monitoring the external world for unexpected events, as a sentinel, and when humans are engaged in high-level internally focused tasks. The existence of DMN correlates in other species, such as mice, challenge the idea that internally focused, high-level cognitive operations, such as introspection, autobiographical memory retrieval, planning the future, and predicting someone else's thoughts, are evolutionarily preserved defining properties of the DMN. A recent human study demonstrated that demanding cognitive shifts could recruit the DMN, yet it is unknown whether this holds for non human species. Therefore, wetested whether large changes in cognitive context would recruit DMN regions in female and male nonhuman primates. Such changes were measured as displacements of spatial attentional weights based on internal rules of relevance (spatial shifts) compared with maintaining attentional weights at the same location (stay events). Using fMRI in macaques, we detected that a cortical network, activated during shifts, largely overlapped with the DMN. Moreover, fMRI time courses sampled from independently defined DMN foci showed significant shift selectivity during the demanding attention task. Finally, functional clustering based on independent resting state data revealed that DMN and shift regions clustered conjointly, whereas regions activated during the stay events clustered apart. We therefore propose that cognitive shifting in primates generally recruits DMN regions. This might explain a breakdown of the DMN in many neurological diseases characterized by declined cognitive flexibility.

TI  - Assessment of a catastrophic rock avalanche in the West Mongolian Altai Mountains
T2  - ENGINEERING GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A giant rock avalanche that resulted in the formation of a dammed lake was discovered during geological mapping in the valley of the Dund Tsenkher Gol River, Munhkhairkhan Soum, Western Mongolian Altai. Field and satellite data (WorldView-2 and SENTINEL-1) were used to obtain a geomorphological description of the landslide and a 3D geometric reconstruction of the rock avalanche. With deposits exceeding 14 million cubic meters in volume, the rock avalanche is one of the largest catastrophic landslides in the world. The rock avalanche was controlled by tectonic setting. The slope instability was favored by the presence of NW-SE and NE-SW trending fault systems, steep foliation and morphology. The rock avalanche was likely triggered by an earthquake related to the activity of the Tolbonuur and Hovd faults. Although the area is sparsely populated, the settlement of Munhkhairkhan Soum is threatened by rockfalls or even by rock avalanches that could be triggered by future earthquakes along these faults.

TI  - Strong constraint on modelled global carbon uptake using solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence data
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate terrestrial biosphere model (TBM) simulations of gross carbon uptake (gross primary productivity - GPP) are essential for reliable future terrestrial carbon sink projections. However, uncertainties in TBM GPP estimates remain. Newly-available satellite-derived sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) data offer a promising direction for addressing this issue by constraining regional-to-global scale modelled GPP. Here, we use monthly 0.5 degrees GOME-2 SIF data from 2007 to 2011 to optimise GPP parameters of the ORCHIDEE TBM. The optimisation reduces GPP magnitude across all vegetation types except C4 plants. Global mean annual GPP therefore decreases from 194 +/- 57 PgCyr(-1) to 166 +/- 10 PgCyr(-1), bringing the model more in line with an up-scaled flux tower estimate of 133 PgCyr(-1). Strongest reductions in GPP are seen in boreal forests: the result is a shift in global GPP distribution, with a similar to 50% increase in the tropical to boreal productivity ratio. The optimisation resulted in a greater reduction in GPP than similar ORCHIDEE parameter optimisation studies using satellite-derived NDVI from MODIS and eddy covariance measurements of net CO2 fluxes from the FLUXNET network. Our study shows that SIF data will be instrumental in constraining TBM GPP estimates, with a consequent improvement in global carbon cycle projections.

AB  - We present a case of cisplatin-induced syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) in a patient with metastatic recurrent urothelial carcinoma. Cisplatin-induced SIADH is an uncommon but potentially life-threatening toxicity. Pharmacogenetic characteristics may result in different toxicity profiles in different populations. With such widespread use of cisplatin in a diverse range of cancers, prompt recognition is crucial to detect and prevent severe neurological sequelae.

TI  - The hidden ecological resource of andic soils in mountain ecosystems: evidence from Italy
T2  - SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Andic soils have unique morphological, physical, and chemical properties that induce both considerable soil fertility and great vulnerability to land degradation. Moreover, they are the most striking mineral soils in terms of large organic C storage and long C residence time. This is especially related to the presence of poorly crystalline clay minerals and metal-humus complexes. Recognition of andic soils is then very important.Here we attempt to show, through a combined analysis of 35 sampling points chosen in accordance to specific physical and vegetation rules, that some andic soils have an utmost ecological importance.More specifically, in Italian non-volcanic mountain ecosystems (> 600 m a.s.l.) combining low slope (< 21 %) and highly active green biomass (high NDVI values) and in agreement to recent findings, we found the widespread occurrence of andic soils having distinctive physical and hydrological properties including low bulk density and remarkably high water retention. Most importantly, we report a demonstration of the ability of these soils to affect ecosystem functions by analysing their influence on the timescale acceleration of photosynthesis estimated by NDVI measurements.Our results are hoped to be a starting point for better understanding of the ecological importance of andic soils and also possibly to better consider pedological information in C balance calculations.

TI  - Monitoring cotton root rot by synthetic Sentinel-2 NDVI time series using improved spatial and temporal data fusion
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - To better understand the progression of cotton root rot within the season, time series monitoring is required. In this study, an improved spatial and temporal data fusion approach (ISTDFA) was employed to combine 250-m Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Different Vegetation Index (NDVI) and 10-m Sentinetl-2 NDVI data to generate a synthetic Sentinel-2 NDVI time series for monitoring this disease. Then, the phenology of healthy cotton and infected cotton was modeled using a logistic model. Finally, several phenology parameters, including the onset day of greenness minimum (OGM), growing season length (GLS), onset of greenness increase (OGI), max NDVI value, and integral area of the phenology curve, were calculated. The results showed that ISTDFA could be used to combine time series MODIS and Sentinel-2 NDVI data with a correlation coefficient of 0.893. The logistic model could describe the phenology curves with R-squared values from 0.791 to 0.969. Moreover, the phenology curve of infected cotton showed a significant difference from that of healthy cotton. The max NDVI value, OGM, GSL and the integral area of the phenology curve for infected cotton were reduced by 0.045, 30 days, 22 days, and 18.54%, respectively, compared with those for healthy cotton.

TI  - Modelling ocean-colour-derived chlorophyll <i>a</i>
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article provides a proof of concept for using a biogeochemical/ecosystem/optical model with a radiative transfer component as a laboratory to explore aspects of ocean colour. We focus here on the satellite ocean colour chlorophyll a (Chl a) product provided by the often-used blue/green reflectance ratio algorithm. The model produces output that can be compared directly to the real-world ocean colour remotely sensed reflectance. This model output can then be used to produce an ocean colour satellite-like Chl a product using an algorithm linking the blue versus green reflectance similar to that used for the real world. Given that the model includes complete knowledge of the (model) water constituents, optics and reflectance, we can explore uncertainties and their causes in this proxy for Chl a (called "derived Chl a "in this paper). We compare the derived Chl a to the "actual" model Chl a field. In the model we find that the mean absolute bias due to the algorithm is 22% between derived and actual Chl a. The real-world algorithm is found using concurrent in situ measurement of Chl a and radiometry. We ask whether increased in situ measurements to train the algorithm would improve the algorithm, and find a mixed result. There is a global overall improvement, but at the expense of some regions, especially in lower latitudes where the biases increase. Not surprisingly, we find that regions-pecific algorithms provide a significant improvement, at least in the annual mean. However, in the model, we find that no matter how the algorithm coefficients are found there can be a temporal mismatch between the derived Chl a and the actual Chl a. These mismatches stem from temporal decoupling between Chl a and other optically important water detrital matter). The degree of decoupling differs regionally and over time. For example, in many highly seasonal regions, the timing of initiation and peak of the spring bloom in the derived Chl a lags the actual Chl a by days and sometimes weeks. These results indicate that care should also be taken when studying phenology through satellite-derived products of Chl a. This study also reemphasizes that ocean-colour-derived Chl a is not the same as the real in situ Chl a. In fact the model derived Chl a compares better to real-world satellite-derived Chl a than the model actual Chl a. Modellers should keep this is mind when evaluating model output with ocean colour Chl a and in particular when assimilating this product. Our goal is to illustrate the use of a numerical laboratory that (a) helps users of ocean colour, particularly modellers, gain further understanding of the products they use and (b) helps the ocean colour community to explore other ocean colour products, their biases and uncertainties, as well as to aid in future algorithm development.

TI  - Gross and net land cover changes in the main plant functional types derived from the annual ESA CCI land cover maps (1992-2015)
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-use and land-cover change (LULCC) impacts local energy and water balance and contributes on global scale to a net carbon emission to the atmosphere. The newly released annual ESA CCI (climate change initiative) land cover maps provide continuous land cover changes at 300 m resolution from 1992 to 2015, and can be used in land surface models (LSMs) to simulate LULCC effects on carbon stocks and on surface energy budgets. Here we investigate the absolute areas and gross and net changes in different plant functional types (PFTs) derived from ESA CCI products. The results are compared with other datasets. Global areas of forest, cropland and grassland PFTs from ESA are 30.4, 19.3 and 35.7 million km(2) in the year 2000. The global forest area is lower than that from LUH2v2h (Hurtt et al., 2011), Hansen et al. (2013) or Houghton and Nassikas (2017) while cropland area is higher than LUH2v2h (Hurtt et al., 2011), in which cropland area is from HYDE 3.2 (Klein Goldewijk et al., 2016). Gross forest loss and gain during 1992-2015 are 1.5 and 0.9 million km(2) respectively, resulting in a net forest loss of 0.6 million km(2), mainly occurring in South and Central America. The magnitudes of gross changes in forest, cropland and grassland PFTs in the ESA CCI are smaller than those in other datasets. The magnitude of global net cropland gain for the whole period is consistent with HYDE 3.2 (Klein Goldewijk et al., 2016), but most of the increases happened before 2004 in ESA and after 2007 in HYDE 3.2. Brazil, Bolivia and Indonesia are the countries with the largest net forest loss from 1992 to 2015, and the decreased areas are generally consistent with those from Hansen et al. (2013) based on Landsat 30 m resolution images. Despite discrepancies compared to other datasets, and uncertainties in converting into PFTs, the new ESA CCI products provide the first detailed long-term time series of land-cover change and can be implemented in LSMs to characterize recent carbon dynamics, and in climate models to simulate land-cover change feedbacks on climate. The annual ESA CCI land cover products can be downloaded from http://maps.elie.ucl.ac.be/CCI/viewer/download.php (Land Cover Maps - v2.0.7; see details in Sect. 5). The PFT map translation protocol and an example in 2000 can be downloaded from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.834229. The annual ESA CCI PFT maps from 1992 to 2015 at 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees resolution can also be downloaded from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1048163.

TI  - Central distractors in Force Concept Inventory data
T2  - PHYSICAL REVIEW PHYSICS EDUCATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Force Concept Inventory was designed to poll the Newtonian conception of force. While there are many in-depth studies analyzing response data that look at the structure of the correct answers, we believe that the incorrect answers also carry revealing information about the students' worldview. The inventory was originally designed so that the "distractors" in each question reflected commonly held misconceptions, and thus the rate at which students guess the correct answer is very low. Students select incorrect answers that correspond to the misconception that they hold and there are very few responses which appear obviously wrong to students. A side effect of this approach is that the incorrect responses reflect the non-Newtonian worldviews held by students. These non-Newtonian worldviews are coherent and robust, and this, at least in part, helps to explain why these misconceptions are so resistant to instruction. In this study we focus once more on the misconception data in Force Concept Inventory responses, particularly on the linkages between these misconceptions. We hypothesize that there are distinct groupings of distractor items formed by the strength of the association between these items. The two largest groupings are associated with the "impetus" world view in which the motion of an object is determined by the quantity of impetus which that object contains. We find that certain central items hold particularly important places in these groupings and also that individual groupings may be connected to each other by "connector" items. We finally suggest that, on the basis of this study, that these non-Newtonian worldviews might best be dismantled by addressing these key central and connector items.

TI  - Urban Heat Island Over Delhi Punches Holes in Widespread Fog in the Indo-Gangetic Plains
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Persistent and widespread fog affects several densely populated and agriculturally fertile basins around the world. Dense and polluted fog is especially known to impact transportation, air quality, and public health. Here we report a striking observation of holes in fog over urban areas in satellite imagery. The extent of fog holes appear highly correlated with city populations in fog-prevalent regions of Asia, Europe, and the United States. We find the highest frequency and largest extent of fog holes over Delhi along with suppressed fog fraction, amidst increased fog occurrence over the Indo-Gangetic Plains, based on 17 years of satellite data (2000-2016). This apparent urban heat impact is characterized in sharp urban-rural gradients in surface temperatures and fog thickness. Urban heating seems to have already amplified the long-term fog decline in Europe and the United States and should be assessed over regions undergoing urban expansion including India, where no previous linkages are reported between urban heating and fog.

TI  - The Meandering Margin of the Meteorological Moist Tropics
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Bimodally distributed column water vapor (CWV) indicates a well-defined moist regime in the Tropics, above a margin value near 48 kg m(-2) in current climate (about 80% of column saturation). Maps reveal this margin as a meandering, sinuous synoptic contour bounding broad plateaus of the moist regime. Within these plateaus, convective storms of distinctly smaller convective and mesoscales occur sporadically. Satellite data composites across the poleward most margin reveal its sharpness, despite the crude averaging: precipitation doubles within 100 km, marked by both enhancement and deepening of cloudiness. Transported patches and filaments of the moist regime cause consequential precipitation events within and beyond the Tropics. Distinguishing synoptic flows that cross the margin from flows that move the margin is made possible by a novel satellite-based Lagrangian CWV tendency estimate. Climate models do not reliably reproduce the observed bimodal distribution, so studying the moist mode's maintenance processes and the margin-zone air mass transformations, guided by the Lagrangian tendency product, might importantly constrain model moist process treatments.Plain Language Summary Satellite snapshots indicate that tropical column-integrated water vapor (CWV) in the atmosphere has broad, almost-uniform moist regions, with sharp edges or margins that meander and move. This structure comprises a bimodal frequency distribution, an important qualitative distinction that justifies the term "regime." Deep convective storms and rainfall are largely confined inside the moist regime, where they are quite sporadic. In some places, the margin of the moist regime is observed to be moved by the wind, but in other places the wind flows across the margin, with air columns undergoing a rapid moistening as they cross the narrow marginal zone. The continued maintenance of this quasi-uniform vapor regime (despite spotty, intense losses in rain events), and of the sharpness of its margins, implies that convective and dynamical processes act in very concerted ways. We show that this concerted process coupling is nontrivial, since current climate models variously lack or exaggerate the bimodality of the CWV frequency distribution. A new data set for identifying regions of cross-margin flows (air column transformations) is offered.

TI  - Reexamining the Nonlinear Moisture-Precipitation Relationship Over the Tropical Oceans
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Bretherton et al. (2004) used the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) version 5 product to derive an exponential curve that describes the relationship between precipitation and column relative humidity (CRH) over the tropical oceans. The curve, which features a precipitation pickup at a CRH of about 0.75 and a rapid increase of precipitation with CRH after the pickup, has been widely used in the studies of the tropical atmosphere. This study reexamines the moisture-precipitation relationship by using the version 7 SSM/I data, in which several biases in the previous version are corrected, and evaluates the relationship in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) models. In the revised exponential curve derived using the updated satellite data, the precipitation pickup occurs at a higher CRH (similar to 0.8), and precipitation increases more slowly with CRH than in the previous curve. In most CMIP5 models, the precipitation pickup is too early due to the common model bias of overestimated (underestimated) precipitation in the dry (wet) regime.

TI  - Chlorophyll Fluorescence Better Captures Seasonal and Interannual Gross Primary Productivity Dynamics Across Dryland Ecosystems of Southwestern North America
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing provides unmatched spatiotemporal information on vegetation gross primary productivity (GPP). Yet understanding of the relationship between GPP and remote sensing observations and how it changes with factors such as scale, biophysical constraint, and vegetation type remains limited. This knowledge gap is especially apparent for dryland ecosystems, which have characteristic high spatiotemporal variability and are under-represented by long-term field measurements. Here we utilize an eddy covariance (EC) data synthesis for southwestern North America in an assessment of how accurately satellite-derived vegetation proxies capture seasonal to interannual GPP dynamics across dryland gradients. We evaluate the enhanced vegetation index, solar-induced fluorescence (SIF), and the photochemical reflectivity index. We find evidence that SIF is more accurately capturing seasonal GPP dynamics particularly for evergreen-dominated EC sites and more accurately estimating the full magnitude of interannual GPP dynamics for all dryland EC sites. These results suggest that incorporation of SIF could significantly improve satellite-based GPP estimates.

TI  - Moisture Balance Over the Iberian Peninsula According to a Regional Climate Model: The Impact of 3DVAR Data Assimilation
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - An analysis of the atmospheric branch of the hydrological cycle by means of a 15km resolution numerical integration performed using Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) nested in ERA Interim is presented. Two WRF experiments covering the period 2010-2014 were prepared. The first one (N) was configured as in standard numerical downscaling experiments. The second one (D), with the same parameterizations, included a step of 3DVAR data assimilation every 6h. Apart from comparing our results with ERA Interim data, several observational data sets were used to validate the precipitable water (radiosondes and MODIS data), precipitation (EOBS, ECA&D, TRMM, and GPCP), or evaporation (GLEAM). The verification results showed that the D experiment systematically performs better than N and in many instances, too, better than the forcing reanalysis. According to the results, the leading terms of the water balance are the tendency of the precipitable water, the divergence of moisture flux, evaporation, and precipitation. No spatial patterns were recognizable for the annual accumulated evaporation, but the effect of the Atlantic fronts was detected in the precipitation patterns. The transboundary moisture fluxes through the contour of the Iberian Peninsula behave differently depending on the season during 2010-2014. During winter, they show a net moisture import through the boundaries. During spring, summer, or autumn moisture is exported specially through the Mediterranean coast, and only during midday, this feature is reversed due to sea breezes.

TI  - Performance of Optimally Merged Multisatellite Precipitation Products Using the Dynamic Bayesian Model Averaging Scheme Over the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of precipitation from satellites at high spatiotemporal scales over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) remains a challenge. In this study, we proposed a general framework for blending multiple satellite precipitation data using the dynamic Bayesian model averaging (BMA) algorithm. The blended experiment was performed at a daily 0.25 degrees grid scale for 2007-2012 among Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) 3B42RT and 3B42V7, Climate Prediction Center MORPHing technique (CMORPH), and Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate Data Record (PERSIANN-CDR). First, the BMA weights were optimized using the expectation-maximization (EM) method for each member on each day at 200 calibrated sites and then interpolated to the entire plateau using the ordinary kriging (OK) approach. Thus, the merging data were produced by weighted sums of the individuals over the plateau. The dynamic BMA approach showed better performance with a smaller root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 6.77mm/day, higher correlation coefficient of 0.592, and closer Euclid value of 0.833, compared to the individuals at 15 validated sites. Moreover, BMA has proven to be more robust in terms of seasonality, topography, and other parameters than traditional ensemble methods including simple model averaging (SMA) and one-outlier removed (OOR). Error analysis between BMA and the state-of-the-art IMERG in the summer of 2014 further proved that the performance of BMA was superior with respect to multisatellite precipitation data merging. This study demonstrates that BMA provides a new solution for blending multiple satellite data in regions with limited gauges.

TI  - An Evaluation of the Shortwave Direct Aerosol Radiative Forcing Using CALIOP and MODIS Observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, all-sky ShortWave Direct Aerosol Radiative Forcing (SWDARF) at the top of atmosphere is estimated using the method of Oikawa et al. (2013) applied to two generations of Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) Level 2 products, i.e., version 2 (V2) and version 3 (V3), and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) cloud product. The estimated SWDARF in Oikawa et al. (2013) was based on CALIPSO V2 product, which contained significant errors in cloud clearing and low-altitude aerosols. This error was corrected in V3, resulting in greatly improved and significantly different aerosol and cloud distributions. In clear-sky conditions, the magnitude of aerosol optical thickness underestimation becomes smaller and SWDARF becomes more negative using the V3 product. In addition, above-cloud aerosols, which cause positive SWDARF, are less frequently detected and below-cloud aerosols are more frequently detected in the V3 product than in the V2 product, so that cloudy-sky SWDARF becomes more negative using the V3 product. From these results, clear-sky, cloudy-sky, and all-sky SWDARFs become more negative using the V3 product than the V2 product. The magnitude of negative SWDARF using the V3 product is more than twice as large as the V2 product under all-sky conditions due to V3 improvements in the lidar retrieval algorithms. Considering the uncertainties of aerosol and cloud measurements, annual zonal averages of clear-sky, cloudy-sky, and all-sky SWDARFs from 60 degrees S to 60 degrees N are estimated as -4.00.2, -1.10.3, and -2.10.2Wm(-2) from the V3 product.

TI  - Cirrus Cloud Optical Thickness and Effective Diameter Retrieved by MODIS: Impacts of Single Habit Assumption, 3-D Radiative Effects, and Cloud Inhomogeneity
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - For inhomogeneous cirrus clouds, cloud optical thickness (COT) and effective diameter (De) provided by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) Collection 6 cloud products are associated with errors due to the single habit assumption (SHA), independent pixel assumption (IPA), photon absorption effect (PAE), and plane-parallel assumption (PPA). SHA means that every cirrus cloud is assumed to have the same shape habit of ice crystals. IPA errors are caused by three-dimensional (3D) radiative effects. PPA and PAE errors are caused by cloud inhomogeneity. We proposed a method to single out these different errors. These errors were examined using the Spherical Harmonics Discrete Ordinate Method simulations done for the MODIS 0.86m and 2.13m bands. Four midlatitude and tropical cirrus cases were studied. For the COT retrieval, the impacts of SHA and IPA were especially large for optically thick cirrus cases. SHA errors in COT varied distinctly with scattering angles. For the De retrieval, SHA decreased De under most circumstances. PAE decreased De for optically thick cirrus cases. For the COT and De retrievals, the dominant error source was SHA for overhead sun whereas for oblique sun, it could be any of SHA, IPA, and PAE, varying with cirrus cases and sun-satellite viewing geometries. On the domain average, the SHA errors in COT (De) were within -16.1%-42.6% (-38.7%-2.0%), whereas the 3-D radiative effects- and cloud inhomogeneity-induced errors in COT (De) were within -5.6%-19.6% (-2.9%-8.0%) and -2.6%-0% (-3.7%-9.8%), respectively.

TI  - Estimation of degree of sea ice ridging based on dual-polarized C-band SAR data
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - For ship navigation in the Baltic Sea ice, parameters such as ice edge, ice concentration, ice thickness and degree of ridging are usually reported daily in manually prepared ice charts. These charts provide icebreakers with essential information for route optimization and fuel calculations. However, manual ice charting requires long analysis times, and detailed analysis of large areas (e.g. Arctic Ocean) is not feasible. Here, we propose a method for automatic estimation of the degree of ice ridging in the Baltic Sea region, based on RADARSAT-2 C-band dual-polarized (HH/HV channels) SAR texture features and sea ice concentration information extracted from Finnish ice charts. The SAR images were first segmented and then several texture features were extracted for each segment. Using the random forest method, we classified them into four classes of ridging intensity and compared them to the reference data extracted from the digitized ice charts. The overall agreement between the ice-chart-based degree of ice ridging and the automated results varied monthly, being 83, 63 and 81% in January, February and March 2013, respectively. The correspondence between the degree of ice ridging reported in the ice charts and the actual ridge density was validated with data collected during a field campaign in March 2011. In principle the method can be applied to the seasonal sea ice regime in the Arctic Ocean.

TI  - Classification of rare land cover types: Distinguishing annual and perennial crops in an agricultural catchment in South Korea
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Many environmental data are inherently imbalanced, with some majority land use and land cover types dominating over rare ones. In cultivated ecosystems minority classes are often the target as they might indicate a beginning land use change. Most standard classifiers perform best on a balanced distribution of classes, and fail to detect minority classes. We used the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) with Random Forest to classify land cover classes in a small agricultural catchment in South Korea using MODIS time series. This area faces a major soil erosion problem and policy measures encourage farmers to replace annual by perennial crops to mitigate this issue. Our major goal was therefore to improve the classification performance on annual and perennial crops. We compared four different classification scenarios on original imbalanced and synthetically oversampled balanced data to quantify the effect of SMOTE on classification performance. SMOTE substantially increased the true positive rate of all oversampled minority classes. However, the performance on minor classes remained lower than on the majority class. We attribute this result to a class overlap already present in the original data set that is not resolved by SMOTE. Our results show that resampling algorithms could help to derive more accurate land use and land cover maps from freely available data. These maps can be used to provide information on the distribution of land use classes in heterogeneous agricultural areas and could potentially benefit decision making.

TI  - Fungal diversity in oil palm leaves showing symptoms of Fatal Yellowing disease
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) is an excellent source of vegetable oil for biodiesel production; however, there are still some limitations for its cultivation in Brazil such as Fatal Yellowing (FY) disease. FY has been studied for many years, but its causal agent has never been determined. In Colombia and nearby countries, it was reported that the causal agent of Fatal Yellowing (Pudricio A n del Cogollo) is the oomycete Phytophthora palmivora, however, several authors claim that Fatal Yellowing and Pudricio A n del Cogollo (PC) are different diseases. The major aims of this work were to test, using molecular biology tools, Brazilian oil palm trees for the co-occurrence of the oomycete Phytophthora and FY symptoms, and to characterize the fungal diversity in FY diseased and healthy leaves by next generation sequencing. Investigation with specific primers for the genus Phytophthora showed amplification in only one of the samples. Analysis of the fungal ITS region demonstrated that, at the genus level, different groups predominated in all symptomatic samples, while Pyrenochaetopsis and unclassified fungi predominated in all asymptomatic samples. Our results show that fungal communities were not the same between samples at the same stage of the disease or among all the symptomatic samples. This is the first study that describes the evolution of the microbial community in the course of plant disease and also the first work to use high throughput next generation sequencing to evaluate the fungal community associated with leaves of oil palm trees with and without symptoms of FY.

TI  - Detection of damaged areas caused by the oil extraction in a steppe region using winter landsat imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil production in a steppe region disturbs the landscape and damages the steppe ecosystem. The objective of this research was to detect areas damaged by oil production in an oil field within the Russian Volga-Ural steppe region using winter Landsat imagery. We developed a practicable and effective approach using winter snow season multispectral Landsat satellite imagery. To this end, we applied seven algorithms of spectral or texture-based transformation: K-means, maximum likelihood estimation, topsoil grain size index, soil brightness, normalized differential snow index, tasselled cap, and co-occurrence measures. The co-occurrence texture measure variance shows the optimal result of identifying damaged areas. The unique feature of our method is that it can differentiate damaged areas from the bare soil of cropland within a cold steppe region where the area damaged by oil production is mixed with bare (fallow) croplands that have a polygonal shape similar to well pads. Such similarities can lead to confusion in object-based classification. Using the co-occurrence measures, we found that from 1988 to 2015, damaged area is nearly three times as big in the peak period of the oil field development (2001 and 2009) as in 1988. Landscape fragmentation also peaked in 2001 and 2009. Our approach for this project is useful and cost effective regular monitoring of damages from oil production for both the Volga-Ural steppe region and other cold steppe regions.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Variations of Vegetation Coverage in Taihu Lake Basin From 2004 to 2014
T2  - Journal of Ecology and Rural Environment
M3  - Article
AB  - As is well known, the Taihu Lake Basin is always one of the regions relatively well-developed in economy in China. With the region developing rapidly in economy, growing in population and rising in urbanization level, the forest ecosystem therein has been deteriorating seriously. Therefore, it is very important for us to study changes in spatial pattern of its vegetation cover and their influencing factors, so as to lay down certain basis for formulating scientific sustainable development programs for the basin. Relevant MODSI-NDVI data available were analyzed using the dimidiate pixel model, variation coefficient, linear trend analysis, principal component analysis and some other analysis methods to characterize changes in spatio-temporal pattern of the vegetation cover of the basin, and trends and influential factors of the changes from 2004 to 2014. Results show: (1) In the past 11 years from 2004 to 2014, the vegetation cover, on the whole, was on a significant declining trend, with a rate being 2.6% . (10 a)(-1). Its mean dropped from 0.606 5 in 2004 to 0.594 2 in 2014, or by 2.03%; (2) The spatial distribution of the vegetation cover in the basin exhibited a downward trend from the southwest to the east, and varied the most drastically in the east, less in the north and west, and the least in the southwest; (3) The areas with vegetation cover seriously degraded accounted for 35.08% of the total of the basin in area, while those with vegetation cover obviously improved accounted for 40.00% and were mostly distributed in the southwest and east and rarely in northwest; and (4) The decrease in the vegetation cover of the basin was attributed mainly to the joint effect of the increases in precipitation, population and economic development. And human activities had dual effects on vegetation cover. It is, therefore, essential for the Taihu Lake Basin to control the population growth, optimize the employment structure, and accelerate the construction of ecological civilization and vegetation restoration, for the purpose of mitigating the detrimental effect of population and industrial development on the vegetation, enhancing citizens' environmental protection consciousness, and reducing destruction of the ecological environment.

TI  - Local amplification of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N8 viruses in wild birds in the Netherlands, 2016 to 2017
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses of subtype H5N8 were re-introduced into the Netherlands by late 2016, after detections in southeast Asia and Russia. This second H5N8 wave resulted in a large number of outbreaks in poultry farms and the deaths of large numbers of wild birds in multiple European countries. Methods: Here we report on the detection of HPAI H5N8 virus in 57 wild birds of 12 species sampled during active (32/5,167) and passive (25/36) surveillance activities, i.e. in healthy and dead animals respectively, in the Netherlands between 8 November 2016 and 31 March 2017. Moreover, we further investigate the experimental approach of wild bird serology as a contributing tool in HPAI outbreak investigations. Results: In contrast to the first H5N8 wave, local virus amplification with associated wild bird mortality has occurred in the Netherlands in 2016/17, with evidence for occasional gene exchange with low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses. Discussion: These apparent differences between outbreaks and the continuing detections of HPAI viruses in Europe are a cause of concern. With the current circulation of zoonotic HPAI and LPAI virus strains in Asia, increased understanding of the drivers responsible for the global spread of Asian poultry viruses via wild birds is needed.

TI  - Firewalls Prevent Systemic Dissemination of Vectors Derived from Human Adenovirus Type 5 and Suppress Production of Transgene-Encoded Antigen in a Murine Model of Oral Vaccination
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR AND INFECTION MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - To define the bottlenecks that restrict antigen expression after oral administration of viral-vectored vaccines, we tracked vectors derived from the human adenovirus type 5 at whole body, tissue, and cellular scales throughout the digestive tract in a murine model of oral delivery. After intragastric administration of vectors encoding firefly luciferase or a model antigen, detectable levels of transgene-encoded protein or mRNA were confined to the intestine, and restricted to delimited anatomical zones. Expression of luciferase in the form of multiple small bioluminescent foci in the distal ileum, cecum, and proximal colon suggested multiple crossing points. Many foci were unassociated with visible Peyer's patches, implying that transduced cells lay in proximity to villous rather than follicle-associated epithelium, as supported by detection of transgene-encoded antigen in villous epithelial cells. Transgene-encoded mRNA but not protein was readily detected in Peyer's patches, suggesting that post-transcriptional regulation of viral gene expression might limit expression of transgene-encoded antigen in this tissue. To characterize the pathways by which the vector crossed the intestinal epithelium and encountered sentinel cells, a fluorescent-labeled vector was administered to mice by the intragastric route or inoculated into ligated intestinal loops comprising a Peyer's patch. The vector adhered selectively to microfold cells in the follicle-associated epithelium, and, after translocation to the subepithelial dome region, was captured by phagocytes that expressed CD11c and lysozyme. In conclusion, although a large number of crossing events took place throughout the intestine within and without Peyer's patches, multiple firewalls prevented systemic dissemination of vector and suppressed production of transgene-encoded protein in Peyer's patches.

TI  - Another Case of Interdigital Located "Metastasing Hematoma"?
T2  - Open access Macedonian journal of medical sciences
M3  - Case Reports
AB  - Interdigital spaces could be an area of affection of a various cutaneous conditions, most of them with benign origin. The spectrum of differential diagnosis of pigmented interdigital lesions with a recent occurrence is not so wide, in contrast. When considering pigmented lesions in the interdigital area, the most harmless differential diagnosis is a traumatic hematoma. But what would happen if we based our therapeutic behaviour or suspicious and unconfirmed harmless diagnosis, instead of considering the real life-threatening once with priority, if we kept in mind that acral lentiginous melanoma has rather an aggressive course and is the main cause of death in skin cancer patients? We present a case of misdiagnosed interdigital melanoma, treated as a hemangioma with curettage, with almost fatal consequences, in regard to uncontrolled tumor progression as a result of the wrong traumatic procedure in one hand, and the lack of adequate screening and follow up, leading to progress of the disease with lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis in general. We want to emphasise the importance of acral lentiginous melanoma with an unusual location in the differential diagnostic plan because, despite the early detection, early eradication with simple excision could save a life, or at least could provide a better prognosis.

TI  - Study of Aerosol Direct Radiation Effects in the Yangtze River Delta Based on MODIS Data
T2  - Journal of Ecology and Rural Environment
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on relevant MODIS data and the 6S atmospheric radiation transfer model, aerosol direct radiation effects (ADRE) on the surface of the Yangtze River Delta and the top layer of the atmosphere were simulated and calculated, and then validated for accuracy with reference to the measured data by CE-318 of the Beichen Building Station of the Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology. On such a basis, analysis was conducted of spatio-temporal distribution of ADRE in the Yangtze River Delta region, Results show that the MODIS data could be used to inverse ADRE on land surface and on top of the atmosphere with results approximate to the measured data, reaching 0.92 and 0.95 in fitting accuracy (R-2). In terms of spatial distribution and variation, ADREs on land surface (-31. 60--20. 54 W . m(-2)) and on top of the atmosphere (-3. 48--2. 61 W . m(-2)) tended to be similar with absolute values being high in the north and lower towards the south. The ADREs in Suzhou, Wuxi and Changzhou of South Jiangsu increased significantly; In terms of temporal variation, absolute ADREs fluctuated downwards year by year, varying in the range of -21. 78--5. 94 and -2.45-0. 73 W . m(-2), respectively, on land surface and on top of the atmosphere, and varied quite significantly with the season in Jiangsu and Shanghai and relatively less in Zhejiang in the range of -10-0 W . m(-2) on land surface and -1-0 W . m(-2) on top of the atmosphere.

TI  - Multiband nonthermal radiative properties of pulsar wind nebulae
T2  - ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims. The nonthermal radiative properties of 18 pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) are studied in the 1D leptonic model.Methods. The dynamical and radiative evolution of a PWN in a nonradiative supernova remnant are self-consistently investigated in this model. The leptons (electrons/positrons) are injected with a broken power-law form, and nonthermal emission from a PWN is mainly produced by time-dependent relativistic leptons through synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton process.Results. Observed spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of all 18 PWNe are reproduced well, where the indexes of low-energy electron components lie in the range of 1.0-1.8 and those of high-energy electron components in the range of 2.1-3.1. Our results show that F-X/F-gamma > 10 for young PWNe; 1 < F-X/F-gamma <= 10 for evolved PWNe, except for G292.0 + 1.8; and F-X/F-gamma <= 1 for mature/old PWNe, except for CTA 1. Moreover, most PWNe are particle-dominated. Statistical analysis for the sample of 14 PWNe further indicate that (1) not all pulsar parameters have correlations with electron injection parameters, but electron maximum energy and PWN magnetic field correlate with the magnetic field at the light cylinder, the potential difference at the polar cap, and the spin-down power; (2) the spin-down power positively correlates with radio, X-ray, bolometric, and synchrotron luminosities, but does not correlate with gamma-ray luminosity; (3) the spin-down power positively correlates with radio, X-ray, and gamma-band surface brightness; and (4) the PWN radius and the PWN age negatively correlate with X-ray luminosity, the ratio of X-ray to gamma-ray luminosities, and the synchrotron luminosity.

TI  - Spatial characterization of long-term hydrological change in the Arkavathy watershed adjacent to Bangalore, India
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The complexity and heterogeneity of human water use over large spatial areas and decadal timescales can impede the understanding of hydrological change, particularly in regions with sparse monitoring of the water cycle. In the Arkavathy watershed in southern India, surface water inflows to major reservoirs decreased over a 40-year period during which urbanization, groundwater depletion, modification of the river network, and changes in agricultural practices also occurred. These multiple, interacting drivers combined with limited hydrological monitoring make attribution of the causes of diminishing water resources in the watershed challenging and impede effective policy responses. To mitigate these challenges, we developed a novel, spatially distributed dataset to understand hydrological change by characterizing the residual trends in surface water extent that remain after controlling for precipitation variations and comparing the trends with historical land use maps to assess human drivers of change. Using an automated classification approach with subpixel unmixing, we classified water extent in nearly 1700 man-made lakes, or tanks, in Landsat images from 1973 to 2010. The classification results compared well with a reference dataset of water extent of tanks (R-2 = 0.95). We modeled the water extent of 42 clusters of tanks in a multiple regression on simple hydrological covariates (including precipitation) and time. Inter-annual variability in precipitation accounted for 63% of the predicted variability in water extent. However, precipitation did not exhibit statistically significant trends in any part of the watershed. After controlling for precipitation variability, we found statistically significant temporal trends in water extent, both positive and negative, in 13 of the clusters. Based on a water balance argument, we inferred that these trends likely reflect a non-stationary relationship between precipitation and watershed runoff. Independently of precipitation, water extent increased in a region downstream of Bangalore, likely due to increased urban effluents, and declined in the northern portion of the Arkavathy. Comparison of the drying trends with land use indicated that they were most strongly associated with irrigated agriculture, sourced almost exclusively by groundwater. This suggests that groundwater abstraction was a major driver of hydrological change in this watershed. Disaggregating the watershed-scale hydrological response via remote sensing of surface water bodies over multiple decades yielded a spatially resolved characterization of hydrological change in an otherwise poorly monitored watershed. This approach presents an opportunity to understand hydrological change in heavily managed watersheds where surface water bodies integrate upstream runoff and can be delineated using satellite imagery.

TI  - Management breaks the natural productivity-biodiversity relationship in forests and grassland: an opinion
T2  - FOREST ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Two approaches mark the difference between the "ecological" and "agricultural" view of the biodiversity/growth relation. In ecology the trend is averaged by taking monocultures of all species as baseline to evaluate mixtures. This contrasts the "agricultural" view focusing on the most productive species or species combination as baseline to evaluate mixtures. The present study investigates the change of highest rates (maximum) productivities in grasslands and forests with increasing plant (or tree) diversity, and compares these with the average response.Methods: We base our analysis on existing published datasets relating the growth of plant stands (growth rate per land area) to the diversity on the same plot. We use a global dataset (Ellis et al. 2012 and MODIS-data, see Fig. 1), the grassland experiment in Jena (Buchmann et al. 2017), the regional study on forests in Romania and Germany by Bouriaud et al. (2016), and data from the German National Forest inventory (BWI 3, see Fig. 3). In all cases the average response of growth to changes in biodiversity as well as the boundary line of the maximum values was calculated.Results: In both vegetation types a decreasing trend of maximum productivity with any added species emerges, contrasting the average trend that was positive in grassland, but absent in forests. The trend of maximum values was non-significant in grasslands probably due to the fact that not all combinations of species mixtures were available. In temperate forests, maximum productivity decreases significantly by about 10% in regional studies and by 8% at national scale with each added species. Maximum biomass per area was the same for managed and unmanaged conditions. A global assessment of NPP and biodiversity could also not confirm a general positive biodiversity productivity relationship.Conclusions: Managed grasslands and forests reach highest productivity and volumes at low diversity. Also globally we could not confirm a biodiversity effect on productivity. Despite this, for long-living organisms, such as trees, the incentive for land managers exists to reduce the risk of failure due to climate extremes and diseases by taking a loss in productivity into account and to actively maintain a mixture of species.

TI  - Minimum aerosol layer detection sensitivities and their subsequent impacts on aerosol optical thickness retrievals in CALIPSO level 2 data products
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to instrument sensitivities and algorithm detection limits, level 2 (L2) Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) 532 nm aerosol extinction profile retrievals are often populated with retrieval fill values (RFVs), which indicate the absence of detectable levels of aerosol within the profile. In this study, using 4 years (2007-2008 and 2010-2011) of CALIOP version 3 L2 aerosol data, the occurrence frequency of daytime CALIOP profiles containing all RFVs (all-RFV profiles) is studied. In the CALIOP data products, the aerosol optical thickness (AOT) of any all-RFV profile is reported as being zero, which may introduce a bias in CALIOP-based AOT climatologies. For this study, we derive revised estimates of AOT for all-RFV profiles using collocated Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Dark Target (DT) and, where available, AErosol RObotic NEtwork (AERONET) data. Globally, all-RFV profiles comprise roughly 71% of all daytime CALIOP L2 aerosol profiles (i.e., including completely attenuated profiles), accounting for nearly half (45 %) of all daytime cloud-free L2 aerosol profiles. The mean collocated MODIS DT (AERONET) 550 nm AOT is found to be near 0.06 (0.08) for CALIOP all-RFV profiles. We further estimate a global mean aerosol extinction profile, a so-called "noise floor", for CALIOP all-RFV profiles. The global mean CALIOP AOT is then recomputed by replacing RFV values with the derived noise-floor values for both all-RFV and non-all-RFV profiles. This process yields an improvement in the agreement of CALIOP and MODIS over-ocean AOT.

TI  - Ensemble-based assimilation of fractional snow-covered area satellite retrievals to estimate the snow distribution at Arctic sites
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - With its high albedo, low thermal conductivity and large water storing capacity, snow strongly modulates the surface energy and water balance, which makes it a critical factor in mid- to high-latitude and mountain environments. However, estimating the snow water equivalent (SWE) is challenging in remote-sensing applications already at medium spatial resolutions of 1km. We present an ensemble-based data assimilation framework that estimates the peak subgrid SWE distribution (SSD) at the 1km scale by assimilating fractional snow-covered area (fSCA) satellite retrievals in a simple snow model forced by downscaled reanalysis data. The basic idea is to relate the timing of the snow cover depletion (accessible from satellite products) to the peak SSD. Peak subgrid SWE is assumed to be log-normally distributed, which can be translated to a modeled time series of fSCA through the snow model. Assimilation of satellite-derived fSCA facilitates the estimation of the peak SSD, while taking into account uncertainties in both the model and the assimilated data sets. As an extension to previous studies, our method makes use of the novel (to snow data assimilation) ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation (ES-MDA) scheme combined with analytical Gaussian anamorphosis to assimilate time series of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Sentinel-2 fSCA retrievals. The scheme is applied to Arctic sites near Ny-Alesund (79 degrees N, Svalbard, Norway) where field measurements of fSCA and SWE distributions are available. The method is able to successfully recover accurate estimates of peak SSD on most of the occasions considered. Through the ES-MDA assimilation, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) for the fSCA, peak mean SWE and peak subgrid coefficient of variation is improved by around 75, 60 and 20 %, respectively, when compared to the prior, yielding RMSEs of 0.01, 0.09m water equivalent (w.e.) and 0.13, respectively. The ES-MDA either outperforms or at least nearly matches the performance of other ensemble-based batch smoother schemes with regards to various evaluation metrics. Given the modularity of the method, it could prove valuable for a range of satellite-era hydrometeorological reanalyses.

TI  - Monitoring glacier albedo as a proxy to derive summer and annual surface mass balances from optical remote-sensing data
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Less than 0.25% of the 250 000 glaciers inventoried in the Randolph Glacier Inventory (RGI V.5) are currently monitored with in situ measurements of surface mass balance. Increasing this archive is very challenging, especially using time-consuming methods based on in situ measurements, and complementary methods are required to quantify the surface mass balance of unmonitored glaciers. The current study relies on the so-called albedo method, based on the analysis of albedo maps retrieved from optical satellite imagery acquired since 2000 by the MODIS sensor, on board the TERRA satellite. Recent studies revealed substantial relationships between summer minimum glacier-wide surface albedo and annual surface mass balance, because this minimum surface albedo is directly related to the accumulation-area ratio and the equilibrium-line altitude. On the basis of 30 glaciers located in the French Alps where annual surface mass balance data are available, our study conducted on the period 2000-2015 confirms the robustness and reliability of the relationship between the summer minimum surface albedo and the annual surface mass balance. For the ablation season, the integrated summer surface albedo is significantly correlated with the summer surface mass balance of the six glaciers seasonally monitored. These results are promising to monitor both annual and summer glacier-wide surface mass balances of individual glaciers at a regional scale using optical satellite images. A sensitivity study on the computed cloud masks revealed a high confidence in the retrieved albedo maps, restricting the number of omission errors. Albedo retrieval artifacts have been detected for topographically incised glaciers, highlighting limitations in the shadow correction algorithm, although inter-annual comparisons are not affected by systematic errors.

TI  - Intracystic papillary carcinoma of the male breast: a case report
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Intracystic papillary carcinoma (IPC) is defined as cancer that develops from the wall of a cyst in the breast. As breast cancer in men accounts for only 1% of all breast cancers, male IPC is an extremely rare form of the disease. The present case report examines IPC in a man, along with an in-depth literature discussion.Case presentation: A 64-year-old Japanese man noticed a mass in the right breast and sought medical attention. An elastic and soft neoplastic 3-cm lesion was palpated in the right papilla. As a 1-cm solid tumor with a gradual rise from the cyst wall was confirmed within the cyst, vacuum-assisted biopsy (VAB) was performed on that site. Pathological examination of the biopsy revealed heterotypic cells with an enlarged oval nucleus forming dense papillary structures mainly of vascular connective tissue component. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) confirmed thickening of the wall that protruded outside the cyst. The preoperative diagnosis was right breast cancer (male IPC) TisN0M0 stage 0 luminal B-like. Total mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy were performed. In the excised specimen, a 4.0-cm unilocular cyst was found, along with a 1-cm solid tumor with a gradual rise from the cyst wall. Pathological diagnosis of the resected specimen shared similar characteristics with the solid tumor in the cyst: notably, an oval nucleus with histologically clear nucleolus and fine granular chromatin, cylindrically shaped heterotypic cells, and the presence of basophilic cells in the papillary growth with a thin stem of fibrovasculature as the axis. Some invasion of tumor cells into the interstitium was confirmed. As such, the final diagnosis was right breast cancer (male IPC) T2N0M0 stage IIA luminal B-like. The expression of hormone receptor (ER and PgR) was high, and endocrine therapy was initiated postoperatively (20 mg/day tamoxifen). At the present time (3 months postoperation), there has not been any evidence of metastasis.Conclusions: We reported a rare case of an IPC in the male breast, along with a literature review.

We gathered national VA inpatient, outpatient, and pharmacy data files for IAV's who received VA care between fiscal years (FY) 2013 and 2014. The VA pharmacy database was used to identify the prevalence of long term (>30 days), high-dose zolpidem exposure (>10mg immediate-release; >12.5mg extended-release) and other medications received in FY14. Baseline characteristics (demographics, diagnoses) were identified in FY13. Bivariate and multivariable analyses were used to examine the demographic, clinical, and medication correlates of zolpidem use.& para;& para;Results & para;& para;Of 493,683 IAVs who received VHA care in FY 2013 and 2014, 7.6% (n = 37,422) were prescribed zolpidem in FY 2014. Women had lower odds of high-dose zolpidem exposure than men. The majority (77.3%) of IAVs who received zolpidem prescriptions had long-term use with an average days' supply of 189.3 days and a minority (0.9%) had high-dose exposure. In multivariable analyses, factors associated with long-term zolpidem exposure included age greater than 29 years old, PTSD, insomnia, Selim Index, physical 2-3 conditions, opioids, antidepressants, benzodiazepines, atypical antipsychotics, and stimulants. High dose exposure was associated with PTSD, depression, substance use disorder, insomnia, benzodiazepines, atypical antipsychotics, and stimulant prescriptions.& para;& para;Conclusion & para;& para;The current practices of insomnia pharmacotherapy in IAVs fall short of the clinical guidelines and may reflect high-risk zolpidem prescribing practices that put Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans at risk for adverse effects of zolpidem and poor health outcomes.

TI  - Predicting minimum uncertainties in the inversion of ocean color geophysical parameters based on Cramer-Rao bounds
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present an analytical approach based on Cramer-Rao Bounds (CRBs) to investigate the uncertainties in estimated ocean color parameters resulting from the propagation of uncertainties in the bio-optical reflectance modeling through the inversion process. Based on given bio-optical and noise probabilistic models, CRBs can be computed efficiently for any set of ocean color parameters and any sensor configuration, directly providing the minimum estimation variance that can be possibly attained by any unbiased estimator of any targeted parameter. Here, CRBs are explicitly developed using (1) two water reflectance models corresponding to deep and shallow waters, resp., and (2) four probabilistic models describing the environmental noises observed within four Sentinel-2 MSI, HICO, Sentinel-3 OLCI and MODIS images, resp. For both deep and shallow waters, CRBs are shown to be consistent with the experimental estimation variances obtained using two published remote-sensing methods, while not requiring one to perform any inversion. CRBs are also used to investigate to what extent perfect a priori knowledge on one or several geophysical parameters can improve the estimation of remaining unknown parameters. For example, using pre-existing knowledge of bathymetry (e.g., derived from LiDAR) within the inversion is shown to greatly improve the retrieval of bottom cover for shallow waters. Finally, CRBs are shown to provide valuable information on the best estimation performances that may be achieved with the MSI, HICO, OLCI and MODIS configurations for a variety of oceanic, coastal and inland waters. CRBs are thus demonstrated to be an informative and efficient tool to characterize minimum uncertainties in inverted ocean color geophysical parameters. (C) 2017 Optical Society of America

TI  - Pathways of Harm: The Consequences of Trump's Withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite widespread democratic support for continued participation in the Paris Agreement, U.S. President Donald Trump decided to withdraw from it in June 2017. The decision signaled a democratic dysfunction in the face of climate change, one that will likely hold negative consequences for communities exposed and vulnerable to the effects of continued fossil fuel use and climate change. This article argues that Trump's decision opens 4 pathways by which these harms might be transmitted in the coming years: (1) by prolonging the viability of U.S. fossil fuel development; (2) by prolonging a period of slow and unambitious global climate action; (3) by extending to climate efforts a worldview that will open future climate policy up to reactionary resistance; and (4) by rescinding funding for adaptation projects in vulnerable communities.

TI  - Historic carbon burial spike in an Amazon floodplain lake linked to riparian deforestation near Santarem, Brazil
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests along the Amazon Basin produce significant quantities of organic material, a portion of which is deposited in floodplain lakes. Deforestation in the watershed may then have potentially important effects on the carbon fluxes. In this study, a sediment core was extracted from an Amazon floodplain lake to examine the relationship between carbon burial and changing land cover and land use. Historical records from the 1930s and satellite data from the 1970s were used to calculate deforestation rates between 1930 to 1970 and 1970 to 2010 in four zones with different distances from the margins of the lake and its tributaries (100, 500, 1000 and 6000m buffers). A sediment accumulation rate of similar to 4 mmyr(-1) for the previous similar to 120 years was determined from the Pu240+239 signatures and the excess Pb-210 method. The carbon burial rates ranged between 85 and 298 gCm(-2) yr(-1), with pulses of high carbon burial in the 1950s, originating from the forest vegetation as indicated by delta C-13 and delta N-15 signatures. Our results revealed a potentially important spatial dependence of the organic carbon (OC) burial in Amazon lacustrine sediments in relation to deforestation rates in the catchment. These deforestation rates were more intense in the riparian vegetation (100m buffer) during the period 1930 to 1970 and the larger open water areas (500, 1000 and 6000m buffer) during 1970 to 2010. The continued removal of vegetation from the interior of the forest was not related to the peak of OC burial in the lake, but only the riparian deforestation which peaked during the 1950s. Therefore, this supports the conservation priority of riparian forests as an important management practice for Amazon flooded areas. Our findings suggest the importance of abrupt and temporary events in which some of the biomass released by deforestation, especially restricted to areas along open water edges, might reach the depositional environments in the floodplain of the Amazon Basin.

TI  - Error analysis of the greenhouse-gases monitor instrument short wave infrared XCO<sub>2</sub> retrieval algorithm
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We developed an algorithm (named GMI_XCO2) to retrieve the global column-averaged dry air mole fraction of atmospheric carbon dioxide (XCO2) for greenhouse-gases monitor instrument (GMI) and directional polarized camera (DPC) on the GF-5 satellite. This algorithm is designed to work in cloudless atmospheric conditions with aerosol optical thickness (AOT) < 0.3. To quantify the uncertainty level of the retrieved XCO2 when the aerosols and cirrus clouds occurred in retrieving XCO2 with the GMI short wave infrared (SWIR) data, we analyzed the errors rate caused by the six types of aerosols and cirrus clouds. The results indicated that in AOT range of 0.05 to 0.3 (550 nm), the uncertainties of aerosols could lead to errors of -0.27% to 0.59%, -0.32% to 1.43%, -0.10% to 0.49%, -0.12% to 1.17%, -0.35% to 0.49%, and -0.02% to -0.24% for rural, dust, clean continental, maritime, urban, and soot aerosols, respectively. The retrieval results presented a large error due to cirrus clouds. In the cirrus optical thickness range of 0.05 to 0.8 (500 nm), the most underestimation is up to 26.25% when the surface albedo is 0.05. The most overestimation is 8.1% when the surface albedo is 0.65. The retrieval results of GMI simulation data demonstrated that the accuracy of our algorithm is within 4 ppm (similar to 1%) using the simultaneous measurement of aerosols and clouds from DPC. Moreover, the speed of our algorithm is faster than full-physics (FP) methods. We verified our algorithm with Greenhouse-gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) data in Beijing area during 2016. The retrieval errors of most observations are within 4 ppm except for summer. Compared with the results of GOSAT, the correlation coefficient is 0.55 for the whole year data, increasing to 0.62 after excluding the summer data.

TI  - Comparison of partial least square regression, support vector machine, and deep-learning techniques for estimating soil salinity from hyperspectral data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explored three techniques for estimating the soil salt content from Landsat data. First, the 127 items of in situ measured hyperspectral reflectance data were collected and resampled to the spectral resolution of the reflectance bands of Landsat 5 and Landsat 8, respectively. Second, 12 soil salt indices (SSI) summarized from previous literature were determined based on the simulated Landsat bands. Third, 127 measurement groups with Landsat bands and SSI were randomly divided into training (102) and testing subgroups (25). Three techniques including partial least square regression (PLSR), support vector machine (SVM), and deep learning (DL) were used to establish a soil salinity model using SSI and the simulated Landsat bands as independent variables (IV), respectively. Results indicated that PLSR with SSI performed best for both simulated Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 data. Compared with PLSR, SVM underestimated soil salt content, whereas DL obtained centralized simulations and failed to capture the lower and upper observations. We recommend the PLSR model with SSI as IV to estimate soil salt content because it can identify >66% moderate-to-high-saline soils, which indicates its great potential for soil salt monitoring in arid or semiarid regions.

TI  - Planning and conducting field surveys of invasive alien species based on GIS
T2  - Biodiversity Science
M3  - Article
AB  - Pre-planning plays a vital role in developing invasive alien plant surveys rapidly and conveniently in the field. This study combined survey technical standards of invasive alien plants and field survey planning methods based on GIS to develop a targeted field survey planning program. LocaSpace Viewer and Orvital maps, which provide rich map resources and powerful functions, were mainly applied. The detailed workflow was as follows: Firstly, the target areas for invasive alien plant field surveys were selected by integrating high-resolution remote sensing data and geographical annotation data in the LocaSpace Viewer; Secondly, according to standards of invasive alien plant field surveys, survey geographic grids, survey points, sample plots, standard-plots, and quadrats were established through the functions of spatial analysis and editing geographic elements in the LocaSpace Viewer, of which information were stored and shared in the KML format; Finally, positioning and navigation of survey points were implemented by Data Management and Navigation functions in the mobile terminal software of the Orvital map. Comparative experiments and applications of proposed technology and methodology have been carried out in Fujian, Guangxi, and Yunnan provinces. Results suggested that the developed technology and methods for planning invasive alien plant surveys and field operations based on GIS technology can help to fulfill surveys in 6 sample points and collect more than 80 records per day. The direct distance of daily invasive alien plant survey is approximately 180 km. The navigation accuracy of survey points is better than 15 m. Planning-based surveys have double the time utilization rate of unplanned surveys. The technical route presented in this study greatly contributes to improving the efficiency of invasive alien plant surveys and provides powerful technical support for invasive alien plant survey in the field and insight into biodiversity field surveying.

TI  - Use of a remotely piloted aircraft system for hazard assessment in a rocky mining area (Lucca, Italy)
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of remote sensing techniques is now common practice in different working environments, including engineering geology. Moreover, in recent years the development of structure from motion (SfM) methods, together with rapid technological improvement, has allowed the widespread use of cost-effective remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) for acquiring detailed and accurate geometrical information even in evolving environments, such as mining contexts. Indeed, the acquisition of remotely sensed data from hazardous areas provides accurate 3-D models and high-resolution orthophotos minimizing the risk for operators. The quality and quantity of the data obtainable from RPAS surveys can then be used for inspection of mining areas, audit of mining design, rock mass characterizations, stability analysis investigations and monitoring activities. Despite the widespread use of RPAS, its potential and limitations still have to be fully understood.In this paper a case study is shown where a RPAS was used for the engineering geological investigation of a closed marble mine area in Italy; direct ground-based techniques could not be applied for safety reasons. In view of the re-activation of mining operations, high-resolution images taken from different positions and heights were acquired and processed using SfM techniques to obtain an accurate and detailed 3-D model of the area. The geometrical and radiometrical information was subsequently used for a deterministic rock mass characterization, which led to the identification of two large marble blocks that pose a potential significant hazard issue for the future workforce. A preliminary stability analysis, with a focus on investigating the contribution of potential rock bridges, was then performed in order to demonstrate the potential use of RPAS information in engineering geological contexts for geohazard identification, awareness and reduction.

TI  - Handheld magnetic probe with permanent magnet and Hall sensor for identifying sentinel lymph nodes in breast cancer patients
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The newly developed radioisotope-free technique based on magnetic nanoparticle detection using a magnetic probe is a promising method for sentinel lymph node biopsy. In this study, a novel handheld magnetic probe with a permanent magnet and magnetic sensor is developed to detect the sentinel lymph nodes in breast cancer patients. An outstanding feature of the probe is the precise positioning of the sensor at the magnetic null point of the magnet, leading to highly sensitive measurements unaffected by the strong ambient magnetic fields of the magnet. Numerical and experimental results show that the longitudinal detection length is approximately 10 mm, for 140 mu g of iron. Clinical tests were performed, for the first time, using magnetic and blue dye tracers-without radioisotopes-in breast cancer patients to demonstrate the performance of the probe. The nodes were identified through transcutaneous and ex-vivo measurements, and the iron accumulation in the nodes was quantitatively revealed. These results show that the handheld magnetic probe is useful in sentinel lymph node biopsy and that magnetic techniques are widely being accepted as future standard methods in medical institutions lacking nuclear medicine facilities.

TI  - Consequences of Epithelial Inflammasome Activation by Bacterial Pathogens
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Inflammasome signaling impinges on the activation of inflammatory caspases (i.e., caspase-1 and caspase-4/5/11) and endows host cells with a sentinel system to sense microbial intrusion and thereby initiate appropriate immune responses. Lately, it has become evident that mammalian inflammasome-dependent responses to infection are not confined solely to cells of hematopoietic origin. Epithelial cells that line the body's mucosal surfaces use inflammasome signaling to sense and counteract pathogenic microorganisms that compromise barrier integrity. Many of the molecular mechanisms of epithelial inflammasome signaling remain unexplored. However, it now seems clear that epithelial inflammasome activation has a profound impact both on the infected cell itself and on its ability to communicate with other cell types of the mucosa. Here, we summarize current knowledge regarding the output of epithelial inflammasome activation during bacterial infection. Well-established downstream effects include epithelial cell death, release of soluble mediators, and subsequent recruitment of effector cell types, including NK cells, mast cells, and neutrophils, to sites of mucosal infection. We discuss the implications of recent findings for antibacterial defense in the mucosa and sketch out areas for future exploration. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - New approach to the retrieval of AOD and its uncertainty from MISR observations over dark water
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - A new method for retrieving aerosol optical depth (AOD) and its uncertainty from Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) observations over dark water is outlined. MISR's aerosol retrieval algorithm calculates cost functions between observed and pre-simulated radiances for a range of AODs (from 0.0 to 3.0) and a prescribed set of aerosol mixtures. The previous version 22 (V22) operational algorithm considered only the AOD that minimized the cost function for each aerosol mixture and then used a combination of these values to compute the final, "best estimate" AOD and associated uncertainty. The new approach considers the entire range of cost functions associated with each aerosol mixture. The uncertainty of the reported AOD depends on a combination of (a) the absolute values of the cost functions for each aerosol mixture, (b) the widths of the cost function distributions as a function of AOD, and (c) the spread of the cost function distributions among the ensemble of mixtures. A key benefit of the new approach is that, unlike the V22 algorithm, it does not rely on empirical thresholds imposed on the cost function to determine the success or failure of a particular mixture. Furthermore, a new aerosol retrieval confidence index (ARCI) is established that can be used to screen high-AOD retrieval blunders caused by cloud contamination or other factors. Requiring ARCI >= 0.15 as a condition for retrieval success is supported through statistical analysis and outperforms the thresholds used in the V22 algorithm. The described changes to the MISR dark water algorithm will become operational in the new MISR aerosol product (V23), planned for release in 2017.

TI  - Prime incision: A minimally invasive approach to breast cancer surgical treatment-A 2 cohort retrospective comparison with conventional breast conserving surgery
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The prime incision technique is an oncoplastic surgery aimed to remove both the breast tumor and the sentinel lymph node through one incision, thus providing better aesthetic results than the conventional breast conservative two incision technique. We retrospectively evaluated 2 cohorts of 60 consecutive breast cancer patients operated by either conventional breast conservative surgery (N = 26) or one incision surgery (N = 34). There were no recurrence or death events observed in any group. No difference was seen regarding the incidence of surgical complications. In the prime incision group the breast volume removed was significantly lower than in the conventional surgery group as well as was the surgical time and the number of dissected lymph nodes. Aesthetical results were better in the one incision group. Further prospective studies are needed to validate the one incision technique as a surgical option for selected early stage breast cancer patients.

TI  - The operational cloud retrieval algorithms from TROPOMI on board Sentinel-5 Precursor
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the operational cloud retrieval algorithms for the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on board the European Space Agency Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) mission scheduled for launch in 2017.Two algorithms working in tandem are used for retrieving cloud properties: OCRA (Optical Cloud Recognition Algorithm) and ROCINN (Retrieval of Cloud Information using Neural Networks). OCRA retrieves the cloud fraction using TROPOMI measurements in the ultraviolet (UV) and visible (VIS) spectral regions, and ROCINN retrieves the cloud top height (pressure) and optical thickness (albedo) using TROPOMI measurements in and around the oxygen A-band in the near infrared (NIR).Cloud parameters from TROPOMI/S5P will be used not only for enhancing the accuracy of trace gas retrievals but also for extending the satellite data record of cloud information derived from oxygen A-band measurements, a record initiated with the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) on board the second European Remote-Sensing Satellite (ERS-2) over 20 years ago.The OCRA and ROCINN algorithms are integrated in the S5P operational processor UPAS (Universal Processor for UV/VIS/NIR Atmospheric Spectrometers), and we present here UPAS cloud results using the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and GOME-2 measurements. In addition, we examine anticipated challenges for the TROPOMI/S5P cloud retrieval algorithms, and we discuss the future validation needs for OCRA and ROCINN.

TI  - Vegetation role in controlling the ecoenvironmental conditions for sustainable urban environments: a comparison of Beijing and Islamabad
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid increase in urbanization due to population growth leads to the degradation of vegetation in major cities. This study investigated the spatial patterns of the ecoenvironmental conditions of inhabitants of two distinct Asian capital cities, Beijing of China and Islamabad of Pakistan, by utilizing Earth observation data products. The significance of urban vegetation for the cooling effect was studied in local climate zones, i.e., urban, suburban, and rural areas within 1-km(2) quantiles. Landsat-8 (OLI) and Gaofen-1 satellite imagery were used to assess vegetation cover and land surface temperature, while population datasets were used to evaluate environmental impact. Comparatively, a higher cooling effect of vegetation presence was observed in rural and suburban zones of Beijing as compared to Islamabad, while the urban zone of Islamabad was found comparatively cooler than Beijing's urban zone. The urban thermal field variance index calculated from satellite imagery was ranked into the ecological evaluation index. The worst ecoenvironmental conditions were found in urban zones of both cities where the fraction of vegetation is very low. Meanwhile, this condition is more serious in Beijing, as more than 90% of the total population is living under the worst ecoenvironment conditions, while only 7% of the population is enjoying comfortable conditions. Ecoenvironmental conditions of Islamabad are comparatively better than Beijing where similar to 61% of the total population live under the worst ecoenvironmental conditions, and similar to 24% are living under good conditions. Thus, Islamabad at this early growth stage can learn from Beijing's ecoenvironmental conditions to improve the quality of living by controlling the associated factors in the future. (C) The Authors.

TI  - Diurnal cycle and seasonal variation of cloud cover over the Tibetan Plateau as determined from Himawari-8 new-generation geostationary satellite data
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Analysis of cloud cover and its diurnal variation over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) is highly reliant on satellite data; however, the accuracy of cloud detection from both polar-orbiting and geostationary satellites over this area remains unclear. The new-generation geostationary Himawari-8 satellites provide highresolution spatial and temporal information about clouds over the Tibetan Plateau. In this study, the cloud detection of MODIS and AHI is investigated and validated against CALIPSO measurements. For AHI and MODIS, the false alarm rate of AHI and MODIS in cloud identification over the TP was 7.51% and 1.94%, respectively, and the cloud hit rate was 73.55% and 80.15%, respectively. Using hourly cloud-cover data from the Himawari-8 satellites, we found that at the monthly scale, the diurnal cycle in cloud cover over the TP tends to increase throughout the day, with the minimum and maximum cloud fractions occurring at 10: 00 a.m. and 18: 00 p.m. local time. Due to the limited time resolution of polarorbiting satellites, the underestimation of MODIS daytime average cloud cover is approximately 4.00% at the annual scale, with larger biases during the spring (5.40%) and winter (5.90%).

TI  - GOCI Yonsei aerosol retrieval version 2 products: an improved algorithm and error analysis with uncertainty estimation from 5-year validation over East Asia
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) Yonsei aerosol retrieval (YAER) version 1 algorithm was developed to retrieve hourly aerosol optical depth at 550 nm (AOD) and other subsidiary aerosol optical properties over East Asia. The GOCI YAER AOD had accuracy comparable to ground-based and other satellite-based observations but still had errors because of uncertainties in surface reflectance and simple cloud masking. In addition, near-real-time (NRT) processing was not possible because a monthly database for each year encompassing the day of retrieval was required for the determination of surface reflectance. This study describes the improved GOCI YAER algorithm version 2 (V2) for NRT processing with improved accuracy based on updates to the cloud-masking and surface-reflectance calculations using a multi-year Rayleigh-corrected reflectance and wind speed database, and inversion channels for surface conditions. The improved GOCI AOD tau(G) is closer to that of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) AOD than was the case for AOD from the YAER V1 algorithm. The V2 tau(G) has a lower median bias and higher ratio within the MODIS expected error range (0.60 for land and 0.71 for ocean) compared with V1 (0.49 for land and 0.62 for ocean) in a validation test against Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) AOD tau(A) from 2011 to 2016. A validation using the Sun-Sky Radiometer Observation Network (SONET) over China shows similar results. The bias of error (tau(G)-tau(A)) is within 0.1 and 0.1, and it is a function of AERONET AOD and Angstrom exponent (AE), scattering angle, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), cloud fraction and homogeneity of retrieved AOD, and observation time, month, and year. In addition, the diagnostic and prognostic expected error (PEE) of tau(G) are estimated. The estimated PEE of GOCI V2 AOD is well correlated with the actual error over East Asia, and the GOCI V2 AOD over South Korea has a higher ratio within PEE than that over China and Japan.

TI  - Calibration of the DSCOVR EPIC visible and NIR channels using MODIS Terra and Aqua data and EPIC lunar observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The unique position of the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) at the Lagrange 1 point makes an important addition to the data from currently operating low Earth orbit observing instruments. EPIC instrument does not have an on-board calibration facility. One approach to its calibration is to compare EPIC observations to the measurements from polarorbiting radiometers. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is a natural choice for such comparison due to its well-established calibration record and wide use in remote sensing. We use MODIS Aqua and Terra L1B 1 km reflectances to infer calibration coefficients for four EPIC visible and NIR channels: 443, 551, 680 and 780 nm. MODIS and EPIC measurements made between June 2015 and 2016 are employed for comparison. We first identify favorable MODIS pixels with scattering angle matching temporarily collocated EPIC observations. Each EPIC pixel is then spatially collocated to a subset of the favorable MODIS pixels within 25 km radius. Standard deviation of the selected MODIS pixels as well as of the adjacent EPIC pixels is used to find the most homogeneous scenes. These scenes are then used to determine calibration coefficients using a linear regression between EPIC counts s(-1) and reflectances in the close MODIS spectral channels. We present thus inferred EPIC calibration coefficients and discuss sources of uncertainties. The lunar EPIC observations are used to calibrate EPIC O-2 absorbing channels (688 and 764 nm), assuming that there is a small difference between moon reflectances separated by similar to 10 nm in wavelength and provided the calibration factors of the red (680 nm) and NIR (780 nm) are known from comparison between EPIC and MODIS.

TI  - High fire-derived nitrogen deposition on central African forests
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition is an important determinant of N availability for natural ecosystems worldwide. Increased anthropogenic N deposition shifts the stoichiometric equilibrium of ecosystems, with direct and indirect impacts on ecosystem functioning and biogeochemical cycles. Current simulation data suggest that remote tropical forests still receive low atmospheric N deposition due to a lack of proximate industry, low rates of fossil fuel combustion, and absence of intensive agriculture. We present field-based N deposition data for forests of the central Congo Basin, and use ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry to characterize the organic N fraction. Additionally, we use satellite data and modeling for atmospheric N source apportionment. Our results indicate that these forests receive 18.2 kg N hectare(-1) years(-1) as wet deposition, with dry deposition via canopy interception adding considerably to this flux. We also show that roughly half of the N deposition is organic, which is often ignored in N deposition measurements and simulations. The source of atmospheric N is predominantly derived from intensive seasonal burning of biomass on the continent. This high N deposition has important implications for the ecology of the Congo Basin and for global biogeochemical cycles more broadly.

TI  - Spatial prediction of basal area and volume in <i>Eucalyptus</i> stands using Landsat TM data: an assessment of prediction methods
T2  - NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF FORESTRY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In fast-growing forests such as Eucalyptus plantations, the correct determination of stand productivity is essential to aid decision making processes and ensure the efficiency of the wood supply chain. In the past decade, advances in remote sensing and computational methods have yielded new tools, techniques, and technologies that have led to improvements in forest management and forest productivity assessments. Our aim was to estimate and map the basal area and volume of Eucalyptus stands through the integration of forest inventory, remote sensing, parametric, and nonparametric methods of spatial prediction.Methods: This study was conducted in 20 5-year-old clonal stands (362 ha) of Eucalyptus urophylla S.T.Blake x Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehnh. The stands are located in the northwest region of Minas Gerais state, Brazil. Basal area and volume data were obtained from forest inventory operations carried out in the field. Spectral data were collected from a Landsat 5 TM satellite image, composed of spectral bands and vegetation indices. Multiple linear regression (MLR), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN) methods were used for basal area and volume estimation. Using ordinary kriging, we spatialised the residuals generated by the spatial prediction methods for the correction of trends in the estimates and more detailing of the spatial behaviour of basal area and volume.Results: The ND54 index was the spectral variable that had the best correlation values with basal area (r = -0.91) and volume (r = -0.52) and was also the variable that most contributed to basal area and volume estimates by the MLR and RF methods. The RF algorithm presented smaller basal area and volume errors when compared to other machine learning algorithms and MLR. The addition of residual kriging in spatial prediction methods did not necessarily result in relative improvements in the estimations of these methods.Conclusions: Random forest was the best method of spatial prediction and mapping of basal area and volume in the study area. The combination of spatial prediction methods with residual kriging did not result in relative improvement of spatial prediction accuracy of basal area and volume in all methods assessed in this study, and there is not always a spatial dependency structure in the residuals of a spatial prediction method. The approaches used in this study provide a framework for integrating field and multispectral data, highlighting methods that greatly improve spatial prediction of basal area and volume estimation in Eucalyptus stands. This has potential to support fast growth plantation monitoring, offering options for a robust analysis of high-dimensional data.

TI  - Snow Cover and Vegetation-Induced Decrease in Global Albedo From 2002 to 2016
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface albedo is an essential parameter in regional and global climate models, and it is markedly influenced by land cover change. Variations in the albedo can affect the surface radiation budget and further impact the global climate. In this study, the interannual variation of albedo from 2002 to 2016 was estimated on the global scale using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) datasets. The presence and causes of the albedo changes for each specific region were also explored. From 2002 to 2016, the MODIS-based albedo decreased globally, snow cover declined by 0.970 (percent per pixel), while the seasonally integrated normalized difference vegetation index increased by 0.175. Some obvious increases in the albedo were detected in Central Asia, northeastern China, parts of the boreal forest in Canada, and the temperate steppe in North America. In contrast, noticeable decreases in the albedo were found in the Siberian tundra, Europe, southeastern Australia, and northeastern regions of North America. In the Northern Hemisphere, the greening trend at high latitudes made more contribution to the decline in the albedo. However, the dramatic fluctuation of snow-cover at midlatitudes predominated in the change of albedo. Our analysis can help to understand the roles that vegetation and snow cover play in the variation of albedo on global and regional scales.

TI  - Length of Stay and Hospital Revisit After Bacterial Tracheostomy-Associated Respiratory Tract Infection Hospitalizations.
T2  - Hospital pediatrics
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify factors associated with longer length of stay (LOS) and higher 30-day hospital revisit rates for children hospitalized with bacterial tracheostomy-associated respiratory tract infections (bTARTIs).METHODS: This was a multicenter, retrospective cohort study using administrative data from the Pediatric Health Information System database between 2007 and 2014 of patients 30 days to 17 years old with a principal discharge diagnosis of bTARTI or a principal discharge diagnosis of bTARTI symptoms with a secondary diagnosis of bTARTI. Primary outcomes of LOS (in days) and 30-day all-cause revisit rates (inpatient, observation, or emergency department visit) were analyzed by using a 3-level hierarchical regression model (discharges within patients within hospital).RESULTS: We included 3715 unique patients and 7355 discharges. The median LOS was 4 days (interquartile range: 3-8 days), and the 30-day revisit rate was 30.5%. Compared with children 1 to 4 years old, children aged 30 days to 12 months had both longer LOS (adjusted length of stay [aLOS] = +0.9 days; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.6 to 1.3) and increased hospital revisit risk (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.5; 95% CI: 1.3 to 1.7). Other factors associated with longer LOS included public insurance (aLOS = +0.5 days; 95% CI: 0.2 to 0.8), 3 or more complex chronic conditions (CCCs), mechanical ventilation (acute or chronic), and empirical anti-Pseudomonas aeruginosa antibiotics (aLOS = +0.6 days; 95% CI: 0.3 to 0.9). Other factors associated with 30-day revisit included 4 or more CCCs (aOR = 1.3; 95% CI: 1.1 to 1.6) and chronic ventilator dependency (aOR = 1.1; 95% CI: 1.0 to 1.3).CONCLUSIONS: Ventilator-dependent patients <12 months old with at least 4 CCCs are at highest risk for both longer LOS and 30-day revisit after discharge for bTARTIs. They may benefit from bTARTI prevention strategies and intensive care coordination while hospitalized.

TI  - Modulation of Winter Precipitation Dynamics Over the Arabian Gulf by ENSO
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Arabian Gulf (Gulf) and the surrounding regions are centers of intense economic activity. The precipitating weather systems that form over the Gulf are important for this predominantly arid region. It is suggested that El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) influences the Middle East precipitation variability through an equatorward shift of the subtropical jet. Here we present compelling evidence to illustrate the role of ENSO in modulating the local dynamics and moisture transport in initiating precipitation during different ENSO phases using satellite and reanalysis data. It is found that the moisture transport from the Red and Arabian Seas toward the Gulf is stronger during El Nino years. The pattern and strength of moisture transport toward the Gulf is weakened during La Nina and neutral years, with most of the transport directed toward the northern Gulf. Using a 120 h back trajectory analysis, it is found that while the air parcels coming toward the Gulf from the Arabian and Red Seas side originate at lower tropospheric levels, the air parcels from the Mediterranean originate at middle and upper tropospheric levels during El Nino years. In contrast, upper tropospheric air parcels originating over the southern Arabian Sea plays a dominant role on Gulf precipitation during La Nina and neutral years. The seasonal mean transients of zonal winds show a robust ENSO signature over the Gulf, indicating a favorable (less favorable) condition for the penetration of midlatitude eddies over the region during El Nino (La Nina) winters.Plain Language Summary The Arabian Gulf and the surrounding regions are centers of intense economic activity. The precipitating weather systems that form over the Arabian Gulf are important for this predominantly arid region. A major portion of the Middle East precipitation variability is known to be associated with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon. The sources of moisture for the heavy precipitation events over the Arabian Gulf are the Arabian and Red Seas. In this study, it is found that the local dynamics that favor precipitation differs during El Nino, La Nina, and neutral years. The moisture transport from the Red and Arabian Seas toward the Arabian Gulf is stronger and covers the entire Gulf during El Nino years. The pattern and strength of moisture transport toward the Gulf are similar during La Nina and neutral years, with most of the transport directed toward the northern Gulf. The air parcels that come from the Mediterranean side originate at middle and upper tropospheric levels during El Nino years. However, during La Nina and neutral years, air parcels primarily originate at the upper tropospheric levels over the southern Arabian Sea.

TI  - Satellite Ocean Aerosol Retrieval (SOAR) Algorithm Extension to S-NPP VIIRS as Part of the "Deep Blue" Aerosol Project
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) satellite, launched in late 2011, carries the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and several other instruments. VIIRS has similar characteristics to prior satellite sensors used for aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieval, allowing the continuation of space-based aerosol data records. The Deep Blue algorithm has previously been applied to retrieve AOD from Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) measurements over land. The SeaWiFS Deep Blue data set also included a SeaWiFS Ocean Aerosol Retrieval (SOAR) algorithm to cover water surfaces. As part of NASA's VIIRS data processing, Deep Blue is being applied to VIIRS data over land, and SOAR has been adapted from SeaWiFS to VIIRS for use over water surfaces. This study describes SOAR as applied in version 1 of NASA's S-NPP VIIRS Deep Blue data product suite. Several advances have been made since the SeaWiFS application, as well as changes to make use of the broader spectral range of VIIRS. A preliminary validation against Maritime Aerosol Network (MAN) measurements suggests a typical uncertainty on retrieved 550 nm AOD of order +/-(0.03+10%), comparable to existing SeaWiFS/MODIS aerosol data products. Retrieved Angstrom exponent and fine-mode AOD fraction are also well correlated with MAN data, with small biases and uncertainty similar to or better than SeaWiFS/MODIS products.Plain Language Summary Aerosols are small particles in the atmosphere like desert dust, volcanic ash, smoke, industrial haze, and sea spray. Understanding them is important for applications such as hazard avoidance, air quality and human health, and climate studies. Satellite instruments provide an important tool to study aerosol loading over the world. However, individual satellites do not last forever and newer satellites often have improved capabilities compared to older ones. This paper describes and evaluates an extension of an algorithm, originally designed to monitor aerosols from an older satellite instrument, to a new satellite instrument called VIIRS.

TI  - Decline in Antarctic Ozone Depletion and Lower Stratospheric Chlorine Determined From Aura Microwave Limb Sounder Observations
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Attribution of Antarctic ozone recovery to the Montreal protocol requires evidence that (1) Antarctic chlorine levels are declining and (2) there is a reduction in ozone depletion in response to a chlorine decline. We use Aura Microwave Limb Sounder measurements of O-3, HCl, and N2O to demonstrate that inorganic chlorine (Cl-y) from 2013 to 2016 was 223 +/- 93 parts per trillion lower in the Antarctic lower stratosphere than from 2004 to 2007 and that column ozone depletion declined in response. The mean Cl-y decline rate, similar to 0.8%/yr, agrees with the expected rate based on chlorofluorocarbon lifetimes. N2O measurements are crucial for identifying changes in stratospheric Cl-y loading independent of dynamical variability. From 2005 to 2016, the ozone depletion and Cl-y time series show matching periods of decline, stability, and increase. The observed sensitivity of O-3 depletion to changing Cl-y agrees with the sensitivity simulated by the Global Modeling Initiative chemistry transport model integrated with Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications 2 meteorology.Plain Language Summary The Antarctic ozone hole is healing slowly because levels of the man-made chemicals causing the hole have long lifetimes. We use Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) satellite data to measure O-3 over Antarctica at the beginning of winter and then compare it to O-3 near the end of winter to calculate depletion. During this period, nearly all O-3 change is due to depletion. MLS also measures HCl, and when ozone levels are very low, nearly all the reactive chlorine species (Cl-y) are converted to HCl. Cl-y varies a lot from year to year from atmospheric motions. Fortunately, MLS measures nitrous oxide (N2O), a long-lived gas that also varies with the motions. Using the ratio of Cl-y to N2O, we find that there is less chlorine now than 9 years ago and that Cl-y has decreased on average about 25 parts per trillion/yr (0.8%/yr). The O-3 depletion we calculate from MLS data responds to changes in the Cly levels, and the ratio of the change in ozone loss to the change in Cl-y matches model calculations. All of this is evidence that the Montreal Protocol is working-the Cl-y is decreasing in the Antarctic stratosphere and the ozone destruction is decreasing along with it.

TI  - Mitigating Satellite-Based Fire Sampling Limitations in Deriving Biomass Burning Emission Rates: Application to WRF-Chem Model Over the Northern sub-Saharan African Region
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Largely used in several independent estimates of fire emissions, fire products based on MODIS sensors aboard the Terra and Aqua polar-orbiting satellites have a number of inherent limitations, including (a) inability to detect fires below clouds, (b) significant decrease of detection sensitivity at the edge of scan where pixel sizes are much larger than at nadir, and (c) gaps between adjacent swaths in tropical regions. To remedy these limitations, an empirical method is developed here and applied to correct fire emission estimates based on MODIS pixel level fire radiative power measurements and emission coefficients from the Fire Energetics and Emissions Research (FEER) biomass burning emission inventory. The analysis was performed for January 2010 over the northern sub-Saharan African region. Simulations from WRF-Chem model using original and adjusted emissions are compared with the aerosol optical depth (AOD) products from MODIS and AERONET as well as aerosol vertical profile from CALIOP data. The comparison confirmed an 30-50% improvement in the model simulation performance (in terms of correlation, bias, and spatial pattern of AOD with respect to observations) by the adjusted emissions that not only increases the original emission amount by a factor of two but also results in the spatially continuous estimates of instantaneous fire emissions at daily time scales. Such improvement cannot be achieved by simply scaling the original emission across the study domain. Even with this improvement, a factor of two underestimations still exists in the modeled AOD, which is within the current global fire emissions uncertainty envelope.Plain Language Summary Polar-orbiting satellites sensors, such as MODIS, have limitations in detecting fires under clouds or when viewing angles are large or in the gaps among satellites' different ground swaths. Here we developed an empirical method to mitigate the effect of these limitations in fire emission estimate. The method is applied to a fire emission inventory (FEER) based on MODIS. We show that, with our method, the adjusted emission inventory improves WRF-Chem simulation of smoke transport and distribution.

TI  - The Influence of Air-Sea Fluxes on Atmospheric Aerosols During the Summer Monsoon Over the Tropical Indian Ocean
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - During the summer monsoon, the western tropical Indian Ocean is predicted to be a hot spot for dimethylsulfide emissions, the major marine sulfur source to the atmosphere, and an important aerosol precursor. Other aerosol relevant fluxes, such as isoprene and sea spray, should also be enhanced, due to the steady strong winds during the monsoon. Marine air masses dominate the area during the summer monsoon, excluding the influence of continentally derived pollutants. During the SO234-2/235 cruise in the western tropical Indian Ocean from July to August 2014, directly measured eddy covariance DMS fluxes confirm that the area is a large source of sulfur to the atmosphere (cruise average 9.1 mu mol m(-2) d(-1)). The directly measured fluxes, as well as computed isoprene and sea spray fluxes, were combined with FLEXPART backward and forward trajectories to track the emissions in space and time. The fluxes show a significant positive correlation with aerosol data from the Terra and Suomi-NPP satellites, indicating a local influence of marine emissions on atmospheric aerosol numbers.Plain Language Summary The air-sea flux trace gases and their transformation to aerosols and cloud condensation nuclei may be fundamental to cloud formation in the marine environment. Clouds and aerosol have an important influence on the radiative balance of the earth. The local coupling of air-sea fluxes and the formation of aerosols and clouds over the ocean is still highly uncertain. This study combines directly measured air-sea fluxes with satellite aerosol remote sensing. It is a novel, interdisciplinary approach where results from air-sea gas transfer are combined with atmospheric chemistry satellite remote sensing using meteorological transport models. Our results strongly support a local influence of marine-derived aerosol precursors on cloud condensation nuclei and aerosol optical depth above the tropical Indian Ocean.

TI  - Using Long-Term Satellite Observations to Identify Sensitive Regimes and Active Regions of Aerosol Indirect Effects for Liquid Clouds Over Global Oceans
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term (1981-2011) satellite climate data records of clouds and aerosols are used to investigate the aerosol-cloud interaction of marine water cloud from a climatology perspective. Our focus is on identifying the regimes and regions where the aerosol indirect effects (AIEs) are evident in long-term averages over the global oceans through analyzing the correlation features between aerosol loading and the key cloud variables including cloud droplet effective radius (CDER), cloud optical depth (COD), cloud water path (CWP), cloud top height (CTH), and cloud top temperature (CTT). An aerosol optical thickness (AOT) range of 0.13 < AOT < 0.3 is identified as the sensitive regime of the conventional first AIE where CDER is more susceptible to AOT than the other cloud variables. The first AIE that manifests as the change of long-term averaged CDER appears only in limited oceanic regions. The signature of aerosol invigoration of water clouds as revealed by the increase of cloud cover fraction (CCF) and CTH with increasing AOT at the middle/high latitudes of both hemispheres is identified for a pristine atmosphere (AOT < 0.08). Aerosol invigoration signature is also revealed by the concurrent increase of CDER, COD, and CWP with increasing AOT for a polluted marine atmosphere (AOT > 0.3) in the tropical convergence zones. The regions where the second AIE is likely to manifest in the CCF change are limited to several oceanic areas with high CCF of the warm water clouds near the western coasts of continents. The second AIE signature as represented by the reduction of the precipitation efficiency with increasing AOT is more likely to be observed in the AOT regime of 0.08 < AOT < 0.4. The corresponding AIE active regions manifested themselves as the decline of the precipitation efficiency are mainly limited to the oceanic areas downwind of continental aerosols. The sensitive regime of the conventional AIE identified in this observational study is likely associated with the transitional regime from the aerosol-limited regime to the updraft-limited regime identified for aerosol-cloud interaction in cloud model simulations.Plain Language Summary Long-term satellite observations of cloud and aerosol have been used to investigate the aerosol effect on marine water cloud from the perspective of climatology. Identifying the regimes and regions where the aerosol effect may manifest clearly in a sense of long-term average over the global oceans is the focus of this study. Several sensitive regimes of aerosol loading and active regions of aerosol effect on the cloud have been identified for the first time in long-term averages of cloud and aerosol variables over the global oceans. The results of this study based on the long-term averaged satellite observation are valuable for the evaluation and improvement of the aerosol effect on cloud in global climate models, which are only evaluated and assessed so far against instantaneous or short-term averaged observations.

TI  - Assessing spring frost effects on beech forests in Central Apennines from remotely-sensed data
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In common beech forests the most damaging frosts are those that occur at the end of spring. At that time the fresh new leaves are at a vulnerable stage and risk to be readily killed by the freezing temperatures. The ability to identify late spring frost spatial dynamics is a key issue for understanding forest patterns and processes linked to such extreme event. The aim of this study is to detect, map and quantify the vegetation anomalies that occurred in the mono-specific beech forest of the Lazio, Abruzzo and Molise National Park (Italy) after an exceptional spring frost recorded on the 25th of April 2016. Results showed that, beech forests at lower elevations that had an early greening process were subject to spring frost damage (SFD pixels) and their productivity performance strongly decreased with respect to the previous 15 years; to the contrary the beech forests located at higher elevations did not suffer the spring frost effects (NSFD pixels) thanks to their delayed leaf unfolding phase. The duration of the effects of freezing stress for the SFD pixels was about two months, until the end of June, confirmed by Net Ecosystem Exchange measurements. This greening hiatus led to an average 14% loss of productivity compared to the previous 15 years. Elevation had a significant role on the probability of occurrence of SFD pixels. Productivity loss in SFD pixels was more severe at elevations in the range 1500-1700 m, on steeply terrains and North aspects. This study represents a step forward the systematic use of automated techniques to study areas subject to stress or anomalies from multitemporal satellite imagery and to identify break points and recovery of the greening process.

TI  - Remote sensing based deforestation analysis in Mahanadi and Brahmaputra river basin in India since 1985
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) change has been recognized as a key driver of global climate change by influencing land surface processes. Being in constant change, river basins are always subjected to LULC changes, especially decline in forest cover to give way for agricultural expansion, urbanization, industrialization etc. We used on-screen digital interpretation technique to derive LULC maps from Landsat images at three decadal intervals i.e., 1985, 1995 and 2005 of two major river basins of India. Rain-fed, Mahanadi river basin (MRB) attributed to 55% agricultural area wherein glacier-fed, Brahmaputra river basin (BRB) had only 16% area under agricultural land. Though conversion of forest land for agricultural activities was the major LULC changes in both the basins, the rate was higher for BRB than MRB. While water body increased in MRB could be primarily attributed to creation of reservoirs and aquaculture farms; snow and ice melting attributed to creation of more water bodies in BRB. Scrub land acted as an intermediate class for forest conversion to barren land in BRB, while direct conversion of scrub land to waste land and crop land was seen in MRB. While habitation contributed primarily to LULC changes in BRB, the proximity zones around habitat and other socio-economic drivers contributed to LULC change in MRB. Comparing the predicted result with actual LULC of 2005, we obtained >97% modelling accuracy; therefore it is expected that the Dyna-CLUE model has very well predicted the LULC for the year 2025. The predicted LULC of 2025 and corresponding LULC changes in these two basins acting as early warning, and with the past 2-decadal change analysis this study is believed to help the land use planners for improved regional planning to create balanced ecosystem, especially in a changing climate.

TI  - Analysis and modelling of surface Urban Heat Island in 20 Canadian cities under climate and land-cover change
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI) is an urban climate phenomenon that is expected to respond to future climate and land-use land-cover change. It is important to further our understanding of physical mechanisms that govern SUHI phenomenon to enhance our ability to model future SUHI characteristics under changing geophysical conditions. In this study, SUHI phenomenon is quantified and modelled at 20 cities distributed across Canada. By analyzing MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensed surface temperature at the cities over 2002-2012, it is found that 16 out of 20 selected cities have experienced a positive SUHI phenomenon while 4 cities located in the prairies region and high elevation locations have experienced a negative SUHI phenomenon in the past. A statistically significant relationship between observed SUHI magnitude and city elevation is also recorded over the observational period. A Physical Scaling downscaling model is then validated and used to downscale future surface temperature projections from 3 GCMs and 2 extreme Representative Concentration Pathways in the urban and rural areas of the cities. Future changes in SUHI magnitudes between historical (2006-2015) and future timelines: 2030s (2026-2035), 2050s (2046-2055), and 2090s (2091-2100) are estimated. Analysis of future projected changes indicate that 15 (13) out of 20 cities can be expected to experience increases in SUHI magnitudes in future under RCP 2.6 (RCP 8.5). A statistically significant relationship between projected future SUHI change and current size of the cities is also obtained. The study highlights the role of city properties (i.e. its size, elevation, and surrounding land cover) towards shaping their current and future SUHI characteristics. The results from this analysis will help decision-makers to manage Canadian cities more efficiently under rapidly changing geophysical and demographical conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Long-term characteristics of satellite-based PM<sub>2.5</sub> over East China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - With the explosive economic development of China over the past few decades, air pollution has become a serious environmental problem and has attracted increasing global concern. Using satellite-based PM2.5 data from 2000 to 2015, we found that the temporal-spatial variation of PM2.5 in East China is characterized by high concentrations in the northern part and low concentrations in the southern part of East China, and by being seasonally high in autumn and winter but low in spring and summer. We also found that the regional average PM2.5 concentration shows an approximative peak pattern over the last 16 years, with the highest, 60.13 mu gm(-3), and the lowest, 46.18 mu g m(-3), occurring in 2007 and 2000, respectively. Despite obviously diminishing heavy polluted regions with a PM2.5 of >80 mu g m(-3) after 2011, those cells dominated by natural background have still not recovered back to the clean level of 2000. These characteristics are valuable information to analyze the relative contributions of anthropogenic emissions and atmospheric conditions to the temporal-spatial variation characteristics of PM2.5.

TI  - The relationship between identity processes and well-being in various life domains
T2  - PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study is to examine the relationships between identity processes and well-being across various life domains. We adopted a three-dimensional model of identity formation that consisted of three processes, namely, in-depth exploration, commitment, and reconsideration of commitment, and applied a domain-specific approach to examine the contribution of identity processes to well-being in various life domains. This study included 1312 participants aged 19 to 35 years. We used the Mental Health Continuum - Short Form and Questionnaire for Eudaimonic Well-Being to measure well-being and the Warsaw Measurement of Identity Commitments Scale to examine identity processes in the following domains: Personality characteristics, Worldview, Hobbies and interests, Experiences from the past, Future plans, Family relationships, Relationships with friends and acquaintances, and Occupation. The results indicated that, in many identity domains, commitment and indepth exploration were found to be significant positive predictors of well-being, while reconsideration of commitment was found to be a negative predictor. However, after analyzing all domains and controlling for shared variance, it was concluded that the domains were not equivocal in their contributions to well-being but rather that the personality domain was the most important with respect to well-being.

TI  - Fine-scale perspectives on landscape phenology from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photography
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest phenology is a multi-scale phenomenon, arising from processes in leaves and trees, with effects on the ecology of plant communities and landscapes. Because phenology controls carbon and water cycles, which are commonly observed at the ecosystem scale (e.g. eddy flux measurements), it is important to characterize the relation between phenophase transition events at different spatial scales. We use aerial photography recorded from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to observe plant phenology over a large area (5.4 ha) and across diverse communities, with spatial and temporal resolution at the scale of individual tree crowns and their phenophase transition events (10 m spatial resolution, similar to 5 day temporal resolution in spring, weekly in autumn). We validate UAV-derived phenophase transition dates through comparison with direct observations of tree phenology, PhenoCam image analysis, and satellite remote sensing. We then examine the biological correlates of spatial variance in phenology using a detailed species inventory and land cover classification. Our results show that species distribution is the dominant factor in spatial variability of ecosystem phenology. We also explore statistical relations governing the scaling of phenology from an organismic scale (10 m) to forested landscapes (1 km) by analyzing UAV photography alongside Landsat and MODIS data. From this analysis we find that spatial standard deviation in transition dates decreases linearly with the logarithm of increasing pixel size. We also find that fine-scale phenology aggregates to a coarser scale as the median and not the mean date in autumn, indicating coarser scale phenology is less sensitive to the tails of the distribution of sub-pixel transitions in the study area. Our study is the first to observe forest phenology in a spatially comprehensive, whole-ecosystem way, yet with fine enough spatial resolution to describe organism-level correlates and scaling phenomena.

TI  - Spatio-temporal analysis of irrigation infrastructure development and long-term changes in irrigated areas in Upper Kharun catchment, Chhattisgarh, India
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Upper Kharun Catchment (UKC), which is part of the new State Chhattisgarh formed in 2000, features considerable population growth, expansion of urban areas and dynamic changes in irrigation infrastructure as well as irrigation practices (spatial extension, temporal intensification, increasing use of groundwater as source) for meeting the increasing food demand. Water intensive rice is the major crop of the area. UKC has a comprehensive canal irrigation system which provides the link to water supply from reservoirs fed from areas outside the UKC. However, water provision for irrigation via the canal system for irrigation is restricted to only post-monsoon season. As a consequence, groundwater remains the only source of irrigation water in summer and winter seasons. Improved electricity facilities and subsidy on groundwater pumping have triggered an enormous increase in groundwater withdrawals. Remote sensing satellite images along with ground observed data were used in this study to spatially identify the areas with canal .and groundwater irrigation. Results reveal that in 2011, around 50% of the area of the UKC benefits from canal irrigation, whereas 29.8% area is irrigated by groundwater. Around 103 villages in the UKC have no canal infrastructures. 216 villages in UKC are considered as 'hotspot areas' because of high groundwater withdrawal (irrigated area exceeding 75 ha per village), There has been threefold increase in groundwater irrigated area in UKC between 1991 and 2011. The upward trend of groundwater use indicates an alarming situation towards over-exploitation and creates the need to provide and analyze data on the use of groundwater resources in the area in order to detect past and to estimate future trends referring to groundwater withdrawals. These data are a prerequisite for enabling careful and foresightful management of groundwater resources especially at spatially identified hotspot areas towards ensuring sustainable management of this resource.

TI  - Response of heterogeneous vegetation to aerosol radiative forcing over a northeast Indian station
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Importance of atmospheric aerosols through direct and indirect effects on hydrological cycle is highlighted through multiple studies. This study tries to find how much the aerosols can affect evapotranspiration (ET), a key component of the hydrological cycle over high NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index)/dense canopy, over Dibrugarh, known for vast tea plantation. The radiative effects of aerosols are calculated using satellite (Terra-MODIS) and reanalysis data on daily and monthly scales. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) obtained from satellite and ground observations compares well. Aerosol radiative forcing (ARF), calculated using MERRA data sets of 'clean-clear radiation' and 'clear-radiation' at the surface, shows a lower forcing efficiency, 35 Wm(-ZS), that is about half of that of ground observations. As vegetation controls ET over high NDVI area to the maximum and that gets modified through ARF, a regression equation is fitted between ET, AOD and NDVI for this station as ET = 0.25 + (-84.27) x AOD + (131.51) x NDVI that explains 82% of 'daily' Er variation using easily available satellite data. ET is found to follow net radiation closely and the direct relation between soil moisture and ET is weak on daily scale over this station as it may be acting through NDVI. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Analysis of diurnal surface temperature variations for the assessment of surface urban heat island effect over Indian cities
T2  - ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - Alterations in the urban surfaces elevate the surface and air temperature in the urban boundary than the surrounding rural area result in urban heat island effect. The present study has been carried out to explore the urban heat island effect for the two-time-frame i.e. day time and night time using remote sensing data from Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor of two Indian cities, Ahmedabad and Jaipur. Land surface temperature is used as the key parameter for surface urban heat island studies in the present study. Inverse or negative surface urban heat island effect has been observed over Jaipur whereas moderate or very weak surface urban heat island effect is observed over Ahmedabad during the daytime, whereas strong surface urban heat island effect is observed during night time over both cities. The study indicates that the higher temperature has been observed during the daytime, but the phenomenon of urban heat island is prevalent only during night time. The contrast diurnal land surface temperature variations over these cities have been analyzed in the current study. To support this remote sensing analysis, in-situ surface temperature measurement study has been conducted on various surfaces (anthropogenic and natural) at Jaipur for 24 h temperature monitoring. The study illustrates that soil has a property of rapidly heating up as well as cooling down than the anthropogenic materials like road and concrete observed under this in-situ temperature measurement. Thermal characteristics of various surface materials influence the diurnal behavior of land surface temperature. The study shows that vegetation cover has the lowest temperature during the entire duration of observation. Time of observation is very important for analyzing the efficacy of remote sensing data for surface temperature variations for different land covers and surface urban heat island studies. Urban heat island varies during the day, and it is more significant during the evening/night. In general, heat island phenomenon is apparent at nighttime. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Monitoring the vegetation activity in China using vegetation health indices
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Terrestrial vegetation plays pivotal roles on land-atmosphere interactions, and even global climate change. However, limited attempts have been taken to elucidate the responses of vegetation activity to weather-related drivers (e.g., droughts, floods). This is especially in China with vast area and changeable meteorological conditions. In this paper, the performance of two satellite-based indices, namely vegetation condition index (VCI) and vegetation health index (VHI) were analyzed to detect the vegetation responses to weather-related variations. The dynamics of vegetation activity in China were further examined for the period 1982-2013. We found widely-distributed vegetation stresses in the entire country for a long period (about an average of two months per year) from the VCI and the VHI. In addition, both the two indices indicated increasing vegetation activities over most parts of China during 1982-2013. However, there is no consensus between the two indices at spatial pattern and regional totals. This discrepancy can be due to the negative-correlation assumption of the VHI between the VCI and bright temperature. However, we found that the relationship between the VCI and temperature could be changeable in different regions, especially in China with complex topography, diverse climate conditions and different vegetation types. The findings of this paper highlight the necessity to account for dominant controls on vegetation growth when using the VCI and the VHI to analyze vegetation activity.

TI  - Differential tolerance to nickel between <i>Dreissena</i> <i>polymorpha</i> and <i>Dreissena</i> <i>rostriformis</i> <i>bugensis</i> populations
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Differential tolerance to stress is partly responsible for the heterogeneity of biomarker responses between populations of a sentinel species. Although currently used for freshwater biomonitoring, studies concerning inter-populational variability in tolerance to contaminants for the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) are scarce. Moreover, this well-known invader is currently replaced by another, the quagga mussel (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis). To evaluate the differential tolerance between dreissenids, several populations of both species were exposed to a high concentration of nickel. A LT50 (time when 50% of individuals were dead) was established for each population. Biomarker responses and internal nickel concentration were also measured, to link tolerance with physiological status. Results evidenced that D. polymorpha populations are more heterogeneous and more tolerant than D. r. bugensis ones. For D. polymorpha populations only, LT50 values were positively correlated with the nickel contamination in situ, with higher anti-oxidative defences and a higher Integrated Biomarker Response value in the field. Such findings may be explained by local adaptation and invasion dynamic within each species. The significance of this differential tolerance when using biomarker responses for biomonitoring purposes is thus discussed.

T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Peri-urbanisation is the expansion of compact urban areas towards low-density settlements. This phenomenon directly challenges the agricultural landscape multifunctionality, including its carbon (C) storage capacity. Using satellite data, we mapped peri-urban C stocks in soil and built-up surfaces over three areas from 1993 to 2014 in the Emilia-Romagna region, Italy: a thinly populated area around Piacenza, an intermediate-density area covering the Reggio Emilia-Modena conurbation and a densely anthropized area developing along the coast of Rimini. Satellite-derived maps enabled the quantitative analysis of spatial and temporal features of urban growth and soil sealing, expressed as the ratio between C in built-up land and organic C in soils (Cc/Co). The three areas show substantial differences in C stock balance and soil sealing evolution. In Piacenza (Cc/Co = 0.07 in 1993), although questioned by late industrial expansion and connected residential sprawl (Cc/Co growth by 38%), most of the new urbanisation spared the best rural soils. The Reggio Emilia-Modena conurbation, driven by the polycentricism of the area and the heterogeneity of economic sectors (Cc/Co rising from 0.08 to 0.14 from 1993 to 2014), balances sprawl and densification. Rimini, severely sealed since the 1960s (Cc/Co = 0.23 in 1993), densifies its existing settlements and develops an industrial expansion of the hinterland, with Cc/Co growth accelerating from + 15% before 2003 to + 36% for the last decade.

TI  - Response of ecosystem productivity to dry/wet conditions indicated by different drought indices
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Various climatic and hydrological variables such as precipitation, soil moisture, stream flow, and water level can be used to assess drought conditions, however, the response of ecosystem productivity to such metrics is not very clear. In this study, we examined the sensitivity of GPP anomalies to five drought indicators: the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), deficit of soil moisture (DSM), and the difference between precipitation (P) and evapotranspiration (ET) (D(P-ET)). The global spatial distributions of drying and wetting trends from 2000 to 2014 determined by these five indices were similar. Additionally, the percent of drought-impacted areas decreased over the study period, indicating a reduction in drought conditions. GPP increased over the study period in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) but decreased in the Southern Hemisphere (SH), resulting in a net increase in global GPP. GPP anomalies were more sensitive to drought indices in the SH than in the NH. Among the five indices, GPP anomalies were most closely correlated with SPI in the NH (R = 0.60, P < 0.05) and SPEI in the SH (R = 0.93, P < 0.01). Regionally speaking, annual and seasonal GPP anomalies were most sensitive to DSM and PDSI, highlighting the importance of soil moisture observations to regional drought monitoring and assessment. The results of this study are important for evaluating the impacts of drought on ecosystem production and the global carbon cycle. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Incorporating diffuse radiation into a light use efficiency and evapotranspiration model: An 11-year study in a high latitude deciduous forest
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The fraction of diffuse photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) reaching the land surface is one of the biophysical factors regulating carbon and water exchange between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere. This is especially relevant for high latitude ecosystems, where cloudy days are prevalent. Without considering impacts of diffuse PAR, traditional 'top-down' models of ecosystem gross primary productivity (GPP) and evapo-transpiration (ET), which use satellite remote sensing observations, are biased towards clear sky conditions. This study incorporated a cloudiness index (CI), an index for the fraction of diffuse PAR, into a Joint 'top-down' model that uses the same set of biophysical constraints to simulate GPP and ET for a high latitude temperate deciduous forest. To quantify the diffuse PAR effects, CI along with other environmental variables derived from an eleven year eddy covariance data set were used to statistically explore the independent and joint effects of diffuse PAR on GPP, ET, incident light use efficiency (LUE), evaporative fraction (EF) and ecosystem water use efficiency (WUE). The independent and joint effects of CI were compared from global sensitivity analysis of the 'top-down' models. Results indicate that for independent effects, CI increased GPP, LUE, ET, EF and WUE. Analysis of joint effects shows that CI mainly interacted with the radiation intercepted in the canopy (PAR, net radiation and leaf area index) to influence GPP, ET and WUE. Moreover, Ta and vapor pressure saturation deficit played a major role for the joint influence of CI on LUE and EF. In the growing season from May to October, variation in CI accounts for 11.9%, 3.0% and 7.8% of the total variation of GPP, ET and transpiration, respectively. As the influence of CI on GPP is larger than that on ET, this leads to an increase in WUE with CI. Joint GPP and ET model results showed that when including CI, the root mean square errors (RMSE) of daily GPP decreased from 1.64 to 1.45 g C m(-2) d(-1) (11.7% reduction) and ET from 15.79 to 14.50 W m(-2) (8.2% reduction). Due to the interaction of diffuse PAR with plant canopies, the largest model improvements using CI for GPP and ET occurred during the growing season and for the transpiration component, as suggested by comparisons to sap flow measurements. Furthermore, our study suggests a potential biophysical mechanism, not considered in other studies: under high diffuse PAR conditions, due to the increased longwave emission from clouds, canopy temperature gets higher and enhances GPP and transpiration in this temperature-limited high latitude ecosystem.

TI  - Impacts of the seasonal distribution of rainfall on vegetation productivity across the Sahel
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change in drylands has caused alterations in the seasonal distribution of rainfall including increased heavy-rainfall events, longer dry spells, and a shifted timing of the wet season. Yet the aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) in drylands is usually explained by annual-rainfall sums, disregarding the influence of the seasonal distribution of rainfall. This study tested the importance of rainfall metrics in the wet season (onset and cessation of the wet season, number of rainy days, rainfall intensity, number of consecutive dry days, and heavy-rainfall events) for growing season ANPP. We focused on the Sahel and northern Sudanian region (100-800 mm yr(-1)) and applied daily satellite-based rainfall estimates (CHIRPS v2.0) and growing-season-integrated normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI; MODIS) as a proxy for ANPP over the study period: 2001-2015. Growing season ANPP in the arid zone (100-300 mm yr(-1)) was found to be rather insensitive to variations in the seasonal-rainfall metrics, whereas vegetation in the semi-arid zone (300-700 mm yr(-1)) was significantly impacted by most metrics, especially by the number of rainy days and timing (onset and cessation) of the wet season. We analysed critical breakpoints for all metrics to test if vegetation response to changes in a given rainfall metric surpasses a threshold beyond which vegetation functioning is significantly altered. It was shown that growing season ANPP was particularly negatively impacted after > 14 consecutive dry days and that a rainfall intensity of similar to 13 mm day(-1) was detected for optimum growing season ANPP. We conclude that the number of rainy days and the timing of the wet season are seasonal-rainfall metrics that are decisive for favourable vegetation growth in the semi-arid Sahel and need to be considered when modelling primary productivity from rainfall in the drylands of the Sahel and elsewhere.

TI  - Relationship among land surface temperature and LUCC, NDVI in typical karst area
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) can reflect the land surface water-heat exchange process comprehensively, which is considerably significant to the study of environmental change. However, research about LST in karst mountain areas with complex topography is scarce. Therefore, we retrieved the LST in a karst mountain area from Landsat 8 data and explored its relationships with LUCC and NDVI. The results showed that LST of the study area was noticeably affected by altitude and underlying surface type. In summer, abnormal high-temperature zones were observed in the study area, perhaps due to karst rocky desertification. LSTs among different land use types significantly differed with the highest in construction land and the lowest in woodland. The spatial distributions of NDVI and LST exhibited opposite patterns. Under the spatial combination of different land use types, the LST-NDVI feature space showed an obtuse-angled triangle shape and showed a negative linear correlation after removing water body data. In summary, the LST can be retrieved well by the atmospheric correction model from Landsat 8 data. Moreover, the LST of the karst mountain area is controlled by altitude, underlying surface type and aspect. This study provides a reference for land use planning, ecological environment restoration in karst areas.

TI  - Influence of monsoonal winds on chlorophyll-α distribution in the Beibu Gulf
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The influence of seasonal, monsoonal winds on the temporal and spatial variability of chlorophyll-a (chl-a) in the Beibu Gulf is studied based on long-term satellite data of sea surface winds, chl-a concentration and sea surface temperature (SST) and in-situ observations for the years from 2002 to 2014. The analysis results indicated that under northeasterly monsoonal winds, chl-a concentrations were substantially elevated in most area of the Beibu Gulf, with a high chl-a concentration (>2 mg m(-3)) patch extending southwestward from the coastal water of the northeastern Gulf, consistent with the winter wind pattern. Meanwhile, the spatial distribution of high chl-a concentration is correlated with low SST in the northeastern Gulf. In the southern Gulf, there was generally low chl-a, except in the coastal waters southwest of Hainan Island. Here, the upwelling cold water prevails outside the mouth of the Beibu Gulf, driven by the southwesterly monsoonal winds and the runoff from the Changhua River, as implied by low observed SST. Correlation analysis indicated the chl-a concentration was strongly modulated by wind speed (r = 0.63, p<0.001), particularly in the middle of the northern Gulf and southern Hainan Island (r>0.7, p<0.001). Integrated analysis also showed that stratification is weak and mixing is strong in winter as affected by the high wind speed, which suggests that the wind-induced mixing is a dominant mechanism for entrainment of nutrients and the spatial distribution of chl-a in winter.

TI  - Recent glacier mass balance and area changes in the Kangri Karpo Mountains from DEMs and glacier inventories
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the influence of the Indian monsoon, the Kangri Karpo Mountains in the south-east of the Tibetan Plateau is in the most humid and one of the most important and concentrated regions containing maritime (temperate) glaciers. Glacier mass loss in the Kangri Karpo is an important contributor to global mean sea level rise, and changes run-off distribution, increasing the risk of glacial-lake outburst floods (GLOFs). Because of its inaccessibility and high labour costs, information about the Kangri Karpo glaciers is still limited. Using geodetic methods based on digital elevation models (DEMs) derived from 1980 topographic maps from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) (2000) and from TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X (2014), this study has determined glacier elevation changes. Glacier area and length changes between 1980 and 2015 were derived from topographical maps and Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI images. Results show that the Kangri Karpo contained 1166 glaciers with an area of 2048 : 50 +/- 48 : 65 km(2) in 2015. Ice cover diminished by 679 : 51 +/- 59 : 49 km(2) (24 : 9 +/- 2 : 2%) or 0 : 71 +/- 0 : 06% a(-1) from 1980 to 2015, although nine glaciers advanced. A glacierized area of 788.28 km(2), derived from DEM differencing, experienced a mean mass loss of 0 : 46 +/- 0 : 08 mw : e : a(-1) from 1980 to 2014. Shrinkage and mass loss accelerated significantly from 2000 to 2015 compared to 1980-2000, consistent with a warming climate.

T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: We compared trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) in preventing outpatient and inpatient influenza cases in Navarre, Spain. Methods: During seasons 2010/11 to 2015/16, community-dwelling patients with influenza-like illness aged 50 years or older were tested for influenza when attended by sentinel general practitioners or admitted to hospitals. The test-negative design was used to estimate and compare the VE by healthcare setting. Results: We compared 1,242 laboratory-confirmed influenza cases (557 outpatient and 685 inpatient cases) and 1,641 test-negative controls. Influenza VE was 34% (95% confidence interval (CI): 6 to 54) in outpatients and 32% (95% CI: 15 to 45) in inpatients. VE in outpatients and inpatients was, respectively, 41% (95% CI: -1 to 65) and 36% (95% CI: 12 to 53) against A(H1N1) pdm09, 5% (95% CI: -58 to 43) and 22% (95% CI: -9 to 44) against A(H3N2), and 49% (95% CI, 6 to 73) and 37% (95% CI: 2 to 59) against influenza B. Trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine was not associated with a different probability of hospitalisation among influenza cases, apart from a 54% (95% CI: 10 to 76) reduction in hospitalisation of influenza A(H3N2) cases. Conclusions: On average, influenza VE was moderate and similar in preventing outpatient and inpatient influenza cases over six influenza seasons in patients above 50 years of age. In some instances of low VE, vaccination may still reduce the risk of hospitalisation in older adults with vaccine failure.

TI  - Synoptic ozone, cloud reflectivity, and erythemal irradiance from sunrise to sunset for the whole earth as viewed by the DSCOVR spacecraft from the earth-sun Lagrange 1 orbit
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - EPIC (Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera) on board the DSCOVR (Deep Space Climate Observatory) spacecraft is the first earth science instrument located near the earth-sun gravitational plus centrifugal force balance point, Lagrange 1. EPIC measures earth-reflected radiances in 10 wavelength channels ranging from 317.5 to 779.5 nm. Of these channels, four are in the UV range 317.5, 325, 340, and 388 nm, which are used to retrieve O-3, 388 nm scene reflectivity (LER: Lambert equivalent reflectivity), SO2, and aerosol properties. These new synoptic quantities are retrieved for the entire sunlit globe from sunrise to sunset multiple times per day as the earth rotates in EPIC's field of view. Retrieved ozone amounts agree with ground-based measurements and satellite data to within 3 %. The ozone amounts and LER are combined to derive the erythemal irradiance for the earth's entire sunlit surface at a nadir resolution of 18 x 18 km(2) using a computationally efficient approximation to a radiative transfer calculation of irradiance. The results show very high summertime values of the UV index (UVI) in the Andes and Himalayas (greater than 18), and high values of UVI near the Equator at equinox.

TI  - Brief communication: The Khurdopin glacier surge revisited - extreme flow velocities and formation of a dammed lake in 2017
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier surges occur regularly in the Karakoram, but the driving mechanisms, their frequency and its relation to a changing climate remain unclear. In this study, we use digital elevation models and Landsat imagery in combination with high-resolution imagery from the Planet satellite constellation to quantify surface elevation changes and flow velocities during a glacier surge of the Khurdopin Glacier in 2017. Results reveal that an accumulation of ice volume above a clearly defined steep section of the glacier tongue since the last surge in 1999 eventually led to a rapid surge in May 2017 peaking with velocities above 5000 m a(-1), which were among the fastest rates globally for a mountain glacier. Our data reveal that velocities on the lower tongue increase steadily during a 4-year build-up phase prior to the actual surge only to then rapidly peak and decrease again within a few months, which confirms earlier observations with a higher frequency of available velocity data. The surge return period between the reported surges remains relatively constant at ca. 20 years. We show the potential of a combination of repeat Planet and ASTER imagery to (a) capture peak surge velocities that are easily missed by less frequent Landsat imagery, (b) observe surface changes that indicate potential drivers of a surge and (c) monitor hazards associated with a surge. At Khurdopin specifically, we observe that the surging glacier blocks the river in the valley and causes a lake to form, which may grow in subsequent years and could pose threats to downstream settlements and infrastructure in the case of a sudden breach.

TI  - Time Series Land Cover Mapping and Change Detection Analysis Using Geographic Information System and Remote Sensing, Northern Ethiopia
T2  - AIR SOIL AND WATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use planners require up-to-date and spatially accurate time series land resources information and changing pattern for future management. As a result, assessing the status of land cover change due to population growth and arable expansion, land degradation and poor resource management, partial implementation of policy strategies, and poorly planned infrastructural development is essential. Thus, the objective of the study was to quantify the spatiotemporal dynamics of land use land cover change between 1995 and 2014 using 5 multitemporal cloud-free Landsat Thematic Mapper images. The maximum likelihood (ML)-supervised classification technique was applied to create signature classes for significant land cover categories using means and variances of the training data to estimate the probability that a pixel is a member of a class. The final Bayesian ML classification resulted in 12 major land cover units, and the spatiotemporal change was quantified using post-classification and statistical change detection techniques. For a period of 20 years, there was a continuously increasing demand for arable areas, which can be represented by an exponential growth model. Excepting the year 2009, the built- up area has shown a steady increase due to population growth and its need for infrastructure development. There was nearly a constant trend for water bodies with a change in slope significantly less than +0.01%. The 2014 land cover change statistics revealed that the area was mainly covered by cultivated, wood, bush, shrub, grass, and forest land mapping units accounting nearly 63%, 12%, 8%, 6%, 4%, and 2% of the total, respectively. Land cover change with agro-climatic zones, soil types, and slope classes was common in most part of the area and the conversion of grazing land into plantation trees and closure area development were major changes in the past 20 years.

TI  - Recognizing the rapid expansion of rubber plantation - a threat to native forest in parts of northeast India
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - With the current trend of land use/land cover (LULC) change taking place globally, several parts of northeast India are also showing signs of change in LULC pattern leading to forest loss. This study focusses on the expansion of monoculture rubber plantation (Hevea brasiliensis) in selected sub-watersheds in northeast India, and distributed in parts of north Tripura, Mizoram and a major portion in the Karimganj district of Assam. Remote sensing and GIS technique has been used to map and analyse the extent of rubber plantation using temporal IRS LISS III satellite data from 1997 to 2013. It has been observed that rubber plantation increased from 4.47 sq. km to 28.42 sq. km in various parts of the study area. The expansion was more rapid during recent times, i.e. during 2010 to 2013. The plantation took place in dense forest, open forest and degraded forest areas. The spread of the plantation was also observed in one reserved forest located within the study area. There are several instances of negative impacts of rubber plantation expansion in Southeast Asia. Similar expansion of rubber plantation has been observed in northeast India as well. Further spread of rubber plantations in the region needs to be regulated to avoid conversion of dense and reserved forest areas by fostering use of mixed cropping methods instead of rubber monocultures, and by adopting more sustainable land use and management practices.

Magnetic basement depth and thickness of the sediments were computed by means of quantitative interpretation techniques. A number of alternate basement ridges/highs/uplifted blocks and depressions/lows/downthrown blocks were also delineated. The lithological variations, major folding and faulting patterns, circular spectral anomalies and other geological structures were interpreted from IRS-1C satellite data. The tectonic framework and deformational history of the basin were deduced. The results obtained from the interpretation of aeromagnetic and satellite data were then integrated and the potential zones of hydrocarbon deposits and vulnerable areas for earthquake occurrence were derived.

TI  - Cloud Detection of ZY-3 Satellite Remote Sensing Images Based on Deep Learning
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The cloud detection method of ZY-3 satellite remote sensing images based on deep learning is proposed to solve the problem of the images with few image bands and limited spectral range. Firstly, we obtain the feature of remote sensing images measured with the unsupervised pre-training network structure of principal component analysis. Secondly, we put forward the adaptive pooling model, which can well mine images in order to reduce the loss of image feature information in the pooling process. Finally, the image features arc input into the support vector machine classifier to obtain the cloud detection results. The typical regions arc selected for cloud detection experiments, and the detection results arc compared with that of the traditional Otsu method. The results show that the proposed method has high detection precision and is not limited by the spectral range, and it can be used for the multi -spectral and panchromatic images cloud detection of ZY-3 satellite.

TI  - Sustainable use of marine resources through offshore wind and mussel farm co-location
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) can offer significant benefits in terms of economic conservation strategies, optimizing spatial planning and minimizing the impact on the environment. In this paper; we focused on the application of multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) technique for co-locating offshore wind farms and open-water mussel cultivation. An index of co-location sustainability (SI) was developed based on the application of MCE technique constructed with physical and biological parameters on the basis of remote sensing data. The relevant physical factors considered were wind velocity, depth range, concerning the site location for energy production, and sea surface temperature anomaly. The biological variables used were Chlorofill-a (as a measurement of the productivity) and Particle Organic Carbon (POC) concentration, in order to assess their influence on the probable benefits and complete the requirements of this management framework. This SI can be easily implemented to do a first order selection of the most promising areas to be more specifically studied in a second order approach based on local field data.

TI  - Polarization Performance in Space Ultraviolet Remote Sensing Spectral Instruments
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - To improve the performance of instrument and the inversion of remote sensing data, we analyze the influence of instrument optical system films on polarization. The xenon lamp, collimation system, Brewster polarizer and ultraviolet spectrometer are used to build a set of polarization response testing system. P polarized light and S polarized light polarization response characteristics of the instrument arc measured in the range from 200 nm to 320 nm ultraviolet wavelength band. The test result indicates that the instrument shows different polarization responses under P polarized and S polarized light irradiation. When the polarization is changing from S to P, the peak wavelength of ultraviolet spectrometer response changes from 290 nm to 275 nm. Meanwhile, the energy of ultraviolet spectrometer under double pieces diffuser reduces by 40%similar to 75% in comparison with single piece diffuser; under single piece diffuser and double pieces diffuser, spectrometer polarization response values both get maximum at 265 nm wavelength, while under double pieces diffuser, the polarization response of spectrometer is closer to unit value, and the variation of response to different polarization states is reduced, which is more suitable for the calibration requirement of the synchrotron radiation source.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: To understand the epidemiological characteristics of human rabies in China in 2016 and provide evidence for the control and prevention of human rabies. Methods: The incidence data of human rabies in China in 2016 were collected from national infectious disease reporting information management system. The surveillance data were collected from provinces of Shandong, Guizhou, Anhui, Hunan, Jiangsu and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. Excel 2013 software was used to process and summarize the data, the epidemiological characteristics of human rabies in China in 2016 were described by using indicators such as morbidity, mortality and constituent ratio. Results: A total of 644 human rabies cases were reported in 28 provinces in China in 2016, a decrease of 19.60% (157/801) compared with 2015. The provinces reporting high incidences of human rabies were Henan, Hunan, Guangxi and Guizhou, accounting for 39.44% (254/644) of the total cases. One case was reported in Qinghai province and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region respectively. The male to female ratio of the cases was 2.14∶1 (439/205), and the majority of the patients were farmers (444/644). Surveillance points in 6 provinces reported 1 281 340 persons seeking post-exposure treatment, of whom 1 018 367 were treated for dog bite or scratch. A total of 764 234 persons completed the vaccination series, accounting for 63.90% (764 234/1 195 956) of the persons with grade Ⅱ and Ⅲ exposures, and 28.89% (165 677/573 571) of the persons with grade Ⅲ exposure were treated with passive immunization product. The average density of dogs in each surveillance area was 7.03/100 persons, the average canine immunization rate was 37.64%. Conclusion: The incidence of human rabies has remained decline in China in 2016, the number of the affected provinces has increased and that has the tendency of spreading to low-risk regions. The cases mainly occurred in men and farmers, and caused by dog bite or scratch. It is necessary to strengthen the health education about rabies prevention and control in rural areas and expand the coverage of canine immunization to prevent and control human rabies.

TI  - Error sources in the retrieval of aerosol information over bright surfaces from satellite measurements in the oxygen A band
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Retrieving aerosol optical thickness and aerosol layer height over a bright surface from measured top-of-atmosphere reflectance spectrum in the oxygen A band is known to be challenging, often resulting in large errors. In certain atmospheric conditions and viewing geometries, a loss of sensitivity to aerosol optical thickness has been reported in the literature. This loss of sensitivity has been attributed to a phenomenon known as critical surface albedo regime, which is a range of surface albedos for which the top-of-atmosphere reflectance has minimal sensitivity to aerosol optical thickness. This paper extends the concept of critical surface albedo for aerosol layer height retrievals in the oxygen A band, and discusses its implications. The underlying physics are introduced by analysing the top-of-atmosphere reflectance spectrum as a sum of atmospheric path contribution and surface contribution, obtained using a radiative transfer model. Furthermore, error analysis of an aerosol layer height retrieval algorithm is conducted over dark and bright surfaces to show the dependence on surface reflectance. The analysis shows that the derivative with respect to aerosol layer height of the atmospheric path contribution to the top-of-atmosphere reflectance is opposite in sign to that of the surface contribution - an increase in surface brightness results in a decrease in information content. In the case of aerosol optical thickness, these derivatives are anti-correlated, leading to large retrieval errors in high surface albedo regimes. The consequence of this anti-correlation is demonstrated with measured spectra in the oxygen A band from the GOME-2 instrument on board the Metop-A satellite over the 2010 Russian wildfires incident.

TI  - Size Class Dependent Relationships between Temperature and Phytoplankton Photosynthesis-Irradiance Parameters in the Atlantic Ocean
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past decade, a number of methods have been developed to estimate size-class primary production from either in situ phytoplankton pigment data or remotely-sensed data. In this context, the first objective of this study was to compare two methods of estimating size class specific (micro-, nano-, and pico-phytoplankton) photosynthesis-irradiance (PE) parameters from pigment data. The second objective was to analyse the relationship between environmental variables (temperature, nitrate and PAR) and PE parameters in the different size-classes. A large dataset was used of simultaneous measurements of the PE parameters (n = 1,260) and phytoplankton pigment markers (n = 2,326), from 3 different institutes. There were no significant differences in mean PE parameters of the different size classes between the chemotaxonomic method of Uitz et al. (2008) and the pigment markers and carbon-to-Chl a ratios method of Sathyendranath et al. (2009). For both methods, mean maximum photosynthetic rates (P-m(B)) for micro-phytoplankton were significantly lower than those for pico-phytoplankton and nano-phytoplankton. The mean light limited slope (alpha(B)) for nano-phytoplankton were significantly higher than for the other size taxa. For micro-phytoplankton dominated samples identified using the Sathyendranath et al. (2009) method, both P-m(B) and alpha(B) exhibited a significant, positive linear relationship with temperature, whereas for pico-phytoplankton the correlation with temperature was negative. Nano-phytoplankton dominated samples showed a positive correlation between P-m(B) and temperature, whereas for alpha(B) and the light saturation parameter (E-k) the correlations were not significant. For the Uitz et al. (2008) method, only micro-phytoplankton P-m(B), pico-phytoplankton alpha(B), nano- and pico-phytoplankton E-k exhibited significant relationships with temperature. The temperature ranges occupied by the size classes derived using these methods differed. The Uitz et al. (2008) method exhibited a wider temperature range compared to those derived from the Sathyendranath et al. (2009) method. The differences arise from the classification of mixed populations. Based on these patterns, we therefore recommend using the Sathyendranath et al. (2009) method to derive micro-phytoplankton PE parameters at sea water temperatures up to 8 degrees C during monospecific blooms and the Uitz et al. (2008) method to derive PE parameters of mixed populations over the temperature range from 8 to 18 degrees C. Both methods exhibited similar relationships between pico-phytoplankton PE parameters and temperatures >18 degrees C.

TI  - Propagation Characteristics of Internal Waves in the Strait of Gibraltar Based on MODIS Remote Sensing Images
T2  - LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) images from 2014 to 2016 are collected in the Strait of Gibraltar (SOG). The temporal and spatial characteristics of internal waves are analyzed statistically based on MOMS images. The optical remote sensing images show that internal waves generate at the cast of Camarinal sill, and concentrate at the western Mediterranean. The eastward propagation internal waves have are-like shape. The temporal distribution of internal waves shows that the majority of internal waves are observed in the second and third quarters. The generation and propagation characteristics of internal waves in the SOG are further studied by Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model (MITgem). Through the change of surface elevations and isotherms, the interaction between barotropic tide and the sill of the SOG is analyzed. The are-like eastward internal waves are generated nearby the jaw. The amplitude decreases with the increase of water depth and the strengthening of dispersion effect. The cast propagating internal waves disintegrate into a train of rank-ordered internal waves packets in the process of propagation. In addition, the width between the crest lines and the radius of the are-like crest line increase. The number of inertial wave in the wave packet increases. The simulation results are consistent with the results observed by optical remote sensors.

TI  - Atmospheric Correction Method for Sentinel-2 Satellite Imagery
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-2 is the second satellite of the world's environmental and safety monitoring system 'Copernicus plan', and it is an important data source for future remote sensing applications with high temporal-spatial resolution image. The simplified model for atmospheric correction (SMAC), 6S model and Sen2cor method arc used to carry out atmospheric correction for Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. The upper atmospheric apparent reflectance is converted to surface reflectance, and analysis combining with measured spectral data of ground objects is carried out. After the atmospheric correction of Sentinel-2 satellite image, the spectral curves of the image and measured objects have the same change tendency with a high fitting degree. The atmospheric correction results of three models have strong correlation and high precision. The accuracy of Sen2cor method is the highest, whose determination coefficient (R-2) is 0.8196, and root-mean-square error (E-rmse) is 0.0388, followed by 6S model and SMAC. From the analysis of normalized differential vegetation index (NDV1), we find that NDV1 values calculated by SMAC have the highest correlation with measured values, whose R-2 is 0.6389, and E-rmse is 0.093, followed by 6S model and Sen2cor method. Results show that the atmospheric correction accuracy of three methods is high. When the sentinel-2 satellite imagery is corrected, the image quality is improved obviously, and the availability is increased.

TI  - The Greater Caucasus Glacier Inventory (Russia, Georgia and Azerbaijan)
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - There have been numerous studies of glaciers in the Greater Caucasus, but none that have generated a modern glacier database across the whole mountain range. Here, we present an updated and expanded glacier inventory at three time periods (1960, 1986, 2014) covering the entire Greater Caucasus. Large-scale topographic maps and satellite imagery (Corona, Landsat 5, Landsat 8 and ASTER) were used to conduct a remote-sensing survey of glacier change, and the 30m resolution Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer Global Digital Elevation Model (ASTER GDEM; 17 November 2011) was used to determine the aspect, slope and height distribution of glaciers. Glacier margins were mapped manually and reveal that in 1960 the mountains contained 2349 glaciers with a total glacier surface area of 1674.9 +/- 70.4 km(2). By 1986, glacier surface area had decreased to 1482.1 +/- 64.4 km(2) (2209 glaciers), and by 2014 to 1193.2 +/- 54.0 km(2) (2020 glaciers). This represents a 28.8 +/- 4.4% (481 +/- 21.2 km(2)) or 0.53% yr(-1) reduction in total glacier surface area between 1960 and 2014 and an increase in the rate of area loss since 1986 (0.69% yr(-1)) compared to 1960-1986 (0.44% yr(-1)). Glacier mean size decreased from 0.70 km(2) in 1960 to 0.66 km(2) in 1986 and to 0.57 km(2) in 2014. This new glacier inventory has been submitted to the Global Land Ice Measurements from Space (GLIMS) database and can be used as a basis data set for future studies.

TI  - Initial Report of Sentinel Lymph Node Identification During Laparoscopic Radical Hysterectomy Using a New Gamma Probe Technology
T2  - JOURNAL OF LAPAROENDOSCOPIC & ADVANCED SURGICAL TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The standard surgical procedure for early-stage cervical cancer is abdominal radical hysterectomy, including pelvic lymphadenectomy. Currently, minimally invasive surgical techniques for early cervical cancer are progressing; total laparoscopic radical hysterectomy (TLRH) is a possible alternative to abdominal surgery. In addition, sentinel node navigation surgery (SNNS), which can prevent lower limb edema, has been widely used for radical hysterectomy. Materials and Methods: A radioisotope is injected into the uterine cervix 1 day preoperatively and surgeons carefully identify the correct sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) to prevent picking up the cervical gamma rays during surgery. Results: It is difficult to identify SLNs in laparoscopic surgery compared to abdominal surgery using the traditional gamma probe, which has the sensor on the tip, since this probe picks up the gamma rays from the uterine cervix. We described 11 cases in which TLRH was combined with SNNS using a new device that accurately detects correct SLNs. Conclusions: The SLNs were detected using a gamma probe that has a sensor built onto the side, without picking up the cervical gamma rays. We believe that the Neoprobe plays a crucial role in SNNS for accurately detecting SLNs and helping determine whether the patient needs to undergo SNNS.

TI  - Satellite observations for describing fire patterns and climate-related fire drivers in the Brazilian savannas
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Brazilian savannas (Cerrado biome) fires are natural and a tool for shifting land use; therefore, temporal and spatial patterns result from the interaction of climate, vegetation condition and human activities. Moreover, orbital sensors are the most effective approach to establish patterns in the biome. We aimed to characterize fire, precipitation and vegetation condition regimes and to establish spatial patterns of fire occurrence and their correlation with precipitation and vegetation condition in the Cerrado. The Cerrado was first and second biome for the occurrence of burned areas (BA) and hotspots, respectively. Occurrences are higher during the dry season and in the savanna land use. Hotspots and BA tend to decrease, and concentrate in the north, but more intense hotspots are not necessarily located where concentration is higher. Spatial analysis showed that averaged and summed values can hide patterns, such as for precipitation, which has the lowest average in August, but minimum precipitation in August was found in 7% of the Cerrado. Usually, there is a 2-3-month lag between minimum precipitation and maximum hotspots and BA, while minimum VCI and maximum hotspots and BA occur in the same month. Hotspots and BA are better correlated with VCI than precipitation, qualifying VCI as an indicator of the susceptibility of vegetation to ignition.

TI  - Examining the determinants and the spatial nexus of city-level CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in China: A dynamic spatial panel analysis of China's cities
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - China, now the world's top CO2 emitter, is facing increasingly pressure to instigate energy-saving and emission-reduction measures. As a result, great attention is being paid to the driving forces behind CO2 emissions in China; literature has to date, however, tended to exclude the city level, due to a scarcity of energy statistics at that scale. Using GIS technology and dynamic spatial panel data models, and aided by spatiotemporal modeling that integrates remote sensing data and statistical data, this study identifies the determinates and the spatial nexus of CO2 emissions at China's city level. The results show that the CO2 emissions of all of China's cities increased between 1992 and 2013, with the highest CO2 emission levels occurring in eastern, rather than western or central, China. In addition, an obvious spatial agglomeration effect was observed in city-level CO2 emissions, highlighting the influence cities exert on their neighbors. Our empirical results also emphasize the influence that factors such as economic growth, population, the industrialization level, capital investment, and population density all exert in relation to raising CO2 emissions; as such, the study found little evidence in support of the EKC hypothesis. These results, further, imply that if China persists in its current development pattern, the estimated factors will inevitably lead to increased CO2 emissions in the long term. Road density and the traffic coupling factor were, in contrast, both found to exert strong influences to the mitigation of CO2 emissions as such, improving the coupling degree between the urban spatial structure of a city and its traffic organization could play an important role in reducing CO2 emissions. Our findings merit attention from Chinese policy makers as they shed new light on the path toward developing low-carbon cities. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Building capacity for active surveillance of vaccine adverse events in the Americas: A hospital-based multi-country network
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - New vaccines designed to prevent diseases endemic in low and middle-income countries are being introduced without prior utilization in countries with robust vaccine pharmacovigilance systems. Our aim was to build capacity for active surveillance of vaccine adverse events in the Americas. We describe the implementation of a proof-of-concept study for the feasibility of an international collaborative hospital-based active surveillance system for vaccine safety. The study was developed and implemented in 15 sentinel sites located in seven countries of the region of the Americas, under the umbrella of the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Vaccine Safety Initiative. The study evaluated the associations between measles-mumps-rubella vaccines and two well-recognized adverse events: Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and aseptic meningitis. The regional network contributed 63 confirmed ITP and 16 confirmed aseptic meningitis eligible cases to the global study, representing, respectively, 33% and 19% of the total cases. To ensure long-term sustainability and usefulness to investigate adverse events following new vaccine introductions in low and middle-income countries, the network needs to be strengthened with additional sites and integrated into national health systems.

TI  - Mapping insecticide resistance in <i>Anopheles gambiae</i> (<i>s</i>.<i>l</i>.) from Cote d'Ivoire
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Insecticide resistance in malaria vectors is an increasing threat to vector control tools currently deployed in endemic countries. Resistance management must be an integral part of National Malaria Control Programmes' (NMCPs) next strategic plans to alleviate the risk of control failure. This obviously will require a clear database on insecticide resistance to support the development of such a plan. The present work gathers original data on insecticide resistance between 2009 and 2015 across Cote d'Ivoire in West Africa.Methods: Two approaches were adopted to build or update the resistance data in the country. Resistance monitoring was conducted between 2013 and 2015 in 35 sentinel sites across the country using the WHO standard procedure of susceptibility test on adult mosquitoes. Four insecticide families (pyrethroids, organochlorides, carbamates and organophosphates) were tested. In addition to this survey, we also reviewed the literature to assemble existing data on resistance between 2009 and 2015.Results: High resistance levels to pyrethroids, organochlorides and carbamates were widespread in all study sites whereas some Anopheles populations remained susceptible to organophosphates. Three resistance mechanisms were identified, involving high allelic frequencies of kdr L1014F mutation (range = 0.46-1), relatively low frequencies of ace-1(R) (below 0.5) and elevated activity of insecticide detoxifying enzymes, mainly mixed function oxidases (MFO), esterase and glutathione S-transferase (GST) in almost all study sites.Conclusion: This detailed map of resistance highlights the urgent need to develop new vector control tools to complement current long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) although it is yet unclear whether these resistance mechanisms will impact malaria transmission control. Researchers, industry, WHO and stakeholders must urgently join forces to develop alternative tools. By then, NMCPs must strive to develop effective tactics or plans to manage resistance keeping in mind country-specific context and feasibility.

TI  - Operational lessons learned in conducting a multi-country collaboration for vaccine safety signal verification and hypothesis testing: The global vaccine safety multi country collaboration initiative
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and effective evaluation of vaccine safety signals for newly developed vaccines introduced in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) is essential. The study tested the development of a global network of hospital-based sentinel sites for vaccine safety signal verification and hypothesis testing. Twenty-six sentinel sites in sixteen countries across all WHO regions participated, and 65% of the sites were from LMIC. We describe the process for the establishment and operationalization of such a network and the lessons learned in conducting a multi-country collaborative initiative. 24 out of the 26 sites successfully contributed data for the global analysis using standardised tools and procedures. Our study successfully confirmed the well-known risk estimates for the outcomes of interest. The main challenges faced by investigators were lack of adequate information in the medical records for case ascertainment and classification, and access to immunization data. The results suggest that sentinel hospitals intending to participate in vaccine safety studies strengthen their systems for discharge diagnosis coding, medical records and linkage to vaccination data. Our study confirms that a multi-country hospital-based network initiative for vaccine safety monitoring is feasible and demonstrates the validity and utility of large collaborative international studies to monitor the safety of new vaccines introduced in LMICs.

TI  - Cross calibration of GF-1 satellite wide field of view sensor with Landsat 8 OLI and HJ-1A HSI
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper focuses on cross calibrating the GaoFen (GF-1) satellite wide field of view (WFV) sensor using the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and HuanJing-1A (HJ-1A) hyperspectral imager (HSI) as reference sensors. Two methods are proposed to calculate the spectral band adjustment factor (SBAF). One is based on the HJ-1A HSI image and the other is based on ground-measured reflectance. However, the HSI image and ground-measured reflectance were measured at different dates, as the WFV and OLI imagers passed overhead. Three groups of regions of interest (ROIs) were chosen for cross calibration, based on different selection criteria. Cross-calibration gains with nonzero and zero offsets were both calculated. The results confirmed that the gains with zero offset were better, as they were more consistent over different groups of ROIs and SBAF calculation methods. The uncertainty of this cross calibration was analyzed, and the influence of SBAF was calculated based on different HSI images and ground reflectance spectra. The results showed that the uncertainty of SBAF was < 3% for bands 1 to 3. Two other large uncertainties in this cross calibration were variation of atmosphere and low ground reflectance.

TI  - Enhancing global vaccine pharmacovigilance: Proof-of-concept study on aseptic meningitis and immune thrombocytopenic purpura following measles-mumps containing vaccination
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - New vaccines designed to prevent diseases endemic in low and middle -income countries (LMICs) are now being introduced without prior record of utilization in countries with robust pharmacovigilance systems. To address this deficit, our objective was to demonstrate feasibility of an international hospital based network for the assessment of potential epidemiological associations between serious and rare adverse events and vaccines in any setting. This was done through a proof-of-concept evaluation of the risk of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and aseptic meningitis (AM) following administration of the first dose of measles-mumps-containing vaccines using the self-controlled risk interval method in the primary analysis. The World Health Organization (WHO) selected 26 sentinel sites (49 hospitals) distributed in 16 countries of the six WHO regions. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) of 5.0 (95% CI: 2.5-9.7) for ITP following first dose of measles-containing vaccinations, and of 10.9 (95% CI: 4.2-27.8) for AM following mumps-containing vaccinations were found. The strain-specific analyses showed significantly elevated ITP risk for measles vaccines containing Schwarz (IRR: 20.7; 95% CI: 2.7-157.6), Edmonston- Zagreb (IRR: 11.1; 95% CI: 1.4-90.3), and Enders'Edmonston (IRR: 8.5; 95% CI: 1.9-38.1) strains. A significantly elevated AM risk for vaccines containing the Leningrad-Zagreb mumps strain (IRR: 10.8; 95% CI: 1.3-87.4) was also found. This proof-of-concept study has shown, for the first time, that an international hospital-based network for the investigation of rare vaccine adverse events, using common standardized procedures and with high participation of LMICs, is feasible, can produce reliable results, and has the potential to characterize differences in risk between vaccine strains. The completion of this network by adding large reference hospitals, particularly from tropical countries, and the systematic WHO-led implementation of this approach, should permit the rapid post-marketing evaluation of safety signals for serious and rare adverse events for new and existing vaccines in all settings, including LMICs.

TI  - Ecosystem carbon emissions from 2015 forest fires in interior Alaska
T2  - CARBON BALANCE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In the summer of 2015, hundreds of wildfires burned across the state of Alaska, and consumed more than 1.6 million ha of boreal forest and wetlands in the Yukon-Koyukuk region. Mapping of 113 large wildfires using Landsat satellite images from before and after 2015 indicated that nearly 60% of this area was burned at moderateto-high severity levels. Field measurements near the town of Tanana on the Yukon River were carried out in July of 2017 in both unburned and 2015 burned forested areas (nearly adjacent to one-another) to visually verify locations of different Landsat burn severity classes (low, moderate, or high; LBS, MBS, HBS).Results: Field measurements indicated that the loss of surface organic layers in boreal ecosystem fires is a major factor determining post-fire soil temperature changes, depth of thawing, and carbon losses from the mineral topsoil layer. Measurements in forest sites showed that soil temperature profiles to 30 cm depth at burned forest sites were higher by an average of 8-10 degrees C compared to unburned forest sites. Sampling and laboratory analysis indicated a 65% reduction in soil carbon content and a 58% reduction in soil nitrogen content in severely burned sample sites compared to soil mineral samples from nearby unburned spruce forests.Conclusions: Combined with nearly unprecedented forest areas severely burned in the Interior region of Alaska in 2015, total ecosystem fire-related losses of carbon to the atmosphere exceeded most previous estimates for the state, owing mainly to inclusion of potential "mass wasting" and decomposition in the mineral soil carbon layer in the 2 years following these forest fires.

TI  - Excess of Mortality in Adults and Elderly and Circulation of Subtypes of Influenza Virus in Southern Brazil
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: In the elderly population, the influenza infection and its clinical complications are important causes of hospitalization and death, particularly, in longer-lived age. The objective of this study is to analyze the impact of influenza virus circulation on mortality in the elderly and adults, in years with different predominant virus strains.Methods: We performed a time trend study to evaluated excess of mortality for pneumonia and influenza, respiratory disease, and all-causes in southern region of Brazil, from 2002 to 2015. After considering other models, we opted for Serfling regression. Excess of death rates per 100,000 inhabitants were analyzed in specific age groups (24-59, 60-69, 70-79, >= 80 years) and by year of occurrence. Mortality information were taken from Brazilian Mortality Information System and etiological data were accessed in Sentinel Virological Surveillance database, getting the weekly positivity of the immunofluorescence tests for influenza A (H1N1, H3N2), and B.Results: In southern Brazil, there is an evident seasonal pattern of all death outcomes among different age groups in the dry and cold season (April-September). The highest excess mortality rates occurs among older, particularly in years of circulation of influenza AH3N2, especially among people >= 80 years, in 2003 and 2007 - years of great severity of influenza activity. After 2009, with the introduction of the pandemic influenza AH1N1, we observed a lower impact on the mortality of the elderly compared to < 60 years.Discussion: A cross reactivity antibody response from past exposure probably provided protection against disease in the elderly. Despite not controlling for comorbidities, climate, and vaccination, for the > 70 years, ratio of respiratory diseases excess mortality rates between AH1N1 (2009) and severe year of H3N2 (2007) shows protection in the pandemic year and great vulnerability during AH3N2 virus predominance.Conclusion: The reduced immune response to infection, and to vaccination, and presence of comorbidities recommend a special attention to this age group in Brazil. Besides medical assistance, the timeliness of vaccine campaigns, its composition, and etiological surveillance of respiratory diseases are some of the preventive and public health measures.

TI  - Survey to identify depth of penetration of critical incident reporting systems in Austrian healthcare facilities
T2  - INQUIRY-THE JOURNAL OF HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATION PROVISION AND FINANCING
M3  - Article
AB  - Incident reporting systems or so-called critical incident reporting systems (CIRS) were first recommended for use in health care more than 15 years ago. The uses of these CIRS are highly variable among countries, ranging from being used to report critical incidents, falls, or sentinel events resulting in death. In Austria, CIRS have only been introduced to the health care sector relatively recently. The goal of this work, therefore, was to determine whether and specifically how CIRS are used in Austria. A working group from the Austrian Society for Quality and Safety in Healthcare (ASQS) developed a survey on the topic of CIRS to collect information on penetration of CIRS in general and on how CIRS reports are used to increase patient safety. Three hundred seventy-one health care professionals from 274 health care facilities were contacted via e-mail. Seventy-eight respondents (21.0%) completed the online survey, thereof 66 from hospitals and 12 from other facilities (outpatient clinics, nursing homes). In all, 64.1% of the respondents indicated that CIRS were used in the entire health care facility; 20.6% had not yet introduced CIRS and 15.4% used CIRS only in particular areas. Most often, critical incidents without any harm to patients were reported (76.9%); however, some health care facilities also use their CIRS to report patient falls (16.7%), needle stick injuries (17.9%), technical problems (51.3%), or critical incidents involving health care professionals. CIRS are not yet extensively or homogeneously used in Austria. Inconsistencies exist with respect to which events are reported as well as how they are followed up and reported to health care professionals. Further recommendations for general use are needed to support the dissemination in Austrian health care environments.

TI  - Critical low temperature for the survival of <i>Aedes aegypti</i> in Taiwan
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Taiwan is geographically located in a region that spans both tropical and subtropical climates (22-25 degrees N and 120-122 degrees E). The Taiwan Centers for Disease Control have found that the ecological habitat of Aedes aegypti appears only south of 23.5 degrees N. Low temperatures may contribute to this particular habitat distribution of Ae. aegypti under the influence of the East Asian winter monsoon. However, the threshold condition related to critically low temperatures remains unclear because of the lack of large-scale spatial studies. This topic warrants further study, particularly through national entomological surveillance and satellite-derived land surface temperature (LST) data.Methods: We hypothesized that the distribution of Ae. aegypti is highly correlated with the threshold nighttime LST and that a critical low LST limits the survival of Ae. aegypti. A mosquito dataset collected from the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control was utilized in conjunction with image data obtained from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) during 2009-2011. Spatial interpolation and phi coefficient methods were used to analyze the correlation between the distributions of immature forms of Ae. aegypti and threshold LST, which was predicted from MODIS calculations for 348 townships in Taiwan.Results: According to the evaluation of the correlation between estimated nighttime temperatures and the occurrence of Ae. aegypti, winter had the highest peak phi coefficient, and the corresponding estimated threshold temperatures ranged from 13.7 to 14 degrees C in the ordinary kriging model, which was the optimal interpolation model in terms of the root mean square error. The mean threshold temperature was determined to be 13.8 degrees C, which is a critical temperature to limit the occurrence of Ae. aegypti.Conclusions: An LST of 13.8 degrees C was found to be the critical temperature for Ae. aegypti larvae, which results in the near disappearance of Ae. aegypti during winter in the subtropical regions of Taiwan under the influence of the prevailing East Asian winter monsoon.

AB  - Objective: To understand the epidemiological characteristics of Human coronavirus (HCoV), the patterns of emergence and circulation, and the genotype distribution of human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) from November, 2009 to April, 2016 in Shanghai. Methods: A total of 6 059 respiratory specimens, including pharyngeal swab, sputum, nasopharyngeal aspirates and alveolar lavage fluid, as well as relative clinical data were collected from patients with acute respiratory infections from seven sentinel hospitals during November, 2009 to April, 2016 in Shanghai. Respiratory specimens were tested by RT-PCR with HCoV-conserved primers and subsequently genotyped by DNA sequencing. Using specific primers to amplify and sequence full-length Spike (S), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) and nucleocapsid (N) gene from HCoV-OC43 positive samples. Further genotype and phylogenetic analysis of HCoV-OC43 were performed by conducting phylogenetic trees. Results: Among 6 059 patients, the total frequency of HCoV was 63 (1.04%), in which HCoV-OC43 was the most frequently detected species with 34 positive samples, followed by human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) with 18 and 10 positive sample respectively. However, other HCoV like human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), were not been detected, which illustrated that HCoV-OC43 was the dominant subtype. The full-length of S, RDRP and N gene were obtained from 29 HCoV-OC43 positive samples. According to the sequence-analysis, 27 of which was genotype D, 2 of which was genotype B and others genotype, including genotype E, F and G, were not detected. The result indicated that the genotype D may be the dominant genotype. Further analysis of S protein that help HCoV-OC43 to entry host cell and stimulate the host immune system to produce neutralizing antibody found that two important functional domains in S protein, N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) contained more amino acid substitution and positive selection sites, accompanied with amino acid insertion/deletion. 13 positive selection sites were all located in the NTD or RBD, 10 of which were located in the NTD and 3 in the RBD. Conclusion: Human coronavirus OC43 was the major circulation human coronaviurs in Shanghai from 2009 to 2016, in which genotype D was the dominant genotype. NTD and RBD regions of the S protein were hypervariable region during HCoV-OC43 evolution, and had amino acid substitutions as well as amino acid insertion/deletion.
AB  - 目的： 分析上海2009年11月至2016年4月人冠状病毒（HCoV）流行特征，以及HCoV-OC43基因型分布和变异变迁规律。 方法： 收集2009年11月至2016年4月期间上海7家哨点医院感染科急性呼吸道感染患者的临床资料和呼吸道样本，包括咽拭子、痰、鼻咽抽吸物和肺泡灌洗液，共6 059例。采用HCoV通用引物对患者样本进行检测并测序分型。HCoV-OC43阳性样本进一步采用特异性引物对刺突蛋白、依赖RNA的RNA聚合酶（RDRP）和核衣壳蛋白全基因进行扩增和测序，并通过全基因序列构建进化树对HCoV-OC43进行基因分型和进化分析。 结果： 共检出HCoV 63株（1.04%），其中HCoV-OC43检出数最多，为34株，其后依次是HCoV-229E和HCoV-HKU1，检出数分别为18和10株，而HCoV-NL63、重症急性呼吸综合征冠状病毒（SARS-CoV）和中东呼吸综合征冠状病毒（MERS-CoV）均未检出。29例HCoV-OC43阳性样本获得刺突蛋白、RDRP和核衣壳蛋白全基因序列，根据进化树分析显示，其中27例为D型，2例为B型，而其他基因型E、F、G均未检出，其中D型为主导基因型。进一步分析与HCoV-OC43进入宿主和中和抗体产生相关的刺突蛋白发现，刺突蛋白重要的功能结构域N端结构域（NTD）和受体结合结构域（RBD）含有较多氨基酸变异和阳性选择位点，并伴有氨基酸插入/缺失。13个阳性选择位点均位于NTD或RBD，其中10个位于NTD，3个位于RBD。 结论： 20092016年，上海流行的HCoV主要为HCoV-OC43，其中D型为优势基因型。刺突蛋白的NTD区和RBD区是HCoV-OC43进化过程中的高变区域，伴有氨基酸替换、氨基酸插入/缺失。.

TI  - Shoreline dynamics of the active Yellow River delta since the implementation of Water-Sediment Regulation Scheme: A remote-sensing and statistics-based approach
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Active Yellow River (Huanghe) Delta (AYRD) is a complex landform in which rapid deposition takes place due to its geologic formation and evolution. Continuous monitoring of shoreline dynamics at high temporal frequency is crucial for understanding the processes and the driving factors behind this rapidly changing coast. Great efforts have been devoted to map the changing shoreline of the Yellow River delta and explain such changes through remote sensing data. However, the temporal frequency of shoreline in the obtained datasets are generally not fine enough to reflect the detailed or subtly variable processes of shoreline retreat and advance. To overcome these limitations, we continuously monitored the dynamics of this shoreline using time series of Landsat data based on tidal-level calibration model and orthogonal-transect method. The Abrupt Change Value (ACV) results indicated that the retreat-advance patterns had a significant impact regardless of season or year. The Water-Sediment Regulation Scheme (WSRS) plays a dominant role in delivering river sediment discharge to the sea and has an impact on the annual average maximum ACV, especially at the mouth of the river. The positive relationship among the average ACV, runoff and sediment load are relatively obvious; however, we found that the Relative Exposure Index (REI) that measures wave energy was able to explain only approximately 20% of the variation in the data. Based on the abrupt change at the shoreline of the AYRD, river flow and time, we developed a binary regression model to calculate the critical sediment load and water discharge for maintaining the equilibrium of the active delta from 2002 to 2015. These values were approximately 0.48 x 10(8) t/yr and 144.37 x 10(8) m(3)/yr. If the current water and sediment proportions released from the Xiaolangdi Reservoir during the WSRS remain stable, the erosion-accretion patterns of the active delta will shift from rapid accretion to a dynamic balance.

TI  - Spatial complexities in aboveground carbon stocks of a semi-arid mangrove community: A remote sensing height-biomass-carbon approach
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves are integral to ecosystem services provided by the coastal zone, in particular carbon (C) sequestration and storage. Allometric relationships linking mangrove height to estimated biomass and C stocks have been developed from field sampling, while various forms of remote sensing has been used to map vegetation height and biomass. Here we combine both these approaches to investigate spatial patterns in living biomass of mangrove forests in a small area of mangrove in north-west Australia. This study used LiDAR data and Landsat 8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) with allometric equations to derive mangrove height, biomass, and C stock estimates. We estimated the study site, Mangrove Bay, a semiarid site in north-western Australia, contained 70 Mg ha(-1) biomass and 45 Mg C ha(-1) organic C, with total stocks of 2417 Mg biomass and 778 Mg organic C. Using spatial statistics to identify the scale of clustering of mangrove pixels, we found that living biomass and C stock declined with increasing distance from hydrological features (creek entrance: 0-150 m; y = -0.00041x + 0.9613, R-2 = 0.96; 150 -770 m; y = -0.0008x + 1.6808, R-2 = 0.73; lagoon: y = -0.0041x + 3.7943, R-2 = 0.78). Our results illustrate a set pattern of living C distribution within the mangrove forest, and then highlight the role hydrologic features play in determining C stock distribution in the arid zone.

TI  - Geospatial analysis of creeks evolution in the Indus Delta, Pakistan using multi sensor satellite data
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea level rise (SLR) in response to looming climate change is being considered as a major impediment to coastal areas. Acute wave activities and tidal propagations of semi-diurnal to mixed type are impairing the morphology of the Indus Delta in Pakistan. In this study a synthetic approach has been adopted using multi sensor satellite and ground data in order to integrate the individual effect of topography, oceanic activities and vegetative canopy for deduction of a synergic impact over the morphology of the Indus Delta creeks system from 1972 to 2017. Geomorphologic anomalies in the planform of fourteen major creeks were explored. Spatiotemporal variations suggested that a substantial amount of the delta alluvium had been engulfed by the Arabian Sea. On average, the creeks located on the right side of the Indus River were relatively less wide (3.9 km) than those of on the left side (5.2 km). Zonal statistics calculated with topographic position index (TPI) enabled to understand the tide induced inundation extents. The mangrove canopy on the right side was found greater, which is why tidal basins on that side experienced less erosive activities. Thus, it could be maintained that the coastal sedimentary processes may be monitored effectively with the remotely sensed data and temporal pattern of changes can be quantified for future planning and mitigation of adverse effects.

TI  - Above-ground biomass prediction by Sentinel-1 multitemporal data in central Italy with integration of ALOS2 and Sentinel-2 data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this research is to test Sentinel-1 SAR multitemporal data, supported by multispectral and SAR data at other wavelengths, for fine-scale mapping of above-ground biomass (AGB) at the provincial level in a Mediterranean forested landscape. The regression results indicate good accuracy of prediction (R-2 = 0.7) using integrated sensors when an upper bound of 400 Mg ha(-1) is used in modeling. Multitemporal SAR information was relevant, allowing the selection of optimal Sentinel-1 data, as broadleaf forests showed a different response in backscatter throughout the year. Similar accuracy in predictions was obtained when using SAR multifrequency data or joint SAR and optical data. Predictions based on SAR data were more conservative, and in line with those from an independent sample from the National Forest Inventory, than those based on joint data types. The potential of S1 data in predicting AGB can possibly be improved if models are developed per specific groups (deciduous or evergreen species) or forest types and using a larger range of ground data. Overall, this research shows the usefulness of Sentinel-1 data to map biomass at very high resolution for local study and at considerable carbon density. (C) The Authors.

TI  - Gross changes in forest area shape the future carbon balance of tropical forests
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Bookkeeping models are used to estimate land-use and land-cover change (LULCC) carbon fluxes (E-LULCC). The uncertainty of bookkeeping models partly arises from data used to define response curves (usually from local data) and their representativeness for application to large regions. Here, we compare biomass recovery curves derived from a recent synthesis of secondary forest plots in Latin America by Poorter et al. (2016) with the curves used previously in bookkeeping models from Houghton (1999) and Hansis et al. (2015). We find that the two latter models overestimate the long-term (100 years) vegetation carbon density of secondary forest by about 25 %. We also use idealized LULCC scenarios combined with these three different response curves to demonstrate the importance of considering gross forest area changes instead of net forest area changes for estimating regional E-LULCC. In the illustrative case of a net gain in forest area composed of a large gross loss and a large gross gain occurring during a single year, the initial gross loss has an important legacy effect on E-LULCC so that the system can be a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere long after the initial forest area change. We show the existence of critical values of the ratio of gross area change over net area change (gamma(Agross)(Anet)), above which cumulative E-LULCC is a net CO2 source rather than a sink for a given time horizon after the initial perturbation. These theoretical critical ratio values derived from simulations of a bookkeeping model are compared with observations from the 30m resolution Landsat Thematic Mapper data of gross and net forest area change in the Amazon. This allows us to diagnose areas in which current forest gains with a large land turnover will still result in LULCC carbon emissions in 20, 50 and 100 years.

TI  - Association of conventional ultrasound, elastography and clinicopathological factors with axillary lymph node status in invasive ductal breast carcinoma with sizes &gt; 10 mm
T2  - ONCOTARGET
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: To evaluate whether conventional ultrasound, elastography [conventional strain elastography of elasticity imaging, acoustic radiation force impulse induced strain elastography of virtual touch tissue imaging, and a novel two-dimensional shear wave elastography of virtual touch tissue imaging quantification] and clinicopathological factors are associated with axillary lymph node metastasis in invasive ductal breast carcinoma with sizes > 10 mm.Materials and Methods: We evaluated 150 breast lesions from 148 patients using the above methods and the clinicopathological factors. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed to determine the axillary lymph node metastasis risk factors. Diagnostic performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.Results: Sixty-three tumors (42%) were node-positive, 87 (58%) were node-negative. Aspect ratio, virtual touch tissue imaging grade, shear wave velocity, pathological invasive tumor size, and histological grade maintained independent significance in predicting nodal involvement. The mean tumor shear wave velocitys (4.60, 6.49, 7.16) increased in proportion to metastatic node number (0, 1-3, >= 4, respectively; P < 0.001). For all tumors in this study, the cut-off shear wave velocity was 6.16 m/s and was associated with 64.1% sensitivity, 78.0% specificity and an area under the ROC curve of 0.799 (95% confidence interval, 0.731-0.868).Conclusions: Aspect ratio, virtual touch tissue imaging grade, shear wave velocity, pathological invasive tumor size and histological grade are independently associated with axillary lymph node metastasis in invasive ductal breast carcinoma with sizes > 10 mm.

TI  - Simulation-based investigation of the generality of Lyzenga's multispectral bathymetry formula in Case-1 coral reef water
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Lyzenga's multispectral bathymetry formula has attracted considerable interest due to its simplicity. However, there has been little discussion of the effect that variation in optical conditions and bottom types-which commonly appears in coral reef environments-has on this formula's results. The present paper evaluates Lyzenga's multispectral bathymetry formula for a variety of optical conditions and bottom types. A noiseless dataset of above-water remote sensing reflectance from WorldView-2 images over Case-1 shallow coral reef water is simulated using a radiative transfer model. The simulation-based assessment shows that Lyzenga's formula performs robustly, with adequate generality and good accuracy, under a range of conditions. As expected, the influence of bottom type on depth estimation accuracy is far greater than the influence of other optical parameters, i.e., chlorophyll-a concentration and solar zenith angle. Further, based on the simulation dataset, Lyzenga's formula estimates depth when the bottom type is unknown almost as accurately as when the bottom type is known. This study provides a better understanding of Lyzenga's multispectral bathymetry formula under various optical conditions and bottom types. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Suspended sediment diffusion mechanisms in the Yangtze Estuary influenced by wind fields
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The complexity of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) distribution and diffusion has been widely recognized because it is influenced by sediment supply and various hydrodynamic forcing conditions that vary over space and over time. Sediment suspended by waves and transported by currents are the dominant sediment transport mechanisms in estuarine and coastal areas. However, it is unclear to what extent the SSC distribution is impacted by each hydrodynamic factor. Research on the quantitative influence of wind fields on the SSC diffusion range will contribute to a better understanding of the characteristics of sediment transport change and sedimentary geomorphic evolution. This study determined SSC from three Envisat Medium-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer acquisitions, covering the Yangtze Estuary and adjacent water area under the same season and tidal conditions but with varying wind conditions. SSC was examined based on the Semi-Empirical Radiative Transfer model, which has been well validated with the observation data. Integrating the corresponding wind field information from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts further facilitated the discussion of wind fields affecting SSC, and in turn the influence of water and suspended sediment transportation and diffusion in the Yangtze estuarine and coastal area. The results demonstrated that the SSC present much more distinctive fluvial features in the inner estuary and wind fields are one of the major factors controlling the range of turbid water diffusion.

TI  - Diurnal changes of remote sensing reflectance over Chesapeake Bay: Observations from the Airborne Compact Atmospheric Mapper
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Using hyperspectral data collected by the Airborne Compact Atmospheric Mapper (ACAM) and a ship borne radiometer in Chesapeake Bay in July August 2011, this study investigates diurnal changes of surface remote sensing reflectance (R-rs). Atmospheric correction of ACAM data is performed using the traditional "black pixel" approach through radiative transfer based look-up-tables (LUTs) with non-zero R-rs in the near-infrared (NIR) accounted for by iterations. The ACAM-derived R-rs was firstly evaluated through comparison with Rrs derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite measurements, and then validated against in situ R-rs using a time window of +/- 1 h or +/- 3 h. Results suggest that the uncertainties in ACAM-derived R-rs are generally comparable to those from MODIS satellite measurements over coastal waters, and therefore may be used to assess whether R-rs diurnal changes observed by ACAM are realistic (i.e., with changes > 2 x uncertainties). Diurnal changes observed by repeated ACAM measurements reaches up to 66.8% depending on wavelength and location and are consistent with those from the repeated in situ R-rs measurements. These findings suggest that once airborne data are processed using proper algorithms and validated using in situ data, they are suitable for assessing diurnal changes in moderately turbid estuaries such as Chesapeake Bay. The findings also support future geostationary satellite missions that are particularly useful to assess shortterm changes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Important changes in the timing of influenza epidemics in the WHO European Region over the past 20 years: virological surveillance 1996 to 2016
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The global epidemiology of many infectious diseases is changing, but little attention has been paid to whether the timing of seasonal influenza epidemics changed in recent years. This study investigated whether the timing of the peak of influenza epidemics has changed in countries of the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region between 1996 and 2016. Methods: Surveillance data were obtained from the WHO FluNet database. For each country and season (July to June of the next year), the peak was defined as the week with the highest 3-week moving average for reported cases. Linear regression models were used to test for temporal trends in the timing of the epidemic peak in each country and to determine whether this differed geographically. Results: More than 600,000 influenza cases were included from 38 countries of the WHO European Region. The timing of the epidemic peak changed according to a longitudinal gradient, occurring progressively later in Western Europe (e.g. by 2.8 days/season in Spain) and progressively earlier in Eastern Europe (e.g. by 3.5 days/season in the Russian Federation). Discussion: These results were confirmed in several sensitivity analyses. Our findings have implications for influenza control and prevention measures in the WHO European Region, for instance for the implementation of influenza vaccination campaigns.

TI  - Novel magnetic multicore nanoparticles designed for MPI and other biomedical applications: From synthesis to first <i>in vivo</i> studies
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthesis of novel magnetic multicore particles (MCP) in the nano range, involves alkaline precipitation of iron(II) chloride in the presence of atmospheric oxygen. This step yields green rust, which is oxidized to obtain magnetic nanoparticles, which probably consist of a magnetite/maghemite mixed-phase. Final growth and annealing at 90 degrees C in the presence of a large excess of carboxymethyl dextran gives MCP very promising magnetic properties for magnetic particle imaging (MPI), an emerging medical imaging modality, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The magnetic nanoparticles are biocompatible and thus potential candidates for future biomedical applications such as cardiovascular imaging, sentinel lymph node mapping in cancer patients, and stem cell tracking. The new MCP that we introduce here have three times higher magnetic particle spectroscopy performance at lower and middle harmonics and five times higher MPS signal strength at higher harmonics compared with Resovist (R). In addition, the new MCP have also an improved in vivo MPI performance compared to Resovist (R), and we here report the first in vivo MPI investigation of this new generation of magnetic nanoparticles.

TI  - Antibody response to sand fly saliva is a marker of transmission intensity but not disease progression in dogs naturally infected with <i>Leishmania infantum</i>
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Antibody responses to sand fly saliva have been suggested to be a useful marker of exposure to sand fly bites and Leishmania infection and a potential tool to monitor the effectiveness of entomological interventions. Exposure to sand fly bites before infection has also been suggested to modulate the severity of the infection. Here, we test these hypotheses by quantifying the anti-saliva IgG response in a cohort study of dogs exposed to natural infection with Leishmania infantum in Brazil.Methods: IgG responses to crude salivary antigens of the sand fly Lutzomyia longipalpis were measured by ELISA in longitudinal serum samples from 47 previously unexposed sentinel dogs and 11 initially uninfected resident dogs for up to 2 years. Antibody responses were compared to the intensity of transmission, assessed by variation in the incidence of infection between seasons and between dogs. Antibody responses before patent infection were then compared with the severity of infection, assessed using tissue parasite loads and clinical symptoms.Results: Previously unexposed dogs acquired anti-saliva antibody responses within 2 months, and the rate of acquisition increased with the intensity of seasonal transmission. Over the following 2 years, antibody responses varied with seasonal transmission and sand fly numbers, declining rapidly in periods of low transmission. Antibody responses varied greatly between dogs and correlated with the intensity of transmission experienced by individual dogs, measured by the number of days in the field before patent infection. After infection, anti-saliva antibody responses were positively correlated with anti-parasite antibody responses. However, there was no evidence that the degree of exposure to sand fly bites before infection affected the severity of the infection.Conclusions: Anti-saliva antibody responses are a marker of current transmission intensity in dogs exposed to natural infection with Leishmania infantum, but are not associated with the outcome of infection.

TI  - Effect of oil palm sustainability certification on deforestation and fire in Indonesia
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Many major corporations and countries have made commitments to purchase or produce only "sustainable" palm oil, a commodity responsible for substantial tropical forest loss. Sustainability certification is the tool most used to fulfill these procurement policies, and around 20% of global palm oil production was certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil ( RSPO) in 2017. However, the effect of certification on deforestation in oil palm plantations remains unclear. Here, we use a comprehensive dataset of RSPO-certified and noncertified oil palm plantations (similar to 188,000 km(2)) in Indonesia, the leading producer of palm oil, as well as annual remotely sensed metrics of tree cover loss and fire occurrence, to evaluate the impact of certification on deforestation and fire from 2001 to 2015. While forest loss and fire continued after RSPO certification, certified palm oil was associated with reduced deforestation. Certification lowered deforestation by 33% from a counterfactual of 9.8 to 6.6% y(-1.). Nevertheless, most plantations contained little residual forest when they received certification. As a result, by 2015, certified areas held less than 1% of forests remaining within Indonesian oil palm plantations. Moreover, certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation.

TI  - Exploiting big earth data from space - first experiences with the timescan processing chain
T2  - BIG EARTH DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - The European Sentinel missions and the latest generation of the United States Landsat satellites provide new opportunities for global environmental monitoring. They acquire imagery at spatial resolutions between 10 and 60 m in a temporal and spatial coverage that could before only be realized on the basis of lower resolution Earth observation data ( > 250 m). However, images gathered by these modern missions rapidly add up to data volume that can no longer be handled with standard work stations and software solutions. Hence, this contribution introduces the TimeScan concept which combines pre-existing tools to an exemplary modular pipeline for the flexible and scalable processing of massive image data collections on a variety of (private or public) computing clusters. The TimeScan framework covers solutions for data access to arbitrary mission archives (with different data provisioning policies) and data ingestion into a processing environment (EO2Data module), mission specific pre-processing of multi-temporal data collections (Data2TimeS module), and the generation of a final TimeScan baseline product (TimeS2Stats module) providing a spectrally and temporally harmonized representation of the observed surfaces. Technically, a TimeScan layer aggregates the information content of hundreds or thousands of single images available for the area and time period of interest (i.e. up to hundreds of TBs or even PBs of data) into a higher level product with significantly reduced volume. In first test, the TimeScan pipeline has been used to process a global coverage of 452,799 multispectral Landsat-8 scenes acquired from 2013 to 2015, a global data-set of 25,550 Envisat ASAR radar images collected 2010-2012, and regional Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 collections of similar to 1500 images acquired from 2014 to 2016. The resulting TimeScan products have already been successfully used in various studies related to the large-scale monitoring of environmental processes and their temporal dynamics.

TI  - Generation of ready to use (RTU) products over China based on Landsat series data
T2  - BIG EARTH DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth observation community has entered into the era of big data. Family of Landsat sensors have collected massive medium resolution satellite images, which are valuable for long-term land surface monitoring. In order to significantly reduce the magnitude of data processing for remote sensing data users, Landsat-based Ready to Use (RTU) products have been produced. Main RTU products, including orthorectified products, land surface reflectance, land surface temperature, large-area mosaic image, and standard image map products, are described. The resulting Landsat RTU products are hosted on the RSGS earth observation data sharing web site for free download (http://ids.ceode.ac.cn/rtu/). These new products will provide consistent, standardized, multi- decadal image data for robust land cover change detection and monitoring across the Earth sciences. In the coming years, CASEarth DataBank system will be constructed, which is an intelligent data service platform for providing not only the RTU products from multi-source satellite data, but also big earth data analysis methods.

TI  - Coiled-Coil Formation Conveys a STIM1 Signal from ER Lumen to Cytoplasm
T2  - CELL REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - STIM1 and STIM2 are endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane proteins that sense decreases in ER-luminal free Ca2+ and, through a conformational change in the STIM cytoplasmic domain, control gating of the plasma membrane Ca2+ channel ORAI1. To determine how STIM1 conveys a signal from the ER lumen to the cytoplasm, we studied the Ca2+-dependent conformational change of engineered STIM1 proteins in isolated ER membranes and, in parallel, physiological activation of these proteins in cells. We find that conserved "sentinel'' features of the CC1 region help to prevent activation while Ca2+ is bound to STIM ER-luminal domains. Reduced ER-luminal Ca2+ drives a concerted conformational change, in which STIM luminal domains rearrange and the STIM transmembrane helices and initial parts of the CC1 regions pair in an extended coiled coil. This intradimer rearrangement overcomes the relatively weak CC1-SOAR/CAD interactions that hold STIM in an inactive conformation, releasing the SOAR/CAD domain to activate ORAI channels.

TI  - The 2015 Gorkha (Nepal) earthquake sequence: I. Source modeling and deterministic 3D ground shaking
T2  - TECTONOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - To better quantify the relatively long period (< 0.3 Hz) shaking experienced during the 2015 Gorkha (Nepal) earthquake sequence, we study the finite rupture processes and the associated 3D ground motion of the Mw7.8 mainshock and the Mw7.2 aftershock. The 3D synthetics are then used in the broadband ground shaking in Kathmandu with a hybrid approach, summarized in a companion paper (Chen and Wei, 2017, submitted together). We determined the coseismic rupture process of the mainshock by joint inversion of InSAR/SAR, GPS (static and high-rate), strong motion and teleseismic waveforms. Our inversion for the mainshock indicates unilateral rupture towards the ESE, with an average rupture speed of 3.0 km/s and a total duration of similar to 60 s. Additionally, we find that the beginning part of the rupture (5-18 s) has about 40% longer rise time than the rest of the rupture, as well as slower rupture velocity. Our model shows two strong asperities occurring 24 s and 36 s after the origin and located similar to 30 km to the northwest and northeast of the Kathmandu valley, respectively. In contrast, the Mw7.2 aftershock is more compact both in time and space, as revealed by joint inversion of teleseismic body waves and InSAR data. The different rupture features between the mainshock and the aftershock could be related to difference in fault zone structure. The mainshock and aftershock ground motions in the Kathmandu valley, recorded by both strong motion and high-rate GPS stations, exhibited strong amplification around 0.2 Hz. A simplified 3D basin model, calibrated by an Mw5.2 aftershock, can match the observed waveforms reasonably well at 0.3 Hz and lower frequency. The 3D simulations indicate that the basin structure trapped the wavefield and produced an extensive ground vibration. Our study suggests that the combination of rupture characteristics and propagational complexity are required to understand the ground shaking produced by hazardous earthquakes such as the Gorkha event.

TI  - Polar Meaning-Building Strategies: Acmeological Characteristics
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY IN RUSSIA-STATE OF THE ART
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Personality is not simply an end product, but rather, it is a process. Therefore, empirical work on personal meaning-building should examine the genesis of meaning and provide a content-based description of personality in terms of personality traits. Such a description suggests a systemic view of personality, where the meaning-based approach is supplemented with the definition of personality traits. The value and meaning potential of personality encompasses three dimensions: worldview, behavior, and cognition.Objective. The aim of this study is to identify the properties of personality, reflecting the features of polar strategies of meaning formation in acmeological terms by age, gender, and professional characteristics.Design. The present study considers the influence of various acmeological factors on meaning-building and concentrates on its two polar strategies: adaptive and developing strategies. We developed nine bipolar scales of personal traits with sublevels by applying the semantic differential technique. In total, there were 145 participants in the study. Participants were grouped according to three criteria: age, gender, and profession.Results. The obtained indices of meaning-building strategies did not coincide in all the differentiated groups, which clearly speaks in favor of acmeological dynamics of the respondents' personal profiles. We stratified the sample according to the mean score of the basic marker of "life meaningfulness," which enabled us to establish differences in characteristics of actual polar strategies of meaning-building. The respondents who did not fall into either of the two groups are "between the poles." They often have an underdeveloped meaning-building strategy as a result of poorly formed ways of organization and actualization of personal meanings or the presence of a transitional form of situational conceptual initiations.Conclusion. The personal profiles that were identified represent multifactor models of the personal value and meaning dimensions, which can predict actual meaning-building strategies using semantic differential scales and indicators ("life meaningfulness" from the Purpose-in-Life test) and help researchers to reduce the number of techniques employed in their studies.

TI  - USE OF HIGH SPATIAL RESOLUTION SATELLITE DATA FOR MONITORING AND CHARACTERIZATION OF DROUGHT CONDITIONS IN THE NORTHWESTERN ALGERIA
T2  - MINING SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last decades, Algeria has witnessed intense and persistent drought periods characterized by a significant rainfall deficit. The Northwestern Algeria, such as the most south Mediterranean regions, is marked by alternating wet and dry periods and mixing between Atlantic and Mediterranean airs. In a climate context increasingly disturbed by anthropogenic activities, it is essential to analyze the dry episodes at spatial and temporal scales. In order to understand this problem, this work aims to use the potential of Landsat satellite imagery for monitoring drought conditions in the Cheliff watershed in the northwestern Algeria. As known, the behavior of vegetation is strongly related to climate changes. On this basis, a comparison of the variations in the standardized normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and those of the drought indices calculated from meteorological data was implemented. In fact, the rainfall series from fifty meteorological stations were analyzed. The standardized precipitation index (SPI) was calculated for the years 1987, 2000, 2006, 2011 and 2015, corresponding to the acquisition dates of Landsat images. Similarly, an extraction of the NDVI values was performed for each meteorological station. The linear regression between SPI and NDVI showed a good correlation. Thus, the obtained results enabled establishing a new drought index based essentially on satellite data. This index represents the advantage for monitoring spatially the drought phenomena and can solve the problem of climatic data lack.

AB  - In Argentina, the deforestation has reached a significant magnitude, particularly in the Chaco Serrano area. One of the main consequences of deforestation is the presence of bare soils which are vulnerable to precipitation, where runoff causes flash floods, particularly in the cities crossed by the river in Saldan stream basin, region Sierras Chicas - Cordoba. In this context geospatial techniques allow to quantify the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of prone zones to erosion based on models which incorporate climatic, edaphological, biological and anthropic variables. The RUSLE (Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation) model, calibrated by means of local factors, is used as base methodology to carry out the analysis. The calculation is made by merging satellite, archive and field information. The optical image classifications show a decrease in middle and low stratum of the vegetation cover for the period 2005-2013, a situation that directly impacts the erosion rate of soils close to urban piedmont populations.

TI  - Mapping rubber trees based on phenological analysis of Landsat time series data-sets
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposes a strategy for accurate mapping of rubber trees through the analysis of Landsat time series datasets. The phenological dynamics of rubber trees were derived from the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to verify the three important phenological metrics of rubber trees; defoliation, foliation and their growing stages. A decade (2006-2015) ago, Landsat time series NDVIs were used to study the strength of relationship between rubber trees, evergreen trees and oil palm trees. Two important results that could discriminate these three types of vegetation were found; firstly, a weak relationship of NDVIs between rubber trees and evergreen trees during the defoliation period (r(2) = 0.1358) and secondly between rubber trees and oil palm trees during the growing period (r(2) = 0.2029). This analysis was verified using Support Vector Machine to map the distribution of the three types of vegetation. An accurate mapping strategy of rubber trees was successfully formulated.

TI  - Monitoring Desertification in Biskra, Algeria Using Landsat 8 and Sentinel-1A Images
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Desertification is the persistent degradation of ecosystems caused by environmental changes and human activities. This is a global problem closely related to climate change with severe consequences in urban locations. For that reason, monitoring those locations with low cost and freely available satellite images could be useful for local agencies. This paper studies a strategy for the observation of desertification in Biskra, Algeria, with Landsat 8 images and synthetic aperture radar images from Sentinel-1A satellite. Radar images are now available from a growing number of missions. These microwave images add valuable additional information to the existing optical products involving soil roughness and moisture content. They are also a very valuable tool to detect man-made objects. However, radar images are still difficult to exploit due to their inherent speckle noise and their characteristics. This paper searches the best methodology for the insertion of radar data to a previously designed approach that uses optical data. Several algorithms are implemented and evaluated and the best technique in terms of overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient is selected for the final change map production. The approach achieves land use land cover change detection using support vector machine and segmentation. The most useful change indices are obtained for the best methodology product. The simple improved methodology, including radar images, provides excellent results and it clearly outperforms the baseline optical technique.

AB  - In this paper, we study the estimation of olive tree biophysical properties driven by Sentinel-2 (52) image inversion. The latter is based on the forward/backward radiative transfer model (RTM). The forward step is done simulating the DART model on a realistic olive tree mock-up, whereas the backward is done based on a coupling between the Look UP Table (LUT) and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The parameters Leaf area index (LAI), chlorophyll (Cab) water (Cw) contents and mesophyll structure (N) are therefore derived. Soil reflectance is pre-calculated based on an upscaling of the 52 resolution to 3m using Planet images. Moreover to obtain a significant representation of the local heterogeneity, S2 are upscaled to the 80m resolution. The estimation results are promising.

AB  - Remote sensing data utilize valuable information via various satellite sensors that have different specifications. Image fusion allows the user to combine different spatial and spectral resolutions to improve the information for purposes such as forest monitoring and land cover mapping. In this study, I assessed the contribution of dual-polarized Advanced Land Observing Satellite/Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar data to multispectral Landsat imagery. The research investigated the separability of forested areas using different image fusion techniques. Quality analysis of the fused images was conducted using qualitative and quantitative analyses. I applied the support vector machine image classification method for land cover mapping. Among all methods examined, the a trous wavelet transform method best differentiated the forested area with an overall accuracy (OA) of 94.316%, while Landsat had an OA of 92.626%. The findings of this study indicated that optical-SAR-fused images improve land cover classification, which results in higher quality forest inventory data and mapping.

AB  - Ice shelves have a key role to assess mass balance in Antarctic Ice Sheet and its contribution to global sea-level rise. On July 12 2017, a large iceberg separated from Larsen-C Ice Shelf in Antarctic Peninsula, which lost greater than 12% of total ice mass. We use ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 ScanSAR images to capture the overall picture of this event and to understand what happens to Larsen-C. ALOS-2 images reveal that the iceberg has been gradually moved toward sea, sometimes affected by sea ice motion. The ALOS and ALOS-2 images show that the ice front has been advancing by similar to 8 km in the last 10 years. The interferometric coherence analysis reveals that there are some cracks on the ice shelf despite not seen in the intensity images. The distribution of the cracks derived from the coherence can be useful to assess the instability of Larsen-C.

TI  - Evaluation of IRS and Landsat 8 OLI imagery data for estimation forest attributes using k nearest neighbour non-parametric method
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMAGE AND DATA FUSION
M3  - Article
AB  - k Nearest neighbour (kNN) is a non-parametric method to integrate satellite image and ground inventory data in order to estimate accurate information and becoming increasingly popular in natural resources and forest sciences. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the IRS and Landsat 8 satellite images data for forest attributes (volume, basal area and tree density) estimation by kNN method in the north forest of Iran. Our results suggested k <= 10 and Euclidean and Fuzzy distance metrics were the best for our study area. We concluded that Landsat 8 image improved the quality of predictions by reducing the error in kNN algorithm predictions. Also, the greatest amount of root mean square error estimated for tree density and the least was for basal area and volume, respectively in all images. Therefore, kNN method showed the best efficiency for basal area but have smaller efficiency for tree density and volume. We found that main original spectral bands have the best results versus normalised difference vegetation index and fusion data. The strength of kNN was the possibility to predict several variables consist of continuous and categorical variables. Therefore, we suggested studying forest cover types as a categorical variable by this method in diverse natural hardwood species in the north forest of Iran.

AB  - We report the development of an innovative standoff ultracompact micro-Raman instrument that would solve some of the limitations of traditional micro-Raman systems to provide a superior instrument for future NASA missions. This active remote sensor system, based on a 532 nm laser and a miniature spectrometer, is capable of inspection and identification of minerals, organics, and biogenic materials within several centimeters (2-20 cm) at a high 10 mu m resolution. The sensor system is based on inelastic (Raman) light scattering and laser-induced fluorescence. We report on micro-Raman spectroscopy development and demonstration of the standoff Raman measurements by acquiring Raman spectra in daylight at a 10 cm target distance with a small line-shaped laser spot size of 17.3 mu m (width) by 5 mm (height).

AB  - Land degradation in drylands has been investigated extensively over recent decades and several remote sensing based techniques attempt to decouple the human influence from the natural climate variability, but are contested in literature. We introduce a novel approach termed SeRGS-TREND that is designed to monitor land degradation by suppressing the impact from climate variability and highlight vegetation disturbances may it be human or climate-induced. SeRGS-TREND is based on the interpretation of the slope of a linear regression analysis within a sequentially moving window along the temporal axis of the time series of remote sensing data. The use of a moving window increases the probability of a statistically significant linear vegetation-rainfall relationship (VRR), which in turn provides an improved statistical basis for the results produced and thereby confidence in the assessment of degradation. We test and compare SeRGS-TREND and the commonly used RESTREND by simulating different degradation scenarios and find that SeRGS reveals both, more significant and more exact information about degradation events (e.g. starting and end point) while keeping the VRR correlation coefficients high, thus rendering results more reliable.

TI  - Remote-sensing estimation of the water stress coefficient and comparison with drought evidence
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought assessment of croplands and sylvo-pastoral areas is crucial in semi-arid regions. Satellite remote sensing offers an opportunity for such assessment. This study presents a method of spatial and temporal estimation of drought index in Medjerda basin (23,700km(2)) using satellite data and its validation with in situ investigation of areas with crop damage realized by the ministry of agriculture. To estimate drought index, potential evapotranspiration (PET) is calculated using Penman-Monteith equation and modified FAO-56 crop coefficient (K-c) approach combined with remote-sensing data and actual evapotranspiration is derived from the Meteosat Second Generation platforms. The period of study is the 2010 water year. PET estimations show good accuracy with corrected pan evaporation observations up to 0.9. In comparison, the water stress coefficient (K-s) aggregated by land-cover type shows the coefficient of determination with the fraction of drought damage areas of 0.5 for the third decade of March and first decade of April in croplands areas and 0.8 for the second and third decades of May in croplands and sylvo-pastoral areas. This study showed that satellite data approaches could successfully be used to monitor drought in river basins in the Northern Africa and Mediterranean region.

TI  - Robot-assisted pelvic lymph node dissection using ICG testing in patients with prostate cancer
T2  - ONKOUROLOGIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective is to investigate the possibility of using fluorescent testing in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy using indocyanine green (ICG testing) during pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) in patients with localized prostate cancer.Materials and methods. Fifteen minutes prior to robot-assisted PLND, intraprostatic transperineal administration of 0.4 ml of indocyanine green (ICG) per lobe under transrectal ultrasound control was performed. Fluorescence map was used. After activation of the FireFly mode, fluorescence of the lymph nodes was evaluated. If a sentinel lymph node was present, lymph node dissection was performed using the FireFly mode. If fluorescence was diffuse, PLND using this option wasn't performed.Results. In total, 35 patients with localized prostate cancer underwent surgery. Mean age was 62.0 +/- 6.5 years (41-68 years), mean prostatespecific antigen level prior to surgery was 15.6 +/- 11.3 ng/ml (1.5-27.0 ng/ml). Postoperative examination revealed micrometastases in the lymph nodes in 7 (20 %) cases. Sentinel lymph nodes were detected in 29 patients. Intraoperative examination revealed sentinel lymph nodes metastases in 6 (17 %) cases, in other cases (83 %) metastases were absent. Morphological examination showed that in 5 (83 %) of 6 patients with lesions in the sentinel lymph node, micrometastases in other lymph nodes were present. In patients without lesions in the sentinel lymph node, no micrometastases in other lymph nodes were observed. PLND complications included lymphocele in 3 (8 %) patients, prolonged drain indwelling time in 5 (14 %) patients.Conclusion. Initial experience of our clinic shows reproducibility and low complications profile of fluorescence monitoring in the near-infrared region using ICG testing during robot-assisted PNLD. In conditions of continuous increase in the number of performed robot-assisted radical prostatectomies, ICG testing is a promising minimally invasive method for evaluation of regional metastases allowing to detect the sentinel lymph node. This approach allows to decrease the number of complications associated with PLND.

AB  - Aleksander Tamanian (1878-1936) planned to raise a core cultural building, the People's House, in the center of Yerevan. He wanted to create it in the form of a temple, which would mark the spot where in ancient times allegedly stood a pagan temple of song. The project and construction of the People's House faced many attacks from the proletarian architects who followed constructivist architectural ideas and were presenting, using V. Paperny's terminology, the revolutionary and egalitarian Culture One. In early 1930s, a new style of Stalin era architecture, representing Culture Two, replaced Culture One. In the 1934 project version, Tamanian's People's House was influenced by this hierarchical and vertical worldview. However, after the death of the architect in 1936, his son continued his father's grand construction, depriving it of Stalin era architecture characteristics. His further edition of father's project gave the city the core building of the Opera and Ballet Theater, the most telling sample of Tamanian's Culture Two, which differs and actually precedes the Stalin era Culture Two.

M3  - Article
AB  - The studies of the deep structure and tectonics of the Arctic are important for solving the fundamental problems of modern geodynamics and developing its natural resources. This region is also of interest from the geopolitical point of view, in particular, considering the boundaries of the marginal seas. Our study aims to investigate the lithospheric (anomalous) geomagnetic field in the Norwegian-Greenland region of the Arctic and to correlate the identified anomalies with tectonic structures located in the region under study. The database includes the CHAMP satellite measurements of the modulus of the total geomagnetic field vector (the satellite operated at the altitude of similar to 280 km). This article describes the satellite data processing method applied to distinguish between the lithospheric part and other components of the geomagnetic field. Map showing the total vector modulus of the lithospheric field has been constructed for the studied area. The article discusses the possible nature of the lithospheric magnetic anomalies and their relation to the processes that occur under the territory of Greenland. According to our interpretation of the maps, the geomagnetic field anomalies are related to the modern large-scale geological and tectonic structures located in the studied area. The obtained results can facilitate further comprehensive geological and geophysical studies and contribute to modeling of the evolution of the lithosphere.

M3  - Article
AB  - Over 50% of wetlands in the world have been lost in the past century, and the remaining wetlands have been degraded to different degrees because of the adverse influences of human activities and climate change impacts. Though protected under Ramser convention, the situation of Haleji wetland complex and Hadero wildlife sanctuary is not very promising. The current paper is focusing to revitalize the abandoned and devastated Ramsar site "Haleji Wetland Complex" and a forgotten wetland "Hadero Wildlife Sanctuary", situated in Thatta district, Sindh province of Pakistan. Both these wetlands are of great importance for natural habitat and reducing risk of coastal disasters and floods. The study mainly employed Arc-Hydro tools using remotely sensed data of ASTER GDEM 2 to determine the topography of both wetlands and their possibilities to connect with freshwater sources, and leeway to increase their respective water holding capacity. The study reveals that all the three wetlands can be re-connected with Indus River to turn them into fresh water bodies for sustaining natural habitat and increasing water harvesting capacities to cater human drinking water needs

T2  - NORTHERN CLINICS OF ISTANBUL
M3  - Article
AB  - Metaplastic breast carcinoma (MBC) is a general term defining a heterogeneous group that includes biphasic lesions, with both malignant epithelial and mesenchymal tissue components. Although its clinical findings are similar to those present in invasive ductal carcinoma, it rarely presents with the findings of inflammatory breast cancer. It is generally seen in the fifth decade. MBC spreads via lymph and blood circulation. Most common distant metastasis areas include lungs and the bone. Although the treatment generally relies on the same principles applied in invasive ductal carcinoma, a more aggressive treatment should be employed in at-risk groups due to higher rates of local recurrence. In this study, we aimed to discuss clinicopathological features and treatment approach in 5 women with MBC.

AB  - With over four decades spent collecting spaceborne moderate-resolution imagery, Landsat represents the longest remote sensing mission in the world, and has had various applications. Land cover mapping is its heritage for research around the world. Landsat 8 continues the legacy of previous Landsat systems, with a new Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensor that has high spectral resolution and improved signal-to-noise ratio for better characterization of land cover. With improved quality, data size also increases. Hence, with limited research in adjusting data size, it is necessary to explore robust land cover classification techniques that produce accurate maps with more or fewer inputs. The Optimum Index Factor (OIF) is a statistic value that can be used to select the optimum combination of three bands in a satellite image that has the highest amount of information. In this study, we explore the land cover classification of OLI imagery based on OIF. Two test sites were selected around the hilly regions of Korea for OLI original composite, first-rank OIF composite, and OLI original with sum derivative of top-three OIF ranked composites. These three composites were classified with the well-known Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. The results were then analyzed and compared on the basis of producer accuracy, user accuracy, overall accuracy, and kappa coefficient. The result shows that the first-ranked OIF with a three-band composite shows a similar classification accuracy in SVM and slightly less in SAM, while the ten-band composite with OLI original bands and the sum derivative of the top-three OIF rank shows the same result or a small improvement in SVM classification. OIF-derivative composites can be useful in classification problems depending on whether the minimum amount of data for a similar result or more data to achieve higher accuracy is preferred.

AB  - The combinatorial use of geostationary and polar-orbiting satellites is expected to provide a new approach to Earth observation with a wide range of applications; however, differences in the observation conditions and sensor specifications can introduce biases into the outputs of the various satellites. These differences are also known to depend on the land cover type, and this feature of the data requires thorough investigation. This study compared the solar reflective bands measured by the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) and an established sensor MODIS onboard Terra satellite. The comparison was made using data collected over a forested region on the Shikoku Island (30 km by 140 km) located in the south of Japan under similar view zenith angles of approximately 40 degrees. The reflectances of the visible and near-infrared bands (four bands) were processed to correct the molecular scattering and ozone absorption effect. A comparison was made before and after the atmospheric correction. Our results showed that the reflectance differences over the region fell mainly within the relevant standard deviations (reflectance variations within the relevant region), except for the green band. The larger difference between the green band reflectances measured by the two sensors was attributed to differences in the band positions. The band-4 of MODIS (green) covers 545-565 nm, whereas the AHI counterpart (band-2) covers 490-530 nm, providing little overlap with MODIS. These results suggested that special caution is needed when using data collected from these two sensors simultaneously or continuously if the green band is involved in the algorithm.

AB  - Wildfires are one of the major threats to the biodiversity of protected and mountainous landscapes. The severity of these fires is an important factor that influence vegetation recovery. Several remote sensing techniques has been used in previous studies to assess fire severity, but the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) has become the standard SI approach to assess burn severity. The Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) demarcates burnt and unburned pixels in the pre-/post-fire season and, then creates an index of the severity of a burn using multi-spectral sensors, which establishes an ideal tool for fire severity assessment. In this study, the fire severity level is computed using the NBR Index from LANDSAT image. The images of pre-and post-fire are used to evaluate the severity level, which is defined as a difference in NBR Index of pre-and post-fire. Results shows that in year 2000, 30704.22 ha of area burned with low to high severity, 31352.13 ha in year 2005, 4697 ha in year 2013 and 30009.33 ha in 2017. A hundred field plots and fire records were used to validate the fire severity map for 2013 and 2017 with an accuracy of 74% which supports the use of NBR for assessing fire severity.

M3  - Article
AB  - Results of studying the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) dynamics for identification and mapping land vegetation according to satellite data of Landsat in the territory of the State nature reserve "Nurgush" in Kirov Region of Russia are given. The features of the proposed approach include the estimation of the values of this spectral index separately for pine, deciduous forests and meadow phytocenoses. The choice of these natural objects is based on their different sensitivity to the impact of natural and anthropogenic environmental factors. Seasonal and long-term dynamics of NDVI for different types of vegetation in the explored territory during the period from 1988 to 2016 is obtained and analysed. It is established that values of the index are higher in summer months (June, August), than in autumn (October). Low NDVI values for vegetal objects on satellite images for July 18, 1994 and on August 7, 2010 are revealed in comparison with values of the index for other years of pictures obtained. This is probably due to the low average monthly air temperature (14.2 degrees C) and a small amount of rainfall in 1994 and rather droughty and hot summer of 2010 (average temperature during the summer period was 24.7 degrees C). Influence of pollution from a large industrial complex on values of the NDVI for the pine woods has been investigated. It is established that the pine woods located in the territory of industrial agglomeration of the center of the Kirov region have lower values of the index in comparison with the similar forests located in the territory of the State nature reserve "Nurgush". The tendency to decrease in values of the vegetative index in the close vicinity of large industrial enterprises is observed.

T2  - JOURNAL OF FOOT & ANKLE SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to review the outcomes and assess the prognostic factors associated with foot melanoma. We hypothesized that primary melanoma of the foot would be more likely to present at an advanced stage and be associated with poorer outcomes. Both univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to examine the relationships between patients' demographic, clinical, and pathologic characteristics and deaths within 5 years. Categorical data were summarized as frequencies and percentages and continuous variables as mean +/- standard deviation. The primary outcome measure was overall survival. On univariate analysis, the significant prognostic variables found included Breslow thickness, ulceration, sentinel node positivity, and localized presentation on the toe. Age, sex, and race were not prognostically significant in this model. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis resulted in a model of foot melanoma with ulceration and location on the toe as independent prognostic variables. The 5-year survival rate for melanoma of the toe was 50%. The results of the present study have shown that physicians should have a low threshold to biopsy suspicious lesions of the foot and ankle. Advanced disease and poorer survival were noted with toe melanoma. An ulcerative lesion of the foot was also associated with poorer survival.

TI  - Remote sensing for detection and monitoring of vegetation affected by oil spills
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study is aimed at demonstrating the application of vegetation spectral techniques for detection and monitoring of the impact of oil spills on vegetation. Vegetation spectral reflectance from Landsat 8 data were used in the calculation of five vegetation indices (normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), adjusted resistant vegetation index 2 (ARVI2), green-infrared index (G-NIR) and green-shortwave infrared (G-SWIR) from the spill sites (SS) and non-spill sites (NSS) in 2013 (pre-oil spill), 2014 (oil spill date) and 2015 (post-oil spill) for statistical comparison. The result shows that NDVI, SAVI, ARVI2, G-NIR and G-SWIR indicated a certain level of significant difference between vegetation condition at the SS and the NSS in December 2013. In December 2014 vegetation conditions indicated higher level of significant difference between the vegetation at the SS and NSS as follows where NDVI, SAVI and ARVI2 with p-value 0.005, G-NIR - p-value 0.01 and G-SWIR p-value 0.05. Similarly, in January 2015 a very significant difference with p-value <0.005. Three indices NDVI, ARVI2 and G-NIR indicated highly significant difference in vegetation conditions with p-value <0.005 between December 2013 and December 2014 at the same sites. Post-spill analysis shows that NDVI and ARVI2 indicated low level of significance difference p-value <0.05 suggesting subtle change in vegetation conditions between December 2014 and January 2015. This technique may help with the real time detection, response and monitoring of oil spills from pipelines for mitigation of pollution at the affected sites in mangrove forests.

AB  - Interaction networks are sensitive to elevation gradients through changes in local distribution of interacting partners. Here, we use plant-pollinator interaction network metrics to assess the effect of elevation on flowers and flower-visiting insect assemblages on a sentinel mountain used for monitoring climate change in the flower- and insect-rich Cape Floristic Region. We also use these interaction metrics to explain the effect of environmental factors on the interaction networks. We did this over four vegetation zones Copyright: CC BY 4.0

TI  - The Fusion of Morphological and Contextual Information for Building Detection from Very High Resolution SAR Images
T2  - 26TH IRANIAN CONFERENCE ON ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING (ICEE 2018)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 26th Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)
CL  - Mashhad, IRAN
AB  - Nowadays, very high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (VHR SAR) images are available for interpretation of the built-up area. Buildings are one of the most important parts of the urban area, and in this paper a new method for building detection from a single SAR image is proposed. First, the contextual information of the buildings, such as double bounce, layover and shadow areas are extracted. Using these features, a set of primary detection is made. Second, morphological profiles (MP), with different structural elements (SE), are utilized to build a differential morphological profile (DMP) that provides the building structural information. This structural information is used to make a secondary detection set of building candidates. The final detection result is made by fusion of these two sets. Performance evaluation of the proposed method is reported by the implementation of the method on two different real TerraSAR-X images. The results show that the proposed method has a high detection rate (DR), while the false alarm rate (FAR) is low.

TI  - Analysis of the evolution of forest and preforest vegetal formations of the Sahel: case of the Wadi-Fira and Ouaddai regions in Chad
T2  - PHYSIO-GEO
M3  - Article
AB  - After the drought that began in the mid-1960s, rainfall in Ouaddai and Wadi-Fira regions, in eastern Chad, improved from 1990s. At the same time, the human impact on vegetal formations rose with the massive arrival of refugees and displaced persons. The effects of these factors are so far little known in this area. The present paper studies the evolution of forest and preforest formations over a period of 23 years (1987-2010). This analysis was carried out using the Landsat TM satellite images of November 4, 1987 and ETM+ of October 22, 2000 and October, 2, 2010. Five classes of land use have been discriminated against (Pure Balanites, Pure Acacias, Mixtures, Bare soil and Rock outcrop). The proportions occupied by the three first classes were respectively 0.1 %, 5.2 % and 54.3 % in 1987, 0.2 %, 2.4 % and 48.7 % in 2000 and 1.0 %, 14.3 % and 61.7 % in 2010. Between 1987 and 2000, a sharp decline was observed for Pure Acacias (-53.6 %) and Mixtures (-10.4 %). However, a significant increase was recorded from 2000 to 2010 for the same classes: +500 % for Pure Acacias and +15.5 % for Mixtures. The class of Pure Balanites never reached 1 % of the total area. In situ observations were also carried out in autumn 2016 on 240 plots. The forest flora richness is of 30 species. The average density is 53 stems.ha(-1) for Pure Balanites, 35 stems.ha(-1) for Pure Acacias and 24 stems.ha(-1) for Mixtures. Improved rainfall has favored species of lower calorific and forage values such as Calotropis procera and Leptadenia pyrotechnica. Despite the return of rainfall, the wood resources of Ouaddai and Wadi-Fira are declining because they are subject to anthropogenic pressure amplified by increase of the population.

AB  - Sinabung Volcano which located in northern part of Sumatera island is part of a hundred active volcano in Indonesia. Surface deformation is detected over Sinabung Volcano and surrounded area since the first eruption in 2010 after 400 years long rest. We present multi temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) time-series method of ALOS-2 L-band SAR data acquired from December 2014 to July 2017 to reveal surface deformation with high spatial resolution. The method includes focusing the SAR data, generating interferogram and phase unwrapping using SNAPHU tools. The result reveal significant deformation over Sinabung Volcano areas at rates up to 10 cm during observation period and the highest deformation occurs in western part which is trajectory of lava. We concluded the observed deformation primarily caused by volcanic activity respectively after long period of rest. In addition, Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis produces disaster affected areas of Sinabung eruption. GIS is reliable technique to estimate the impact of the hazard scenario to the exposure data and develop scenarios of disaster impacts to inform their contingency and emergency plan. The GIS results include the estimated affected area divided into 3 zones based on pyroclastic lava flow and pyroclastic fall (incandescent rock and ash). The highest impact is occurred in zone II due to many settlements are scattered in this zone. This information will be support stakeholders to take emergency preparation for disaster reduction. The continuation of this high rate of decline tends to endanger the population in next periods.

TI  - Characterising the land surface phenology of Africa using 500 m MODIS EVI
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation phenological studies at different spatial and temporal scales offer better understanding of the relationship between the global climate and the global distribution of biogeographical zones. These studies in the last few decades have focussed on characterising and understanding vegetation phenology and its drivers especially using satellite sensor data. Nevertheless, despite being home to 17% of the global forest cover, approximately 12% of the world's tropical mangroves, and a diverse range of vegetation types, Africa is one of the most poorly studied regions in the world. There has been no study characterising land surface phenology (LSP) of the major land cover types in the different geographical sub-regions in Africa, and only coarse spatial resolution datasets have been used for continental studies. Therefore, we aim to provide seasonal phonological pattern of Africa's vegetation and characterise the LSP of major land cover types in different geographical sub-regions in Africa at a medium spatial resolution of 500 m using MODIS EVI time-series data over a long temporal range of 15 years (2001-2015). The Discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT) technique was employed to smooth the time series data and an inflection point-based method was used to extract phenological parameters such as start of season (SOS) and end of season (EOS). Homogeneous pixels from 12 years (2001-2012) MODIS land cover data (MODIS MCD12Q1) was used to describe, for the first time, the LSP of the major vegetation types in Africa. The results from this research characterise spatially and temporally the highly irregular and multi-annual variability of the vegetation phonology of Africa, and the maps and charts provide an improved representation of the LSP of Africa, which can serve as a pivot to filling other research gaps in the African continent.

TI  - Major trends in the land surface phenology (LSP) of Africa, controlling for land-cover change
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring land surface phenology (LSP) trends is important in understanding how both climatic and non-climatic factors influence vegetation growth and dynamics. Controlling for land-cover changes in these analyses has been undertaken only rarely, especially in poorly studied regions like Africa. Using regression models and controlling for land-cover changes, this study estimated LSP trends for Africa from the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) derived from 500 m surface reflectance Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MOD09A1), for the period from 2001 to 2015. Overall end of season showed slightly more pixels with significant trends (12.9% of pixels) than start of season (11.56% of pixels) and length of season (LOS) (5.72% of pixels), leading generally to more 'longer season' LOS trends. Importantly, LSP trends that were not affected by land-cover changes were distinguished from those that were influenced by land-cover changes such as to map LSP changes that have occurred within stable land-cover classes and which might, therefore, be reasonably associated with climate changes through time. As expected, greater slope magnitudes were observed more frequently for pixels with land-cover changes compared to those without, indicating the importance of controlling for land cover. Consequently, we suggest that future analyses of LSP trends should control for land-cover changes such as to isolate LSP trends that are solely climate-driven and/or those influenced by other anthropogenic activities or a combination of both.

TI  - Spatiotemporal and spectral analysis of sand encroachment dynamics in southern Tunisia
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aeolian processes in drylands often transcend into sand encroachment, a common form of land degradation. Highly reflective desert features, hence sandy areas, often cause spectral confusion, and mapping through remote sensing techniques can be challenging. This work aims at designing an efficient classification method that minimises spectral confusion of desert features, hence two types of sandy areas. Moreover, we employ land cover (LC) change detection over the last 30 years. The extraction and spatiotemporal variations of LC and sand encroachment areas in the Dahar-Jeffara Medenine site (southeastern Tunisia) are assessed by employing Landsat imagery (1984 and 2014), a 30 m digital elevation model of Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTMGL 1 arc second), field data and X-ray diffraction analyses of sand samples. Five new spectral indices were designed and employed in a Decision Tree (DT) classifier for the extraction of 11 LC classes, including two different types of sandy areas. The DT map yielded an overall accuracy of around 89%. Change detection results showed substantial change in several landscape components and an increase of sand units by 29% within the Jeffara-Medenine plain over the last three decades. Geomorphological observations and multi-temporal, spectral and mineral analyses indicate a main, possible in-situ source area of sand.

AB  - Satellite imagery is used in various application such as metrological, change detection, disaster migration, agriculture development etc. With the changing habits of the agriculture practice, there is a need to estimate the vegetated area with the non-vegetated area for the yield estimation. Therefore an approach has been critically evaluated for precision agriculture monitoring especially for area estimation using satellite data with the efficient application of image processing tools. For this purpose sentinel-2 and drone data is used.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) is a key concept that makes the revolution in the present era to make the world smarter. By combining the key technologies, the pace of the processing and delivering of information can be changed. Now, in the context of agriculture monitoring where crop health depends on several parameters like LST, soil moisture, precipitation, etc., therefore timely information of these parameters are playing a major role for monitoring the crop health. These parameters are provided by various satellite sensors which are having different spatial and temporal granularity, therefore in this paper, a new concept of satellite-based IoT is proposed by which we can retrieve all the information at the single platform the power of cloud (storage and processing). The proposed approach tries to extract Land Surface Temperature (LST) automatically from the MODIS data on a spatial equivalent of Landsat 8 which leads to a motivation of providing LST having single day temporal granularity. The basic challenge to handle and efficiently use huge data that can be overcome easily by cloud and its computing.

AB  - Unplanned urbanization has drastically altered the natural topography of the cities and the surrounding areas. Migration from rural areas to Cities has led the transformation of the nearby rural areas into the extended city. The increase in an urban environment as an outcome of socio-economic activities has resulted in the urban sprawl of major cities globally including India. Urban sprawl has raised concerns over unplanned land use but also day-to-day weather conditions of the city. Concentrated development in the major cities of Bangalore, Karnataka and Capital city of New Delhi has given rise to serious implications in form of an increase in local temperatures during the last decade. The study aims at representing the change with an increase in urbanization with the formation of UHI. Sophisticated techniques of remote sensing and GIS are used to perform the analysis. Land Surface Temperature (LST) extracted from the thermal band (band 10) of the Landsat-8 OLI data from the DN values is evaluated for detecting spatial-temporal variations in the formation of heat island of the two cities. The LST calculated for each city is analyzed with the NDBI and NDVI to study the relation of surface temperature and respective indices. It was found that the surface temperature follows a positive co-relation with NDBI and a negative co-relation with NDVI. The indices are used as a basis to delineate pervious and impervious areas in the two cities. Landsat and Sentinel 2a satellite imagery temporal data are used to study the area.

AB  - India is emerging as a major influence of socioeconomic change connecting diverse cultures, people with improved mobility across geographic boundaries. Rapid urbanizations owing to rural to urban migration have made the existing infrastructure and resources inadequate. A case study on Varanasi city has been conducted to demonstrate the urban growth pattern for the years 2000, 2013 and 2014. Satellite imagery of Cartosat-1 (2.5m) and LISS-IV (5m) is used to create the high-resolution multi-spectral data through image processing techniques. In the year 2000, the urban built-up covered an area of 42.75 sq km to 109.03 sq km and the cultivated land area has decreased by 16%. Every year cultivated land decreases for mounting urban sprawl with another 2% decrease in the year 2014 and a 9% increase in built-up. This paper demonstrates the utilization of open source GIS to generate results.

AB  - This paper addresses the problem of SAR Tomographic (TomoSAR) imaging, allowing the detection of multiple scatterers in presence of partially correlated Gaussian clutter. TomoSAR is a multidimensional imaging technique that has proven its ability in localizing the scatterers, reconstructing the elevation profile of the structures on the ground (3D reconstruction) and estimating the temporal deformations and thermal dilations of the scene (5D reconstruction). In the literature statistical based TomoSAR reconstruction refers to a signal model where in each range-azimuth resolution cell one or more scatterers are interfering in presence of noise and clutter signals, modeled as zero-mean complex circular white Gaussian random vectors. In this paper, we propose to extend a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) detector, proposed by the authors and denoted Fast-Sup-GLRT, to a different signal model, where a correlated clutter model is considered. Results on TerraSAR-X real data are presented.

AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging systems can provide valuable sources of earth observation data for various applications. Speckle noise reduction of images produced by these systems is a challenging issue. In this paper, a novel method is proposed for reducing the speckle noise from time series SAR images. This method is mainly based on wavelet transform and Kalman filter. The proposed method is applied to a time series SAR images acquired by Sentinel-1 over Tehran, Iran. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed method, both qualitative and quantitative evaluations are reported compared to those of conventional speckle filtering methods. The experimental results show the good performance and efficiency of the proposed method for the speckle reduction of multitemporal SAR images. As well, the results show that the proposed method can preserve the major edge structures and the spatial resolution while reducing the time of processing.

T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The volume of glaciers in Sikkim with specific reference to East Rathong glacier is estimated. The variability in the results from different methods of volume estimation is also studied. Volume of East Rathong glacier is estimated using on-field and off-field methods. Then volume of other 424 glaciers is estimated using off-field methods. Using the glacier outline from Randolph Glacier Inventory 5.0, a total of 424 Sikkim glaciers are analysed in this study. The area estimated is 509 km(2). Total volume of glaciers estimated using volume-area scaling method is 35 km(3). Estimates of the total volume and average thickness of these glaciers using slope-dependent method in 2008 are 51 km(3) and 100 m respectively. Estimates of the total volume (average thickness) of these glaciers using ice-flow velocity method in 2010 and 2014 are 48 km3 (95 m) and 47 km(3) (93 m) respectively. The glaciers of Sikkim Himalaya seem to show annual mass balance of -0.44 +/- 0.2 m w.e. using ice-flow velocity method during the period of 2010-2014.Slope of Sikkim glaciers is calculated from Cartosat-1 DEM 2008. Cartosat-1 DEM is validated with Global Positioning System (GPS) points. The volume of the ablation (Ab) zone of East Rathong glacier using GPS data is found to be 0.054 km(3). Its volume calculated using slope-dependent method is similar to 0.037 km(3) and using ice-flow velocity method is similar to 0.038 km(3). Volumes estimated for East Rathong glacier using field and off-field methods are comparable. The negative mass balance of Sikkim glaciers could be attributed to an increase in air temperature (0.23 degrees C/decade) at higher altitude (similar to 5500 m a.s.l.) and reduction of precipitation as reported in Agrawal et al. (2014).

AB  - The objective of this research is to estimate Probable Maximum Precipitation (PMP) using satellite data, as one of the solutions to the lack of observation data, and to know the representativeness of satellite data used. The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) incredibly defined the spatial variation of PMP. The north area of Subang Regency has the highest PMP value compared to the surrounding areas for duration of 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 hours. This phenomenon is due to the control of topography against extreme conditions. The PMP itself is generally used to determine the Probable Maximum Flood (PMF) value. The PMP-PMF concept can be utilized for flood management, the determination of temporary retention areas and spillways design reference on dams.

AB  - Starting from A. Allegra's book, Visioni transumane (2017), in this essay I support the idea that transhumanism attempts to reactivate, in the secularized context of Western societies, a kind of religious imagination that is not opposed to the scientific worldview, but it is based on faith in techno-scientific progress. In particular, I discuss the topic of a secular immortality and salvation. Hence, I wonder whether transhumanism is conceivable as a new "religion of humanity" or a "religion without revelation" and evaluate its position with regard to historical religions and in particular to Christianity. Finally, I critically take into account some recent theological interpretations of transhumanism.

AB  - Remote sensing and GIS play a vital role in trend analysis over sodic land and use of alternative measures to minimize the time and cost in reclamation processes. Sodic land is the highly contaminated of salt having pH range of 9.5-10.5 and sodium percentage greater than 15% above which is caused by naturally and anthropogenic. In this study, Raebareli district has been taken as the study area for mapping and monitoring the change detection with respect to sodic lands. LISS III data are used for mapping sodic land in both years 1997 and 2012. The maximum likelihood algorithm method was used for area statistics of different categories of sodic land followed by integration of both the classification of satellite data of Rabi seasons. The Sodic land covers 28823.91 ha area in 1997, which is 8.80% of the total geographical area of the district. At present the total area of sodic lands have been decreased by 18483.60 ha, which covers 10340.31 ha area in 2012, which is 5.64% of the total geographical area of the district. The major changes have been reported mainly in terms of wastelands, fallow land and sodic land areas, which have been reported to decrease over the years.

CL  - Honolulu, HI
AB  - Supraglacial debris essentially hamper the mapping of ice glaciers by remote sensing data. A semi-automatic approach for the mapping of debris covered glaciers in Astor Basin was applied, which combines the inputs from optical satellite data and the digital elevation model (DEM) data. Strong and effective pixel-based band ratios have turned out to be precise for naturally outlining clean glacier ice, however such classifications algorithm exhibit limitations in delineating debriscovered ice because of its spectral resemblance with adjacent landscape. Object based image analysis (OBIA) has risen as another examination strategy inside remote sensing. It gives a system to filter out worthless details and integrate other parts of detail into a single object, although it is also allowing contextual, shape, textural and, hierarchical principles to be used to classify imagery. Supraglacial debris-covered, snow covered glaciers and glaciated ice in Astor Basin were mapped by using Landsat 7,8 imageries gained from 2010 to 2017 and a digital elevation model (DEM) acquired from Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS). The methods offered recognized their usefulness using freely accessible reasonable resolution Landsat OLI and ALOS data. Yet, the increasing availability of high resolution imageries, improved quality and the latest digital terrain data grip the potential of enhanced image segmentation and classification from OBIA approaches.

T2  - AIMS GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The environment and habitat are the important aspects of the forest ecosystem. The continuous changes in the environment due to natural phenomenon or human actions have degraded the forest and wildlife habitat thus causing a decline in their population. Therefore it is important to study wildlife habitat in order to ensure their survival. In this regard, application of Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System has been widely accepted as a tool which has immense significance in wildlife habitat suitability modeling and mapping. Maps derived from analysis of remote sensing data and modeling in GIS are highly useful in making the strategies in wildlife management and conservation planning. Objectives: The objectives of the study are to identify the suitable habitat for wild life and conservation hotspot grids were delineated which require immediate attention. Methods/Statistical analysis: The wildlife habitat suitability parameter based on forest cover, agriculture with settlement, forest fires, roads, streams and mines were analyzed. The statistical method such as pairwise comparison was used to evaluate the weightage of each parameter which helped to determine the wildlife habitat suitability modeling and mapping. Findings: The study of wildlife habitat suitability mapping in Saranda forest division reveals 42% of the grid equal to 1898 has very high suitability for wild life. The conservation hotspot reserve grid based on contiguous patch was identified within the very high wildlife suitability habitat was found to be 925 (49%). Application/Improvements: Conservation effort can be focused based on the above study and will assist in policy related decision making.

T2  - ECOLOGICAL QUESTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire events are an increasing phenomenon these days due to the climate change. It is responsible for forest degradation and habitat destruction. Changes in ecosystem processes are also noticed. The livelihood of tribal population is also threatened. Geo-spatial technologies along with Remotely Sensed data have enormous capability to evaluate the various diversified datasets and to examine their relationship.In this analysis, we have utilized the long term fire events at district level for the Orissa state of India and forest fire hotspots were identified. The fire pattern was analyzed with respect to the existing vegetation types, tribal population and topography to understand its association/relationship. Furthermore, it was evaluated with future climate change data for better comprehension of future forest fire scenario.The study reveals that Kandhamal, Raygada and Kalahandi district have highest fire frequency representing around 38% of the total Orissa fire events. The vegetation type "Tropical mixed deciduous and dry deciduous forests" and "Tropical lowland forests, broadleaved, evergreen, <1000 m" occupy the geographical area roughly 43% whereas they retain fire percent equivalent to 70%. Approximately 70% of forest fire occurred in the area where tribal population was high to very high. The 60% of forest fire occurred where elevation was greater than 500 meters whereas 48% of fire occurred on moderate slopes.Our observation of future climate change scenario for the year 2030 reflects the increase in summer temperature and irregular rainfall pattern. Therefore, forest fire intensity will be more in future in the state of Orissa whereas it's intensity will be more severe in few of the district such as Kandhamal, Raygada, Kalahandi and Koraput which have significantly high forest fire events in present scenario.The outcomes of the present study would certainly guide the policymakers to prepare more effective plan to protect the forest which is main source of livelihood to the tribal population keeping in mind of future climate change impact for prioritization of various districts of state of Orissa suffering from forest fires.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMAGE AND DATA FUSION
M3  - Article
AB  - The integration of information extracted from the Syste'm Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) and the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data, comprehensive field and mineralogy studies demonstrates that phyllic alteration zone associated with northwestern (NW)-southeastern (SE) structural fractures is a high potential zone for Cu-Fe-Au vein-type mineralisation in the Bajestan region, the Lut block, east Iran. The fractal pattern was calculated for fractures map using the Box-Counting algorithm to the SPOT-5 data. Statistical parameters of fractures, such as density, intensity and fractures' intersection were also determined. Band composition, specialised band ratio and Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) classification methods were implemented to the ASTER dataset for detecting hydrothermal alteration zones, such as propylitic, phyllic, argillic and gossan. Results indicate that the maximum value of the fractal dimension, intensity, density and the intersection of the fractures are concentrated in the NW and SE parts of SPOT image maps. In the other hand, phyllic alteration zone containing sericite, alunite, kaolinite and jarosite mineral assemblages was also identified in several zones of the NW and SE parts of the ASTER image maps. Integration of the results indicates the high potential zones for the occurrence of Cu-Fe-Au mineralisation in the Bajestan region.

TI  - Where is the coast? Monitoring coastal land dynamics in Bangladesh: An integrated management approach using GIS and remote sensing techniques
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper draws upon the application of GIS and remote sensing techniqueS to investigate the dynamic nature and management aspects of land in the coastal areas of Bangladesh. The geomorphological characteristic of the coastal areas is highly dynamic where land erosion and accretion with different rates remain a constant phenomenon. This study focuses on three coastal zones: western, central and eastern that comprise the entire coastal area of the country. At its core, this study uses the past 30 year Landsat satellite images. This research reveals that the rate of accretion in the study area is slightly higher than the rate of erosion. Overall land dynamics indicate a net gain of 237 km(2) (7.9 km(2) annual average) of land in the area for the whole period from 1985 to 2015. The results also demonstrate that the rates of both erosion and accretion are higher in the central zone compared to the western and the eastern zones of the coastal area. This is the first time that the entire coastal areas of Bangladesh have been considered for assessment. This study also recommends that coastal managers, planners and policymakers to consider the identified dynamic trends of coastal land before opting for any specific measure. Constant monitoring using the GIS and remote sensing techniques would be a viable management for this purpose. This study has identified some causes of land dynamics, particularly for the three coastal zones, that might be helpful for policymakers in identifying the nature of interventions needs to be taken for specific coastal zones.

T2  - INFLUENZA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY VIRUSES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundSeasonal influenza-associated mortality estimates help identify the burden of disease and assess the value of public health interventions such as annual influenza immunization. Vital registration is limited in Bangladesh making it difficult to estimate seasonal influenza mortality.ObjectivesOur study aimed to estimate seasonal influenza-associated mortality rates for 2010-2012 in Bangladesh.MethodsWe conducted surveillance among hospitalized patients with severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) for persons aged 5years and severe pneumonia for children <5years in 11 sites across Bangladesh. We defined the catchment areas of these sites and conducted a community survey in 22 randomly selected unions (administrative units) within the catchment areas to identify respiratory deaths. We multiplied the proportion of influenza-positive patients at our surveillance sites by the age-specific number of respiratory deaths identified to estimate seasonal influenza-associated mortality.ResultsAmong 4221 surveillance case-patients, 553 (13%) were positive for influenza viruses. Concurrently, we identified 1191 persons who died within 2weeks of developing an acute respiratory illness within the catchment areas of the surveillance hospitals. In 2010-2011, the estimated influenza-associated mortality rate was 6 (95% CI 4-9) per 100000 for children <5years and 41 (95% CI 35-47) per 100000 for persons >60years. During 2011-2012, the estimated influenza-associated mortality rate was 13 (95% CI 10-16) per 100000 among children <5years and 88 (95% CI 79-98) per 100000 among persons aged >60years.ConclusionsWe identified a substantial burden of influenza-associated deaths in Bangladesh suggesting that the introduction of prevention and control measures including seasonal vaccination should be considered by local public health decision-makers.

AB  - We examine the potential for ocean color (OC) retrievals using a neural network (NN) technique recently developed by us to make up for the lack of a 678 nm florescence band on VIIRS, previously available on MODIS and important for Karenia brevis harmful algal bloom (KB HABs) retrievals.. NN uses VIIRS Remote Sensing Reflectance (Rrs) at 486, 551 and 671 nm to retrieve phytoplankton absorption at 443nm, from which both KB HABs and chlorophyll [Chla] concentrations can be inferred. NN retrievals are compared with retrievals obtained using other algorithms, including OCl/OCx and Semi-analytical algorithm for both complex and open ocean waters. VIIRS KB HABs retrievals in the WFS, using NN and other algorithms, are first compared against all co-incident in-situ cell count measurements available between 2012-16. Next, we compared retrievals obtained for different algorithms using in-situ radiometric Rrs measurements against sample measurements, 2017-18, for both the WFS and Atlantic coasts. Retrieval statistics showed (i) the important impact of short term (15-20 minutes) temporal variations and sample depth considerations in complex bloom waters. These limit satellite retrieval accuracies and utility; and (ii) particularly for high chlorophyll bloom waters, better retrieval accuracies were obtained with NN followed by OCI/OCx algorithms. Likely rationales: the longer Rrs wavelengths used with NN are less vulnerable (i) to atmospheric correction inadequacies than the deeper blue wavelengths used with other algorithms, and (ii) to spectral interference by CDOM in more complex waters.

M3  - research-article
AB  - This study deals with the characteristics of regression motifs in Korean web novels and the desires of reading. I examined the works focusing on the romance fantasy genre, where the motifs were quickly utilized. In this study, ‘regression’ is characterized by the character of the web novel entering into the body of the past, and the spirit of the future dominating the body of the present(past). The narrative of regression motif is based on the fact that the main character starts from the loss of the present significant relationship / power, utilizes knowledge to recover his / her life after recurrence, and affirms the future since the return to be.The reading desire extracted from the regression motif is the tendency of the readers desiring a new narrative, the desire to recover the loss, and the internalization of the discourse of self - help. Since then, predictable narrative changes have been examined in terms of repetition of repetition (change of game) and change of purpose of regression.This research is meaningful in that it sees the ‘regression’ mentioned in the genre as a characteristic and deals with its cause and characteristics from an academic point of view. Limitations include lack of genre limitation, lack of relevance of genre conservativeness and motifs, lack of self-regression and connection of modern female readers, and lack of active reader research. The research points and limitations discussed above are left as a follow-up study.

AB  - Canada's coastline presents challenges for navigational charting. Within Arctic regions, in situ surveying presents risks to surveyors, is time consuming and costly. To better meet its mandate, the Canadian Hydrographic Service (CHS) has been investigating the potential of remote sensing to compliment traditional charting techniques. This paper focuses on an evaluation of sensors and techniques for operational Satellite Derived Bathymetry (SDB) implementation. Analysis focused on Cambridge Bay, Nunavut using Pleiades, SPOT, WorldView and PlanetScope imagery. Multiple SDB techniques were applied to evaluate their agreement with in-situ bathymetric measurements:An empirical logarithm band ratio approach.A multiple band modeling technique.A multi-dimensional Look-Up-Table approach.Through this analysis, CHS attempted to answer critical questions for operational SDB implementation:Do specific optical sensors offer advantages for SDB?Are there advantages/disadvantages with the application of SDB techniques within the examined environment?Can multiple SDB techniques improve CHS's understanding of the confidence it can place in remotely sensed bathymetry estimates?Early results have achieved overall root mean square errors of 0.56 to 0.99 m relative to in situ survey depths for all sensors and techniques. These similarities suggest that CHS can be confident in the accuracies observed from various SDB approaches. Results do not indicate significant advantages or disadvantages of particular optical sensors, suggesting other factors contain greater importance for SDB image selection (e.g. sea floor visibility). While this analysis provides excellent information for operational empirical SDB implementation within Arctic environments, further work is required within other Canadian coastal regions to support national SDB application.

TI  - An Adaptively Truncated Clutter-Statistics-Based Two-Parameter CFAR Detector in SAR Imagery
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF OCEANIC ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detectors suffer probability of detection (PD) degradation influenced by the outliers such as interfering ship targets, side lobes, and ghosts, especially in crowded harbors and busy shipping lines. In this paper, a new two-parameter CFAR detector based on adaptively truncated clutter statistics (TS-LNCFAR) is proposed. The new two-parameter CFAR detector uses log-normal as the statistical model; by adaptive-threshold-based clutter truncation in the background window, the outliers are removed from the clutter samples, while the real clutter is preserved to the largest degree. The log-normal model is accurately built using the truncated clutter statistics through the maximum-likelihood estimator. Compared with traditional CFAR detectors, the parameter estimation is more accurate, and TS-LNCFAR has a better false alarm regulation property and a high PD in a multiple-target environment. Furthermore, the parameter estimation and threshold calculation do not need iterative numerical calculation, and TS-LNCFAR has a high computational efficiency. The superiority of the proposed TS-LNCFAR detector is validated on the multilook Envisat-ASAR and TerraSAR-X data.

TI  - Ka-band HTS channel uplink SNIR probability model
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING
M3  - Article
AB  - I present a novel analytical study of the signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratio (SNIR) for Ka-band high throughput satellite uplink channels. The Ka-band high throughput satellite systems employ frequency and polarization (color) reuse among the spot beams to achieve throughput increase many times the throughput of the system without reuse. However, color reuse also produces substantial co-color interference and adding to it, tropospheric precipitation attenuation rises sharply in Ka-band. The co-color interference and precipitation induced fading vary randomly; they degrade the system performances. To assess the impact, I develop the uplink channel SNIR probability model in this study. Compared with the known studies of the same topic, this study takes the theoretic approach and is applicable to the urban users in particular. The model is feasible to implement and can provide accurate assessment of the channel SNIR performances statistically in theory for a wide array of system operational scenarios. The SNIR probability model is applied to a model spot beam system of 101 user beams to obtain and compare sample channel performances, which can be used for making system design choices at the early stage of a satellite project.

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - This chapter presents an analysis of the current status and the challenges in change detection techniques for the analysis of multitemporal SAR images. Algorithms and methods based on validated statistical models for SAR data are investigated, which adopt advanced information-theoretic and multi-scale signal-processing methodologies. After a brief review of the recent literature on general change detection methods, the chapter investigates the specific problem of change detection in SAR images. The main properties of the change detection problem in SAR images are explored and discussed. Then, recent change detection techniques for high-resolution (HR) and very high-resolution (VHR) SAR data are presented and critically analyzed from the theoretical viewpoint. Finally, examples of application of these techniques to real problems are presented by using simulated image pairs and Enhanced Spotlight COSMO-SkyMed images.

AB  - Monitoring shoreline change is one of essential tasks for appropriate design of coastal management and protection strategies. As one of remote sensing technologies, synthetic aperture radar, SAR can be a promising option because SAR is affected neither by cloud coverage nor by sun illumination. In this study, various kind of parameters, such as the grain size of bed materials, incident angles and wave height, were analyzed and it was found that the grain size is one of the most important factors for the shoreline monitoring skills using SAR.

T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to test the performance of the Rotation Forest (RTF) algorithm in urban and rural areas that have similar characteristics using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images to produce the most up-to-date and accurate land use maps. The performance of the RTF algorithm was compared to other ensemble methods such as Random Forest (RF) and Gentle AdaBoost (GAB) for object-based classification. RGB bands and other variables (i.e. ratio, mean, standard deviation, ... etc.) were also used in classification. The accuracy assessments showed that the RTF method, with 92.52 and 91.29% accuracies, performed better than the RF (2 and 4%) and GAB (5 and 8%) methods in urban and rural areas, respectively. The significance of differences in classification methods was also analysed using the McNemar test. Consequently, this study shows the success of the RTF algorithm in the object-based classification of UAV images for land use mapping.

TI  - Factors impacting the accuracy of intra-operative evaluation of sentinel lymph nodes in breast cancer
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) is a standard axillary staging technique in breast cancer and intraoperative sentinel lymph node (SLN) assessment is important for decision-making regarding additional treatment and reconstruction. This study was undertaken to investigate clinicopathologic factors impacting the accuracy of intraoperative SLN evaluation. Records of patients with clinically node-negative, invasive breast cancer who underwent SLND with frozen section intraoperative pathologic evaluation from 2004 to 2007 were reviewed. Intraoperative SLN assessment results were compared to final pathology. Patients with positive SLNs that were initially reported as negative during intraoperative assessment were considered false negative (FN) events. Primary tumor histology, grade, receptor status, size, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), multifocality, neoadjuvant chemotherapy or hormonal therapy, number of SLNs retrieved, and SLN metastasis size were evaluated. The study included 681 patients, of whom 262 (38%) received neoadjuvant therapy. There were 183 (27%) patients who had a positive SLN on final pathology, of whom 60 (33%) had FN events. On univariate analysis, lobular histology, favorable histology, absence of LVI and micrometastasis were associated with a higher FN rate. On multivariate analysis, favorable and lobular histology and micrometastasis were independent predictors of FN events whereas LVI and receipt of neoadjuvant therapy were not statistically significant predictors. The accuracy of intraoperative SLN evaluation for breast cancer is affected by primary tumor histology and size of the SLN metastasis. There was no significant association between neoadjuvant therapy and the FN rate by intraoperative assessment. This information may be helpful in counseling patients about their risk for a FN intraoperative SLN assessment and for planning for immediate breast reconstruction in patients undergoing mastectomy.

TI  - Iceberg Detection in Open and Ice-Infested Waters Using C-Band Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Icebergs can cause a significant threat to shipping, offshore oil and gas production facilities, and subsea pipelines. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a well-established tool for detecting and monitoring sea-ice objects in the often dark and cloud-covered polar regions. However, detection of small icebergs floating in nonhomegeous sea clutter environments is still a challenging task. We propose a new methodology for automatic identification of potential icebergs in high-resolution polarimetric SAR images. The algorithm adopts to various sea-ice conditions and it tackles high iceberg density situations and heterogeneous background conditions in the marginal ice zone. Results from a time series of RADARSAT-2 data containing numerous icebergs broken off from glaciers in Kongsfjorden on Svalbard demonstrate that the approach is viable.

AB  - Calving of icebergs at the tidewater glacier fronts is a component of the mass loss in Polar regions. Studying the regional distribution of icebergs, their volume, motion, and interaction with the environment is of interest. Here, we present the results from a fieldwork campaign conducted in Kongsfjorden, Svalbard in April 2016, where both satellite and ground-based remote sensing instruments were used to observe dynamics of sea ice, icebergs, and growlers. We used a ground-based radar system, imaging the study area every second minute during five days. During the same observation period, we collected four RADARSAT-2 (RS-2) quad-pol images, that are used for automatic detection of icebergs. In addition, the fieldwork team collected GPS positions of some drifting and grounded icebergs in the fjord to be used as ground-truth data. The comparison and combination of satellite, ground-based radar, and in-situ data contribute to cross-validate the results.

T2  - JOURNAL OF LAND USE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assessed impact of land use change on ecosystem services (ES) of the southwest coastal Bangladesh, by combining Landsat data and published value coefficients of different ecosystems. Land use categories were estimated using satellite images from 1980 - 2016. Changes in the value of ES delivered by each of the land use categories were estimated from respective value coefficients. Results revealed that agriculture land decreased by 253,928 ha and aquaculture land increased by 272,032 ha within 1980 - 2016. Meanwhile, the total value of ES decreased from US$ 90.45 to 88.22 billion. Decline of agriculture was the largest contributor (US$ 1.41 billion) to the loss of ES, followed by deforestation (US$ 0.94 billion). Forest is the major contributor to the ES of this region and could largely impact on the ES value. Future land use policy could be targeted to promote sustainable agriculture and conservation of forest.

AB  - Earthquake damage assessment using multi-temporal medium-resolution SAR data with dual polarization is possible. In this study Sentinel-1 SAR data have applicated for earthquake damage assessment using existing change detection method. Sentinel-1 data are applicable due to universal availability of pre- and post-earthquake SAR imageries for maximum six days. The normalized difference of intensity correlation coefficient (NDIC), normalized difference of interferometric coherence coefficient (NDCC), co-seismic intensity correlation (IC) and difference in the backscattering coefficient (DBC) images were used in order to create damage maps. In this investigation, histogram of damaged and intact building in the values of NDIC, NDCC and statistical distribution of IC-DBC were analyzed with different window size of correlation coefficients.. and local mean values m. It was found that damaged buildings are better detectable with NDIC and NDCC variables than IC-DBC. Artifical neural network (ANN) supervised classification method has better results of producer's accuracy for damaged building classes. Producer's accuracy of damaged building class is achieved 95.6%, however, there are misclassification between intact building and none built-up area, it is decreased by using GIS data having mask of built-up area. These results lend support to the idea of realization low-cost method of damage assessment after natural disasters based on Sentinel-1 and GIS data, which are required for insurance companies and governments. Amatrice and Sarpol-e Zahab cities were studied in this investigation, which have been more affected by the earthquakes in 2016-2017.

TI  - Multi precursors analysis associated with the powerful Ecuador (M<sub>w</sub>=7.8) earthquake of 16 April 2016 using Swarm satellites data in conjunction with other multi-platform satellite and ground data
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - After DEMETER satellite mission (2004-2010), the launch of the Swarm satellites (Alpha (A), Bravo (B) and Charlie (C)) has created a new opportunity in the study of earthquake ionospheric precursors. Nowadays, there is no doubt that multi precursors analysis is a necessary phase to better understand the LAIC (Lithosphere Atmosphere Ionosphere Coupling) mechanism before large earthquakes. In this study, using absolute scalar magnetometer, vector field magnetometer and electric field instrument on board Swarm satellites, GPS (Global Positioning System) measurements, MODIS-Aqua satellite and ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) data, the variations of the electron density and temperature, magnetic field, TEC (Total Electron Content), LST (Land Surface Temperature), AOD (Aerosol Optical Depth) and SKT (SKin Temperature) have been surveyed to find the potential seismic anomalies around the strong Ecuador (M-w = 7.8) earthquake of 16 April 2016. The four solar and geomagnetic indices: F10.7, D-st, K-p and a(p) were investigated to distinguish whether the preliminary detected anomalies might be associated with the solar-geomagnetic activities instead of the seismo-ionospheric anomalies. The Swarm satellites (A, B and C) data analysis indicate the anomalies in time series of electron density variations on 7, 11 and 12 days before the event; the unusual variations in time series of electron temperature on 8 days preceding the earthquake; the analysis of the magnetic field scalar and vectors data show the considerable anomalies 52, 48, 23, 16, 11, 9 and 7 days before the main shock. A striking anomaly is detected in TEC variations on 1 day before earthquake at 9:00 UTC. The analysis of MODIS-Aqua night-time images shows that LST increase unusually on 11 days prior to main shock. In addition, the AOD variations obtained from MODIS measurements reach the maximum value on 10 days before the earthquake. The SKT around epicentral region presents anomalous higher value about 40 days before the earthquake. It should be noted that the different lead times of the observed anomalies could be acknowledged based on a reasonable LAIC earthquake mechanism. Our results emphasize that the Swarm satellites measurements play an undeniable role in progress the studies of the ionospheric precursors. (C) 2017 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

T2  - PROBLEMY ISTORICHESKOI POETIKI
M3  - Article
AB  - The urgency of the work lies in the fact that English culture and literary tradition were significant in the life and creative development of Pasternak. The article is devoted to the problem of interaction of Russian and English literatures in the Boris Pasternak's works. It deals with the facts of direct appeal of the poet to the creative heritage of English poets and playwrights, special attention is paid to the images of Shakespeare's tragedies, which manifested not only in the poet's correspondence with his relatives, but also in the poems (The Decade of Presny, Shakespeare, English Lessons etc.) and in the novel Doctor Zhivago. The images of Shakespeare's tragedies (Macbet's witches, Ophelia, Desdemona, Birnam forest) allow Pasternak to describe the events taking place in the family and in the country in whole. They become the topic of Pasternak's literary-critical articles (Hamlet, Prince of Denmark (on behalf of the translator), Notes on Shakespeare, etc.). They express not only the understanding of the main images of his works, the interpretation of their conflicts and Pasternak's observations on Shakespeare's style, but also the reasoning about his own method of translating. Thus, the Pasternak was under the influence of Shakespeare's style long before working upon the translations of his plays. From 1940 to 1949 Pasternak translated Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, Anthony and Cleopatra, Othello, etc. Shakespeare's images and the problems touched upon in his tragedies, as well as the stylistic and genre features of his plays, gradually penetrated into life and, as a result, Pasternak's writings. The study tested that the interest in foreign culture contributed to the enrichment and expansion of the ideological and aesthetic worldvicw of the poet, actively mastering the artistic discoveries of the past and adopting them in the present.

TI  - Agricultural water policy reforms in China: a representative look at Zhangye City, Gansu Province, China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Water resources are essential for agricultural production in the grain-producing region of China, and water shortage could significantly affect the production and international trade of agricultural products. China is placing effort in new policies to effectively respond to changes inwater resources due to changes in land use/land cover as well as climatic variations. This research investigates the changes in land, water, and the awareness of farmer vis-a-vis the implementation of water-saving policies in Zhangye City, an experimental site for pilot programs of water resources management in China. This research indicates that the water saved through water-saving programs and changes in cropping structure 2.2 x 10(8) m(3) a(-1)) is perhaps lower than the newly increased water withdrawal through corporate-led land reclamation (3.7 x 10(8) m(3) a(-1)). Most critically, the ground-water withdrawal has increased. In addition, our survey suggests that local government is facing a dilemma of water conservation and agricultural development. Therefore, the enforcement of the ban on farmland reclamation and irrigation water quotas in our study area is revealed to be relatively loose. In this vein, the engagement of local stakeholders in water governance is essential for the future sustainable management of water resources.

AB  - This paper interrogates the notions of time and money in Islamic (economic) tradition by applying Toshihiko Izutsu's theory of the key terms of a worldview. A Japanese scholar of Islam, Toshihiko Izutsu (1914-1993), wrote extensively on Islamic studies, eastern mystical traditions, and Sufism. His theory of key ethical concepts in the Qur'an is a semantic analysis of an Islamic worldview, which can be applied also more specifically to economic thought in Islamic tradition. Applying Izutsu's theory would shed light on the main ethico-economic concepts and postulates in Islamic intellectual history, such as the notions of time, money, and commodity purchases, as well as their relation to man as a time-contingent being. As well as the introduction and conclusion, this paper is divided into three main parts. In the first part, I introduce Izutsu's life and his semantic theory. The second focuses on Islamic economics and its relation to Shari'a as a moral concept, whereas the third part inquires more specifically upon the notion of time and money in classical and contemporary Islamic economic thought.

TI  - Reconnoitering the linkage between cardiovascular disease mortality and long-term exposures to outdoor environmental factors in the USA using remotely-sensed data
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND HEALTH PART A-TOXIC/HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES & ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - This ecological study aimed to assess the association between long-term exposures to outdoor environmental factors and mortality rate from cardiovascular disease (CVD) in a diverse and spatially distributed population from 3,094 counties within the U.S. (n > 3,780,000 CVD deaths) using satellite-derived data of PM2.5 concentrations, sunlight, and maximum heat index. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine whether PM2.5, sunlight and maximum heat index were related to the odds of the total CVD death rate based on gender, race, and age taking into consideration the confounding risk factors of diabetes, obesity, leisure- time physical inactivity, smoking and socioeconomic status. The study has shown that elevated levels of PM2.5, sunlight and heat long-term exposures are significantly associated with an increase in the odds ratio of the total CVD mortality. The results suggest a 9.8% (95% CI = 6.3% - 13.4%), 0.9% (95% CI = 0.5% - 1.2%), and 0.7% (95% CI = 0.5% - 11.2%) increase in total CVD mortality associated with 10 g/m(3) increase in PM2.5 concentrations, 1,000 kJ/m(2) increases in sunlight, and 1 F-o increase in heat index, respectively. The odds ratios for the CVD death rate due to long-term exposures of PM2.5, sunlight, and heat index were significantly greater than 1.0 for all categories except for Asians, Hispanics, and American Indians, indicating that the effect of long-term exposures to particulate matter, sunlight radiation, and maximum heat on CVD mortality is trivial for Asians, Hispanics, and American Indians. Among the categories of age, the group of 65 years and older had the highest odds ratios, suggesting that the age group of 65 years and older are the most vulnerable group to the environmental exposures of PM2.5 (OR = 1.179, 95% CI = 1.124 - 1.237), sunlight (OR = 1.047, 95% CI = 1.041 - 1.053), and maximum heat (OR = 1.014, 95% CI = 1.011 - 1.016). The odds ratios of CVD mortality due to the environmental exposures were higher for Blacks than those for Whites. The odds ratios for all categories were attenuated with the inclusion of diabetes, obesity, leisure-time physical inactivity, smoking, and income covariates, reflecting the effect of other medical conditions, lifestyle, behavioral and socioeconomic factors on the CVD death rate besides the environmental factors.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND STATISTICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote Sensing and GIS have been widely used for analyzing and identifying land use change. In this study, MODIS images of Babylon Governorate were used to provide vegetation cover maps for 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012 and 2016. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) trend maps showed clearly decreasing in vegetation cover over the study period. The negative trend in vegetation cover with NDVI values from 0 to 0.3 appeared in the years 2012 and 2016 in comparison with years of 2000, 2004 and 2008. The most clearly decreasing in vegetation cover was at the east and south-east parts of Babylon governorate. The study followed scientific methods to determine the value of vegetation cover decreasing. One of these methods was the change detection for each study year in comparison to the year 2000, which considered as a reference year for this study. The second method was NDVI Anomaly, where the percentage of NDVI deviation for each study year was calculated in comparison to the mean of NDVI values for the five studied years. The findings of this study verified the change detection and NDVI Anomaly as a successful method to compare changes in land use pattern and provide details about increasing urbanization features. The results verified also that the MODIS-derived NDVI can be used as a simple and cost-effective tool for land use monitoring in Iraq.

AB  - Due to land availability and shallow coast line, random garbage dump sites have been used in the past and present in the Kingdom of Bahrain. This has caused economic stress, environmental hazards, and contributed to the failure of many family dwellings throughout the Kingdom. This paper aims to identify, locate, and map possible garbage dump sites. Input data used in this paper includes 300 Borehole data from the Ministry of Work (MoW) LandSat imagery from 1972 to present, agricultural, drainage and soil maps that were produced in 1975, Digital Elevation Models (DEM) from the Surveying and Land Registration Bureau (SLRB) and site investigations. ArcGIS 10.2 and extensions are utilized toward mapping possible sites. The IR band is used to delineate the land borders as the sea depth is very shallow. 1969 Topographic map and aerial photos of 1950s are used to identify agricultural and residential areas and as a benchmark. 3D digital surface is created for the Kingdom based on contour map of 1969 and drainage maps of 1975. Supervised classifications of the blue, green, red, and IR bands is preformed every 5 years to determine the growth of residential areas and the shrinking of agricultural areas. Borehole data provides detailed soil information that contributed significantly in identifying garbage dump sites. Site investigation and citizen interviews indicate that almost all garbage dumps areas are located in lowland areas or in the shallow sea. An algorithm based on least square principles is developed to determine possible sites. Results show that dump sites are spread all over the Kingdom. Empty sites that are located within 100 m from residential areas and are at least 2 m below the average elevation of surrounding areas are highly likely to be used as dump sites. 65 dump sites and 47 possible sites are identified. Dump site areas range between 4,000 to almost more than 10 km(2).

TI  - Geoinformatic analysis of vegetation and climate change on intertidal sedimentary landforms in southeastern Australian estuaries from 1975-2015
T2  - AIMS GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation canopies represent the main ecosystems on intertidal landforms and they clearly respond to changes in coastal environments. Climate change, including temperature, precipitation and sea level rise, are affecting the health and distribution of coastal vegetation, as well as the runoff and sedimentation rates that can impact coastal areas. This study has used the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to investigate vegetation canopy dynamics on three different coastal sites in southeastern Australia over the past 47 years (1975-2015). NDVIs temporal-datasets have been built from satellite images derived from Landsat 1-8. These were then regressed to the climatic and geomorphic variables. Results show clear increases in NDVI at Towamba and Wandandian Estuaries, but a decline at Comerong Island (southeastern Australia). The sedimentation rate has the most significant positive impact on NDVI since it has the potential to provide additional space for vegetation. Temperature and sea level rise have positive effects, except on Comerong Island, but rainfall has no significant effect on the NDVI at any site. Different NDVI trends have been recorded at these three coastal sites reflecting different correlations between the vegetation, climatic and geomorphic (as independent) variables. The geomorphological characteristics of the highly-dynamic intertidal estuarine landforms, which are subject to active erosion and deposition processes, have the largest impact on vegetation cover and, hence, on NDVI. Assessing the vegetation canopy using NDVI as an evaluation tool has provided temporal-dynamic datasets that can be correlated to the main individual environmental controls. Such knowledge will allow resource managers to make more informed decisions for sustainable conservation plans following the evaluation the potential consequences of any environmental changes.

AB  - This study was conducted to assess soil salinity forecasting using spectral soil reflectivity. Artificial salinization was carried out on silty clay loam soil. Collected soil sample was handy crushed, sieved through a 4 mm sieve and backed in plastic columns. The columns were closed from the bottom with a perforated plastic lids with the presence of sand-gravel filter. Columns placed vertically at plastic basins contain saline ground water and left for salinization by capillary rise. At the desired salinity level, soil reflectivity was measured using spectroradiometer and wave length between 350-2500 nm, and band width 1 nm. Soil salinity and moisture were determined soon after spectral measurements. Data processed and converted to digital data using ViewSpecPro software. MS Excel 2010 was used to calculate reflectivity data for bands equivalent to those used with the sensor OLI used at LandSat-8. SPSS V. 23 statistic program was used to formulate mathematics models (Multiple linear, Quadratic and Cubic) that describe the relationship between soil salinity and spectral reflectivity at three soil moisture levels i.e. 8, 18 and 24%. Results confirmed the efficiency of the three models to forecast soil salinity at 19 dS m(-1) or higher and at soil moisture of 24%. The quadratic and cubic models also gave good results at soil salinity of 9 dS m(-1) or more and at 8% soil moisture level. At soil moisture of 18%, the Quadratic and Cubic models showed behavior similar to their behavior at the lower moisture level, while the linear model was efficient at salinity level of 40 dS m(-1) and higher.

AB  - In this study, we compared coupled and uncoupled land surface model simulations of surface soil moisture (SM) with passive microwave remote sensing observations of SM over the contiguous US (CONUS). For this purpose, we used the following: (i) the European Space Agency's Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite retrieved L3 surface SM; (ii) the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E) SM derived using LPRM; and (iii) the coupled and uncoupled ORCHIDEE land surface model. The comparison was achieved by computing the temporal mean difference between the normalized remotely-sensed and the model-SM datasets. It was found that both coupled and uncoupled models are drier than the remotely sensed data (particularly the SMOS data) over the principal aquifers of the CONUS. These aquifers are known as one of the places where irrigation is intensive. Therefore, the reason behind this model' dryness could be the fact that the models do not take into account the irrigation activities, which can be monitored by the remotely-sensed observations. Time series of SM over irrigated pixels also showed that SMOS was wetter than the models mainly during the irrigation period.

T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Dwelling unit (population) data at finer zones are important for different applications. The census data are not available every year and published at coarse zones. While the remotely sensed data have addressed this limitation, analysis of spatial non-stationarity in the relationship between dwelling and detailed urban remote-sensing covariates for dwelling estimates is almost novel. Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, is chosen as a case study. The remote-sensing variables have been derived from QuickBird data using an object-based image analysis. To analyse the spatial non-stationarity, ordinary least squares (OLS) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) approaches are applied. The OLS models suggest that utilizing three-residential classes provides more accurate results than built area and residential built area. The GWR models are more accurate than the OLS model. This research proves that the GWR approach cannot completely handle the spatial non-stationarity problem without efficient explanatory variables. For example, the GWR model that uses three-residential classes is the best model to estimate dwelling compared with the GWR model that uses residential built area. This article confirms that the application of the OLS approach with efficient explanatory variables can successfully account the spatial non-stationarity and the results are relatively comparable with the GWR model.

TI  - Flood risk assessment of Srinagar city in Jammu and Kashmir, India
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RESILIENCE IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Risk assessment is imperative for disaster risk reduction. The risk is rooted to various physical, social, economic, demographic and environmental factors that determine the probable magnitude of loss during an extreme event. By way of bringing a conceptual model into practice, this paper aims to examine the flood risk of the Srinagar city.Design/methodology/approach The risk triangle model has been adopted in the present investigation evaluating parameters, reflective of hazard (intensity), exposure (spatial) and vulnerability (sensitivity) using Landsat-8 operational land imager scene (10 September 2014), global positioning system, Cartosat-1 digital elevation model and socioeconomic and demographic data (Census of India, 2011). The authors characterise flood hazard intensity on the basis of variability in water depth during a recent event (September 2014 Kashmir flood); spatial exposure as a function of terrain elevation; and socioeconomic structure and demographic composition of each municipal ward of the city as a determinant factor of the vulnerability. Statistical evaluation and geographic information system-based systematic integration of all the multi-resolution data layers helped to develop composite flood risk score of each ward of the city.Findings Principal deliverable of this study is flood risk map of the Srinagar city. The results reveal that approximately 46 per cent of the city comprising 33 municipal wards is at high risk, while rest of the area, i.e. 17 and 37 per cent, exhibit moderate and low levels of risk, constituting 23 and 12 municipal wards, respectively. It is very likely that the municipal wards expressing high risk may witness comparatively more damage (impact) during any future flood event. Thus, there is a need of planned interventions (structural and non-structural) to minimise the emergent risk.Originality/value Very rare attempts have been made to bring theoretical models of disaster research in practice; this is mainly because of the complexities associated with the data (selection, availability and subjectivity), methodology (integration, quantification) and resolution (spatial scales). In this direction, this work is expected to have considerable impact, as it provides a clear foundation to overcome such issues for the studies aiming at disaster risk assessment. Furthermore, using varied primary and secondary data, this paper demonstrates the relative (municipal wards) flood risk status of the Srinagar city, which is one of the key aspects for flood hazard mitigation.

TI  - Land surface deformation parameter estimation using persistent scatterer interferometry approach in an underground metal mining environment
T2  - IMAGING SCIENCE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) is a major advancement in radar interferometry for detecting and monitoring land deformation. PSI is the most advanced class of differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) techniques. The technique conquers the main drawbacks of the conventional DInSAR technique by identifying radar targets having stable backscattering characteristics in time. These targets are termed as persistent scatterers (PSs). The higher the number of PSs for a study area the higher the accuracy of the results will be, which is most common for deformation analysis in urban areas. However, for nonurban or highly de-correlated areas, PSs density collapses significantly, which needs to increase for optimal results. For this purpose, partially coherent/distributed scatterers (DSs) are being exploited in addition to the PSs. The field surface of this study is one of the copper-rich mining belts in India, which consists of two major underground metal mines. Scatterer characterziation of the field surface under study suggests that most of the scatterers are DSs and very few scatterers under the influence of the mining zone are PSs. In addition to this, a preliminary investigation of deformation characteristics of the field surface under study reveals that the spatial extent of deformation is small/localized along with slow and non-linear deformation. Keeping in view scatterer and deformation characteristics of the field surface under study, in this research paper, a Quasi-Persistent Scatterer based PSI approach has been applied using high-resolution TerraSAR-X interferometric data stack (10 images) to generate deformation time series and deformation velocity. Furthermore, results obtained from the applied PSI approach and ground-based observations (using GNSS) have shown good agreement with each other, in the order of -5.20 mm/year (LOS) and -5.38 mm/year (subsiding), respectively.

TI  - SAUDI CHILDREN'S TAXONOMIC KNOWLEDGE OF ANIMAL SPECIES
T2  - JOURNAL OF BALTIC SCIENCE EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this research was to explore and compare the ideas of Saudi boys and girls on animal species. Eighty-four children (comprising 42 boys and 42 girls), aged nine years, from four primary schools, participated in structured interviews to determine their ideas pertaining to taxonomiclabels, namely 'animal', 'fish', 'amphibian', 'reptile', 'bird', 'mammal', and 'insect'. The results demonstrated that Saudi children of both genders display a wide range of alternative conceptions; more specifically, the effect of gender was significant for all taxonomic vertebrate labels, suggesting that Saudi boys have better knowledge relating to animals than girls. However, generally, children did not have adequate forms of reasoning for biological classification. It was also found that none of the fourth graders thought of humans as animals due to the Islamic science worldview. Based on these findings, it is argued that science education, notably in an international context, should strive to incorporate an understanding of local values and beliefs.

AB  - The response of eastern Ontario farmland species diversity to landscape dynamics was modeled at multiple spatial and temporal scales using metrics derived from MODIS and Landsat data in random forest and multiple regression analyses. For the seven taxa studied, significant positive gamma diversity responses to MODIS-derived start of season NDVI and its spatial coefficient of variation over 3 km x 3 km landscapes were found for beetles and birds. Butterfly diversity was positively related to mean growing season NDVI. Plant diversity was found to be greater in landscapes where the start of the growing season is earlier. Landsat data analysis found that beetle and plant diversity is lower when Tasseled Cap brightness increases and wetness decreases, while butterfly and bird diversity increased with increasing NDVI. Initial inter-annual analysis showed that variation in NDVI over the period of 1985-2011 was not related to biodiversity measured in 2011-2012; i.e. no effect of inter-annual landscape vegetation dynamics on biodiversity was found.

AB  - The identification of Aedes aegypti breeding hotspots in urban areas is crucial for the rational design of control strategies against this disease vector. Remote sensing and geographic information systems offer valuable tools for mapping habitat suitability of a given area. However, predicting species occurrences by means of probability distribution maps based on transversal entomological surveys has limited utility for local authorities. The aim of the present study was to carefully examine the temporal evolution of the number of houses infested with immature stages of Ae. aegypti in each individual neighbourhood and to explore the value of producing environmental clusters generated with information provided by remotely sensed variables to explain the observed differential temporal behaviour. Entomological surveys were conducted between 2011 and 2013 throughout a small town in Argentina registering the number of houses with containers harbouring inunature stages of Ae. aegypti. A SPOT 5 satellite image was used to obtain land cover variables, which were subsequently submitted to k-means partitioning for grouping neighbourhoods into four environmental clusters. Finally, a generalized linear model was fitted showing that the number of houses found to be positive for Ae. aegypti was jointly affected by the interaction between environmental clusters and the year of sampling. Moreover, the number of positive houses in one of the clusters was 9.5 times higher (P<0.005, SE=0.37) in 2013 than in 2012, but we did not observe any other statistically significant increases.

AB  - Remote sensing can be a powerful tool for long-teen spatial and temporal water quality monitoring if proper sets of algorithms are available. To estimate optically significant substances (OSS) by satellite images the water-leaving reflectance (pw) must be accurately estimated because it is directly related to the inherent optical properties (IOPs). For an accurate pw an effective atmospheric correction method must be used to remote the contribution of the atmospheric path radiance. The C2RCC processor has a set of algorithms capable of reduce the atmospheric path radiance, estimate the IOPs and then the OSS concentrations. But, the C2RCC was only tested using OL Cl/Sentine1-3 images for coastal areas, therefore, is of huge importance to know about their accuracy for inland waters. The results showed that the pw (with errors from 26.57 to 97.48%), IOPs (with errors from 39.77 to 99.90%) and OSS concentrations (with errors from 49.29 to 148.40%) estimated by C2RCC have no correlation with in situ data. For a long-teen use of OL Cl/Sentine1-3 images researchers must try to use another atmospheric correction and IOPs estimation methods when studying inland waters.

CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments on board the Terra and Aqua spacecraft are equipped with several on-board calibrators (OBCs) and continue to operate normally since launch. One such calibrator is the Spectro-Radiometric Calibration Assembly (SRCA), whose regular calibrations provide accurate measurements in radiometric, spatial and spectral modes. The SRCA is able to monitor and measure the center wavelength (CW) shift, the bandwidth (BW) shift and a major portion of the relative spectral response (RSR) for each of the MODIS reflective solar bands (RSBs) while operating in spectral mode. However, there are several factors that influence the uncertainties when calculating these results. This paper provides a brief overview of the SRCA in spectral mode, along with how the CWs, BWs and RSRs of the MODIS RSBs are calculated. The operational factors that contribute to the spectral uncertainty are also discussed, including the variation of the half-included angle (beta) and the grating motor offset angle (theta(off)) of the monochromator. A comparison between the theoretical and on-board CW uncertainty is also provided.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth Observing Systems XXIII
CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments on-board the Terra and Aqua spacecraft are equipped with several on-board calibrators (OBCs) and continue to operate normally since launch. One such calibrator is the solar diffuser (SD), which allows for the calibration of the 20 reflective solar bands (RSBs) with wavelengths ranging from 0.41 to 2.3 mu m. In order to accurately characterize the RSBs on-orbit, the changes associated with the SD bi-directional reflectance factor (BRF) are tracked using a solar diffuser stability monitor (SDSM). The SDSM consists of nine detectors located within a spherical integration source (SIS) and covers wavelengths from 0.41 to 0.94 mu m. During each calibration event, the SDSM alternately views sunlight through an attenuation screen and the sunlight reflected from the SD in order to accurately characterize the degradation of the SD at those nine wavelengths. This paper provides a brief overview of the SD/SDSM calibration and operation, with more emphasis on the recent performance of the SD degradation and the SDSM detectors. A methodology to compute the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for each of the SDSM detectors is formulated and the noise performance is tracked over the mission lifetime. The importance of the detector noise to the RSB calibration uncertainty and to other instruments, such as the VIIRS SDSM, is also discussed.

TI  - Water Shortage Drives Interactions Between Cushion and Beneficiary Species Along Elevation Gradients in Dry Himalayas
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - It is challenging to understand the drivers of plant-plant interaction patterns in dry mountains. However, such knowledge is important to assess alpine ecosystem resilience to climate change. In water-limited ecosystems, leaf C-13 and satellite-derived vegetation index (NDVI) may serve as reliable indicators of environmental severity to address plant responses to water availability. We hypothesized that in dry mountains, interaction intensity between cushion and beneficiary species increases with increasing C-13 and decreasing NDVI regardless of elevation, indicating the importance of water availability in driving plant interactions. We used relative interaction indices (RII) of species and individual numbers within and outside the canopy of three cushion plant species along three elevational transects in dry Himalayas, Nepal. Site-specific NDVI was calculated from 30m Landsat images. Thornthwaite moisture index was calculated for each elevation site. We observed nonlinear patterns in RII, C-13, and NDVI with elevation. Intraspecific variation of C-13 was negatively correlated with moisture index and NDVI, while NDVI across sites was positively correlated with precipitation but not with temperature. RII within a cushion species was positively correlated with C-13 and negatively with NDVI when the effect of elevation was removed. In pooled data across cushion species and sites, RII was negatively correlated with precipitation and NDVI when the effect of temperature was removed. RII was uncorrelated with cushion size under the same environment. Leaf nitrogen showed no correlation with RII or C-13. Our data show that water shortage is the main driver of plant interactions in the alpine belt of dry Himalayas.

M3  - Article
AB  - The ethno-cultural aura of phraseology is revealed in conjunction with the comprehension of the secrets of the linguistic mentality of peoples that generates the idiomatics of native languages. Since traditionally ethno-cultural specificity of phraseology was studied at the level of a country study description, an attempt was made to elucidate the work of cognitive-pragmatic mechanisms for the formation of phraseological imagery. The first method is aimed at revealing the ethno-cultural component in the value-semantic potential of phraseme building components, called culturally significant realia. However, the authors do not confine themselves to this method, which narrows the reference of phraseme building components. An integrated approach to the identification and description of the ethno-cultural component is proposed, using the analysis of the integrated configuration of the four factors of the formation of the axiological content of phrasemes.

TI  - Participation of Contemporary Pagans in Heritage Politics of Lithuania
T2  - POMEGRANATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper aims at examining participation of contemporary Lithuanian Pagans (represented by Romuva in this study) in politics of heritagization. After presentation of a broader picture of the research and the revival of ethnic culture during both Soviet and post-Soviet periods, contemporary Pagan discourse and practices intended for society, as well as attempts to make influence through state institutions are analyzed. The case study shows that they interact and compete with other religious groups and inheritors of the past and can employ a range of strategies to seek power and influence in heritage politics. The post-Soviet context that accounts for some specific characteristics of contemporary Eastern European Pagans is also an important factor in heritage politics related to worldview-based competition, and in Lithuanian case, the well-known hostility of contemporary Pagans towards Christianity is accompanied by the threat that representatives of the Catholic Church feel because of the Pagans' influence in heritage politics.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article contributes to understand imagery of nature in the context of Tarjei Vesaas' artistic philosophy. Tarjei Vesaas was a Norwegian writer, widely known in the world, and rarely studied in Russia. The introduction is brief overview of the poet's biography. The analytical part gives general review of Vesaas' six poetry books and discusses main imagery of each, align with characteristics of basic images of nature introduced by the poet and analytics of the "mystics in the concrete" - notion, suggested by Jon Fosse to outline Tarjei Vesaas' philosophy. In the poet's creative evolution his philosophy of nature was expanded with existentionalism and irrationalism, which gradually dominated in the writer's worldview. We mark difference between the use of nature and country-side imagery in Tarjei Vesaas and Russian traditionalist writers of the 20th century. We give some parallels between his poetic and prose works in this relation.

AB  - The article proposes an interpretation of A. Fet's poems in the form of a knowledge building workshop. The lesson project is preceded by the rationale for choosing the form of the lesson. At the heart of the lesson plan there are some tasks that allow us to see, to understand, and to characterize the specifics of the poetic worldview and attitude of A. A. Fet. During the lesson, students have an opportunity to feel themselves as poets, critics and readers at the same time. In the role of a poet, they select the most accurate and expressive epithets and metaphors, in the role of a critic they reflect on the problem of the ratio of poetic vigilance and grammatical accuracy in the lyrics and take part in the discussion of the poetry of A. A. Fet, in the role of a reader they compare the images created by A. A. Fet and B.L. Pasternak. This type of work creates conditions for the perception of the complex text and shapes the ability of building new personal meanings in a dialogue with classical works.

AB  - The challenges for the arctic ecosystems of Russia are due to the weak regeneration capacity of natural components against the backdrop of an ever-increasing technogenic burden of the oil-producing industry, frequent failures at the oil- and gas-pipelines, drilling rigs and plants, emission of industrial wastes into the atmosphere and discharge of waste waters into the rivers and seas. The present-day technical facilities for remote sensing of the Earth's shells allow obtaining digital images of practically all sites of the Earth's surface at a high spatial resolution and in a wide range of the electromagnetic wave spectrum. The tasks of geoinformation monitoring of the arctic territories are urgent. The purpose of this study is to develop the principles and mechanisms of geoinformation ecological monitoring of oil producing arctic territories based on the example of Kolguyev Island, using the GIS-technologies and Landsat-8 imagery.

T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Salinization is one of the major soil degradation threats occurring worldwide. This study evaluates the feasibility of operational surface soil salinity mapping based on state-of-the-art Earth Observation (EO) products captured by sensors on-board WorldView-2 (WV2) and Landsat 8 satellites. The proposed methods are tested in Timpaki, south-central Crete,Greece, where brackish water irrigation puts soil health at risk of soil salinization. In all cases, EO products are calibrated against soil samples collected from bare soil locations. Results indicate a moderate correlation of observed ECe values with the investigated remote sensing parameters. Regarding sensitivity to saline soil, the yellow band displays higher values. Comparison between methods used in the literature shows that those developed specifically for soil salinity, and especially index S5, perform better. The proposed detection index' and 3D PCA transformation methodology perform reasonably well in detecting areas with high ECe values and provide a simple and effective operational alternative for saline topsoil detection and mapping.

AB  - Sentinel-2 is an Earth Observation optical mission developed and operated by the European Space Agency (ESA) in the frame of the Copernicus program of the European Commission. The mission consists on a MultiSpectral Instruments (MSI) on board a constellation of two satellites flying on the same orbit but phased at 180 degrees: Sentinel-2A launched in June 2015 and Sentinel-2B launched in March 2017. It covers the Earth's land surfaces and inland and coastal waters every five days at the equator under the same viewing conditions with high spatial resolution and wide field of view. Accurate radiometric calibration is key to the success of the mission; therefore, in-orbit calibration and validation activities are conducted within the Sentinel-2 Mission Performance Centre (MPC), including a consortium of Expert Support Laboratories (ESL). The Database of Imaging Multispectral Instrument and Tool for Radiometric Intercomparison (DIMITRI) is used to perform the vicarious validation of Level-1 products delivered to users. The aims of this validation are 1) to assess the quality of the data product at Level-1, 2) to monitor the evolution of the radiometry of both instruments and 3) to ensure that the products meet the mission requirement accuracy. Three vicarious methods are used, such as Rayleigh scattering, Desert Pseudo-Invariant Calibration Sites (PICS) and Sensor-to-Sensor inter-calibration methods. Although the results indicate good stability and performance of both sensors MSI-A/B, a slight discrepancy between them of similar to 1% over desert sites could be observed. Slight decrease of band B8A (865 nm) signal over Algeria-3 site has been detected since April 2017. This effect seems to be related to the impact of human and industry activities near the area. Radiometric performances and image quality of Sentinel-2 MSI-A/B level-1C products appear stable and meet the mission requirements.

TI  - Valuation and validation of carbon sources and sinks through land cover/use change analysis: The case of Bangkok metropolitan area
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates carbon sources and carbon sink estimation, nexus and validation through Land cover/land use (LCLU) change analysis of Bangkok Metropolitan Area (BMA), Thailand. Considering spiking population and carbon emission trends, especially in metropolitan cities of developing countries, such estimations are direly needed. Moreover, quantification and empirical evidence involving such a multidisciplinary analysis are rarely available. Therefore, this study would help in understanding the relationship among economic development, carbon emissions, carbon sinks and land use change in BMA. CO2 emission and sequestration data from 1987 to 2015 were collected, and the changes and rate of change in LCLU were assessed by analyzing landsat satellite images of 1987, 1995, 2005, and 2015. Best efforts were put to attain net gains and losses in carbon sources and sinks analyses. Results showed that carbon sources have increased by almost 4-folds from 1987 to 2015 while sinks have declined rapidly to half of its original amount since 1987. The gap between carbon sources and sinks is widening year by year and will, if it continues in this manner cover up the whole green space of BMA in the next decade. The LCLU change results also verified and showed the same results, which helped in validating such outcomes. Urban/built up area sprawl over 60% of BMA's area while the remaining 40% constitutes agricultural land, green spaces, and water bodies. Furthermore, the rate of change of urban area was 157.4 sq km during 2005-2015 and 218 sq km during 1995-2005. Therefore, policy makers of BMA should seriously draft expansion plans of green spaces and public parks and implement it immediately to tackle with carbon emissions and land use change disquiets. Meanwhile, awareness regarding conservation of green areas, trees, and use of public transport could be another set of bottom-up policies.

TI  - IGTMPP: A Hybrid Method to Predict Missing Pixels of Remote Sensing Images Using Geo-Temporal Properties

CP  - International Conference on Digital Image Computing - Techniques and Applications (DICTA)

AB  - At times, remote sensing images do not capture every pixel in a target location due to atmospheric or electronic disturbance. These uncaptured pixels are referred to as missing pixels. Since missing pixels may contain important data, they can negatively affect downstream applications and scientific fields. A number of methods have been developed to predict the value of missing pixels and can be classified into four groups: deterministic, geostatistic, auxiliary image-based and hybrid methods. Each method has limitations with a common limitation being predicting change for a particular environmental class. Here, we introduce the Integration of Geostatistic and Temporal Missing Pixels' Properties (IGTMPP) as a hybrid method to predict missing pixels. IGTMPP combines geostatistical and temporal relationships between pixels, based on how similar pixels to a target pixel changed over time. IGTMPP was tested using Landsat 5 images of different areas in Queensland, Australia and compared with three baseline methods. The results showed that IGTMPP outperformed the baseline methods.

AB  - In the present study, drainage analysis with application in lithological and structural study using remote sensing and GIS technique has been carried out in left bank catchment (Sukhnag-Ferozpur) of River Jhelum, Kashmir Basin. The remote sensing and GIS with the aid of satellite data are emerging as the most effective and time-saving technique for drainage analysis. This technique is found applicable for the extraction of drainage basin and its drainage networks from ASTER (DEM) with the support of satellite data (IRS LISS III 2005 and Survey of Indian toposheets). Drainage analysis is found of immense utility in the examination of lithology and structures. The mean bifurcation ratio fluctuation indicates structural control in drainage development in south-west side. Low drainage density is observed in low relief and highly permeable material in north-east and high drainage density in regions having impermeable sub-surface and mountainous relief in south-west side. Lithological and lineament analysis is performed using satellite data which gave ample support to the spatial variability of lithology and the presence of structures illustrated out by drainage parameters. Moreover, mountain fronts (mainly active fronts), stream profiles (showing anomalous nature at lineament crossing) and drainage basin asymmetry (left tilt) also supported to the presence of possible structures. The dominant trend of the lineaments was observed NW-SE which concords with the trend shown by major structures traversing in and around the area. The sub-watersheds in the Sukhnag catchment (left side of River Jhelum) has been divided into three zones: high-altitude zone of rugged topography and steep slopes with hard rocks like Panjal Volcanic, Dogra slates, and limestone; middle altitude zone of Karewas; and low-altitude flood plain zone of alluvium. The chances of landsliding in the high-altitude zone are more because of high-structural, steep-slope and deep-valley topography enhanced by cutting slopes, deforestation, making road and buildings. Futher, the high-altitude basins contribute more water to plainer area and to the main river (Jhelum River) causing floods in low-lying areas, which becomes most disastrous during heavy rainfall conditions. The low-lying plainer area were found more prone to floods as observed in recent flooding (Sep 2014) in the Kashmir Valley.

T2  - PHILOSOPHY AND COSMOLOGY-FILOSOFIYA I KOSMOLOGIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper focuses on cosmological ideas of a twentieth-century Russian philosopher Nikolay Lossky (1870-1965). It specifies the place of these ideas within the entire framework of his philosophical views, as well as in the context of his topology of philosophical systems, in particular. the discrimination between organic and non-organic worldview. A historico-philosophical analysis of Lossky's cosmology allows revealing the interaction of gnoseological and ontological principles of his system, e.g. explicating the difference of Lossky's intuitionism from the one of Bergson. The key section of the organic worldview is the doctrine of the hierarchy of substantival agents: the hierarchical personalism, as well as the notions of transcreation, dynamic understanding of matter, and the doctrine of free will closely related to it. The paper specifies the peculiarities of Lossky's interpretations of panvitalism and panpsychism, as well as the doctrine of reincarnation, which has a particular place in his system. The final stage of Lossky's cosmological ideas development is his ontological aesthetics: on this stage he understands the world as an embodiment of beauty. The conclusion is drawn that Lossky's cosmological doctrine is Christian and metaphysical in its nature.

AB  - In the last decades the photogrammetry has undergone interesting innovation, both in terms of data processing and acquisition mode, to allow obtaining detailed 3D models useful for complete survey and important support for the management and recovery of cultural heritage and buildings. However, despite recent developments, the main photogrammetry outputs are raster data (ortophoto and DEM) and point clouds characterized by high informative content, but they are not typically extracted automatically. Automated feature detection is yet manual, time-consuming procedure and an active area of research. The raster to vector conversion is not direct, but transformations must be performed on the input data to convert the pixel values into features. Always, segmentations are preceded by filter technique to remove noise and to improve the conversion phase. However, remote sensing data and especially UAV photogrammetry output are the most complex to treat because of their heterogeneity (presence of different objects and shapes), the nature of sensor used and the different scale. In this work we experiment new enhancement filter to improve the automatic extraction of vector information for a UAV photogrammetry results of the facing walls of eminent church, symbol of the city of L'Aquila, the" Basilica of Santa Maria di Collemaggio".

TI  - POTENTIAL OF LANDSAT-OLI FOR SEAGRASS AND ALGAE SPECIES DETECTION AND DISCRIMINATION IN BAHRAIN NATIONAL WATER USING SPECTRAL REFLECTANCE

AB  - Seagrass (Halodule uninervis and Halophila stipulacea) and algae (green and brown) species are widely distributed along the coastal zones of the Bahrain national water. In this study the potential of Landsat-OLI VNIR spectral bands was investigated for distinction and discrimination among these species using spectral reflectances. The measured spectra's of each species considering different coverage rate (0, 10, 30, 75 and 100%) were transformed using continuum-removed (CR) approach, resampled and convolved in the solar-reflective spectral bands of OLI using a radiative transfer code, then converted to water vegetation indices (WVI). Regression analysis were performed between the transformed WVI and the coverage rates of each species individually (seagrass and algae) and mixed; as well between WVI and NIR reflectances. Spectral and CR analyses showed that the blue and the green bands perform better than the coastal and the red bands for seagrass and algae classes' discrimination. This result was further corroborated by the WVI. Regression results between the coverage rates and WVI calculated with green and NIR bands showed that the TDAVI and WAVI discriminate significantly among the mixed species (R-2 of 0.70), and between individual species (R-2 of 0.80 for algae and for seagrass). Accomplished between WVI and NIR reflectances, regression correlations were more significant when all mixed samples (R-2 of 0.95) have been considered, likewise when we consider individually the two seagrass (R-2 of 0.95) and the two algae species (R-2 of 0.82).

TI  - Soil salinity and vegetation cover change detection from multi-temporal remotely sensed imagery in Al Hassa Oasis in Saudi Arabia
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Detecting soil salinity changes and its impact on vegetation cover are necessary to understand the relationships between these changes in vegetation cover. This study aims to determine the changes in soil salinity and vegetation cover in Al Hassa Oasis over the past 28years and investigates whether the salinity change causing the change in vegetation cover. Landsat time series data of years 1985, 2000 and 2013 were used to generate Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Soil Salinity Index (SI) images, which were then used in image differencing to identify vegetation and salinity change/no-change for two periods. Soil salinity during 2000-2013 exhibits much higher increase compared to 1985-2000, while the vegetation cover declined to 6.31% for the same period. Additionally, highly significant (p<0.0001) negative relationships found between the NDVI and SI differencing images, confirmed the potential long-term linkage between the changes in soil salinity and vegetation cover.

AB  - Supporting datasets for Allen et al. (2018) - Global estimates of river flow wave travel times and implications for low-latency satellite data  Abstract Earth-orbiting satellites provide valuable observations of upstream river conditions worldwide. These observations can be used in real-time applications like early flood warning systems and reservoir operations, provided they are made available to users with sufficient lead time. Yet, the temporal requirements for access to satellite-based river data remain uncharacterized for time-sensitive applications. Here we present a global approximation of flow wave travel time to assess the utility of existing and future low-latency/near-real-time satellite products, with an emphasis on the forthcoming SWOT satellite. We apply a kinematic wave model to a global hydrography dataset and find that global flow waves traveling at their maximum speed take a median travel time of 6, 4 and 3 days to reach their basin terminus, the next downstream city and the next downstream dam respectively. Our findings suggest that a recently-proposed ≤2-day latency for a low-latency SWOT product is potentially useful for real-time river applications.

TI  - Satellite remote sensing of land cover change in a mixed agro-silvo-pastoral landscape in the Alentejo, Portugal
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mixed agro-silvo-pastoral landscapes are typically of significant natural, economic and cultural value. The montado (wood pasture) dominated systems of southern Portugal are a prime example, and experience high rates of land cover change. Tracking these changes is of importance for landscape level conservation and management. Whilst satellite remote sensing is the most realistic approach at large spatial scales, heterogeneous landscapes can present challenges to the accurate classification of land cover and its change. In this investigation we demonstrate a novel approach to the investigation of land cover change over a 25year period (1984-2009) in an area of importance for the conservation of the Iberian lynx, Black vulture, and other threatened biodiversity in south-east Alentejo, Portugal. We apply a Tasselled Cap Transformation (TCT) to Landsat imagery from these two years, and then Change Vector Analysis (CVA) on the transformed data to highlight areas of vegetation gain and loss during the intervening period. Using a 2009 land cover classification, and a set of rules based on these vegetation changes, we then predict the land change over the 25year period focussing on predominant classes of vegetation physiognomy. The results are discussed in terms of probable drivers, as well as implications for biodiversity and other landscape values.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING FOR AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS, AND HYDROLOGY XX
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing for Agriculture, Ecosystems, and Hydrology XX
CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is one of the fastest agriculture economical growing country in the world. One aspect of this agriculture growth is the development of the date palm trees sector in the UAE. The date palm tree is considered one of the oldest and most widely cultivated tree, which is commercially the most important tree in the life of its people and their heritage. Moreover, the date palm tree was believed to be a part of the UAE strategy to control desertification. With this huge investment and interest in palm trees in the UAE, there is limited knowledge of the actual tree counts and their exact spatial locations, which is a requirement for any agricultural census. WorldView-3 satellite images were used to develop an algorithm to detect and count palm trees in the UAE. The processing was done in two steps: the first step is to detect palm trees which involved supervised classification using maximum likelihood with four feature classes: Red, Blue, Green and Near infrared (NIR) bands associated with palm trees objects taken by the labeling. The second step is to count palm trees which involved extracting local spatial maxima of Laplacian blob from Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) masking. The algorithm was tested in different regions of interest in AlAin city, part of the capital Emirate Abu Dhabi. The algorithm and final results are compared with ground truth images for accuracy assessment. The results were satisfactory with an accuracy of 89% and higher and very minimum negligible misclassification.

M3  - Article
AB  - AimsThis study aims to describe the development of a Cerebral Palsy Follow-up Registry in Jordan (CPUP-Jordan) and to provide a baseline child and parent demographic information, birth history of the child participants, and distribution of the participants based on topographical distribution of cerebral palsy (CP) and functional classification systems.MethodsThe CPUP-Jordan was developed using a similar framework of a follow-up surveillance programme for persons with CP in Sweden (CPUP). Standard assessment forms were utilized to collect data related to child and family demographics, child birth history, and functional classifications and physiotherapy and occupational therapy assessments and interventions. Research assistants were trained to conduct the assessments. A secured web-based system was developed to store data and disseminate knowledge maintained in the registry. Children with CP were included in the registry if they have confirmed diagnosis of CP. The ascertainment age of inclusion and the minimum age of survival required are 4years.ResultsOne hundred sixty-seven children were registered between 2013 and 2015 (mean age is 3.63.0years). Forty-two percent were born premature, and 48% were less than the normal birthweight. Perinatal causes were reported for 54% of the participants. The most common type of CP based on tone disturbance was spastic type, and the most common topographical distributions of motor dysfunction were quadriplegia followed by diplegia. Fifty-six percent of the participants had severe limitation in ambulation; 48% had restricted manual abilities, and 47% had limited communication abilities even with familiar family members and partners.ConclusionsThe development of CPUP-Jordan registry for children with CP proved to be both feasible and informative. The registry baseline descriptive data were similar to those reported in previous research in Jordan supporting validity of the data. The implementation of CPUP-Jordan at national level is expected to have a positive impact on children with CP, clinicians, policymakers, and researchers.

AB  - Simulation is an important tool in understanding and designing physical systems, engineering systems and social systems. Because of its importance and broad range, it has been the subject of numerous research and books. Simulation is about techniques for using computers to imitate (simulate) the operations of various kinds of real world complex systems. It has been an accepted tool for the improvement of decision making through discovering knowledge and learning how to deal with the complexity of real world. This paper illustrates the importance of system thinking in enhancing decision making process and providing the ability to see the world as a complex system, where "you cannot just do one thing" and that "everything is connected to everything else". It is a holistic worldview that enables people to discover hidden knowledge and to act in consonance with the best interest of the system as a whole and thus enhance the learning loop through various system thinking tools. The case study in this paper illustrated the use of a system dynamics simulator to allow the financial manager in a firm to discover certain aspects and test different account receivables scenarios and the strategies to control these accounts. We found that this simulator has helped the manager to increases his knowledge about the problem by analysing the effect of his decisions.

TI  - The effect of different build orientations on the consolidation, tensile and fracture toughness properties of direct metal laser sintering Ti-6Al-4V
T2  - RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to study new process parameters which were selected to achieve the full density of Ti-6Al-4V samples in different building orientations and investigate fracture toughness property and its relation to the microstructure, an area which has not previously been reported in full detail and which may offer information to a designer. Direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) is an additive manufacturing technique that directly manufactures three-dimensional parts, layer-by-layer, to scan and melt metal powders for aerospace applications.Design/methodology/approach - Hardness and tensile tests were carried out to evaluate the effect of consolidation on the mechanical performance of specimens made at three different building directions. Optical and electron microscopy were used to characterise the microstructure of the DMLS specimens and their effects on the fractures and mechanical properties.Findings - It was found that the built samples have an excellent density at 4.5 g/cm, and the sample surfaces parallel to the building direction are rougher than the perpendicular surfaces. The fracture toughness result was higher than that of the cast material for the same alloy and higher than the Ti-6Al-4V parts fabricated by electron beam melting. This results in the superior mechanical properties of DMLS, while slightly lower in the zy direction owing to cracks, porosity and surface finish.Research limitations/implications - The tensile strength was found to be higher than the wrought material, and the samples exhibited brittle fractures owing to the martensitic phase, which is caused by a high temperature gradient, and the mechanical properties change with the change in the microstructures at different building directions.Originality/value - This paper contains original research.

TI  - Density-based particle swarm optimization algorithm for data clustering
T2  - EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is widely used in cluster analysis. However, it is a stochastic technique that is vulnerable to premature convergence to sub-optimal clustering solutions. PSO-based clustering algorithms also require tuning of the learning coefficient values to find better solutions. The latter drawbacks can be evaded by setting a proper balance between the exploitation and exploration behaviors of particles while searching the feature space. Moreover, particles must take into account the magnitude of movement in each dimension and search for the optimal solution in the most populated regions in the feature space. This study presents a novel approach for data clustering based on particle swarms. In this proposal, the balance between exploitation and exploration processes is considered using a combination of (i) kernel density estimation technique associated with new bandwidth estimation method to address the premature convergence and (ii) estimated multidimensional gravitational learning coefficients. The proposed algorithm is compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms using 11 benchmark datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository in terms of classification accuracy, repeatability represented by the standard deviation of the classification accuracy over different runs, and cluster compactness represented by the average Dunn index values over different runs. The results of Friedman Aligned-Ranks test with Holm's test over the average classification accuracy and Dunn index values indicate that the proposed algorithm achieves better accuracy and compactness when compared with other algorithms. The significance of the proposed algorithm is represented in addressing the limitations of the PSO-based clustering algorithms to push forward clustering as an important technique in the field of expert systems and machine learning. Such application, in turn, enhances the classification accuracy and cluster compactness. In this context, the proposed algorithm achieves better results compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms when applied to high-dimensional datasets (e.g., Landsat and Dermatology). This finding confirms the importance of estimating multidimensional learning coefficients that consider particle movements in all the dimensions of the feature space. The proposed algorithm can likewise be applied in repeatability matters for better decision making, as in medical diagnosis, as proved by the low standard deviation obtained using the proposed algorithm in conducted experiments.

TI  - Goce derived geoid changes before the Pisagua 2014 earthquake
T2  - GEODESY AND GEODYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The analysis of space - time surface deformation during earthquakes reveals the variable state of stress that occurs at deep crustal levels, and this information can be used to better understand the seismic cycle. Understanding the possible mechanisms that produce earthquake precursors is a key issue for earthquake prediction. In the last years, modern geodesy can map the degree of seismic coupling during the interseismic period, as well as the coseismic and postseismic slip for great earthquakes along subduction zones. Earthquakes usually occur due to mass transfer and consequent gravity variations, where these changes have been monitored for intraplate earthquakes by means of terrestrial gravity measurements. When stresses and correspondent rupture areas are large, affecting hundreds of thousands of square kilometres (as occurs in some segments along plate interface zones), satellite gravimetry data become relevant. This is due to the higher spatial resolution of this type of data when compared to terrestrial data, and also due to their homogeneous precision and availability across the whole Earth. Satellite gravity missions as GOCE can map the Earth gravity field with unprecedented precision and resolution. We mapped geoid changes from two GOCE satellite models obtained by the direct approach, which combines data from other gravity missions as GRACE and LAGEOS regarding their best characteristics. The results show that the geoid height diminished from a year to five months before the main seismic event in the region where maximum slip occurred after the Pisagua Mw = 8.2 great megathrust earthquake. This diminution is interpreted as accelerated inland-directed interseismic mass transfer before the earthquake, coinciding with the intermediate degree of seismic coupling reported in the region. We highlight the advantage of satellite data for modelling surficial deformation related to preseismic displacements. This deformation, combined to geodetical and seismological data, could be useful for delimiting and monitoring areas of higher seismic hazard potential.

TI  - Low complexity regression wavelet analysis variants for hyperspectral data lossless compression
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The evolution of the optical and of the sounding interferometer instruments along with the increase of the spaceborne storage capacity allows for the acquisition of large data volumes. However, the strongly limited downlink bandwidth unveils an insufficient on-board storage capacity, and the on-the-ground storage and dissemination are also contested. In these scenarios, data compression techniques are demanded. We discuss here the regression wavelet analysis (RWA) spectral transform, introducing novel variants that lead to an improved lossless coding performance. A comprehensive comparison with state-of-the-art remote-sensing data compression techniques shows the competitive behaviour of RWA in terms of lossless coding performance (yielding lower bit rates), computational complexity (requesting lower execution time), and other signal measurements (decreasing energy, mutual information, and entropy). Experimental results are performed on uncalibrated and calibrated data from Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer, from Hyperion instrument and from Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer.

TI  - Comparison of satellite remote sensing data in the retrieve of PM10 air pollutant over Quito, Ecuador
T2  - REMOTE SENSING TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS IN URBAN ENVIRONMENTS III
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing Technologies and Applications in Urban Environments III
CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - Most of the large cities have an air quality network to measure air pollution including PM10. However, air quality monitoring network has a high cost and it is spatially limited. Quito, capital of Ecuador, is a city with an automatic air quality network (REMMAQ) composed by 9 stations. The REMMAQ works since 2002, measuring PM10 only in 4 regular stations located at different points along the city. This scarce quantity of PM10 measures led us to propose a new strategy to obtain PM10 data in all the city. Several studies have already considered the retrieving of PM10 from remote sensing data in cities with an air quality network. In order to find an optimal model to retrieve PM10 in Quito, this study compare the use of 3 different satellite sensors (Landsat-7 ETM+, Landsat-8 OLI and TERRA/MODIS) between 2013 to 2017. Additional to remote sensing data, we also use field data considering the REMMAQ. In each sensor, we used different variables and environmental indexes to model the best fit equation to quantify PM10 in all the city, finding the significant variables for each type of data and year. The variables considered were the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Land Surface Temperature (LST), Soil-adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Normalized Stability Index (NSI), surface reflectance Blue Band (B1), surface reflectance Green Band (B2) and surface reflectance Red Band (B3). These variables were considered because most of them are used in different studies combined with meteorological data. All the procedures were implemented in R Studio. The empirical models using remote sensing data/derived products and air quality data can help in retrieving air pollutants in large cities. This work is a valuable contribution for the study of the spatialization of PM10 in order to find new alternatives in the use of remote sensing data to support government decisions.

TI  - Fusing Landsat and MODIS data to retrieve multispectral information from fire-affected areas over tropical savannah environments in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the combination of surface reflectance products from Terra-Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and Landsat-Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus sensors are explored through the Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusion (FSDAF) algorithm within the framework of forest fire studies over tropical savannah environments. Thus, 60 fusion-derived images were generated from four spectral bands [red, near-infrared, shortwave infrared (SWIR1 and SWIR2)] and six spectral indices [normalized difference vegetation index, normalized difference moisture index, global environment monitoring index, soil-adjusted vegetation index, normalized burn ratio (NBR), and differenced normalized burn ratio (dNBR)] over two selected study sites. For all fusion processes performed, the actual Landsat images for the corresponding dates are available, which supports validation of the blended images. Additionally, integration of blended spectral indices in the immediate post-fire evaluation and the generation of fire severity were analysed. The blended bands presented correlation and Structure Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) values that were consistently higher than 0.819 and root mean square error values of less than 0.027, which confirms good accuracy levels obtained from the model. Similar correlation and SSIM accuracy levels were observed in the blended indices assessment for both study sites, which enables its values to be well-integrated for an analysis of the immediately post-fire date. However, the fire severity mapping from fused images needs to be carefully implemented since the dNBR index is generally less accurate than other blended indices. FSDAF fusion proved to be a useful alternative to retrieving multi-spectral information from savannah environments affected by fires.

TI  - SPATIAL DYNAMICS OF SEMIDECIDUOUS SEASONAL FORESTS: CASE STUDY IN THE TURVO SUJO RIVER BASIN IN SOUTHEASTERN BRAZIL, BETWEEN THE YEARS OF 2003 AND 2016
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Agencia Nacional das (ANA) states that Brazil faces a water shortage problem since 2012, and it is linked with the conservation of the country's watersheds directly. It is possible to track the landscape changes and its conservation state through satellite images. This study aims to analyze the spatial dynamics of Semideciduous Seasonal Forest (FES) fragments in the basin of the river Turvo Sujo, in Minas Gerais, southeastern Brazil, between the years of 2013 and 2016, and how this dynamic relates to the terrain aspect. In order to accomplish that, we used images of the Landsat series with geometric, radiometric and atmospheric corrections. For processing those images, samples of five categories of land cover and use were collected from RGB compositions. Maximum Likelihood was used to classify the images, and the overall accuracy, the confusion matrix, and the User's and Producer's accuracies per category were later obtained during the validation process. In 2003 the SSE occupied an area of 6.956 hectares, with highly fragmented disposition. Between 2003 and 2016 the native forest increased 42% (about 3.053 hectares of regrowth within 13 years), resulting in a total of 10.009 hectares in 2016. The fragments of Semideciduous Seasonal Forest are more frequently present in the South, Southeast, Southwest and West aspects in both years, 2003 and 2016. However, the forest regrowth a long those years did not follow that evidence, with the regrowth occurring equally in all the exposition faces, except in the plain terrains, that represents only 0.03% of the studied watershed. That is an evidence relevant and positive, which must be monitored, once it is necessary to conserve all terrain aspects for water availability and quality maintenance within watersheds.

AB  - Sediment production is the amount of sediment in the unit area that is transported through the basin by water transfer over a specified period of time. The main aim of present study is to predict sediment yield of Wadi, Al-Naft watershed with 8820 Km(2)area, that is located in the North-East of Diyala Governorate in Iraq, using Soil-Water Assessment Tool, (SWAT) and to predict the impact of land management and the input data including the land use, soil type, and soil texture maps which are obtained from Landsat-8 satellite image. Digital Elevation Model,(DEM) with resolution (14x 14) meter is used to delineate the watershed with the aid of model. Three Land-sat images were used to cover the study area which were mosaic processed and the study area masked-up from the mosaic, image. The area of study has been registries by Arc-GIS 10.2 and digitized the soil hydrologic group through assistant of Soil Plant Assistant Water Model, (SPAW) which was progressed by USDA, Agricultural, Research Service, using the data of soil textural and organic matter from Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the available water content, saturated hydraulic conductivity, and bulk density. The results of average, sediment depth and the maximum upland sediment for simulation period (2010-2020) were predicted to be (1.7 mm), and (12.57 Mg/ha), respectively.

TI  - SWEDISH SIMILES DESCRIBING A PERSON'S MOVEMENT AS PART OF THE LINGUISTIC WORLDVIEW (IN COMPARISON WITH THE RUSSIAN LANGUAGE MATERIAL)
T2  - SKANDINAVSKAYA FILOLOGIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article deals with the analysis of Swedish similes which describe a person's movement as part of the linguistic worldview against the Russian language material. The aim of this article is to determine a place and role of Swedish similes characterizing a person's movement and displacement in the Swedish culture as compared to the Russian culture. The material for the research includes the data from Swedish dictionaries, illustrative contexts of usage of analyzed units in Swedish literature, journalism and the Internet (the Swedish National Corpus), results of a survey of Swedish speakers, as well as of the data from dictionaries of stable comparisons (similes) of the Russian language. The paper contains an ideographic classification of units of the category considered, an analysis of quantitative content of ideographic groups of Swedish similes as compared to the Russian language ones and a detailed linguoculturological analysis of the standards and basis for comparisons. As a result of the analysis, it becomes obvious that the ideographic category of similes occupies different places in the Russian and Swedish linguistic worldviews. Swedish similes mainly represent appearance, disappearance and fast movement of a person, that is, the Swedes focus primarily on the general displacement of a person caused by movement. In the Russian linguistic worldview displacement and movement are far more detailed, which indicates a greater attention to this fragment of reality in the Russian linguoculture and greater movement differentiation, expressed in similes, denoting slow, reluctant or lazy movements.

AB  - Drought is a slow developing phenomenon that accumulates over period and affecting various sectors. It is one of natural hazards that occurs each year, particularly in Indonesia over Australian Monsoon period. During drought event, vegetation's cover can be affected by water stress. Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) is a method for water resource assessment and known to be strongly related to the plant water content. NDWI is produced from MODIS bands Near-infrared (NIR) and Short Wave Infrared (SWIR). This research aims to monitor drought using NDWI in West Java during El Nino 2015 and its impact on rainfall variability. The result showed rainfall was decreased significantly starting from May-June, then increased in November. According to NDWI, it also showed that mostly West Java Region affected by drought during May-November. Very strong drought occurred on September-November. On December, areal extent of drought was decreasing significantly because rainfall had increased during November. Generally, areal extent of drought in West Java was dominated by strong and moderate drought. It implied that El Nino 2015, give great impact on increasing drought and decreasing rainfall in West Java. NDWI can be detected drought occurrence as it have good correlation with rainfall spatially.

TI  - A Multiple Classifier System to improve mapping complex land covers: a case study of wetland classification using SAR data in Newfoundland, Canada
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - There are currently various classification algorithms, each with its own advantages and limitations. It is expected that fusing different classifiers in a way that the advantages of each are selected can boost the accuracy in the classification of complex land covers, such as wetlands, compared to using a single classifier. Classification of wetlands using remote-sensing methods is a challenging task because of considerable similarities between wetland classes. This fact is more important when utilizing synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, which contain speckle noise. Consequently, discriminating wetland classes using only SAR data is generally not as accurate as using some other satellite data, such as optical imagery. In this study, a new Multiple Classifier System (MCS), which combines five different algorithms, was proposed to improve the classification accuracy of similar land covers. This system was then applied to classify wetlands in a study area in Newfoundland, Canada, using multi-source and multi-temporal SAR data. The results demonstrated that the proposed MCS was more accurate for the classification of wetlands in terms of both overall and class accuracies compared to applying one specific algorithm. Therefore, it is expected that the proposed system improves the classification accuracy of other complex landscapes.

TI  - Using smart ICT to provide weather and water information to smallholders in Africa: The case of the Gash River Basin, Sudan
T2  - CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Gash Delta of Eastern Sudan, spate irrigation (flood-recession farming) contributes substantially to rural livelihoods by providing better yields than rainfed dryland farming. However, spate irrigation farmers are challenged by the unpredictability of flooding. In recent decades, the number of farmers practicing spate irrigation has decreased, due to varying rainfall intensity and frequency, insufficient infrastructure and farmers' limited capacity to manage such variations. One solution that may help farmers face such challenges is for them to access real-time water-related information by using smart Information and Communication a Technology (ICT). This paper shows how integrating remote sensing, Geographical Information Systems (GIS), flood-forecasting models and communication platforms can, in near real time, alert smallholder farmers and relevant government departments about incoming floods, using the Gash basin of Sudan as an example. The Ministry of Water Resources of Sudan used the findings of this study to transform farmers' responses to flood arrival from being ` reactive', to planning for the flood event. Intensive on-site and institutional efforts to build the capacity of farmers, farmer organizations, development departments and officers of the Ministry helped to develop the initiative from simply sending ` emergency alerts' to enabling stakeholders to visually see the flood event unfolding in the region and to plan accordingly for storing water, operating spate-irrigation systems and undertaking cropping activities. The research, initially conducted on a 60x60 km site, was later extended to the entire Gash basin. The paper outlines how to develop tools that can monitor plot-specific information from satellite measurements, and supply detailed and specific information on crops, rather than providing very general statements on crop growth. Farmers are able to use such tools to optimize their farm profits by providing water to their crops in the right place, at the right time and in the right quantity. Finally, the work demonstrates the high potential of combining technology, namely remote sensing data and simple a agro-meteorological model with limited parameters, for large-scale monitoring of spate irrigation systems and information sharing to advise farmers as to how to apply this information to their managerial decisions.

AB  - Land utilization in Indonesia is regulated in an official spatial land use planning (OSLUP), stipulated by government regulations. However in fact, land utilizations are often develops inconsistent with regulations. OSLUP itself is also not usually compatible with sustainable land utilizations. This study aims to evaluate current land utilizations and OSLUP in Indramayu Regency, West Java. The methodology used is the integrated analysis using land use and land cover (LU/LC) data, land capability data and spatial pattern in OSLUP. Actual LU/LC are interpreted using SPOT-6 imagery of 2014. The spatial data of land capabilities are derived from land capability classification using field data and laboratory analysis. The confrontation between these spatial data is interpreted in terms of future direction for sustainable land use planning. The results shows that Indramayu regency consists of 8 types of LU/LC. Land capability in research area range from class II to VIII. Only a small portion of the land in Indramayu has been used in accordance with land capability, but most of the land is used exceeding its land capability.

TI  - Automatic feature selection for Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 image co-registration using SURF-FANN
T2  - 2018 IEEE SYMPOSIUM SERIES ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE (IEEE SSCI)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 8th IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (IEEE SSCI)
CL  - Bengaluru, INDIA
AB  - Remote sensing data acquired from Landsat series of satellites having multispectral bands with a moderate spatial resolution of 30 m are available from 1973 and Sentinel-2 data at 10 m spatial resolution are available from 2015 onwards with a regular temporal global coverage. The availability of Landsat-8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) and Sentinel-2 MSI (Multispectral Instrument) imagery have offered opportunities to build a wide range of spatio-temporal applications such as monitoring the Earth's surface frequently based on the combined data sets. However, the standard georeferenced Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI data products are misaligned, therefore the two data sets must be co-registered at a pixel level before being used together for any study. In this paper, we present a new approach called SURF-FANN (Speeded-Up Robust Features-Fast Approximate Nearest Neighbour) for feature selection and matching between Landsat and Sentinel data. These features (tie-points) are then used for automatic co-registration of Sentinel data with reference to Landsat data. Further, geocoding is performed using conformal, affine and projective transformations followed by resampling using bilinear interpolation, nearest neighbour and cubic convolution. The results were compared with SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform)-FANN which is a popular algorithm for automatic feature extraction and selection. It was found that SURF is computationally faster but has higher RMSE compared to SIFT. However, the feature selection and matching by combining SURF and SIFT with FANN, followed by projective transformation and bilinear interpolation rendered the lowest RMSE of 0.14 compared to using either SIFT or SURF as a stand-alone method.

TI  - Energyscapes and prey fields shape a North Atlantic seabird wintering hotspot under climate change
T2  - ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - There is an urgent need for a better understanding of animal migratory ecology under the influence of climate change. Most current analyses require long-term monitoring of populations on the move, and shorter-term approaches are needed. Here, we analysed the ecological drivers of seabird migration within the framework of the energyscape concept, which we defined as the variations in the energy requirements of an organism across geographical space as a function of environmental conditions. We compared the winter location of seabirds with their modelled energy requirements and prey fields throughout the North Atlantic. Across six winters, we tracked the migration of 94 little auks (Alle alle), a key sentinel Arctic species, between their East Greenland breeding site and wintering areas off Newfoundland. Winter energyscapes were modelled with Niche Mapper T, a mechanistic tool which takes into account local climate and bird ecophysiology. Subsequently, we used a resource selection function to explain seabird distributions through modelled energyscapes and winter surface distribution of one of their main prey, Calanus finmarchicus. Finally, future energyscapes were calculated according to IPCC climate change scenarios. We found that little auks targeted areas with high prey densities and moderately elevated energyscapes. Predicted energyscapes for 2050 and 2095 showed a decrease in winter energy requirements under the high emission scenario, which may be beneficial if prey availability is maintained. Overall, our study demonstrates the great potential of the energyscape concept for the study of animal spatial ecology, in particular in the context of global change.

AB  - Nanoparticle-based diagnostic and therapeutic agents have attracted considerable interest because of their potential for applications in clinical oncology and other biomedical research. Versatile nanostructures for in vivo applications, such as lipid and polymeric nanocapsules for drug delivery, iron oxide nanoparticles for magnetic resonance imaging, gold nanoparticles for X-ray computed tomography, and quantum dots (Qdots) for fluorescence imaging have been reported. However, the intrinsic toxicity of Qdots is of critical concern, which may impede their final clinical application. Therefore, the design of bright probes with biologically benign materials is highly desirable for many in vivo clinical purposes. Semiconducting polymer dot (Pdot) bioconjugates are a new class of ultrabright fluorescent probes because of their exceptional brightness and their nontoxic feature. Researchers have developed various methods to improve the versatility and functions of Pdots for biomedical studies, such as tuning the emission color, exploring new preparation methods, engineering the particle surface, doping functional sensing molecules, encapsulating magnetic materials, and mapping the sentinel lymph node as a first in vivo study. Researchers have developed a general method to form semiconducting Pdot bioconjugates, and have demonstrated their applications in specific cellular targeting and bioorthogonal labeling. In this entry, we summarize the preparation and applications of various semiconducting Pdot bioconjugates.

AB  - The sixty percent of Italian students ignore the link between what they study and the work opportunities. To fill this gap the Italians Educational ministry is promoting the "Alternanza scuolalavoro" (school-work interchange) program which aims to provide students with real work experience aligned with the principle of open school. The program starts in 2015 and involve students of the last three years of High schools. The idea is to anticipate the contact of students with working world providing them new skills and directions for future work choices within a sort of internship project with a private or public body. In this context Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV) offers a list of projects within geophysical application.In this work we show the two years (2017 and 2018) experience with the High school students who have been challenged with Remote Sensing from space project to test their response and potential receptivity. The project is titled "Earth Observation with satellite: the case of burn areas". The schoolwork path way experience has been hold at INGV in Rome and for a total of 40 hours each year (contact and not contact) during which the two group of students, of 5 students each year have been guided to thorough the process of defining a research question, learn and apply Remote Sensing tools to use data and deliver a presentation including obtained results.

AB  - Coastal line is very dynamics zone. The erosion and accretion process along the coastline takes place alternately. The dynamics of the coastal line also depends on their location. Teluk Lipat beach is located at the east coast of Malaysia peninsula that directly expose to the South China Sea. Due to the severe erosion, the reclamation work has been carried out in this area. So, instead of erosion and accretion, the land reclamation also contributes significant change to the coastal line. It is considered interesting to study the coastal change over spatial and time domain along this area. This study was conducted using Landsat dataset acquired over the study area for the period of 1988 to 2018. The period is then broken into 4-year time range. Water and land was distinguished by using Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI). The result shows the worst erosion event occur between 2004-2004 period. In this period 0.092 km(2) of land was eroded. Meanwhile highest accretion event occurs between 1988-1992. During this period, 0.299 km(2) of accretion take place especially at the north part of the study area. These two worst process occur before the reclamation work at 2011.

AB  - While the mapping of LAI green (LAI(G)) is well established, current operational products are not calibrated for LAI brown (LAI(B)), i.e. LAI estimation over senescent vegetation. With Sentinel-2 (S2) new opportunities are opened to estimate LAI brown. An explicit distinction between LAI(G) and LAI(B) can be achieved thanks to the S2 bands in the red edge (B5: 705 nm and B6: 740 nm) and in the shortwave infrared (B11: 1610 nm). By using LAI ground measurements data from multiple campaigns together with available S2 data, independent LAI(G) and LAI(B) models were optimized using Gaussian processes regression (LAI(G): R-2 = 0.89, NRMSE = 7.1%; LAI(B): R-2 = 0.75, NRMSE = 13.7%). These models can then be combined into LAI GB composite maps. The uncertainty estimates were used to map only those LAI estimated values that fall within a 50% uncertainty threshold. As only the vegetated areas fall within that threshold there is no need to apply additional masks. For multiple European core test sites, LAI(GB) composite maps were generated from S2 images, enabling to quantify when crops start senescing across the European regions.

TI  - Object-based classification of hyperspectral data using Random Forest algorithm
T2  - GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a new framework for object-based classification of high-resolution hyperspectral data. This multi-step framework is based on multi-resolution segmentation (MRS) and Random Forest classifier (RFC) algorithms. The first step is to determine of weights of the input features while using the object-based approach with MRS to processing such images. Given the high number of input features, an automatic method is needed for estimation of this parameter. Moreover, we used the Variable Importance (VI), one of the outputs of the RFC, to determine the importance of each image band. Then, based on this parameter and other required parameters, the image is segmented into some homogenous regions. Finally, the RFC is carried out based on the characteristics of segments for converting them into meaningful objects. The proposed method, as well as, the conventional pixel-based RFC and Support Vector Machine (SVM) method was applied to three different hyperspectral data-sets with various spectral and spatial characteristics. These data were acquired by the HyMap, the Airborne Prism Experiment (APEX), and the Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) hyperspectral sensors. The experimental results show that the proposed method is more consistent for land cover mapping in various areas. The overall classification accuracy (OA), obtained by the proposed method was 95.48, 86.57, and 84.29% for the HyMap, the APEX, and the CASI datasets, respectively. Moreover, this method showed better efficiency in comparison to the spectral-based classifications because the OAs of the proposed method was 5.67 and 3.75% higher than the conventional RFC and SVM classifiers, respectively.

TI  - Suzy's Gold Star A Holistic Education in Steinbeck's <i>Sweet</i> <i>Thursday</i>
T2  - STEINBECK REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, I analyze Suzy and Fauna's pedagogical relationship in Sweet Thursday as an example of holistic education. I argue that through this relationship, Steinbeck's holistic worldview is illuminated, a worldview consistent with the ideas of Jiddu Krishnamurti, an educator, thinker, and Steinbeck contemporary. Steinbeck and Krishnamurti's core beliefs about the importance of relationships and the development of the self are central themes of holistic education. Holistic education is informed by ecological thinking and takes into account the student as a whole person in relation to others. In this light I examine Fauna's teaching style and the content of her lessons, which relate to awareness. Once Suzy's awareness is ignited, she grows holistically, extending her potential and becoming more integrated into the community. As she evolves, Suzy personifies Krishnamurti's ideal of developing awareness in relation to the environment. To a lesser extent, but still through a Krishnamurti lens, I examine the character of Doc as another teacher-figure and learner, whose nagging problem of loneliness is resolved through community, reflection, and self-awareness.

AB  - In this paper, we present a novel method for mapping flooded areas exploiting Sentinel-1 ground range detected products. The work introduces two novelties. As first, the input products. In fact, as far we know, no applications using these products has been so far presented in literature. Secondly, a new unsupervised methodology, based on the usage of opportune layers combined in a fuzzy decision system, is presented. Experimental results, obtained both on the single SAR image and on a couple of acquisitions in a change detection framework showed that our method is able to outperform the most popular classification techniques in terms of standard assessment parameters.

T2  - 3L-LANGUAGE LINGUISTICS LITERATURE-THE SOUTHEAST ASIAN JOURNAL OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study investigates how Ian McEwan's Enduring Love (1997) re-defines human ethical qualities within a Darwinian framework. McEwan's Enduring Love from the very beginning to the end abounds in Darwinian images and passages, thereby, it forms a Darwinian lens through which the events of the novel are scanned and interpreted, from the helium balloon gone out of control to a shared happiness resulted from seeing a familiar face at the airport. Within the Darwinian worldview the novel sets, it tries to subvert the traditionally-considered human ethical actions, like heroism, cooperation, courage, and love and therefore redefine them. To prove its claim, this paper, first, explores the Darwinian framework Enduring Love develops, benefiting from the ideas of literary Darwinists and other biopoetical theorists; then, it tries to show how the novel applies the same Darwinian principles to those human ethical qualities mentioned above which results in their redefinition.

TI  - Early Soviet Policy towards Buddhism <i>From Ostentatious Tolerance to Undisguised Hostility</i>
T2  - INNER ASIA
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper explores the Buryat Bolsheviks' efforts to replace the religious identity of fellow Buryats with a Soviet identity in the wake of the Russian Revolution, and analyses the ways in which the Buddhist community attempted to adapt to totalitarian rule. In addition to fostering a general atmosphere of intolerance to religion, considered an antagonistic worldview, the Bolsheviks set out to promote the cultural assimilation of this non-Russian population within the Russian ethnic majority. This entailed a programme of education in the spirit of Soviet patriotism and loyalty, designed to ensure the ideological unity of the nation. Over a short historical period from the early 1920s to the early 1930s, the attitude of the Soviet authorities towards Buddhist religion, clergy and believers shifted radically, from tolerance towards the religion of the 'oppressed non-Russian masses' to uncompromising antagonism and the targeting of religion as a class enemy that must be annihilated in the name of creating 'a new man'.

AB  - MODIS chlorophyll-a concentration (chla), sea surface temperature (SST), and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) were used to perform a geographically weighted regression (GWR) analysis within a 150-km buffer of the Brazilian coast. The correlation was between chla as the regressed variable and SST or PAR as the predictors. Both a GWR and a Bayesian GWR (BGWR) were used for evaluating the variables. Colored matrices were plotted for displaying beta values, significance, residuals, and t-statistics. Coefficients of determination (R-2) were computed for all months Also, the ratio of the GWR beta estimates and the 95% confidence interval BGWR estimates was computed. Results showed overall better R-2 for SST than for PAR regression but also better beta estimates for PAR than for SST in relation to BGWR beta significance range. Northern regions of the Brazilian coast exhibited lower statistical significance. July had lowest GWR beta values and best significance, January highest beta values and worst significance, and April and October highly variable results.

AB  - An important prerequisite for improving the classification accuracy is to fully extract the characteristics that reflect physical properties of the objects. The objective of this study is to investigate the capability of quad polarized Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images for crop classification in Ontario, Canada. Multi-temporal RADARSAT-2 fine beam quad-polarized SAR data were acquired. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier was selected for the classification using combinations of the polarization characteristics and texture features. The polarimetric features, including odd scattering, double scattering and volume scattering, were extracted from classic Pauli decomposition. Eight texture features were extracted from grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method was applied to reduce the redundancy of texture features. The results indicated that multi-temporal SAR data achieved satisfactory classification accuracy. Texture features of SAR data were useful for improving classification accuracy. SAR data have considerable potential for agricultural monitoring.

TI  - On the Secrecy Performance of Land Mobile Satellite Communication System
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we investigate the secrecy performance against eavesdropping of a land mobile satellite (LMS) system, where the satellite employs the spot beam technique, and both the terrestrial user and eavesdropper are equipped with multiple antennas and utilize maximal ratio combining to receive the confidential message. Specifically, in terms of the availability of the eavesdropper's CSI at the satellite, we consider both passive (Scenario I) and active (Scenario II) eavesdropping. For Scenario I where the eavesdropper's channel state information (CSI) is unknown to the satellite, closed-form expressions for the probability of non-zero secrecy capacity and secrecy outage probability are derived. Furthermore, expressions for the asymptotic secrecy outage probability are also presented to reveal the secrecy diversity order and array gain of the considered system. For Scenario II where the eavesdropper's CSI is available at the satellite, novel expressions for the exact and asymptotic average secrecy capacity are obtained. Based on a simple asymptotic formula, we can characterize the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) slope and high SNR power offset of the LMS systems. Finally, simulations are provided to validate our theoretical analysis and show the effect of different parameters on the system performance.

AB  - This study investigated the effect of forest type changes in Daegu, the hottest city in Korea, on the land surface temperature (LST). The LST change by forest type was analyzed by 2scene of Landsat TM image from 1990 to 2007. The land cover types were classified into 4 types; forest areas, urban areas, cultivated areas and other areas, and water areas. The forest areas were further classified into the coniferous tree areas and the broadleaf tree areas. The result of the statistical analysis of the LST change according to the forest type showed that the LST increased when the forest was changed to the urban area. The LST increased by about 0.6 ℃ when a broadleaf tree area was changed to an urban area and about 0.2 ℃ when a coniferous tree area was changed to an urban area. This was the temperature change as the result of the simple type change for 17 years. The temperature change was larger when considering both cases of the forest type being retained and changed. The LST increased by 2.3℃ more when the broadleaf tree areas were changed to the urban areas than when broadleaf trees were maintained. The LST increased by 1.9℃ more when the coniferous tree areas were changed to the urban areas than when the coniferous tree areas were maintained. The LST increased by 0.4℃ more when the broadleaf tree areas were destroyed than when the coniferous tree areas were destroyed. The results confirmed that the protection of broadleaf trees in urban forests was more effective for mitigating climate change.

AB  - Monitored storage data derived from detection and estimation of oil tank can be gathered to report statistics of demand and supply trend and these are tremendously important for economics and commodity trading. Several previous studies focusing on the tanks have been reported with SAR imagery but application with L-band requires completely different discussion. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm estimating floating roof height by use of ALOS-2 imagery and the proposed technique is discussed not only in StripMap mode but also in ScanSAR mode. Since an evaluation by use of ground measurement data is difficult, qualitative results are shown and discussed in this report.

AB  - Authentication systems verify the genuineness of the user who is accessing certain services. The verification process by these systems is done when user logs into the system. These services remain available until user logs off from the session. In this article we discuss a different authentication system based on keystroke dynamics that monitors the user continuously during the session. This system ensures that, the user accessing the services during the entire session is same who has started the session.Previous continuous authentication systems required preregistration in order to create training template. In the proposed work we devise a method that does not require any preregistration. Here a 26-by-26 (aa, ab ... zy, zz) matrix is used to collect user's data during the session and the same is used to verify her. To measure the performance of the proposed system, we propose new metrics Strokes to False Reject (SFR) and Stroke to False Accept (SFA).

AB  - Many places around Java island are experiencing land subsidence with the rates vary from few centimeter to order of tens centimeter per year. Question arises on what would be the causes of the subsidence in the area. The tectonic is one of the suspected causes along with anthropogenic causes (e.g. ground water overexploitation). The question is very important for proper and effective mitigation or adaptation. As we can see the impact from subsidence like damaging on infrastructures, wider area expansion of flood, etc. indeed they are formed a quite serious disaster now. If the tectonic play significant role, in this case the adaptation is more effective than mitigation, etc. GNSS GPS technology is a passive, all-weather satellite-based navigation and positioning system, which is designed to provide precise three dimensional positions and velocity, as well as time information on a continuous worldwide basis. In the context of subsidence as we highlight above, GPS could provide very accurate level (millimeter level) to determine the subsidence signal if existed. This paper will highligt the investigation of tectonic subsidence over Java island by using data measurements from GNSS campaign and continue. Our preliminary result shows no tectonic subsidence over Java island.

AB  - This study presents the first results of the use of co-clustering to identify potential spatial and temporal concurrences of favourable conditions for the emergence and maintenance of West Nile Virus (WNV) in Greece. We applied the Bregman block average co-clustering algorithm with I-divergence to various time series (from 2003 to 2016) of indices derived from Land Surface Temperature (LST) reconstructed from MODIS products. The results show that the combination of two temporal and three spatial groups performs best in identifying times and areas with and without WNV human cases, yielding smaller standard deviations in co-clusters. Among the indices that appeared to perform better we found: number of summer days, annual average of mean and maximum LST, potential number of mosquito and virus cycles (EIP) and mean LST of the WNV transmission season. These variables are consistent with known effects of temperature over mosquito development and reproduction as well as virus amplification. Further research will be carried out to identify groups of variables that cluster both in space and time.

AB  - The long-time technological trend towards ever-finer ground resolution in space-borne multispectral data has opened the doors to finer levels of urban mapping and monitoring. Single buildings and their features can nowadays be detected and mapped starting from nadiral data; yet, despite a large body of research results, an exhaustive solution to space-based building mapping is still to be found. In this paper, we give our contribution by proposing a novel approach to the extraction of rooftop shapes of buildings from very-high-resolution (VHR) optical multi-spectral data. The approach is derived from existing work, namely an automatic rooftop extraction method intended for aerial imagery. Because of the very different nature of the data, it was necessary to rearrange the reference method, modifying and adding new constraints, applying both spectral and spatial conditions. This work was developed in the framework of the EU H2020 Satellite Swarm Sensor Network (S3NET) project.

T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To map vegetation and land cover changes on the West-African coastline using LANDSAT TM scenes taken at different dates, we applied a stacking of undirected classifications. The first step consists in interpreting the radiometric classes obtained via undirected classification so as to form the classes of the thematic nomenclature. The classification is subsequently improved by increasing radiometric contrasts within each of the classes. To do so, a Principal Component Analysis is applied to the LANDSAT channel. Then, a second classification within the classes enables to reallocate correctly those pixels that were wrongly classified previously. Cross-analysing the 2015 LANDSAT images and maps from earlier decades revealed that between the end of the years 1970 and the mid-2010s, wooded areas increased by 2% for the mangrove and 3.5% for dry land. This positive result is the outcome of significant regressions of woodlands compensated by even more significant progressions. It is in the mangrove that progression prevails over regression, especially in the last fifteen years. Finally, an opposition between particularly stable sectors and particularly changing sectors was observed, given that areas having gone through two changes or more are larger than those having gone through one change only in 36 years.

AB  - The Electronic Calibration (Ecal) tests are performed during various stages of instrument development to examine the linearity of the instrument electronics. During this process, charges with stepwise increments are injected in the analog electronics circuitry to generate a ramp signal that can be used to characterize any nonlinearities in the electronics. The prelaunch characterization of MODIS (on the Terra and Aqua platforms) and VIIRS (on SNPP, JPSS-1 and JPSS-2) involved a regular evaluation of the electronics linearity using the Ecal tests. On orbit, the Ecal tests have been regularly performed over the mission for both the MODIS instruments to derive the electronics gain and linearity. Unlike MODIS, the Ecal tests on the VIIRS instruments are performed on an as-needed basis. To date, no Ecal tests were performed for S-NPP VIIRS on orbit. The VIIRS instrument on JPSS-1 (now NOAA 20) was launched on November 18, 2017. An Ecal test was performed to support the instruments initial post-launch performance assessment. Shortly after the first on-orbit emissive band calibration, degradation in the instrument gain was observed for the LWIR bands (M15, M16 and I5). As a part of the investigation related to this anomaly, a second Ecal test was performed and results were compared with the prelaunch results. In this paper, we discuss the prelaunch Ecal tests and representative results from MODIS and VIIRS prelaunch characterization. Also, discussed are the on-orbit results from the two MODIS instruments as well as from the recently launched VIIRS instrument.

CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - The MODIS reflective solar bands (RSB) are calibrated on-orbit using a solar diffuser (SD) with its on-orbit degradation, or change in the bi-directional reflectance factor (BRF) monitored using a solar diffuser stability monitor (SDSM). By performing alternate observations of direct sunlight via an attenuation screen and of sunlight reflected diffusely off the SD, the SDSM monitors Rip on-orbit degradation of the SD. The MODIS SDSM has 9 detectors, covering wavelengths from 0.41 to 0.94 mu m. Both Terra and Aqua MODIS instruments have successfully operated for more than 16 years on-orbit, with the SD experiencing significant degradation at the shortest wavelength (about 50% for Terra MODIS and about 20% for Aqua MODIS at 0.41 mu m). The first VIIRS instrument on the Suomi NPP spacecraft was launched in October, 2011 and the follow-on instrument was launched in November, 2017 on the,IPSS-1 spacecraft (now NOAH 20). Both the VIIRS instruments carry a MODIS-like SD and SDSM system with an improved design based on the lessons learned from MOMS. Unlike MODIS, the VIIRS SDSM collects data using 8 detectors covering a similar wavelength range as MODIS. A similar wavelength dependent SD degradation pattern is also observed in both VIIRS instruments. This paper provides a comparison of the on-orbit performance of the four instruments in terms of the on-orbit changes in the SDSM detector responses and on-orbit degradations of their SDs. The NOAA-20 VIIRS instrument is still in its first year of operation and hence the early performance of the Terra and Aqua MODIS and SNPP VRRS is discussed to provide a perspective comparison.

AB  - MODIS is the key instrument for the NASA's EOS Terra and Aqua missions, launched in December, 1999 and May, 2002 respectively. The reflective solar bands (RSB) on Terra and Aqua MODIS are calibrated independently using an on-board solar diffuser and a solar diffuser stability monitor. Near-monthly lunar observations are also a major component of the on-orbit calibration strategy facilitating a response-versus-scan angle (RVS) characterization on-orbit. With a few exceptions, the regularly scheduled lunar observations have been performed with the same phase angles ranging from -55 degrees to -56 degrees for Aqua MODIS and 55 degrees to 56 degrees for Terra MODIS. Previous efforts have demonstrated that the observations of the Moon serve as an effective mechanism to perform an on-orbit cross-calibration of the two MODIS instruments. In addition to the regularly scheduled lunar observations that require a roll maneuver, both MODIS instruments also view the Moon via its space-view (SV) port for three to four months in a year that covers a wider range of phase angles. In this paper, we expand on the previous effort to provide an assessment of the RSB calibration difference between Terra and Aqua MODIS based on unscheduled lunar observations made over a range of phase angles. Also, discussed in this paper are strategies that could benefit other EOS sensors such as SNPP and NOAA 20 VIIRS.

TI  - Identity, development and otherness in the Andean Latin American post-drama
T2  - REVISTA INTERNACIONAL DE COMUNICACION Y DESARROLLO
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyzes the development of the identity of the theater in Andean Latin America against the otherness imposed by foreign cultures, and particularly Spain, which by using the same language could exercise an "undesirable" influence on the postdramatic worldview in America Latina, especially when the past of both looks of a theatrical nature comes from the same trunk. We will use this otherness as a methodology of analysis, the order of chaos and its categories, taking into account the variables of meaning and the patterns of emptiness, of the absurd. It is proposed that the origin of theater in Spanish language has a birth and trunk different from Greco-Roman and for this a brief study of The Auto of the Magi is made. To finish, one enters in the dissection of some notes and characteristics of the Andean theater in Latin American lands from several works from Ecuador, Bolivia and Peru.

TI  - An object-based approach for mapping forest structural types based on low-density LiDAR and multispectral imagery
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping forest structure variables provides important information for the estimation of forest biomass, carbon stocks, pasture suitability or for wildfire risk prevention and control. The optimization of the prediction models of these variables requires an adequate stratification of the forest landscape in order to create specific models for each structural type or strata. This paper aims to propose and validate the use of an object-oriented classification methodology based on low-density LiDAR data (0.5m(-2)) available at national level, WorldView-2 and Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery to categorize Mediterranean forests in generic structural types. After preprocessing the data sets, the area was segmented using a multiresolution algorithm, features describing 3D vertical structure were extracted from LiDAR data and spectral and texture features from satellite images. Objects were classified after feature selection in the following structural classes: grasslands, shrubs, forest (without shrubs), mixed forest (trees and shrubs) and dense young forest. Four classification algorithms (C4.5 decision trees, random forest, k-nearest neighbour and support vector machine) were evaluated using cross-validation techniques. The results show that the integration of low-density LiDAR and multispectral imagery provide a set of complementary features that improve the results (90.75% overall accuracy), and the object-oriented classification techniques are efficient for stratification of Mediterranean forest areas in structural- and fuel-related categories. Further work will be focused on the creation and validation of a different prediction model adapted to the various strata.

AB  - This paper presents the first results obtained by repeat-pass bistatic synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry using a fixed C-band ground-based receiver and the Sentinel-1A/B satellites as transmitters of opportunity. The methodology developed to obtain repeat-pass bistatic SAR interferograms uses as input a stack of range compressed bistatic acquisition data and mainly consists in the following stages: raw interferograms computation on a two-dimensional grid in ground geometry, atmospheric phase screen removal and topographic phase compensation. The displacements of a high-rise building were estimated using two stacks of bistatic SAR images acquired between April-June 2017 over an area of Bucharest city, Romania.

CL  - Bonn, GERMANY
AB  - An accurate geometrical alignment of remote sensing data is the basis for higher-level image processing techniques used to extract information. Fusing radar image data with other sensor data sources states a special case because the coordinate system is based on the measured range which causes ambiguous regions due to layover effects. An accurate 3D representation of the scene is essential to find a fitting geometrical transformation between the respective sensor image spaces. This paper applies a method that accurately maps detailed 3D information of the German island of Heligoland to the slant-range-based coordinate system of radar images imaged by DLR's airborne F-SAR sensor. The highly accurate 3D information along with optical imagery has been acquired by DLR's airborne optical sensor system MACS.

AB  - Complex interactions of ecological and climate indicators play a vital role in defining spatiotemporal patterns of vector-borne disease habitats and transmission. Vietnam is in the sub-tropical climate zone with high humidity and abundant precipitation, while unevenly distributed precipitation leads to frequently annual occurrence of drought and flooding. The increase in frequency and magnitude of severe weather extremes likely linked to climate change and anthropogenic processes highlights the demands of research in GeoHealth risk and adaptive capacity assessment. In this study, mapping vector-borne disease is made for revealing physical features of ecological indicators and its association with vector-borne diseases and adaptive capacity to illustrate how remotely sensed data products have been utilized in GeoHealth applications, surveillance, and vector-borne disease risk mapping in Vietnam. Additionally, it is to promise the possibilities of establishing disease early-warning systems with citizen participation and provide knowledge to support ecological and human health diseases research.

AB  - Monitoring vegetation drought is quite a challenging task although researchers are using satellite data to monitor it. Still more attention is required in monitoring vegetation drought using conventional drought indices because sometimes they provide either over estimation or under estimation of drought condition. Currently researchers are commonly using ground-based observations for drought monitoring which is quite cumbersome and time consuming. Some reported works are available based on satellite data where some vegetation indices like Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) and Thermal Condition Index (TCI) have been used. But these indices have to be critically analyzed for optimally using them for agriculture drought monitoring. For this purpose, various fusion techniques like principal component analysis (PCA), discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and expectation maximization (EM) algorithm have been used and critically analyzed. The performance of the obtained fused results was compared with the ground truth information. It is found that PCA and DWT are giving better performance compared to EM based fusion techniques.

AB  - Surabaya's geological condition that dominated by alluvium unconsolidated, as well as increasing growth of buildings-especially skyscrapers- are triggered the surface deformation on the area. This research aims to monitor and analyze the surface deformation, especially the subsidence that occurred in Surabaya urban area over the last two years. We use Remote Sensing Technology that has been widely developed, not only aims to observe and analyze objects on the earth, but also very useful to monitor land surface changes. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) is the first known technique to get surface deformation measurement effectively on large areas (thousands of km(2)) up to sub-centimeters. However, the technique also has limitations. In order to overcome the limitations of InSAR, multi-temporal InSAR techniques have been recently developed and one of them is Small Baseline Subset (SBAS). This time-series technique tries to overcome the temporal decorrelation due to atmosphere effect and measure transient movement on the Earth surface by using multi-look interferograms combination and small baseline temporal selection. Using SBAS technique we processed 24 Sentinel-1A images from Mei 2015 to Mei 2017 and 28 Sentinel-1A images from May 2015 to September 2017 to extract information of vertical displacement in Surabaya and compare both of them. The result shows that during the observation period, the rate of deformation in the form of Line of Sight Displacement (LOS) is varies from -60mm/year to +20mm/year. The majority of subsidence occured in coastal area (Northern and Eastern part) whereas the majority of uplift occured in the Surabaya downtown area (Southern and Western part).

AB  - Near real time processing and feature extraction from high-resolution satellite images aids in various applications of remote sensing including segmentation, classification and change detection. The latest generation of satellite sensors are able to capture the data at a very high spatial, spectral and temporal resolution. The processing time required for such a huge data is also large. Disaster monitoring applications such as forest fire monitoring, earthquakes require fast/real time processing of high resolution data to enable response activities. In general, due to the large size of satellite data, the computational time of feature calculation and training neural network is found to be very high. Therefore in order to achieve the aim of near real time processing of such huge data, we developed a parallel implementation. The implementation is performed on NVIDIA's Graphical Processing Unit. The performance improvement obtained is demonstrated by a GPU implementation on Resourcesat-1 data and compared with the traditional sequential implementation. The results show that the GPU implementation is found to achieve performance improvement in terms of execution time and speedup throughput as compared to the sequential implementation.

AB  - Here, we investigate multiple ways of assimilating synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data to L-band Microwave Emission of the Biosphere (L-MEB) model to enhance the model performance over forested areas in the boreal zone. Land C-band satellite SAR backscatter data, X-band interferometric SAR coherence, as well as auxiliary data layers from forest authorities are used as a proxy in calculating the forest transmissivity, instead of traditionally used leaf area index (LAI) parameter.Our earlier experiments have shown, that when particularly ALOS PALSAR (L-band) and multitemporal composite Sentinel-1 (C-band) data were applied, an improved agreement was achieved between the measured and simulated brightness temperatures (TBs) over forests. Here, we extend our analysis and examine data acquired by ALOS PALSAR, ESA Sentinel-1, and TanDEM-X mission of DLR, as well as several other auxiliary datasets on forest parameters. Our proposed model based approach indicates the potential of an SAR-based estimation of forest volume transmissivity and represents a viable way of active-passive microwave satellite data fusion and incorporating readily available reference data.

AB  - In this study, a set of bistatic interferometric SAR images acquired by the TanDEM-X mission are used along with fully polarimetric ALOS PALSAR data for the assessment of tropical forest properties in Nepal.Research to be presented at the conference concentrates on several scientific goals. First, location of interferometric scattering phase centre inside forest canopy is investigated using reference ALS measured canopy height model. Means for forest tree height extraction using both model based approaches (similar to Random Volume over Ground) and semi-empirical models are investigated and reported. It is shown, that forest tree height retrieval is possible with RMSE around 2.8 meters (R-2=0.68). Secondly, correlations between ALOS PALSAR and tropical forest data are analysed, and AGB estimation using fully polarimetric SAR features is performed. Several statistical and non-parametric methodologies were tested and compared. Thirdly, forest AGB estimation is done using both TanDEM-X based tree height and L-band PolSAR features using statistical inversion framework.

AB  - Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere play a very important role in maintaining the temperature of the earth. Plants absorb carbon in the atmosphere in the form of CO2 which is beneficial for photosynthesis which will produce O-2 into the atmosphere. By utilizing remote sensing technology and field data integration, this research aims to estimating aboveground carbon reserves in the research area. The results of this research indicate that the above ground carbon stock resulting from estimation calculations using remote sensing data and field calculations using brown allometric are 103,397 TonC / Ha with an error rate of 1,8354. This error level indicates the size of the error in the estimated value of each pixel.

M3  - Article
AB  - In modern Western theology, there is a widespread idea that the formula etsi Deus non daretur (" as if God did not exist") appears for the fi rst time in works of Hugo Grotius (1583-1645) and marks the advent of a new secular worldview, according to which the world and man are autonomous and independent from the transcendental God. Nevertheless, historical facts show that this formula was in use as early as the 14th century and repeatedly occurred in works of Catholic scholastics (such as Gabriel Biel, Domingo de Soto, Francisco Suarez, etc.). The author's opinion is that this formula is nothing more than a mental experiment which was employed in the dispute about the nature of the natural moral law between Christian objectivists and voluntarists. The objectivists who used this experiment defended the idea that the principles of morality (in the form of the natural law) are rooted in human nature itself so fi rmly that their existence and validity do not depend on the presence or absence of any divine commandments and prohibitions. It is in this sense that the aforementioned formula should be understood; even if per impossibile there was no God, the principles of morality would exist in man and would be expressed in the dictates of common sense (recta ratio). This, however, does not in any way imply a denial of the existence of God or even a doubt about it: the mental experiment remains just a mental experiment; as for the rest, the objectivists (including Grotius) emphasised that the nature of man together with the natural moral law embedded in it are what they are only because such was the will of God the Creator.

T2  - ASIAN JOURNAL OF WATER ENVIRONMENT AND POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid growth of urbanization has put heavy pressure on the land and its surrounding resources, reduction of vegetation cover, open spaces and serious social and environmental problems. Therefore, a basic step for managing and planning urban growth, as well as evaluating its cumulative effects, is to study and simulate the physical growth of the city. The purpose of this study is to understand the factors that influence the physical growth in Tehran on the basis of sustainable urban development in terms of environmental dimension and the preservation of environmental conditions in the next two decades. For this, using Landsat multi-temporal satellite imagery and object-based classification, land-use was assessed during the period from 1990 to 2015. In the next step, using the multi-criteria analysis model and the environment-based growth model, the impact of independent variables on urban growth, including 18 variables, was calculated from 1990 to 2015 and the map of urbanization potential was produced. Then the area of change for the expected year was predicted quantitatively using the Markov chain analysis. Finally, using Cellular Automata model, urban growth simulation for 2015 was performed with relative accuracy of 0.91 and Kappa coefficient of 0.87, and this model was used to estimate urban growth in 2025. The results show that urban growth will accelerate in 2025, as in the period 2003-2015, and often in the western and northeastern parts of the city. if the nature and extent of the impact of factors affecting urban growth will remain constant.

AB  - The annual incidence of nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is estimated to be 2 to 22.5 cases per 100,000 people depending on the region, and despite vast improvement over the years, mortality in SAH is still approximately 30 to 40%. Clinical presentation of aneurysmal SAH is typically characterized by the "worst headache of life," but a significant proportion of patients present with a mild headache due to a sentinel hemorrhage. The Fisher score and the Hunt and Hess score are frequently used to grade SAH: they reflect the severity of disease and aid in informing the prognosis. The most devastating primary cerebral complications are aneurysmal rerupture, acute hydrocephalus, intracranial hypertension, and delayed cerebral ischemia due to vasospasm, but patients are at risk for seizures, neurogenic pulmonary edema, stress cardiomyopathy, cerebral salt wasting, infections, typical complications associated with catastrophic illness, as well as decompensation of underlying chronic illness. The mainstays of therapy are prompt recognition and diagnosis; resuscitation; transfer to a center with experience in managing the disease; blood pressure control; reversal of anticoagulation or correction of thrombocytopenia; management of acute hydrocephalus; rapid treatment (coiling or clipping) of the aneurysm; monitoring, prophylaxis, and treatment of vasospasm; prevention and treatment of complications; management of preexisting chronic illnesses; and rehabilitation.

AB  - United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) weather satellites adopt Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensors to acquire remote sensing data and broadcast Automatic Picture Transmission (APT) images. The orientation of the scan lines is perpendicular to the orbit of the satellite. In this paper we propose a new low cost solution for NOAA remote sensing. More in detail, our method focuses on the possibility of directly sampling the modulated signal and processing it entirely in software enabled by recent breakthroughs on Software Defined Radios (SDR) and CPU computational speed, while keeping the costs extremely low. We aim to achieve good results with inexpensive SDR hardware, like the RTL-SDR (a repurposed DVB-T USB dongle). Nevertheless, we faced some problems caused by hardware limits such as high receiver noise figure and low ADC resolution. Furthermore, we detected several inherent drawbacks of frequent tuner saturations. For this purpose we developed a software-hardware integrated system able to perform the following steps: satellite pass prediction, time scheduling, signal demodulation, image cropping and filtering. Although we employed low cost components, we obtained good results in terms of signal demodulation, synchronization and image reconstruction.

TI  - Land-use land-cover classification analysis of Giba catchment using hyper temporal MODIS NDVI satellite images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat-based land-use land-cover (LULC) mapping studies were previously conducted in Giba catchment, comprising an area of 4019 km(2). No attempt has been done to map LULC of this catchment through the analysis of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time-series data. This article is aimed to see whether time-series MODIS NDVI data set is applicable for LULC mapping of Giba catchment or not. MODIS NDVI data sets of the year 2010 were used for classification analysis. The original data were subjected to MODIS Reproduction Tool and stacking. The re-projected and stacked images were filtered using Harmonic Analysis of Time-Series filtering algorism to remove the effects of cloud and other noises. The MODIS NDVI data sets (16-day maximum value composite) were classified using the ISODATA clustering algorithm available under ERDAS IMAGINE software. A series of unsupervised classification runs were carried out with a pre-defined number of classes (5-24). From this classification, the optimal numbers of classes were determined to be eight after checking for average divergence analysis. The classification result became eight LULC classes namely: bare land, grass land, irrigated land, cultivated land, area closure, shrub land, bush land, and forest land with an overall accuracy of 87.7%. It was therefore concluded that MODIS NDVI time-series image is applicable for mapping large watersheds.

AB  - Remote sensing techniques collect relevant information from Earth surface. This information is useful for deforestation analysis, natural disasters monitoring, urban expansion analysis, and study of climate changes. Multispectral and hyperspectral systems had powered this applications allowing temporal analysis using classical pixel-based techniques and most promising techniques like object-based classifiers. Aiming to study land cover changes in Colombian territory, a remote sensing change detection study is presented in this work. A comparison between pixel-based and object-based techniques was performed over multispectral imaging from Landsat-8 collected over Barrancabermeja city. Obtained results show that objectbased classification technique outperform the pixel based one, besides it shows that Barrancabermeja region is constantly changing, specially by the crops in the rural area but slightly affected by deforestation.

TI  - Mapping fire severity levels of burned areas in Galicia (NW Spain) by Landsat images and the dNBR index: Preliminary results about the influence of topographical, meteorological and fuel factors on the highest severity level

AB  - Fire severity assessment and mapping are essential for prioritizing post-fire emergency rehabilitation actions. The present study, carried out in Galicia (one of the regions most severely impacted by wildfire in the Iberian Peninsula), focused on 36 wildfires affecting areas of more than 200 ha during the period 2006-2016. The aims of the study were i) to map the severity in these wildfires by using the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) index, and ii) to explore how the highest levels of fire severity and canopy damage are related to topographical, meteorological and forest fuel variables. Pre and post-fire Landsat images (Path 204 and Row 31), provided by the European Space Agency (ESA), were radiometrically and topographically corrected. The dNBR index was calculated for each wildfire, and the values obtained were used to establish four classes of fire severity and four levels of canopy damage. A total of 23 topographical, meteorological and fuel variables were also determined in order to characterize each wildfire. The non-parametric Random Forests method was used to relate the burned area (%) corresponding to the highest levels of fire severity and crown fire damage to the various environmental variables. The variables that best differentiated the most severely burned areas were in both cases wind speed and percentage of burned area with slope ranging from 30 to 45%.

TI  - A new method of simulating volcanic eruption column formation and dispersion of ejected ash clouds
T2  - METEOROLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - A new Eulerian-Lagrangian model is developed to predict the formation of eruption columns, and the long range transport and dispersion of volcanic ash clouds in the atmosphere. The model capability is tested by presenting the atmospheric dispersion of ash clouds released during two eruptions of the Popocatepetl volcano in Mexico. The atmospheric wind predictions were made by using the Eulerian regional atmospheric modelling system (RAMS), which is well tested over the Mexico region. Two Lagrangian models were also employed: (1) an eruption column formation model and (2) a Lagrangian stochastic deterministic (LSD) particle dispersion model. In a LSD model, the continuous plume is simulated by several puffs (clouds) successively released in the atmosphere. (1) The influence of the wind on the eruption column, (2) the transport and dispersion of the ash cloud and (3) the concentration of volcanic ash using a smoothed particle hydrodynamics technique are reported. This is thought to be a unique combination of mathematical prediction models and would be of interest to the broader scientific community. The formation of the eruption column is compared with ground observations, while the long range trajectory of the ash clouds is compared with images based on satellite data, qualitatively. In both cases the agreement within the observed and simulated plume shape was found to be satisfactory which indicated the suitability of the Eulerian wind prediction model (RAMS) in the region as well as that of Lagrangian models employed in the study.

TI  - Determining fuel moisture thresholds to assess wildfire hazard: A contribution to an operational early warning system
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data study
AB  - Fuel moisture content (FMC) is an important fuel property for assessing wildfire hazard, since it influences fuel flammability and fire behavior. The relationship between FMC and fire activity differs among land covers and seems to be a property of each ecosystem. Our objectives were to analyze pre-fire FMC among different land covers and to propose a wildfire hazard classification for the Sierras Chicas in the Chaco Serrano subregion (Argentina), by analyzing pre-fire FMC distributions observed for grasslands, shrublands and forests and using percentiles to establish thresholds. For this purpose, we used a fire database derived from Landsat imagery (30 m) and derived FMC maps every 8 days from 2002 to 2016 using MODIS reflectance products and empirical equations of FMC. Our results indicated that higher FMC constrains the extent of wildfires, whereas at lower FMC there are other factors affecting their size. Extreme and high fire hazard thresholds for grasslands were established at FMC of 55% and 67% respectively, at 72% and 105% for forests and at 106% and 121% for shrublands. Our FMC thresholds were sensitive to detect extreme fire hazard conditions during years with high fire activity in comparison to average conditions. The differences in the distributions of pre-fire FMC among land covers and between ecosystems highlighted the need to locally determine land cover-specific FMC thresholds to assess wildfire hazard. Our wildfire hazard classification applied to FMC maps in an operational framework will contribute to improving early warning systems in the Sierras Chicas. However, moisture alone is not sufficient to represent true fire hazard in Chaco forests and the combination with other variables would provide better hazard assessments. These operational wildfire hazard maps will help to better allocation of fire protective resources to minimize negative impact on people, property and ecosystems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study analyzing pre-fire FMC over several fire seasons in a non-Mediterranean ecosystem, aiming at assessing wildfire hazard. Copyright: CC BY 4.0

AB  - The high revisit time of Sentinel-1 (S1) observations enables the design of crop type mapping approaches exploiting the backscatter time series observed for the different crops. The objective of this study is to propose a supervised crop classification methodology based on the temporal signature of crops. With this aim 29 dual-pol S1 observations acquired over an agricultural area of Spain, where ground truth was available, were processed. The classification approach was based on the temporal signatures obtained for each polarization channel (VH, VV and the cross-pol ratio) for the different crops. Highest accuracies were obtained when fields were assigned to the class that minimized the RMSE, with an overall accuracy of 79% and best results for rapeseed, sunflower, alfalfa and barley.

TI  - "I am a New Person, and My New Life Needs New People..." : a Story of Liza D'yakonova Told by Herself and by the Writer Pavel Basinskiy
T2  - PHILOLOGICAL CLASS
M3  - Article
AB  - The book by Elizaveta Dyakonova (1874-1902) "The Diary of a Russian Woman" (Moscow: Zakharov, 2004), published posthumously in 1905, served as the material for Pavel Basinsky's literary biography. Her diary reflects the stages of its formation as a person in the struggle to get a full-fledged education and the opportunity to find its place in life. He is the most valuable ego document: Dyakonova leads him to the gymnasium, then at the Bestuzhev courses, then in Paris, becoming a student at the Sorbonne. Basinsky traces the events of Dyakonova's life, captured by a talented girl, reflecting on them and giving her comment. The image of an "ordinary Russian girl", although somewhat exalted and unpredictable, created by her biographer Basinsky, does not quite correspond to the seriousness and ambitiousness of her intentions and life plans. Dyakonova's worldview, formed under the influence of the cult of the heroic personality and the teachings of Leo Tolstoy, is distinguished by its integrity and makes it look for ways to solve the "women's issue">> in Russia. A penchant for posing philosophical problems makes her diary an important evidence of understanding religious issues, problems of individual existence, as well as problems of women's emancipation. The heroine of Basinsky is a strongwilled and strong woman who can go all the way in the search for truth. Having revalued the usual forms of social life, she affirms the right of women to higher education and the freedom to choose their own life path.

TI  - Empirical line model for the atmospheric correction of sentinel-2A MSI images in the Caribbean Islands
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An Empirical Line Model (ELM) was tested to correct Sentinel-2A (MSI) images acquired in the tropical archipelago of San Andres, Colombia. This approach uses a linear regression to model the relationship between the average ground reflectance and radiance on bands 2, 3, 4, and 8, for 32 spectrally homogeneous targets. The model was validated from eight targets measured on different land-covers trough the estimated coefficient of determination R-2 . The result of the prediction equations observed was high, with a value of R-2:0.91 performed at the 0.01 level of significance for the four wavebands, against the R-2:0.77 of SEN2COR and R-2:0.81 of ATCOR Correction Models. Complementary, a quantitative approach was proposed to determine the suitability of the ELM, based on the spectral response on six land-covers types for every band after correction. A separability index (M) was used from a set of independent targets to estimate the effectiveness of spectral classification of land-covers. The more evident results of the correction are on the vegetation cover in the NIR band (785-900 nm), where the ELM has 55% and 58% more separability than the SEN2COR and ATCOR models, respectively. Additionally, the absolute difference between the Top-of-Atmosphere (TOA) and Bottom-ofAtmosphere (BOA) images was calculated, finding the highest differences in the NIR band with 0.094 in the L1C-TOA reflectance image, and 0.013 in the ELM-BOA image. Finally, a sensitivity analysis on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to estimate the performance of the spectral response of ELM on vegetation cover was employed.

AB  - Geomorphological characterization is a descriptive element of the landscape that allows us through the identification of units and specific geophysical features resulting in time. This work presents an alternative to the identification of such units in the landscape complex of the archipelago of San Andres and Providencia, by using spectral indices from WorldView 2 and 3 satellite images, this can improve the pictorial-morphological identification of images typically used. The results, in contrast with those published by authors; let you identify, detail, estimate and evaluate one greater number (more than ten) of geomorphological units to scale 1:2 000, which were verified through statistical validation integrated with field data. In the case of results obtained through traditional methods as I ecosondeo multiband and direct observation sin the field, sometimes they tend to throw information of higher resolution and detail of the seabed, accompanied by an ecological description of the area most successful; However variables such as effective area of capture, accuracy, spatial coverage and geomorphological units discrimination of these methods are punctual type, which means that these are not as effective at the time of their choice due to the complexity that they require and their execution times.

AB  - The error matrix has been adopted as a standard way to report on the thematic accuracy of any remotely sensed data product. A very usual way to perform the thematic accuracy analysis of an error matrix is by means of global indexes (e.g. overall accuracy, Kappa coefficient). But global indices do not allow for a category-wise control. This work proposes a new method for accuracy control of thematic classification based on an application of the chi-square goodness of fit test. By this way we can stablish our preferences of accuracy for each category but also we can consider some degree of misclassification between some categories. A practical example is provided for a 4x4 matrix (16 class combinations). In this example, a total of 13 quality levels (specifications) are imposed for certain class combinations. In this way, much more is controlled than by means of global indexes. In addition, the method allows to be more demanding or flexible in the quality levels of certain classes, according to convenience.

TI  - Assessment of values and trends in coarse spatial resolution NDVI datasets in Southeast Asia landscapes
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) has been widely applied for monitoring vegetation dynamics. However, NDVI values are known to be profoundly affected by various external factors. In this study, the variation of NDVI values and trends among the several long-term NDVI datasets with resolution of 1, 4 and 8 km were assessed to understand the differences between the available datasets. The assessment items were 1) Pearson's correlation coefficient, 2) trend map and breakpoint spatial similarities and 3) comparison of NDVI from Landsat and Flux tower in 2007-2015. The comparison revealed a maximum correlation coefficient of 0.67 among NDVI datasets and average spatial similarity of 37.2% among the trend maps estimated from NDVI datasets. Furthermore, there was a possibility of having significantly opposite trends between two trend maps from different NDVI products. Comparisons with NDVI from vegetation pixel in Landsat 5 TM and 8 OLI resulted in the R-2 between 0.06 and 0.68 and RMSE of 0.07-0.2, while comparison with NDVI from flux tower data yielded the RMSE of 0.040.41, although the R-2 was relatively weak at 0-0.18. Our study highlights the possibility of differences among NDVI datasets, and suggests that these differences should be reconciled especially in time-series analysis.

TI  - Long-term variations of aerosol optical depth and aerosol radiative forcing over Iran based on satellite and AERONET data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, three different sensors of satellites including the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR), and Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) were used to study spatial and temporal variations of aerosols over ten populated cities in Iran. Also, the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model was used for analyzing the origins of air masses and their trajectory in the area. An increasing trend in aerosol concentration was observed in the most studied cities in Iran during 1979-2016. The cities in the western part of Iran had the highest annual mean of aerosol concentration. The highest aerosol optical depth (AOD) value (0.76 +/- 0.51) was recorded in May 2012 over Ahvaz, and the lowest value (0.035 +/- 0.27) was recorded in December 2013 over Tabriz. After Ahvaz, the highest AOD value was found over Tehran (annual mean 0.11 +/- 0.20). The results show that AOD increases with increasing industrial activities, but the increased frequency of aerosols due to land degradation and desert-ification is more powerful in Iran. The trajectory analysis by the HYSPLIT model showed that the air masses come from Egypt, Syria, and Lebanon and passed over the Iraq and then reached to Iran during summer. Aerosol radiative forcing (ARF) has been analyzed for Zanjan (Aerosol Robotic Network site) during 2010-2013. The ARF at surface and top of the atmosphere was found to be ranging from -79 to -10W m(-2) (average -33.45 W m(-2)) and from -25 to 6 W m(-2) (average 12.80 W m(-2)), respectively.

TI  - Meteorological factors affecting the sudden decline in Lake Urmia's water level
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake Urmia, in northwest Iran, is the second most saline lake in the world. During the past two decades, the level of water has markedly decreased. In this paper, climate of the lake region is investigated by using data from four meteorological stations near the lake. The data include climatic parameters such as temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind speed, sunshine hours, number of rain days, and evaporation. Climate around the lake is examined by way of climate classification in the periods before and after the reduction in water level. Rainfall in the lake catchment is also evaluated using both gauge and satellite data. The results show a significant decreasing trend in mean annual precipitation and wind speed and an increasing trend in annual average temperature and sunshine hours at the four stations. Precipitation and wind speed have decreased by 37 mm and 2.7 m/s, respectively, and the mean annual temperature and sunshine hours have increased by 1.4 degrees C and 41.6 days, respectively, over these six decades. Only the climate of the Tabriz region is seen to have significantly changed, going from semiarid to arid. Gauge records and satellite data show a large-scale decreasing trend in rainfall since 1995. The correlation between rainfall and year-to-year changes in lake level is 0.69 over the period 1965 to 2010. The relationship is particularly strong from the early 1990s to 2005. This suggests that precipitation has played an important role in the documented decline of the lake.

AB  - Floating cages is one of the methods of fish farming (aqua culture) that can be developed at rivers, lakes or seas. To determine a proper location for floating cages, there are some requirements that need to be fulfilled to maintain sustainibility of floating cages. Those requirements are the quality of the environment. This paper will discuss the selection of best location for aquaculture activities using Weighted Overlay method in the Geographical Information System, based on the the concentration of chlorophyll-a, sea surface temperature presented by Aqua MODIS Level 1b satellite images. The satellite data will be associated with the measured field data on March and October 2016. The study take place on Prigi Bay, at Trenggalek Regency, East Java. Based on spatial analysis in the Geographical Information System, the Prigi bay generally suitable for aquaculture activities using floating net cages. The result of Weighted Overlay combinations in both periods showed a mean score of 2.18 of 3 where 8.33 km(2) (23.13% of the water area) considered as "very suitable" and 27.67 km(2) (76.87% of water area) considered "suitable".

AB  - This work presents the preliminary parametric analysis on the along-track dynamic of the tandem flight founation between Sentinel-3 and FLEX. It includes the study of maneuvering strategy for a master-slave scenario concept, where Sentinel-3 acts as the master of the founation while FLEX is the slave. This control strategy is assessed in teiins of safety for both satellites but also science impact trying to reach an along-track distance as bounded as possible. Numerical and analytical results of this study are provided.

TI  - Tracking land cover change along the western edge of the U.S. Corn Belt from 1984 through 2016 using satellite sensor data: observed trends and contributing factors
T2  - JOURNAL OF LAND USE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Cropland Data Layers (CDL) are high-resolution geo-referenced data products made available by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. However, the CDL lacks in its ability to be employed as a tool to identify the impact of the gradually evolving drivers of land use change, e.g., climate change, due to its limited historical depth. We implement a robust, phenology-based satellite image classification algorithm to identify historical cropland allocation in eastern South Dakota and North Dakota predating the initial CDL by 13 and 22 years, respectively. Five major land covers, i.e., corn, soybeans, wheat, alfalfa and grass (including native grass, hay and pasture) are identified using archived Landsat-5 surface reflectance data, while achieving CDL-like accuracy. The long-term rate of grassland loss during 1985-2011 is found to be significantly lower (26,781 hectares or 1.5% annually) relative to the near-term rate of grassland loss during 2006211 (84,545 hectares or 5.2% annually). We find similar discrepancy in regional corn expansion rates. Our value-added raster data provide opportunities for improved identification of land use drivers, whereas relying solely on the CDL's restricted historical extent may lead to biased land use change estimates and misguide policy.

TI  - Intrinsic religiosity protects believers from the existential fear of a human Jesus
T2  - MENTAL HEALTH RELIGION & CULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study examined the role of internalised religious beliefs in defending against existential concerns aroused from a creaturely Jesus. Prior work has found that biologically human traits (e.g., vomiting, sweating, etc.) can increase death concerns when applied to both humans and a god. Intrinsic beliefs, however, have been shown to reduce mortality awareness. In the current study, religious participants were primed with thoughts of either a human or neutral Jesus followed by a single item measure about fear of death. A moderated regression analysis found that whereas high intrinsic individuals were buffered from existential concerns, low intrinsic individuals experienced a greater fear of death when primed with a human Jesus. These results replicate prior work within terror management theory and the psychology of religion suggesting that internalised beliefs serve a protective function against existential anxieties.

TI  - Development of a cellular automata model using open source technologies for monitoring urbanisation in the global south: The case of Maputo, Mozambique
T2  - HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Cities throughout the world are expanding, and globally we are witnessing a significant amount of urbanisation. Currently, 54% of the world's population lives in cities, and an increase of 66% is expected by 2050. Based on the World Urbanisation Prospects' report, most of this growth is projected to concentrate in Asia and Africa. The resulting uncontrolled urbanisation can lead to many issues with profound impacts on health, poverty, and social inequality. Monitoring our global landscapes in the most rapidly growing regions particularly in the global south becomes thus an important endeavour. The estimation of future urban patterns become thus part of important topics that foresight the necessary support systems that efficiently cope with the carrying capacity of these urban regions. In this sense, this paper aims to i) monitor historical land cover changes in one of such major cities Maputo, Mozambique, and, ii) project future patterns of urban fabric in its metropolitan region. To achieve this, satellite imagery from Landsat between 2000 and 2015 was collected and classified using a maximum likelihood algorithm. Spatiotemporal monitoring of urban settlements showed that within the proposed temporal scope, massive urban development took place while depleting a substantial amount of other land use types. Based on this spatiotemporal cognisance, a customized cellular automaton (CA) model was built that embeds the trends of changes while predicting future patterns. Our predictions exposed a significant amount of urbanisation will evolve over the next years if no significant controlling mechanism to cope with rapid urbanisation is integrated. Our findings, as well as conclusions, aim to aid local urban planners and policy makers in the course of urban planning in the region while taking advantage of novel open source methodologies that offer cost reduction and enable efficient monitoring for large urban extents.

TI  - DETERMINATION OF SOIL LOSSES USING RUSLE MODEL AND GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS (GIS) IN A SELECTED AREA IN MEDITERRANEAN REGION OF TURKEY
T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the soil erosion in a selected area, that contained different physiographic units located on various slopes and have different soil series, using the RUSLE model in the Mediterranean Region of Turkey. Meteorological, soil data, topographic information and data obtained from land observations were used to produce past and present erosion risk maps and potential soil losses. Landsat satellite images that belong to the same months of different years (1990. 2016), were also used to asses the changes in the study area. The P factor of RUSLE model was generated by two different scenarios. For this reason, two different risk maps of the same year were produced. Results had shown that RUSLE, P=1 scenario produced more reliable/realistic results than P factor obtained by Wener method. According to P=1 scenario, the maximum annual soil loss in the study area was 3.219 t ha(-1) per year in 1990 and 3.514 t ha(-1) per year in 2016. The average soil losses in the study area were 0.16 and 0.21 t ha per year for 1990 and 2016, respectively. In the study area, soil erosion had slightly increased in the last 26 years, according to all scenarios.

TI  - Fog/low clouds detection over the Delhi Earth Station using the Ceilometer and the INSAT-3D/3DR satellite data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fog is a meteorological phenomenon in which cloud has its base near to the surface which disrupts public health and transportation due to decrease in visibility. In the present study, a collective method has been implemented for detection of fog/low clouds over the Delhi Earth Station during fog season for the years 2016 and 2017. A detailed comparison has been performed with the use of ground-based cloud-base height measurements from the Ceilometer and the Indian National Satellites (INSAT-3D/3DR)-retrieved fog product. Fog/low clouds have been effectively detected by both the Ceilometer and the INSAT-3D/3DR during single-layer cloud in the range of 0-200m in most of the cases. Since the INSAT-3D/3DR fog product is derived under clear sky condition, fog detection during multilayer clouds is a challenging task. Results indicate that the Ceilometer can capture fog/low clouds effectively even in presence of single- and multilayer clouds. Remote-sensing technology can provide better opportunity by providing complete temporal and spatial coverage of fog. The present technique which incorporates both ground-based Ceilometer and space-based INSAT-3D/3DR measurements is observed to be more promising than other conventional methods for an improved detection and monitoring of fog/low clouds.

TI  - Fog Stability Index: A novel technique for fog/low clouds detection using multi-satellites data over the Indo-Gangetic plains during winter season
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel fog/low clouds detection technique has been implemented using data from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) and the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) along with the Global Forecasting System (GFS) and the European Centre for Medium Weather Forecast (ECMWF) model wind data. The study has been carried out during fog seasons of the years 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 over six locations over the Indo-Gangetic (IG) plains. Fog is indicated if the estimated Fog Stability Index (FSI) is found to be less than the corresponding dynamically derived threshold value. The same algorithm is effective for both day and night-time analysis and has the potential to detect fog even in the presence of higher clouds. Results are validated with visibility data obtained from various meteorological stations of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) located in the IG plains and found to be in agreement in 84.63% of cases. For qualitative comparison with FSI, the Indian National Satellites (INSAT-3D) fog products have also been used. FSI could be the most effective technique for those satellites which could have a sounder sensor along with an infrared and microwave channels like the AIRS and the IASI for an improved and continuous monitoring of fog.

TI  - Linguopoetics of time in the works of Peter Zakharov: structural and semantic representations
T2  - VESTNIK UGROVEDENIYA-BULLETIN OF UGRIC STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: this article analyses linguopoetical phenomenon of time in the poetic discourse of Peter Zakharov, who is one of brightest representatives of the ethno-futuristic trend of modem Udmurt poetry of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries.Objective: to analyze the different levels of connection of the text grammar and its artistic semantics; to show the reciprocity of form and content, language elements and individual author's worldview.Research materials: Peter Zakharov's poems, included in his debut book "Vozh vyzh" ("Green Bridge").Results and novelty of the research: the scientific novelty of the research is dictated by the lack of knowledge of the problems of temporality in Udmurt idiostyles, the lack of lingua-poetical practices within the framework of Udmurt philology, and insufficient attention to the prosody aspects of literary criticism. It is established that time is the basis of P. Zakharov's artistic picture of the world: the lyrical subject recognizes himself, others, the surrounding reality through the prism of time, which overgrows a large number of features, characteristics, definitions in the percipient consciousness. The category of time is interpreted analytically in the context of heterogeneous grammatical structures, lexical representations, and in the complexly organized system of the artistic content of a concrete poetic text. During the interpretation of the poems, the dominant temporal scenarios were identified and the semantic plans associated with them were described. The increased attention of the author's "I" to the language as the main instrument of writing was ascertained. A study of Zakharov's poems has shown that there are two representative groups: the first includes texts with explicated language searches, in the second - texts without the linguistic participation of the author.

AB  - This study investigates the variability of convective and stratiform rainfall over Indonesia from 5 years (2004-2008) data of Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Precipitation Radar (PR). The remote sensing data was employed to analyze the seasonal means and seasonal differences between convective and stratiform rainfall values. In addition, the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) analysis impact on two rainfall types was also done with exemplification in 2006 and 2007 event. Two datasets were used namely the probability and the rainfall accumulation from both rainfall types. The results showed that the probability of Indonesian stratiform rainfall type was higher than convective rainfall type. In contrast, convective rainfall type more contributed to rainfall values. Spatial patterns of convective-stratiform rainfall types have different spreads. Generally, convective rainfall supplied more rainfall over the land, whereas stratiform rainfall supplied more rainfall over the sea, except in December-January-February (DJF) season. The ENSO impact was clearly seen during September-October-November (SON) season from both rainfall types over the south. Moreover, the stratiform rainfall type was more affected by ENSO during June-July-August (JJA) season.

TI  - SOIL EROSION RISK MAPPING USING USLE/GIS METHODOLOGY IN ROZE-CHAY CATCHMENT, NORTHWEST IRAN
T2  - SCIENTIFIC PAPERS-SERIES A-AGRONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion by water is a serious environmental problem all over the world, particularly in semi-arid regions like Iran, where agricultural water quality and productivity potential of soils have been decreased as a direct consequence of this process. Therefore, the development of a model assessing soil erosion potential and proportional risk maps, would help to protect soil and water resources. Among the empirical models, Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) is a widely accepted model developed for soil erosion prediction. The aim of this study was to assess erosion risk by integrating the USLE model and GIS techniques in Roze-Chay catchment, northwest Iran. The map of the USLE factors was produced as follow: rainfall erosivity factor (R) map was interpolated from data point taken from the meteorological stations; Soil erodibility factor (K) map was created by determining the particle size distribution and organic carbon of the 98 soil samples from the study area; Topographic factor (LS) was derived from digital elevation model (DEM); Cropping-management factor (C) was computed from NDVI values derived from Landsat-TM data. Assuming no erosion control practices in the catchment, Conservation practice factor (P) was set to be a unit, in calculations. The results showed that the annual average soil loss for the Roze-Chay catchment was 57 Mg. ha(-1). ya(-1) in 2015. The erosion risk map showed that, 33.6% of the total area has a low erosion risk with annual average soil loss of less than 10 Mg. ha(-1). ya(-1), but the area of 265 km(2) (approximate to 59%) in the catchment showed high to highly severe erosion risk, which should be protect by appropriate conservation practices. The high erosion risk of the catchment can be related to the topography and low levels of the vegetation cover. The developed soil erosion risk map can be used to highlight the erosion risk areas and therefore, assist the farmers and decision makers in implementing suitable conservation program to control soil erosion.

AB  - Recent models of Earth's core magnetic field based on geomagnetic satellite data suggest an existence of interannual core dynamics. The related magnetic signal of the interannual core dynamics is found to be small, which makes an observational detection of interannual variations of the core flow and the associated oscillations of the core angular momentum (CAM) difficult. However, it has been shown that the phase of the interannual oscillation is robustly determined, according to numerous CAM computations from diverse core flow models that are all estimated as a result of inverting a single geomagnetic model C3FM2. Here, we show that the phase identification depends on the secular acceleration (SA) of a geomagnetic model. Estimates of the phase still vary with geomagnetic models, C3FM2, gufm1, and COV-OBS, for the pre-satellite era, whose differences are readily recognisable in their SA representations. None of them may be an optimal model for describing the SA. Compared with the SA of a satellite model GRIMM3, C3FM2 is overdamped in time, but it may be improved for resolving the interannual CAM oscillations by properly modifying its temporal smoothness in reference to the SA of satellite models.

AB  - The present work presents a novel and robust method that exploits multi-temporal Sentinel-1 SAR data for land use classification. The method is built on an interferometric stack of multi-temporal Sentinel-1 SAR data and combines the intensity of backscattering, the short time interferometric coherence and the decorrelation time of scatterers. Promising preliminary results of land use classification and river corridor coverage are presented. The test case is located in the flat area of the Padana plains in west northern part of Italy. The proposed method is a novel, robust and all-conditions tool for improving unsupervised land use classification at large scale. In the future, this technique will be integrated with optical information for testing the potentiality offered to the classification of land-uses and river features.

AB  - Irrational utilization of land and fast developing of infrastructure due to increase in the population has led to the stagnation of the forest landscape. Deforestation results in, the demise of forest cover for the purpose of agriculture development or implementing urban architecture or it could be an implication of unrestricted grazing. This documentation is focused to represents and consul a procedure and process for the forest retention and conservation. Spatial modelling has been employed to contemplate the land cover changes using Markov chain and CA-Markov to predict LULC for 2020. Deforestation has become a leading environmental subject due to its effects and which plays a crucial part in destruction of natural ecology. Therefore, defining the fitness criteria of forest and finding the effective parameters causing deforestation can help in forest management and conservation. For the assessment of Forest fitness criteria Slope, EVI, Forest Land use type and distance to roads, drainage network, and settlement have been used as criteria of factor maps. Distance importance chart has been developed for each factor based on the threshold values with respect to forest. By using Multi Criteria Analysis (MCA) process, the Forest Protection Zones have been pointed, the pockets that are most susceptible to deforestation in 2020 have been identified and forests have also been mapped that are most important to protect in future. Thematic land use land cover types of 1992, 2005 and 2009 of Landsat sensor have been classified. The spatial extent decrease from 1999 to 2009 of forest has been observed to be 9.76% and if the proper measures will not be taken then from 2009 to 2020 the predicted forest spatial extent decrease has been observed to be 4.59%. The projected Land use Land Cover map for 2020 would provide useful inputs to decision makers. The forests are located at lower elevation and close to roads have been observed most vulnerable to clearance. Distance to roads and settlements are explored as the major factors for loss of forest.

In the present paper it is shown that if Delta = {delta(n)}(n is an element of N) is a sequence of mappings delta(n) : U -> U (not necessarily linear) such that delta(n)(XY Z + ZY X) = Sigma(i+j+k=n) (delta(i)(X)delta(j)(Y)delta(k)(Z)+delta(i)(Z)delta(j)(Y)delta(k)(X)) for all X, Y, Z is an element of U, then Delta = {delta(n)}(n is an element of N) is an additive higher derivation on U.

TI  - Assessing the Threat of Erosion to Nature-Based Interventions for Stormwater Management and Flood Control in the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area, Ghana
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Perennial flooding has become a major feature in urban areas in developing economies generating research interest towards finding alternative approaches to stormwater management which could complement the existing systems and help address the challenge of flooding. One of such alternative approaches is nature-based stormwater management and flood control, the implementation of which could be affected by soil erosion. This paper, as part of a wider research, was developed to determine the extent of the threat of soil erosion to stormwater management in an urban area on the example of Greater Accra Metropolitan Area, Accra Ghana as the focus of the research. Landsat 8 images (2014) were used in the research to prepare the Landcover maps. Daily rainfall data from 6 raingauge stations from 1972 to 2014 were utilized to prepare the rainfall erosivity factor maps, whereas DEM was used to prepare the slope and slope length (SL) factor maps. The land cover map with an overall accuracy of 73.6 and Kappa 0.7122 was combined with literature sources to prepare the vegetative cover factor map, and conservation practice factor map. A soil series map, prepared and updated with literature sources and data from the Harmonized World Soil Database on physical parameters, was used to calculate the soil erodibility factor (K factor) for each soil series. These were integrated into RUSLE model as 30 m raster maps to generate a soil loss map at tons/ha/yr. The results produced rainfall erosivity index values based on the modified Fournier index ranging between 0.058 and 23.197 which is classified as low. Low soil erodibility factor (K) ranging between 2.9x10(-5) and 8.5x10(-2) t ha/MJ mm indicated low susceptibility to erosion, SL factor value showing areas of low to almost flat relief with a few isolated areas of moderate slope length were generated. A soil loss of 69,5918 tons/ha/yr classified the soils as having high potential soil loss. The results showed a very low soil loss threat of 0-5.1853 tons/Ha/yr for more than 90% of the study area. Targeted intervention for source areas with high potential soil loss will contain any threat of erosion and sediment yield to the implementation of an infiltration-based stormwater management and flood control system.

TI  - Estimating Aboveground Biomass on Private Forest Using Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Private forests have a crucial role in maintaining the functioning of the Indonesian forest ecosystem especially because of the continuous degradation of natural forests. Private forests are a part of social forestry which becomes a tool for the Indonesian government to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emission by 26% by 2030. The United Nations Programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation has encouraged the Indonesian government to establish a forest monitoring system by estimating forest carbon stock using a combination of forest inventory and remote sensing. This study is aimed at assessing the potential of vegetation indices derived from Sentinel-2 for estimating aboveground biomass (AGB) of private forests. We used 45 sample plots and 7 vegetation indices to evaluate the ability of Sentinel-2 in estimating AGB on private forests. Normalised difference index (NDI) 45 exhibited a strong correlation with AGB compared to other indices (r=0.89; R-2=0.79). Stepwise linear regression fitted for establishing the model between field AGB and vegetation indices (R-2=0.81). We also found that AGB in the study area based on spatial analysis was 72.54Mg/ha. A root mean square error (RMSE) value from predicted and observed AGB was 27Mg/ha. The AGB value in the study area is higher than the AGB value from some of forest types, and it indicates that private forests are good for biomass storage. Overall, vegetation indices from Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery can provide a good result in terms of reporting the AGB on private forests.

TI  - Sacred Functions of Musical Instruments in the Creative Syncretism of Shamanistic Ritual
T2  - RUPKATHA JOURNAL ON INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES IN HUMANITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The study explores the spiritual and worldview aspects of shaman's ritualistic practice through the example of Central Asian Turkic tribes. We tried to show the magico-religious aspect of using the most widespread Kazakh and Kyrgyz musical instruments in the shamanic practice as a ritual that forms the artistic field in the general context of syncretic multi-element complex of shamanistic practice. This study considers the syncretism of creative principles in the shamanistic ritual, and the meanings of the sacred musical instruments (kobyz, tambourine, dombra, asatayak) used in the re shamanistic rituals of the nomadic Turkic religion - Tengrianism. The ritualistic practice of shamans is interpreted as an artistic comprehension of the world, which not only records and reflects the reality, but also bears creative and forming principles, thus becoming an integral part of culture. At that, emphasis is placed on the key role of sacred musical instruments in the shamanistic ritual. The study reveals the spiritual and symbolic meaning of each key musical instrument in the shamanistic ritual separately and in the context of the syncretic complex of the shaman's ritualistic practice.

AB  - The present study uses the Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) retrieved from Moderate Imaging Resolution Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data for the period from January 2011 until December 2015 over an urban area in Kuching, Sarawak. The results show the minimum AOD value retrieved from MODIS is -0.06 and the maximum value is 6.0. High aerosol loading with high AOD value observed during dry seasons and low AOD monitored during wet seasons. Multi plane regression technique used to retrieve AOD from MODIS (AOD(MODIS)) and different statistics parameter is proposed by using relative absolute error for accuracy assessment in spatial and temporal averaging approach. The AOD(MODIS) then compared with AOD derived from Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) Sunphotometer (AOD(AERONET)) and the results shows high correlation coefficient (R-2) for AOD(MODIS) and AOD(AERONET) with 0.93. AOD(MODIS) used as an input parameters into Santa Barbara Discrete Ordinate Radiative Transfer (SBDART) model to estimate urban radiative forcing at Kuching. The observed hourly averaged for urban radiative forcing is -0.12 Wm(-2) for top of atmosphere (TOA), -2.13 Wm(-2) at the surface and 2.00 Wm(-2) in the atmosphere. There is a moderate relationship observed between urban radiative forcing calculated using SBDART and AERONET which are 0.75 at the surface, 0.65 at TOA and 0.56 in atmosphere. Overall, variation in AOD tends to cause large bias in the estimated urban radiative forcing.

AB  - Groundwater table depths (WTD) control peat formation and greenhouse gas emissions from peatlands. Therefore, monitoring WTD is of great interest for restoration and climate change mitigation actions. In shallow groundwater systems such as peatlands, moisture in the topsoil is influenced by and often in hydrostatic equilibrium with WTD. Sentinel-1 provides C-band radar data with high temporal and spatial resolution. Since backscattered microwave radiation is sensitive to the soils' dielectric permittivity of the first centimeters, radar data provides a promising tool to obtain spatial information not only on soil moisture but also on WTD. We evaluate the correlation between time series of backscatter coefficients sigma(0) and WTD measured in situ at > 50 dip wells using a change detection approach. Study area is the Dromling peatland in Germany. Overall, we observe an increase in sigma(0) with shallower WTD. For a few sites and time periods sigma(0) also decreased during wettest conditions and related partial inundation. Preliminary results from the Dromling peatland show that temporal correlation coefficients vary strongly among sites and reach on average 0.57. Time series indicate that the sigma(0)-WTD dependency partly disappears during summer.

AB  - This paper analyses the quantitative performance metrics on applying image fusion method on satellite images and compares it with the fusion methods when applied to filtered images. The satellite images are obtained from over long distances and are immensely huge in size. During transmission, the satellite images get distorted by the presence of different noise components in the atmosphere. In this paper, satellite image fusion is done using Discrete Cosine Transform and compared with the image fusion after filtering operation on satellite images. The results are compared by calculating the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio, Mean Square Error and Entropy. From the results, it can be inferred that the image fusion on filtered images gives improved results in comparison to fusion on unfiltered images.

AB  - In this research paper, focus is given on exploring the potential of Persistent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PSInSAR) technique for the measurement of landslide, which is the extension of existing DInSAR technique. In PSInSAR technique, the movement is measured by finding the phase shift in the scatterers present in the study area through the course of time. The backscattering of such a scatterer does not change during the study. By using this technique, 32 datasets acquired over a period of time i.e. from 2009 to 2011 over the area of Troms County of Lyngen Fjord, Norway are analysed. The dataset utilised are acquired with TerraSAR - X and TanDEM - X pair, in Stripmap mode of acquisition. Coregistration of dataset with subpixel accuracy is done with master images is done to align all the dataset correctly. APS estimation is done in order to remove the phase decorrelation caused by the atmosphere, movement, etc. using algorithms for phase unwrapping which allowed the processing of sparse data and the effect of atmosphere is reduced by doing analysis on temporal basis of the phase shift in interferograms of successive datasets. By this study it has been tried to show the estimation of shift can be done by the temporal analysis of the data acquired by TerraSAR X. The velocity output is displayed in a map reflecting the velocity of movement. Apart from this, the data properties such as baseline distribution both temporal and spatial are displayed in a chart. Other outputs obtained are the atmospheric Phase Screen, sparse point distribution, reflectivity map of the study area etc. are displayed using a map of terrain. The output velocity obtained of the terrain movement is found to be in the range of -40 mm/yr to -70 mm/yr.

AB  - Detecting surface mine activities has been one of the major challenges of remote sensing community to monitor ecological balance in the vicinity of mine area. Towards addressing this issue, we propose an unsupervised mine-site detection technique using multi-modal remotely sensed data from Sentinel missions. We use Sentinel-1's dual polarized SAR data, and Sentinel-2's multi-spectral data for this purpose. An initial set of seed pixels is sampled using spectral slopes based rules on multi-spectral images, which are tailored to capture mining area pixels that exhibit common characteristics. Then, we generate features using multi-spectral image indices and dual polarized SAR data Stokes' parameters. These features over locations sampled by slope based rules are used to train a one-class support vector machine to detect the land anomalies (mine activities). As observed from the experiments, multi-spectral features are efficient in separating mine region and built-up region from the rest of the land surface, and SAR image features discriminate built-up region from the rest of the image. We fuse both of these imagery features to encash their advantage in segregating mine sites in the considered study area. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed technique in detecting active coal mines over two study sites, Asansol region (in West bengal, India) and Jharia region (in Jharkhand, India), both of which exhibit common geographical characteristics. The average detection accuracy in our results is found to be around 94.8%.

T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data study
AB  - The West African forest-savanna mosaic, an important habitat for biodiversity and humans, is severely degraded, fragmented and modified by human activities. However, few studies have quantified the land cover changes observed over time and/or analysed the drivers of change. This study focused on Fazao-Malfakassa National Park, the largest in Togo, uses a combination of remote sensing, ground surveys and questionnaires to: (i) quantify vegetation changes, (ii) determine the drivers of change, (iii) compare results with findings elsewhere in the region and (iv) suggest management interventions. The images used were Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM and Sentinel-2. Different vegetation indices were computed including: number of fragments, index of dominance, mean area of a vegetation type and mean annual expansion rate. In total, 300 people (including park staff and local populations) were interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire. Results indicate that between 1987 and 2015 closed-canopy forest and tree-savanna became severely degraded and fragmented, following trends in other parts of the West African forest-savanna mosaic. The main drivers of change were agricultural expansion, bush fires and timber extraction. Observed changes and drivers altered with time: e.g. agricultural expansion was greatest during 1987-2001 (linked with political instability) while illegal timber extraction augmented during 2001-2015 (following increased timber value). Park staff and local populations perceptions on drivers of change did not differ. Our study highlights that action is urgently needed if we are to preserve this important habitat, the biodiversity it hosts and the services it provides to humans. We suggest several management interventions, learning from successful interventions elsewhere in the region. Copyright: CC BY 4.0

TI  - A multi-sensor approach for improving biodiversity estimation in the Hyrcanian mountain forest, Iran
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Modelling tree biodiversity in mountainous forests using remote-sensing data is challenging because forest composition and structure change along elevation. Topographic variations also affect vegetation's spectral and backscattering behaviour. We demonstrate the potential of multi-source integration to tackle this challenge in a mountainous part of the Hyrcanian forest in Iran. This forest is a remnant of a deciduous broadleaved forest with heterogeneous structure affected by natural and anthropogenic factors. The multi-source approach (i.e. Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM +), Advanced Land Observing Satellite/Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (ALOS/PALSAR), and topographic variables) allows us to propose a biodiversity estimation model using partial least square regression (PLSR) calibrated and validated with limited field data. The effective number of species was calculated based on field measurements of the biodiversity in the study area. In order to model species diversity in more homogeneous extrinsic environmental conditions, we divided data into two groups with relatively uniform slope values. In each slope group, we modelled the correlation between observed biodiversity and satellite-derived data. For that, we followed three scenarios: (A) multispectral Landsat ETM + alone, (B) ALOS/PALSAR alone, and (C) inclusion of both sensors. In each scenario, elevation and slope data were also considered as predictors. We observed that in all scenarios, coefficient of determination (R-2) in gentler slopes was higher than that in areas with steeper slopes (average difference in R-2: Delta R-2 = 0.21). The highest correlation was achieved by inclusion of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and ETM + (R-2 = 0.87). The results clearly confirm that the multi-source remote-sensing approach can provide a practical estimate of biodiversity across the Hyrcanian forest and potentially in other deciduous broadleaved forests in complex terrain.

AB  - A time series issued from modern synthetic aperture radar satellite imaging sensors is a huge dataset composed by many hundreds of million pixels when observing large-scale earth structures such as big forests or glaciers. A concise monitoring of these large scale structures for anomaly spotting thus requires loading and analyzing huge spatio/polarimetric multi-temporal image series. The contributions of the present paper for the sake of parsimonious analysis of such huge datasets are associated with a framework having two main processing stages. The first stage is the derivation of an index called geometric multi-wavelet total variation for fast and robust anomaly spotting. This index is useful for identifying significant abnormal patterns appearing as geo-spatial non-stationarities in multi-wavelet total variation map. The second stage consists in the proposal of a concise asymmetric multi-date change information matrix on regions associated with significant multi-wavelet total variations. This stage is necessary for a fine characterization of change impacts on existing geo-spatial structures. Experimental tests based on Sentinel-1 data show relevant results on a wide Amazonian forest surrounding the Franco-Brazilian Oyapock Bridge.

AB  - The forest ecosystem is an important carbon sink and source containing majority of the aboveground terrestrial organic carbon. Carbon management in forests is the global concern to mitigate the increased concentration of green house gases in the atmosphere. The present study estimated vegetation carbon pool and biophysical spectral modelling to correlate biomass with reflectance/derivatives in Barkot Forest Range, Uttarakhand. The study was carried out using Cartosat-1, IRS-P6 LISS-IV MX, IRS LISS-III, Landsat 7 ETM satellite data and ground data collected from stratified random sampling. Forest type and forest crown density was mapped using resolution merged Cartosat-1 and LISS-IV imagery. Growing stock, biomass and carbon was calculated for the individual sample plots using inventory-based biomass assessment technique. Field-inventoried data was correlated with the surface reflectance and derivatives of it. Among the four vegetation types, viz. Shorea robusta, S. robusta mixed, S. robusta Tectona grandis mixed, T. grandis plantation, mixed plantation, Grassland and Agriculture/orchard, the S. robusta was found to be the dominant vegetation in the area, covering 55.86 km2 of the total area. The study revealed that the S. robusta with high density had the highest aboveground biomass (AGB) (t/ha) was found in S. robusta > 70 % (530 t ha(-1)), followed by S. robusta 40 - 70 % (486 t ha(-1)) and minimum was found in mixed plantation < 10% (101 t ha(-1)). The general trend showed the decrease in AGB with decrease of forest density in each forest type category. The average AGB of S. robusta T. grandis forest was found (308 t ha(-1)-458 t ha(-1)) due to the dominancy of S. robusta trees. The study highlighted the invaluable role of geospatial technology and field inventory for growing stock, biomass and carbon assessment.

TI  - New Insights for Detecting and Deriving Thermal Properties of Lava Flow Using Infrared Satellite during 2014-2015 Effusive Eruption at Holuhraun, Iceland
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A new lava field was formed at Holuhraun in the Icelandic Highlands, north of Vatnajokull glacier, in 2014- 2015. It was the largest effusive eruption in Iceland for 230 years, with an estimated lava bulk volume of- 1.44 km3 covering an area of 84 km2. Satellite- based remote sensing is commonly used as preliminary assessment of large scale eruptions since it is relatively efficient for collecting and processing the data. Landsat- 8 infrared datasets were used in this study, and we used dual- band technique to determine the subpixel temperature ( Th) of the lava. We developed a new spectral index called the thermal eruption index ( TEI) based on the shortwave infrared ( SWIR) and thermal infrared ( TIR) bands allowing us to differentiate thermal domain within the lava flow field. Lava surface roughness effects are accounted by using the Hurst coefficient ( H) for deriving the radiant flux ( F rad) and the crust thickness ( D h). Here, we compare the results derived from satellite images with field measurements. The result from 2 December 2014 shows that a temperature estimate ( 1096 ffi C; occupying area of 3.05 m2) from a lava breakout has a close correspondence with a thermal camera measurement ( 1047 ffi C; occupying area of 4.52 m2). We also found that the crust thickness estimate in the lava channel during 6 September 2014 ( 3.4- 7.7 m) compares closely with the lava height measurement from the field ( 2.6- 6.6 m); meanwhile, the total radiant flux peak is underestimated ( 8 GW) compared to other studies ( 25 GW), although the trend shows good agreement with both field observation and other studies. This study provides new insights for monitoring future effusive eruption using infrared satellite images.

TI  - Have droughts and increased water extraction from the Murray River (Australia) reduced coastal ocean productivity?
T2  - MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - River discharges are decreasing in many regions of the world; however, the consequences of this on water quality and primary productivity of receiving coastal oceans are largely unclear. Weanalysed satellite remote-sensing data (MODIS) of the coastal ocean zone that receives outflows from the Murray River, from 2002 to 2016. This system has experienced historical flow reductions and a recent extreme hydrological 'Millennium' drought. Remotely sensed chlorophyll-a and particulate organic carbon in the coastal ocean were strongly correlated with river outflows (R 2.0.6) in an 8-km radial buffer zone from the Murray Mouth, and the river influence extended up to, 60 km from the Murray Mouth during high-flow periods. This distance was approximately three times greater than the freshwater plume extent during maximum flows in 2011, suggesting that new primary productivity was created. In contrast, there was no additional coastal ocean productivity above background levels from 2007 to 2010 when river outflows ceased. Hindcast calculations based on historical flows from 1962 to 2002 suggest that declining Murray River flows have greatly reduced primary productivity in adjacent coastal waters. This has potential consequences for higher trophic levels and should be considered in future management planning.

TI  - Symbols of Orthodox Calendar in A. Varlamov's Works
T2  - NAUCHNYI DIALOG
M3  - Article
AB  - The article considers the specifics of the Orthodox worldview reflection in the contemporary art. Attention is paid to the analysis of the ideological principle of the work through the representation of Christian chronometry. The novelty of the work is seen in the understanding of the symbols of the Orthodox calendar on the material of modern Russian prose, as until today there is a tradition of analysis of this problem only on the example of writers of the 19th-20th centuries. The novelty of the work also lies in the consideration of A. Varlamov's creativity not from the perspective of continuation of the traditions of realistic prose or postmodern understanding of reality, but from the point of realization of the author's religious worldview and attempts to translate the Orthodox worldview in his work. Special attention is paid to the analysis of spiritual and moral evolution of A. Varlamov's characters in the context of symbols of Easter and Christmas holidays. The relevance of the study is determined by the appeal to the problems of the moral principle in modern fiction and the possibility of reading it from the position of the spiritual potential typical to all Russian classics. The author comes to the conclusion that modern Russian literature cannot be considered as completely secularized, it reflects the traditions laid down by Russian classics (A. S. Pushkin, F. M. Dostoevsky), and traditions associated with the idea of spiritual salvation of man.

AB  - Assessment and mapping of the ecosystems state in the context of ecosystem services that they supply are important tasks to improve human well-being, especially in regions with considerable land degradation. Haskovo region is situated in the Southeastern part of Bulgaria and is considered as an extremely sensitive to land degradation in terms of climate change and human activities in result of unappropriated land management practices. In order to improve the conservation activities and ecosystem services of the region, rapid and available technics are needed in addition to the used analytical methods. The study presents the potential of remote sensing methods (satellite data from different sensors Sentinel and Landsat) and GIS for assessment of the current state of the landscapes to supply ecosystem services and allows a comprehensive evaluation of the main indicators for assessment of ecosystem services to be performed. The proposed methodology includes application of vegetation indices (NDVI, NDWI and MSAVI2) and SAR data. The results show that the referred technics can be used for a rapid and accurate assessment of the main indicators showing the state of the terrestrial ecosystems such as: soil degradation, land use and impact of human activities, responsible for the ecosystem services supply.

AB  - Remote sensing data is a viable alternative for mapping pigment concentrations in water body, and consequently, the trophic. Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) is present in all phytoplankton species. This study therefore uses laboratory fluorometric and remote sensing extraction methods for assessing chlorophyll-a concentration in the Lagos Lagoon. The fluorometer was calibrated with a commercially available chlorophyll-a standard before used in the laboratory to estimates chlorophyll-a concentration. Landsat 7 (ETM+) and Landsat 8 (OLI) were acquired for the remote sensing method. The Landsat data were first geometrically rectified. Then brightness values were converted to reflectance through the radiometric correction process. For the regression models, logarithmically transformed chlorophyll-a was used as the dependent variable. Single bands, band ratios and logarithmically transformed band ratios were the independent variables. R2 values were computed and evaluated.Chlorophyll-a contributes to productive water bodieslaboratory fluorometric and remote sensing extraction methodsLandsat data acquired for the remote sensing method (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Dams construction and operations have many benefits, nevertheless, they have also led to lots of negative social, health and human impacts. It is based on this that this study assesses the potential and socioeconomics dynamics of Oyan dam between 1980 and 2016. The data used for this study include water level and discharge records of the dam between 2007 and 2016, Landsat imageries of 1984 and 2016 and socio-economic datasets for the period. Analysis of the dam potentials (water supply, agriculture and hydropower) and socioeconomic impacts of the dam were carried out using basic statistical tools, land use change anaysis and field survey using questionnaire, structured interview with major stakeholders and personal observation. The results revealed that the water level and storage of the Oyan dam had a relative reduction of about 2% as well as non-stationarity pattern of water abstraction and production for the period. The landuse classes show all classes decreased in extent except the cultivated landuse that acrued an increased of 19.9% between 1984 and 2016. Furthermore, commercial water supply varied significantly between 2010 and 2016 while irrigation scheme is grossly under-utilized from the inception in 1983 to 2016. Finally, the result of socio-economic impacts revealed that majority of the selected communities' members are actually not benefiting from the dam and their livelihoods are not from the dam.

TI  - Application of fractional-order differentiation in multispectral image fusion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this letter, a novel pansharpening method is proposed using component substitution (CS) framework. In order to inject the spatial details into the low resolution multispectral (MS) bands, the fractional-order differentiation is used. Eight direction masks are superimposed on each other to construct a unique mask. The primitive detail map is calculated using the difference between the panchromatic (PAN) image and a linear combination of the low resolution MS bands. To refine the detail map and better pansharpening, the superimposed mask is convolved with the extracted primitive detail map. Two datasets collected by the WorldView-2 and Pleiades satellites are used to examine the proposed method. Experimental results show that in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method can better provide the spectral and spatial information in the fused product quantitatively and subjectively.

AB  - The states of the earth surface in terms of freeze and thaw (FT) cycles especially in high-latitude regions have a crucial role in many applications such as biogeochemical transitions, hydrology and ecosystem studies. This study uses Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) c-band backscatter data from Sentinel 1 from April 2014 to December 2017 to detect high-resolution freeze/thaw states in Alaska. The contrasts between frozen and thawed seasons are used to define FT states. Comprehensive in situ observations of soil temperature, air temperature, snow depth, and soil moisture were obtained to develop appropriate sigma (dB) thresholds of backscattering between freeze and thaw states. The developed thresholds were used to detect FT in Alaska, USA. The results of this method revealed that the estimates are reasonably able to detect the states of surface when compared with ground measurements from SNOw TELemetry (SNOTEL) observations. The developed method that mainly relies on using ground measurements from different land cover type shows an improvement with respect to previous methods that had used the average of frozen and thawed backscattering scenarios as FT references.

T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a natural disaster which causes global damages and affects people. In this work, a comparative study of different drought indices such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Deviation NDVI (DevNDVI), Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) and Temperature Condition Index (TCI) from HJ-1A/1B multispectral data is discussed. These indices have shown potential to detect the drought severity. The objective of this study is to monitor drought in the Potohar region using HJ-1A/1B satellite data, from late November to April during 2009-2014. Additionally, results obtained from satellite data have been verified using ground-based rainfall and crop yield data. The results concluded that the Potohar region faced drought condition in 2010, which is further verified by ground data. Furthermore, NDVI and VCI in this region are found more effective than other drought indices. On the basis of validation of individual drought index with crop yield data, each index is assigned weight accordingly. Moreover, the combination of indices has the ability to detect time periods where drought is affecting the yield production. Regular monitoring and mapping of satellite-based drought indices would play an important role in predicting drought conditions.

TI  - Coal Exploration Based on a Multilayer Extreme Learning Machine and Satellite Images
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The demand for coal has been on the rise in modern society. With the number of opencast coal mines decreasing, it has become increasingly difficult to find coal. Low efficiencies and high casualty rates have always been problems in the process of coal exploration due to complicated geological structures in coal mining areas. Therefore, we propose a new exploration technology for coal that uses satellite images to explore and monitor opencast coal mining areas. First, we collected bituminous coal and lignite from the Shenhua opencast coal mine in China in addition to non-coal objects, including sandstones, soils, shales, marls, vegetation, coal gangues, water, and buildings. Second, we measured the spectral data of these objects through a spectrometer. Third, we proposed a multilayer extreme learning machine algorithm and constructed a coal classification model based on that algorithm and the spectral data. The model can assist in the classification of bituminous coal, lignite, and non-coal objects. Fourth, we collected Landsat 8 satellite images for the coal mining areas. We divided the image of the coal mine using the constructed model and correctly described the distributions of bituminous coal and lignite. Compared with the traditional coal exploration method, our method manifested an unparalleled advantage and application value in terms of its economy, speed, and accuracy.

Remote sensing sensors such as Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MOD'S), Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) with coarse spatial resolution on board different satellites were used to detect the forest fires across the world. Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLD data has the better spatial resolution (30m) as compared with the MODIS and VIIRS, therefore useful to detect the smaller fires. Nainital district in Uttarakhand state was severely affected by the massive forest fire events occurred during April-May, 2016. The main objective of the study is to identify the potential of Landsat-8 data in detecting the forest fire for varying topographic region like Nainital. Landsat-8 data acquired on 28th April 2016 and 1" May 2016 has been used in this study. The results obtained from Landsat-8 data arc compared with the MODIS fire products and showed an improvement in the detection of small fires.

AB  - The Lake Manyara area is the focus of several paleo-archeological investigations. The Manyara basin is located approximately 70 km east of Olduvai Gorge, where important paleoanthropological artifacts are traced back to Homo habilis. In the Manyara basin itself, two hominin-bearing sites (0.78-0.633 Ma) and plenty of vertebrate bones and teeth as well as stone artifacts from different periods were discovered, especially close to the Makuyuni River. Different methodological approaches with a main emphasis on remote sensing were utilized to contribute to the understanding of the paleo-landscape development. In order to investigate the morphotectonic evolution of the study area, lineaments were detected from Synthetic Aperture Radar satellite scenes. The complex lacustrine development of the Lake Manyara and its paleo-stages was investigated by delineating the extent of paleo-lake sediments (older than 0.633 Ma) with multispectral ASTER data. In addition, lake terraces and shorelines on different levels (up to 80 m above today's lake level) and an outlet to the neighboring Engaruka basin were detected by analyzing the backscattered intensity of TerraSAR-X data. The distribution of topsoils, identified from multisensory remote sensing datasets, indicates soil formation as well as erosional and depositional processes. The fossils and artifacts were then characterized, and their distribution probabilities were determined using a statistical model. The proposed methods contribute to a better understanding of the paleoenvironmental interrelations within the study area.

AB  - Increase in use of biomass as renewable source of energy in Europe is tightly linked to the policies aimed at mitigation of climate changes i.e. reductions of greenhouse gas emissions. Both for assessment of the carbon sequestration and emissions as well as for assessment of potential amounts of biomass for renewable energy, information of land cover dynamics are essential. Therefore, the aim of our study was to improve accuracy of estimates of the land use changes in the time period between 1990 and 2014.Land use categories were determined in accordance to UNFCCC: wetland, cropland (arable land, bare field), forest, grassland, settlements (urban/suburban area), and other land. Combination of data from National forest inventory (NFI) sample plots and analysis of Landsat images were used. For the classification based on Landsat images vegetation index (NDVI) was estimated and linked to known information on the land use type from NFI sample plot data.In the analysed period, the most significant changes were found for forest lands - the total area of forest land during the last two decades had increased by 1% (64.5 thousand ha). Similar increase (1.2%) was observed also in the area of cropland. Both of these tendencies were primarily the result of marginal field area reduction (by 2.6%). Increase in forest area and thus annual increment has led to an increase in above-ground biomass by 10.2 m(3) ha(-1).

AB  - This paper aimed to identify main factors of community characters, which have an effect on the land surface temperature(LST) change and estimate the impacting coefficient(ratio) of factors in a significant level of statistics. Chungcheongbuk-do province was selected and then partitioned into city and county areas for the sake of convenience of modeling. LST time series data and the community character data were developed based on Terra Satellite MODIS data and collected from the National Statistical Office, respectively. By the cause and effect relationship between community characters and LST, regression coefficients were estimated using a penal model. In a panel modeling, LST and community characters were used as a dependent variable and explanatory variables, respectively. Panel modeling analysis was carried out using statistical package STATA14 and one-way fixed effect model was selected as the most suitable model to evaluate the regression coefficients in the study area. The impacting ratio of LST change by any explanatory variable derived from the regression coefficients of the panel model fixed. Impacting ratios for industrial areas, elevation x building, energy usage, average window speed, non-urban management area, agricultural, nature and environmental conservation, average precipitation were 3.746, 2.856, 2.742, 0.553, 0.102, 0.071 and 0.003, respectively.

AB  - North Korea conducted the sixth nuclear test in Punggye-ri on 3 September 2017. An artificial earthquake of Mw 6.3 was reported near North Korea's Punggye-ri nuclear test site. Several minutes later, a second smaller earthquake followed the initial event, and it was characterized as a collapse of the cavity. The large and complex deformations related to the earthquakes occurred in the ground surface. It is very important to measure the artificial earthquake-related deformations, because it enables us to estimate the location, depth and cavity radius of the nuclear test. We observed the three-dimensional surface deformations related to the sixth North Korea nuclear test using the ascending and descending ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 radar offset-tracking. We used the multi-kernel offset tracking method to improve the precision of the offset-tracking measurement. The maximum deformation of more than 3 m was observed in the horizontal direction. We estimated the location, depth and cavity radius using the Mogi model. The estimated depth and cavity radius are about 600 m and about 52 m, respectively. The satellite offset-tracking observation will contribute to the nuclear test monitoring and characterization.

AB  - The potential of Sentinel-1 C-band SAR data in VV polarization for estimating the surface roughness (Hrms) over bare agricultural soils was studied. First, a neural network (NN) is used for estimating the soil moisture (mv). Then, a second neural network is used for retrieving the soil roughness in using as an input to the network the soil moisture that was estimated by the first network. The neural networks are trained using simulated dataset generated from the radar backscattering model IEM (Integral Equation Model). The inversion approach is then validated using Sentinel-1 images collected over two study sites, one in France and one in Tunisia. Results show that the use of C-band in VV polarization does not allow a reliable estimate of the soil roughness. Results show that the accuracy on the estimates of Hrms is about 0.8 cm (RMSE).

AB  - Alexander Pushkin had a unique gift of seeing himself in the extraneous and the extraneous in himself. With equal enthusiasm, he would create his own version of a commonly known fact or incorporate the highest human achievements into his creativity, enriching them with the flavor of his own worldview. Translations, imitations, interpretations are the samples of "proteismus", "transmutations", while the poet's original works represent the "second aspect" of the same gift. Still, in "his own" we always see the "extraneous", something that had already existed in the culture, yet was endowed by Pushkin with a new, more vivid color.

TI  - A Framework of Rapid Regional Tsunami Damage Recognition From Post-event TerraSAR-X Imagery Using Deep Neural Networks
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Near real-time building damage mapping is an indispensable prerequisite for governments to make decisions for disaster relief. With high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems, such as TerraSAR-X, the provision of such products in a fast and effective way becomes possible. In this letter, a deep learning-based framework for rapid regional tsunami damage recognition using post-event SAR imagery is proposed. To perform such a rapid damage mapping, a series of tile-based image split analysis is employed to generate the data set. Next, a selection algorithm with the SqueezeNet network is developed to swiftly distinguish between built-up (BU) and nonbuilt-up regions. Finally, a recognition algorithm with a modified wide residual network is developed to classify the BU regions into wash away, collapsed, and slightly damaged regions. Experiments performed on the TerraSAR-X data from the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan show a BU region extraction accuracy of 80.4% and a damage-level recognition accuracy of 74.8%, respectively. Our framework takes around 2 h to train on a new region, and only several minutes for prediction.

AB  - Urbanisation contributed to the presence of urban heat island phenomenon, and aggravated urban heat island effect intensity with the improvement of urbanisation level. Overheat weather condition caused severe threat to human life and health, while green infrastructure including water bodies has been validated to be able to reduce urban land surface temperature in different extent. To examine the impact of green infrastructure on urban heat island effect in Harbin, with the aid of ENVI and geographic information system software, this paper retrieved seasonal Harbin land surface temperature from 2000 to 2015 using Landsat series and MODIS 8-day remote sensing data, and further computed surface urban heat island intensity(SUHII). Then, to build the quantitative relationship between green infrastructure fraction and urban heat island intensity applying regression analysis method. Finally, by means of ENVI-MET software, this article simulated urban heat island intensity change based on different green infrastructure scenarios. The results showed that, as far as administrative region of Harbin scale, surface urban heat island intensity both in summer and in winter reduced from 2000(6.55 degrees C in summer, 4.15 degrees C in winter) to 2015(2.6 degrees C in summer, 0.47 degrees C in winter), and SUHII in summer is higher than it in winter except 2005; Green infrastructure fraction is negative correlated with SUHII; Simulation result indicated that increase on green infrastructure would facilitate to mitigation of urban heat island effect. The result of this study would provide some help and advice for land use planning decision and urban construction in the future of Harbin.

AB  - The thesis of this paper analyzes Alfred Rosenberg’s worldview which is the ideology of German Third Reich. Especially from the center of his “20th century mythology”, racial struggle and war were analyzed by his historical thought. This paper analyzesRosenberg’s worldview through the Nazi party leaders’ worldview and the church policy debate within the Nazi party.Particularly, it inquires into the conflict within German Christians who were the supporters inside Hitler’s Protestantism. Lastly, it analyzes Rosenberg’s worldview through its impact on Protestantism with regards to the idea of the “20th century mythology”.According to Rosenberg, the worldview is one fixed point of view (bestimmte Haltung) . This is from human point of view about soul (seelisch) and about character (charakterisch) . It is a human’s character and spirit combined with special blood. This is primary and other ethnic or outside doctrine and tradition is secondary. Therefore, the Nazi’s worldview should begin from definite humanity, human character and human history.Rosenberg pays attention to Christian creed which contains all spheres of life. It starts from the creed of Christianity at the center of all deeds and dogma whichconsist of the entire fields of life. The worldview by Nazism needs replacement for the lack of a future outlook from church.Rosenberg claims to write a new world history on account of new world is born. His worldview is based on racism, and his view of history is race and the struggle of race. His political view is neither the class struggle nor a fight between the church dogma and dogma anymore. It’s rather the battle between the blood and blood, nation and nation, race and race, and spiritual value and spiritual value. His view of the world a history of race struggle.

AB  - Cloud computing has developed as a prevailing and transformational worldview in Information innovation space throughout the most recent couple of years. It has influenced a huge number of ventures, for example, government, broadcast communications etc. The Quality of Service (QoS) of a cloud specialist organization is a vital research field which envelops distinctive basic issues, for example, effective load adjusting, reaction time enhancement, culmination time change and diminishment in wastage of data transfer and power consumption. This project highlights a new energy aware algorithm which can map and migrate virtual machines onto the physical machines while maintaining least performance degradation. Power consumption by the datacentre is decreased via switching off the hosts with least workload, by mapping and migrating the Virtual machines onto the other hosts, which have adequate resources to execute these Virtual Machines simultaneous to the one already executing upon it. Quality of Sevice (QoS) is maintained while the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) can decide whether the algorithm has to be cost efficient or time efficient. The algorithm can be made cost efficient for the CSP by prioritizing the CPU utilization and time efficient by prioritizing the Performance degradation. Therefore, the algorithm decreases the energy consumption by the Data center and while maintaining the QoS.

AB  - Phenology is the study of periodic plant and animal life cycle events and how these are influenced by seasonal and inter-annual variations in weather and climate, as well as in other environmental factors. Time series of remote sensing (RS) images can he used to characterize land surface phenology at continental to global scales. For this, the RS images are typically transformed into various vegetation indices (VI) such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI.) or the enhanced vegetation index (EVI). These indices can then be used to extract various phenological metrics.In our previous work we used cloud computing to generate temperature-based phenological indices [1], [2], and to relate one phenological metric, namely the Start-of-Season (SOS), with those indices [3], [4]. Here we present an extension of our work where we use a Spark-based platform to efficiently extract phenological metrics from time series of NDVI and EVI. This platform allows obtaining and analyzing high spatial resolution metrics (in this case 1km) from 10-day composites. The platform uses the same architecture as in [3], i.e., it is organized into three layers: a storage layer, a processing layer, and JupyterHub services for user-interaction. It is designed to store the data in well-known file formats like GeoTiffs and Hierarchical Data Format (HDF). For the data analysis the user expresses the operations in Jupyter notebooks as Python, R, or Scala code (Fig. 1). Hence, with a browser and remote connection, the user can express a research question and/or collect insights from large data sets. All computations are pushed down to the computational platform, and results fetched back for data visualization.To extract the phenological metrics, we rely on TimeSat [5]. TimeSat is a software package that can he used to fit a function (e.g. double logistic) to time series of VIs. After that, it uses various approaches to extract vegetation seasonality metrics such as SOS. The programs numerical and graphical routines are coded in Matlab and Fortran. These routines are highly vectorized and efficient for use with large data sets. However, distributed processing is required to determine SOS at continental scales. Through an efficient partition of the data, and Spark's scheduling policies, these single-core routines are scheduled for parallel execution over multiple machines. The study evaluates which Nils and fitting functions are most suitable for certain vegetation types by comparing the SOS metrics to volunteered phenological observations curated by the USA national phenological network [6]. Our preliminary results show there can be up to 20-30 days differences in the SOS depending on the fitting function, the VI and the approach used to extract the SOS metric. In the South, SOS is around mid-February or March whereas in mountainous regions and the North, the SOS can be as late as June-July. We are to further evaluate how our results compare to the ground volunteered observations. This work is then a first stepping stone towards being able to systematically analyze and map the impact of climate change on the seasonality of plants. Our tests show that the platform is scalable and can be extended to work with even higher resolution VIs, such as those that can he derived from Sentinel-2 images (10 m resolution). Because of this, our work opens the door to studies at continental to global scales, and to the use of high and very high spatial resolution data.

M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Evidence of safety issues associated with long-acting beta(2)-agonist (LABA) treatment has led to multiple regulatory activities by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on this class of medications. This study describes the impact of the regulatory activities on incident LABA-containing medication dispensing. Methods: A monthly rolling cohort of asthma patients who were eligible to initiate a LABA-containing product was created in the Mini-Sentinel Distributed Database between January 2005 and June 2011. Cohorts of individuals who initiated LABA were examined for the changes in the proportions of single-ingredient to fixed-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-LABA initiators, appropriate initiation of LABA-containing products, and use of controller medications. The impact of the 2005 and 2010 FDA regulatory activities associated with LABA-containing products was measured using interrupted time series with segmented regression. Results: LABA-containing product initiation was declining prior to the 2005 regulatory activities and continued to decline over the study period, accompanied by increased initiation of fixed dose ICS-LABA among LABA initiators. While the 2010 regulatory activities had no immediate impact on the proportion of LABA initiation in patients with prior controller medication dispensing and/or poor asthma control, there was an increasing positive trend toward LABA initiation in the appropriate patient population after the regulatory activities. Conclusion: The 2005 and 2010 FDA regulatory activities likely had an impact on communicating the safety concerns of LABA products. However, the impact cannot be viewed independent of scientific publications, guidelines for asthma treatment and other regulatory activities.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the project of the solar systems, the values of the solar radiation of a region must be known. The global solar radiation measurements are performed by the Turkish Meteorological Service in Turkey, while the diffuse solar radiation measurements are unavailable. In this study, some new models for predicting the monthly average daily diffuse solar radiation on a horizontal surface for Erzincan, Turkey are developed using satellite data. The evaluation of the models is carried out with the statistical analysis methods of mean bias error (MBE), root mean square error (RMSE) and correlation coefficient (r). The results are proved that the correlation equations obtained in here can be used to forecast diffuse solar radiation reasonably well.

TI  - Variability of the Lake Onega ice coverage in the period 2000-2018 according to the satellite data
T2  - LED I SNEG-ICE AND SNOW
M3  - Article
AB  - Studying of characteristics of the Lake Onega ice regime and investigating of the climate influence on the formation and destruction of the ice cover requires a continuous chronological series of data on the Lake ice coverage. Ice cover is the percentage of the ice area to the total area of the lake. In 1955-1990, calculations of the ice coverage of the Lake were based on the use of the results of airborne ice reconnaissance. On average for this period, from 5 to 15 values were annually obtained, which was not enough for a comprehensive analysis of the ice coverage variability. In this paper, for the first time, a daily series of values of the ice coverage of the Lake Onega for the period 2000-2018 had been formed basing on the results of a combined analysis of the following satellite data sets: NSIDC, NOAA NESDIS, corrected by data of the satellite MODIS sensor. Values from November to May were grouped from the above data sets without regards for years of observations, and then the regression analysis of these values made possible to create a model (a polynomial of the 8th degree) of the chronological course of the ice coverage during the period of the ice phenomena existence on the Lake Onega. The coefficient of determination of the model is 0.74, and the error in determining the ice coverage is 21%. The average dates of the beginning, end, and duration of periods of the formation (from November 25th to January 19th), the destruction (from April 13th to May 17th) of the ice cover, as well as the total freeze-up time (from January 20th to April 12th) on the Lake Onega for the period 2000-2018 was determined. The period of ice phenomena on the Lake Onega on average lasts for almost half a year (175 days), of which a significant part of the time is a complete freeze-up (84 days). It was found that the rate of formation of the ice cover (1.76% per day) on the Lake Onega is 1.65 times smaller than the rate of its destruction (2.90% per day), which approximately corresponds to similar results obtained for the Lake Ladoga (1.5 times).

TI  - Extracting water-related features using reflectance data and principal component analysis of Landsat images
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES
M3  - Review
AB  - This study aimed to map water features using a Landsat image rather than traditional land cover. We involved the original bands, spectral indices and principal components (PCs) of a principal component analysis (PCA) as input data, and performed random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) classification with water, saturated soil and non-water categories. The aim was to compare the efficiency of the results based on various input data. Original bands provided 93% overall accuracy (OA) and bands 4-5-7 were the most informative in this analysis. Except for MNDWI (modified normalized differenced water index, with 98% OA), the performance of all water indices was between 60 and 70% (OA). The PCA-based approach conducted on the original bands resulted in the most accurate identification of all classes (with only 1% error in the case of water bodies). We therefore show that both water bodies and saturated soils can be identified successfully using this approach.

TI  - Situating the Gulen Movement in France and in Europe
T2  - POLITICS RELIGION & IDEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Fethullah Gulen's Turkish socio-religious movement has been active in Europe for over a decade in the spheres of education and interfaith dialogue. Operating outside Turkey and with relative freedom of association and expression, the Gulen movement has begun to carve out its niche in European Islam. Unlike in the United States, where supporters have chartered full-time schools, members of the Gulen movement in France and Germany mostly offer after-school tutorial services. It is within these programs that Fethullah Gulen's moral and ethical worldview is being exposed to increasing numbers of young people of mainly Turkish descent. These activities elude easy categorization as religious commitment. Yet the Gulen movement remains an Islamic organization that is directly implicated in the religious sphere because of its explicitly universalistic and humanistic approach. Rather than aiming at literally spreading the religion of Islam, the organization works to improve Islam's public image in Western contexts.

AB  - Radar data is of primary importance for Arctic regions study and mapping. Kotelny Island was selected as an area of interest due to well-defined landscapes diversity and abundance of Sentinel-1 radar data. The study based on multi-temporal and multi-polarization images acquired by Sentinel-1A at a period from October 2015 to September 2016. The ways of modified radar images creation are proposed, which aimed at their adaptation for visual and automated interpretation. The main factors influencing the backscatter values and its dynamics are revealed based on additional data sources. The main result of the research is a map of natural landscapes of Kotelny Island at a scale 1:750 000. Spatial and temporal variations of backscattering coefficient allowed semi-automatic delineating the boundaries of landscapes which are characterized by different combination of the relief, vegetation and soils. Table legend of the map contains information both on landscapes features and respective annual backscatter behavior.

AB  - The objective of this study is to cross-compare three algorithms for retrieving surface soil moisture (SSM) from ESA's Sentinel-1 (S-1) data. The context is provided by the large scientific and application interest in SSM products at high resolution and regional/continental scale that can be retrieved from S-1 data alone or in combination with other missions such as NASA/SMAP and ESA/SMOS. Of the three investigated algorithms, one inverts a scattering model exploiting a Bayesian approach, whereas the other two are change detection approaches. The cross-comparison is carried out by using both simulated and experimental data. Strengths and weaknesses of the three algorithms are identified and discussed.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node in early stage ovarian cancer; a literature review
T2  - JOURNAL OF MIND AND MEDICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Although sentinel lymph node mapping has been widely implemented in gynecological malignancies in order to minimize the number of unnecessary lymph node dissections and to diminish postoperative morbidity rate, little is known about ovarian cancer sentinel lymph node mapping. This article presents a literature review regarding the effectiveness, safety and benefits of this method.Sentinel lymph node detection in early stage ovarian cancer seems to be a safe and effective method, able to minimize the rate of patients submitted to unnecessary lymph node dissection. The second goal of the procedure, to minimize the risk of missing involved lymph nodes, seems also to have been achieved, most studies reporting a very small number of cases diagnosed with positive non-sentinel lymph nodes.Considering all these data we can note that this procedure is not yet included as part of the standard therapeutic protocol, so that further studies would be necessary to include it as a common therapeutic approach in the case of patients with early stage ovarian cancer.

AB  - This paper presents the approach and results of geoinformatical outcrop analysis in Zdarske vrchy Protected Landscape Area (PLA). This locality is typical with the outcrops on the tops of ridges, which overhang surrounding., valleys. Local outcrops have been studied and described very well, also because Zdarske vrchy is one of the most attractive recreational locality in central Czech Republic, which attracts attention of tourists, sportsmen, scientists, especially geologists. In this paper, we would like to continue in geomorphodiversity studies and try to interpret these specific shapes using Remote Sensing data. We used Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data and Digital Terrain Model (DTM) to visualize these shapes and create another view on them for wide range of interested people, tourists and visitors. Through models based on laser scanning we can gain better overview of these localities, which are not usually overlookable well because of complicated terrain geomorphology and grown vegetation.

AB  - The objective of this work is to better understand the air-sea interactions in coastal areas by developing an improved coastal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) wind retrieval algorithm. During the Coastal Land Air-Sea Interaction (CLASI) field experiment in June, 2016, X-band COSMO-SkyMed SAR images were acquired over Monterey Bay, CA. Wind fields were derived from these images using the Mouche X-band SAR wind retrieval algorithm and compared to the wind fields from the corresponding Coupled Ocean/Atmosphere Mesoscale Prediction System (COAMPS) model outputs. Additional data from coastal tower measurements and other relevant sources are utilized to gain insight on a specific feature present in the SAR images, in addition to quantifying temporal and spatial surface roughness scales near the Monterey Bay coastline.

AB  - With more than 50% of the world's population now living in cities, monitoring urban areas is of utmost importance. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is a very useful tool for monitoring urban areas because artificial objects, like buildings, typically appear bright and stable in SAR images. By using the coherence, which is the complex correlation between two images, we can detect changes in urban areas very well, because buildings normally stay coherent over an extended period of time, while most other land use classes loose coherence quickly over time. This classification method is well known, but requires time-series of SAR data, which made the approach costly and therefore not widely applied. With the global availability of Sentinel-1 data and the open data policy of the Copernicus mission, this changed. Now, we can use this approach to globally monitor changes in urban areas.In this paper, we demonstrate the applicability of coherence change method to monitor the urbanization process in Shanghai, but also demonstrate the applicability of the approach to monitor destructions, with examples from Syria.

AB  - Contextual services are having increasing importance in nowadays literature due to current availability of always-connected personal devices like smartphones and tablets. It is therefore increasingly important to have an affordable and accurate way for user localization in both indoor and outdoor environments. In outdoor GPS or GLONASS are reliable, but indoor a valid and ubiquitous localization system is still under research. One of the most promising methodology is wireless fingerprinting, which exploits available access points infrastructure. It is composed of two distinct phases: one training phase during which the interesting area is monitored and recorded and a usage phase in which the recorded data is used for localization purposes. The usage phase is reliable and accurate, but the training phase is often time consuming (in particular for large areas) as it must be performed manually and may also need to be repeated in case of structural and environmental changes. In this paper we propose a novel framework which uses an appropriate Wireless Sensors Network allowing continuous training over time in order to achieve real-time updating of the fingerprinting database without any human interaction, while also aiming to reduce power consumption needed for training phase, determining a minimal set of sentinel, which are sensors able to detect network alterations and able to trigger RadioMap rescanning.

AB  - Wildfires are one of the main processes that currently shape Mediterranean ecosystems. The analysis of wildfire risk combined with historical records allows for a greater understanding of trends and their relation to territorial variables that are favourable to future events. Using GIS analysis, we assess wildfire risk in La Campana - Penuelas Biosphere Reserve, in Central Chile. Additionally, with official historical records and LANDSAT satellite images from 1985-2015 and GIS we determine historical occurrence in the Reserve. We found that the areas with very high risk of wildfire occurrence have a strong combination of ignition factors such as presence of human settlements and road connectivity, and variables that would be negatively impacted by the occurrence of wildfires, such as degraded soils and vulnerable vegetation. These findings highlight the need to destine resources to fire prevention in these areas and develop adaptation strategies for risk management at different scales.

AB  - This study focuses for the first time on the water content modeling as an indicator for red palm weevil (RPW) stress-attacks using field sampling, Worldview-3 (WV-3) reflectance measurements, water content estimation at the laboratory (WC-(Lab)), several water stress indices (WSI) and statistical analysis. Based on field identification and sampling, 100 date palm trees were considered and divided into four classes of RPW stress-attacks: dead, severely attacked, moderately attacked, and healthy trees (young and mature trees). Spectral measurements were acquired over each sample using Analytical Spectral Devices (ASD). Then, they were resampled and convolved using WV-3 spectral response profiles and the Canadian radiative transfer code (CAM5S). For model calibration, only 80 samples were considered, while 20 samples were used for validation purposes. Obtained results indicate that the proposed models based on PTWSI-4 and SRWI offer an important alternative to discriminate among different levels of RPW stress-attack. They discriminate significantly among the considered stress classes (R-2 >= 0.85) using second order regression (p < 0.05). The validation of PTWSI-4 model revealed a significant correlation with the WC-(Lab) values (R-2 of 0.95), and an acceptable RSME of 8.5 %.

T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data study
AB  - Abstract Currently, there is an increase in the number of low orbit satellites dedicated to radio occultation of GPS signals. The MetOp-B is one of these new satellites, but it has not been explored in the data assimilation performed in Brazil. In order to include this source of observation in the database used in the assimilation of the CPTEC/INPE and evaluate its impact in the performance of the Atmospheric Global Circulation Model used operationally at the center, an experiment with data from January and August 2014 was executed. The results were compared with another experiment without assimilating those data, which showed that the inclusion of the MetOp-B refractivity profiles, has impacted beneficially the assimilation of more data from the other satellites in use, such as COSMIC, TerraSAR-X and MetOp-A. The most prominent results were observed in August, with root mean squared gain values greater than 40% in the state variables for the 24-h forecast over the Southern Hemisphere, variables that are directly related to the refractivity values. Beyond that, the anomaly correlation coefficient values over South America indicated that, adding the MetOp-B data, the zonal and meridional wind components at 250 hPa were indirectly impacted, showing the importance of assimilate such data.

AB  - With the availability of high quality remote sensing data, the phenomena of urban heat island has been well documented over the past two decades. Various mitigation measures, including changes to urban form, construction material, etc. have been suggested; however, these factors tend to be static and have a long gestation period. Water and forest body have higher specific heat compared to urban built up and thus have a lower surface temperature during the afternoon, when the temperature generally peaks. Many indigenous civilizations have used this `cooling effect', but the effectiveness of water and forest bodies on cooling is poorly understood. This study uses remote sensing data, specifically, thermal imagery from Landsat 7 and 8 satellites to calculate the quantity and range of cooling due to the combined presence of water body and green strip along the water's shore. The study finds that in the studied area, the cooling effect ranges from 1.1 to 3.9 degrees C but with a maximum effective range of 360 meters under the favourable wind conditions. The short range of cooling effect raises questions if green-blue infrastructure can be an effective way to combat UHI in the dense urban area where land is scarce and expensive.

TI  - Spatial methane emission modelling from wetlands using geospatial tools
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland ecosystems have acquired importance among the scientific community because of their role in biogeochemical cycling and as source and sink of greenhouse gas emissions particularly methane (CH4) in addition to the ecosystem services that they provide. To estimate the CH4 emission from wetlands in spatial domain, models incorporating the geospatial tools are required. Accordingly, main focus of this study is to demonstrate the utility of geospatial techniques in assessing the spatial CH4 emission variability from four different regions of Uttar Pradesh (UP), India, namely, Western, Central, Bundelkhand, and Eastern regions deploying Semi-Automated Empirical CH4 emission Model (SEMEModel) using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer data of 2010-2012. SEMEModel is a three-tier model which determines the CH4 emissions in spatial domain as a function of remote sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) derived wetland components including wetland area and corresponding temperature factors coupled with point CH4 emission coefficients developed via field measurements. Results of the study have shown that eastern region of UP exhibited maximum estimated/modelled CH4 emissions (43.10Gg yr(-1)) as compared to other regions due to more area being under wetlands whereas central region was found to be the least contributor (0.266Gg yr(-1)) due to the fact that it has minimum wetland area (0.40%) among all the regions. It was observed that estimated/modelled CH4 emissions depicted an increase by 4.96 orders of magnitude in 2010-2011 and 4.04 orders of magnitude in 2011-2012 when estimated by applying literature-based global CH4 emission coefficients for UP in place of CH4 flux values derived in field. It signifies that the upscaling of CH4 flux values using literature-based CH4 flux values of one region to another region may not reflect actual values. Therefore, this study not only helps to improve accuracy of CH4 emission estimates from wetlands but also credibly adjudges that integration of CH4 flux field measurements with modern tools of RS and GIS will immensely assist to reduce the uncertainties in CH4 emission predictions done over larger regions.

AB  - The purpose of this study was putting up with a remote sensing diagnosis method for extracting mulberry and mapping the spatial distribution of it. Based on the Gaofen-1 remote sensing image, we established the classification model through applying one versus one support vector machine optimized by self-adaptive mutation particle swarm optimizer (SAMPSO-SVM) to separate the combined image of spectral derivative and original remote sensing image, which was named as SD-SVM model in this study. Furthermore, we evaluated the results via three contrast experiments and achieved following conclusions: 1) Adding spectral feature of target class into the dimension of dataset to be classified could enhance the results. 2) The classification performance also largely depended on the initial parameters of SVM which could be optimized by particle swarm optimizer (PSO) or SAMPSO. 3) Although the SAMPSO solve the problem of premature convergence of PSO, it was not definite to outperform PSO obviously. 4) To decrease the omission and commission errors, the one versus one SVM method provided superior performance than one versus others.

AB  - With the adoption of MCD45 product in a consecutive twelve years, the spatial evolution model of fire behavior in the study area is analyzed and the spatial and temporal variation rule in interannual and seasonal duration is mastered. On that basis and starting from the principle of grassland fire combustion mechanism, the index of the source of fire, the combustible state index and the fire environmental index are built. Through comprehensive analysis the grassland fire danger index is obtained, with the fire danger classified into five levels by using the risk matrix method. To verify the accuracy of the model, the fire point data on March 22nd, 2012 is tested and the accuracy proves to be 71%. The result shows that the grassland fire danger warning method can be applied to warning work in grassland regions and can efficiently improve the accuracy of grassland fire warning, which denotes great practical significance in domestic grassland fire prevention and control work.

TI  - Sublethal effects of the exposure to the Aznalcollar toxic spill in long-lived birds.
T2  - Revista Catalana d'Ornitologia
M3  - Article
AB  - In 1998, the rupture of the tailings dam at the Aznalcollar pyrite mine (Sevilla, Southwestern Spain) caused a toxic spill in the surroundings of the Donana National Park. Here, we review the potential impact of this mining spill on birds using the White Stork Ciconia ciconia and the Black Kite Milvus migrans as sentinel species. We employed a biomarker approach to study the relationships between blood levels of Pb, Cd, Zn, Cu and As (the most abundant metals in the spill), and molecular, biochemical, cellular, and physiological aspects of vital importance including the immune system, DNA damage, the adrenocortical stress response, and bone development and metabolism to organism functioning. We found that, although often below threshold toxicity values, levels of some metals (e.g. Cu) could be related to an impaired cellular immune response (PHA-skin-test) and to DNA damage (comet assay) both in White Stork and Black Kite nestlings. The adrenocortical stress response in White Stork nestlings was positively related to low Pb levels. This association was stronger in individuals that had suffered additional stress from other environmental factors. The morphological deformities detected in White Stork nestlings after the spill were related to disrupted bone metabolism (P levels, Ca: P, bone alkaline phosphatase), especially in younger birds. Moreover, female storks developmentally exposed to the spill experienced an altered age-dependent pattern of breeding performance in comparison with their non-developmentally exposed counterparts (hatched before the spill), showing an unusually high productivity in their early reproductive life and premature breeding senescence. We propose that sublethal effects compromising White Storks' health during the nestling period might play an important role in shaping this pattern of reproduction (terminal investment hypothesis). In summary, the biomarker approach used in the short- and medium-terms can serve as an early-warning signal of long-term contaminant effects in wild birds. This review shows that the exposure to pollutants in early life, even at low levels, may affect individual fitness (reproduction) and is evidence of the need for long-term monitoring and evaluation when attempting to correctly assess the impact of pollutants on wildlife populations. We conclude that the Aznalcollar mine spill is the most likely cause of the effects detected in storks and kites. However, we cannot completely rule out the idea that these effects may be the result of the combined exposure to spill-related metals and other contaminants associated with the industrial and agricultural activities practiced in the surroundings of the Donana National Park.

M3  - Data study
AB  - This study aimed to monitor and analyze the spatial and temporal dynamic of forest cover in Eastern area of Beni-Mellal Province (Morocco), using multispectral ASTER and Sentinel-2A MIS images acquired in 2001 and 2015, respectively. The supervised classification algorithm and NDVI were combined within a GIS environment to quantify the extent and density change of forest cover stands, i.e., Holm oak, Aleppo pine, Thya, Zea oak, Crops & others and Bare ground. The classification overall accuracy was 97.76 and 95.80% in 2001 and 2015 images, respectively. The result revealed an overall forest cover change with an increase in forested area. All species stands showed expansion at the expense of the bare ground and crops & others classes. The density maps showed a net density change with an expansion of dense forest class. The observed forest cover expansion may be due to the favourable climate in the examined period, the protection, the reforestation programs and the regeneration through clandestine cutting. These results constituted the first attempt at mapping and monitoring of forest cover change in the study region that used a remote sensing-based product. They will help authorities and forest managers for the development of sustainable forest conservation and management decisions. Copyright: CC BY 4.0

AB  - Forest fires are a significant factor that affects the natural heritage of our planet - the lake Baikal basin. Moreover, often this impact is negative and causes damage to the forest areas of the region. The main condition for effective forest management and fire protection is the availability of reliable and comprehensive static and dynamic information on the state of the forest fund. The report provides a description of the methodology for preliminary analysis of the structure of the forest and assessing forest fire danger. LANDSAT images are used as primary information. One of the territories of the Baikal region is considered. LANDSAT images were used for 2015.

TI  - Analysis of land use change impacts on flash flood occurrences in the Sosiani River basin Kenya
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RIVER BASIN MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper investigates the impacts of land use changes on river peak discharges during floods and its contribution to flood occurrence in the Sosiani River basin in the Rift Valley province of Kenya. The land use maps used in the study were derived from the Landsat imagery employing remote sensing and GIS techniques. Two-dimensional Rainfall-Runoff-Inundation (RRI) model was utilized in simulating the flash flood events. The results indicated an increase in river peak discharge due to extensive deforestation in the past decades and increase in farmlands which covers up to 75% of the total watershed area. According to the observed discharge data and generated land use maps, expansion of farmlands from 15.3% (in the early 1970s) to 75.2% (2013) and urban areas from 0.4% (in the early 1970s) to 10% (2013) have triggered the observed river peak discharge to increase from 167 m(3)/s (1970) to 233 m(3)/s (2013). Two land use change scenarios were tested for urbanization and reforestation using the calibrated RRI model and modified land use maps accordingly. The obtained results indicated a high sensitivity for the variation in land use to the river peak discharges. The results of the study will be beneficial for future developments in the basin and its flood management activities.

TI  - Assessing wheat spatial variation based on proximal and remote spectral vegetation indices and soil properties
T2  - ITALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing the spatial variation of soil and crop properties is the basis for site specific management of crop practices in precision agriculture applications. To this aim, proximal and remote spectral vegetation indices are increasingly replacing soil analysis. In this study the spatial variation of soil properties, proximal and remote spectral vegetation indices were compared in a winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) crop grown in a 4.15 ha field in northern Italy. Soil analysis (particle size distribution, pH, carbonates, C, total N, available P, exchangeable cations and electrical conductivity) was geo-referentially carried out; the proximal indices chlorophyll content by N-Tester and normalised difference vegetation index through GreenSeeker were determined in three dates during stem elongation; the remote indices PurePixel (TM) chlorophyll index and PurePixel (TM) vegetation index were determined through the Landsat 8 satellite in three dates during the same wheat stage. Dry biomass yield (DBY), grain yield (GY) and yield components were determined at harvest. Soil, proximal and remote data were submitted to principal component analysis (PCA), and the retained PCs were clustered to delineate areas at low, intermediate and high yield potential, based on soil parameters (CLUsp), proximal (CLUpi), and remote vegetation indices (CLUri). DBY and GY were significantly correlated with several soil parameters and vegetation indices. Spatial distribution of soil and crop data consistently depicted a low performing area (GY<3 Mg ha(-1)) and a high performing one (GY>8 Mg ha(-1)). CLUsp determined a lower GY difference between low and high performing area (+60%), compared to CLUpi and CLUri (almost +100%). In CLUsp and CLUpi the low and high performing area were of similar size (25 and 29% for the two respective areas in CLUsp; 25 and 33% in CLUpi), whereas in CLUri they were quite different (16 and 46%). Lastly, yield potential levels determined by vegetation indices (CLUpi and CLUri) exhibited a better degree of agreement with DBY and GY levels, than soil parameters (CLUsp). In exchange for this, the above referred soil parameters are quite consistent in time, allowing soil data to be used for more years. On concluding, PCA followed by clustering resulted in a robust delineation of field areas at different yield potential. This is the premise for developing research driven strategies of practical use.

AB  - Haines Index (HI) has been associated with convective forest fires risk. Temperatures and humidities in low atmospheric levels are required to compute HI and usually, atmospheric sounding data are used for this purpose. However, spatial and temporal resolutions of these data are coarse and remote sensing data could improve them. Therefore, the aim of this work is to test remote sensing data from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) instrument on board the EOS Aqua satellite, specifically the Level 2 V6 products (AIRX2RET and AIRS2RET), for this purpose. First, we validated the remote sensing data with radiosonde daytime and nighttime data located in the Iberian Peninsula in 2014. Significant deviations between daytime and nighttime data were not found in the analysis. The correlations between AIRS and radiosonde data are slightly better for top atmospheric layers than for low layers, and the results show good agreement between both measures, a bit better for the AIRS2RET product. Thus, these remote sensing data can improve the lack of global data in the atmospheric lower layers to evaluate convective forest fire risk. Finally, as an example, we mapped the result of the HI computed from AIRS data for a forest fire event.

TI  - Icy lakes extraction and water-ice classification using Landsat 8 OLI multispectral data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We present an algorithm discriminating ice from open water on icy lakes using multispectral data from Landsat 8. Lakes are first extracted from the images using a new radiometric index coined ILI (Icy Lakes Index) which uses the stability of the reflectance of water and ice in the shortwave infrared bands. Quantitative comparisons to state-of-the-art indexes such as the Modified Normalised Difference Water Index (MNDWI) or the Water Ratio Index (WRI) show the ILI separates mixed ice/ water bodies from land better than the current indexes, consistently achieving kappa coefficients (.) above 0.93 with manually labelled reference data. Additionally, these results suggest that the ILI has a very high optimal threshold stability, compared to other indexes. In the delineated lake area, we perform a supervised classification with a decision tree using radiometric properties, but also texture properties such as the local standard deviations and average gradients in each band. A key feature of this classification is the Water-Ice Classification Index (WICI), also texture-based, which discriminates shallow water from ice efficiently. We prove the robustness of our classification algorithm by comparing its results to manually digitised reference data, but also to concurrent Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data in the case of Lake Ladoga. In both cases, the comparison leads to. ranging from 0.84 to 0.97.

AB  - This paper aims to analyse the house-studio of Antonio Teixeira Lopes in formal and iconographic terms, linking it with the private and social life of the sculptor, and the architecture and worldview of Romanticism. Building on the characterisation of the house-studio as a refuge and a stage for the artist, its emergence is correlated with the entrance of art into the public sphere. The construction of Teixeira Loped house-studio is contextualized within the scope of his personal and professional journey and its spatial dynamics is examined. Finally, this paper also decodes the iconographic discourses present in the building. The coexistence between allusions to the artist's identity and the eclectic appropriation of artistic movements and ornaments susceptible of an initiatory or esoteric reading is interpreted in the light of the Portuguese 19th century.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to study the potential of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) for estimating wheat height using interferometry and polarimetry. Our contribution in this paper consists on a statistical relationship that we establish between field height measurement and backscattering coefficient, polarimetric parameters and interferometric coherence. For experimental validation, the height of wheat crops was determined through the different phenological stage for two types of wheat conducted irrigated and rainfed wheat. In the same period of field campaign, eight Radarsat-2 images and seven Sentinel-1images were acquired over the region of Sidi Bouzid in the center of Tunisia. From these images, temporal variation of backscattering coefficient, interferometric coherence and polarimetric parameters were extracted and compared to the height variation of wheat. The results showed a weak correlation between wheat height and backscattering coefficient. A high correlation between height of wheat and polarimetric parameters principally Radar vegetation index (RVI) and Pedestal height (r = 0.9 and r = 0.92 respectively) and an acceptable correlation between height and interferometric coherence (r = -0.6).

T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate generation of spatial soil water maps is useful for many types of irrigation management. A hybrid remote sensing evapotranspiration (ET) model combining reflectance-based basal crop coefficients (K-cbrf) and a two-source energy balance (TSEB) model was modified and validated for use in real-time irrigation management. We modeled spatial ET for maize and soybean fields in eastern Nebraska for the 2011-2013 growing seasons. We used Landsat 5, 7, and 8 imagery as remote sensing inputs. In the TSEB, we used the Priestly-Taylor (PT) approximation for canopy latent heat flux, as in the original model formulations. We also used the Penman-Monteith (PM) approximation for comparison. We compared energy balance fluxes and computed ET with measurements from three eddy covariance systems within the study area. Net radiation was underestimated by the model when data from a local weather station were used as input, with mean bias error (MBE) of -33.8 to -40.9 W m(-2). The measured incident solar radiation appeared to be biased low. The net radiation model performed more satisfactorily when data from the eddy covariance flux towers were input into the model, with MBE of 5.3 to 11.2 W m(-2). We removed bias in the daily energy balance ET using a dimensionless multiplier that ranged from 0.89 to 0.99. The bias-corrected TSEB ET, using weather data from a local weather station and with local ground data in thermal infrared imagery corrections, had MBE = 0.09 mm d(-1) (RMSE = 1.49 mm d(-1)) for PM and MBE = 0.04 mm d(-1) (RMSE = 1.18 mm d(-1)) for PT. The hybrid model used statistical interpolation to combine the two ET estimates. We computed weighting factors for statistical interpolation to be 0.37 to 0.50 for the PM method and 0.56 to 0.64 for the PT method. Provisions were added to the model, including a real-time crop coefficient methodology, which allowed seasonal crop coefficients to be computed with relatively few remote sensing images. This methodology performed well when compared to basal crop coefficients computed using a full season of input imagery. Water balance ET compared favorably with the eddy covariance data after incorporating the TSEB ET. For a validation dataset, the magnitude of MBE decreased from -0.86 mm d(-1) (RMSE = 1.37 mm d(-1)) for the Kcbrf alone to -0.45 mm d(-1) (RMSE = 0.98 mm d(-1)) and -0.39 mm d(-1) (RMSE = 0.95 mm d(-1)) with incorporation of the TSEB ET using the PM and PT methods, respectively. However, the magnitudes of MBE and RMSE were increased for a running average of daily computations in the full May-October periods. The hybrid model did not necessarily result in improved model performance. However, the water balance model is adaptable for real-time irrigation scheduling and may be combined with forecasted reference ET, although the low temporal frequency of satellite imagery is expected to be a challenge in real-time irrigation management.

TI  - Multi-band spectral matching inversion algorithm to derive water column properties in optically shallow waters: An optimization of parameterization
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Deriving inherent optical properties (IOPs) and other water quality parameters from satellite remote sensing data covering optically shallow environments has historically been problematic due to difficulties in separating the benthic signal from that of the water column. While recent advances have improved such retrievals, most methods have high uncertainties for very shallow (< 5 m) or very bright (e.g., carbonate sand) targets. Here, we present a two-stage process to improve IOP derivations from satellite-derived reflectance data, termed the Shallow Water Optimization with Resolved Depth (SWORD). Within this process, a raster bathymetry is first derived through multiple pixel-wise implementations of a spectral matching algorithm on mapped reflectance data. This bathymetry is then used as a fixed input in subsequent implementations of the algorithm, leading to improved IOP retrievals. The SWORD approach was developed and tested using a dataset of simulated reflectance spectra as well as MERIS reflectance data covering two optically shallow water environments. Bathymetries derived using this process showed strong agreement with those determined from soundings and coastal relief models. Although SWORD-derived raster albedo maps showed general concordance to benthic habitat surveys, we found limited benefit of fixing this parameter in spectral matching routines. IOP derivations from SWORD show expected spatiotemporal patterns in the Florida Keys region, consistent with local hydrodynamic processes, seasonal fluctuations, and known anomalous events. This approach is portable to multi spectral reflectance data from similar satellite instruments, allowing regular and ongoing assessment and monitoring of optical water quality for ecologically and economically important marine systems.

TI  - The Integration of knowledge about the Cantabrian Cordillera: towards an inter-regional observatory of global change.
T2  - ECOSISTEMAS
M3  - Review
AB  - The Cordillera Cantabrica (CC) presents a series of singularities that make this area an excellent place for monitoring the effects of global change. This study analyses the need to generate an interregional observatory of global change, which would integrate current knowledge about these mountains and help setting priorities in the generation of new knowledge. To achieve this goal, two complementary approaches are presented. The first is the review of the scientific literature published about the CC and its comparison with other mountain systems in the Iberian Peninsula. The second is the synthesis of information from a seminar entitled "The CC as a Sentinel of the Effects of Global Change" held in Santander in August 2015. The literature shows that the number of scientific publications about the CC is similar to other mountain systems in the Iberian Peninsula, but with a lower diversity of disciplines. Scientific production is dominated by the nearest research centres and has a large international participation. The conclusions of the seminar show that this system is an ideal candidate for monitoring the effects of global change on a multitude of biophysical elements. We consider that the generation of a permanent seminar, along with the consolidation of the actual monitoring networks, and the coordination of new studies and the improvement of communication between administrations and the scientific and technical communities are essential elements for the future generation of an observatory of global change in the CC.

AB  - This study proposed the exploitation of Sentinel-2 and Proba-V imagery to assess the heterogeneity in the surroundings of EC stations through the multitemporal analysis of NDVI. The observations by these platforms allow computation of NDVI at 10 m (Sentinel-2) and 100 m (Proba-V) spatial resolutions. Such levels of spatial detail allowed the comparison of pixel values within two relevant geographic extents: the footprint of EC stations and the extent of satellite imagery cells commonly used to force flux modelling. The satellite platforms considered for this study exhibit different but complementary strengths. Proba-V allowed fast processing over a large number of stations in order to screen or rank EC stations as function of the spatial heterogeneity. The fine spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 allowed more in-depth spatial analysis. Three methods were implemented to explore the spatial heterogeneity with Sentinel-2 NDVI: the analysis of simple NDVI histogram, spatial heterogeneity index (SHI) and fitting a semi-variogram. The analysis with Proba-V resulted in a ranking of flux tower stations on the basis of NDVI Interquartile Range.This study was conducted in the framework of a research programme aiming at improving estimates of net primary productivity across different biomes. The methods appeared to complement each other: histograms were simple to interpret and offered a clear view on the spread and shape of data (often bi-model in cropped sites); SHI plots enable the visualization of heterogeneity changes throughout a period of time and semi-variograms allow the analysis at different distances and orientations.

TI  - Trends of night-time hourly cloud-cover values over Manila Observatory: ground-based remote-sensing observations using a digital camera for 13 months
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Night-time cloud detection provides data sets of cloud-cover percentage. Although night-time cloud-cover data sets from satellite-based instruments are common, these data sets do not have relatively high temporal resolution. To quantify local temporal cloud-cover variability and to attain long-term cloud-cover measurements, ground-based instruments would be the appropriate apparatus. In this study, a digital camera is used to continuously gather images of the night sky at 5-min intervals over Manila Observatory (14.64 degrees N, 121.07 degrees E). For the first time in Manila, ground-based remote-sensing data gathered from October 2015 to October 2016 are analysed for hourly cloud cover. The results indicate that wet season has relatively higher cloud-cover values (median >40%) as compared to the dry season (median <40%). Moreover, cloud-cover values are observed to decrease during the night. For the wet season, August having the highest cloud-cover values has the highest value of change of hourly cloud-cover percentage (-0.82% h(-1)). For the dry season, February having the lowest cloud-cover values has the highest value of change of hourly cloud-cover percentage (-1.04% h(-1)).

T2  - EARTH OBSERVING SYSTEMS XXIII
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth Observing Systems XXIII
CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - The Landsat-9 Operational Land Imager 2 (OLI-2) instrument, currently under development for launch in late 2020, is a clone of the Landsat-8 OLI instrument, which was launched in 2013. Ball Aerospace built and rigorously characterized the Landsat-8 OLI and is repeating the process for the Landsat-9 OLI-2. A major difference between the testing for OLI and OLI-2 will be spectral test equipment. The instrument-level spectral test for OLI made use of a double monochromator; the OLI-2 test will use of Goddard Laser for the Absolute Measurement of Radiance (GLAMR).The GLAMR system is a set of lasers, which collectively cover the entire spectral range of the OLI-2 spectral bands.The laser outputs are fed to a 30 '' integrating sphere via fiber optic cables, which OLI-2 can view from its position inside the thermal vacuum chamber. The laser-based spectral characterization offers several major advantages over the monochromator-based methods: (1) higher signal levels as compared to the lamp in the double monochromator providing better signal to noise and capabilities to measure out of band response, (2) full aperture illumination and flood illumination of multiple focal plane modules so that all detectors are tested and crosstalk effects can be observed, as opposed to the approximately 60 detectors illuminated by the slit image of the monochromator (3) an absolute spectral response characterization as opposed to relative spectral response.OLI-2 spectral testing with GLAMR should begin in late 2018. This work describes the spectral-radiometric test plan, test requirements, and GLAMR performance demonstrated prior to OLI-2 characterization.

TI  - Sentinel-2A MSI and Landsat-8 OLI radiometric cross comparison over desert sites
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-2A and Landsat-8 satellites carry on-board moderate resolution multispectral imagers for the purpose of documenting the Earth's changing surface. Though they are independently built and managed, users will certainly take advantage of the opportunity to have higher temporal coverage by combining the datasets. Thus it is important for the radiometric and geometric calibration of the MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) and the Operational Land Imager (OLI) to be compatible. Cross-calibration of MSI to OLI has been accomplished using multiple techniques involving the use of pseu do-invariant calibration sites (PICS) using direct comparisons as well as through use of PICS models predicting top-of-atmosphere reflectance. A team from the University of Arizona is acquiring field data under both instruments for vicarious calibration of the sensors. This paper shows that the work done to date by the Landsat and Sentinel-2 calibration teams has resulted in stable radiometric calibration for each instrument and consistency to similar to 2.5% between the instruments for all the spectral bands that the instruments have in common.

AB  - Buildings can generally be represented as individual polygons until 1:100 000 in topographic maps. As scale decreases, the level of detail of the features is reduced with generalization to preserve the readability on map. In this context, shape analysis is important because it can be used in generalization operator and parameter selection, generalization quality evaluation as well as scale inference for VGI and remotely sensed data. Shape analysis of polygons are often carried out with various shape indices. A shape index usually measures a specific shape characteristic of a polygon. In this paper, it is aimed at investigating the response of different shape indices to the level of detail variation in building features depending on scale. For this purpose, five shape indices were used and evaluated for measuring shape complexity of individual building features at six different scales ranging from 1:1 000 to 1:100 000.

AB  - Image processing techniques (band rationing, color composite, Principal Component Analyses) are widely used by many researchers to describe various mines and minerals. The primary aim of this study is to use remote sensing data to identify iron deposits and gossan located in Kaman, Ku sair region in the central part of Anatolia, Turkey. Capability of image processing techniques is proved to be highly useful to detect iron and gossan zones. Landsat ETM+ was used to create remote sensing images with the purpose of enhancing iron and gossan detection by applying ArcMap image processing techniques. The methods used for mapping iron and gossan area are 3/1 band rationing, 3/5 : 1/3 : 5/7 color composite, third PC and PC4 : PC3 : PC2 as RGB which obtained result from Standard Principal Component Analysis and third PC which obtained result from Developed Selected Principal Component Analyses (Crosta Technique), respectively. Iron-rich or gossan zones were mapped through classification technique applied to obtained images. Iron and gossan content maps were designed as final products. These data were confirmed by field observations. It was observed that iron rich and gossan zones could be detected through remote sensing techniques to a great extent. This study shows that remote sensing techniques offer significant advantages to detect iron rich and gossan zones. It is necessary to confirm the iron deposites and gossan zones that have been detected for the time being through field observations.

TI  - Lie as a communication model and concepts of lying in the Serbian language and culture
T2  - ETNOANTROPOLOSKI PROBLEMI-ISSUES IN ETHNOLOGY AND ANTHROPOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A lie is a cultural and semiotic fact - as it exists only in the society where truthfulness is mandatory. Although lying has been negatively judged in various ethical and religious systems, under the certain circumstances, it has always been perceived even as ethical or at least permitted. In the contemporary society, together with various variants of truth, lying too has been relativised. We are witnesses, at present, of the change in the communication protocol; where lying has been permitted only in the sphere of arts and play, it begun to be permitted in the sphere of social reality. In fact, with the loss of concrete conceptions of reality and truth, blatant lies have become, according to reticent convention, permitted or have been mildly judged in the public or political discourse. The concepts of lying and the stance towards it in the Serbian language and culture have been changing with cultural and social changes. The original concept of lying in the Serbian language, as it has been the case in the majority of IE languages, was closely related to the concept of error and shortcoming as well as with a joke and shenanigans. In the conscience of general public, as it has been recorded in Serbian epic poetry and folk tales, lying has been labeled as something fantastic, a fiction, or jolly exuberance as well as witticism with positive connotations. The research has shown that in the Serbian culture lying has a negative attribute, usually given to an archenemy or representatives of other nations, or a representative of the ruling class, or even a woman that symbolically represents a potential danger in a society with patriarchal worldview. A harmless joking lie that is told in entertainment purposes is peculiar for the members of the 'own' community. This concept of a liar as 'someone else' could have roots in the Christian culture, where God is the guarantor of the truth while the archenemy (Devil) from within is the liar and the father of lies (Diablous mendax est et pater ejus.) The concept of lying in the contemporary era has been labeled as "powerful Other" and is most commonly related with the media pictures that create a parallel and deceitful reality because of the various interests of the powerful lobby or groups (politicians, corporations, banks etc.) that are the archenemy of the populous or a helpless individual. The omnipresence of lying, and weakening of the definition of truth, in the contemporary society, leads to a paradoxical situation where the concept of lying may not exist in the future because the necessary presumption of its existence is in fact the social and communicational obligation of telling the truth.

T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data study
AB  - Influenza surveillance is critical to monitoring the situation during epidemic seasons and predictive mathematic models may aid the early detection of epidemic patterns. The objective of this study was to design a real-time spatial predictive model of ILI (Influenza Like Illness) incidence rate in Catalonia using one- and two-week forecasts. The available data sources used to select explanatory variables to include in the model were the statutory reporting disease system and the sentinel surveillance system in Catalonia for influenza incidence rates, the official climate service in Catalonia for meteorological data, laboratory data and Google Flu Trend. Time series for every explanatory variable with data from the last 4 seasons (from 2010-2011 to 2013-2014) was created. A pilot test was conducted during the 2014-2015 season to select the explanatory variables to be included in the model and the type of model to be applied. During the 2015-2016 season a real-time model was applied weekly, obtaining the intensity level and predicted incidence rates with 95% confidence levels one and two weeks away for each health region. At the end of the season, the confidence interval success rate (CISR) and intensity level success rate (ILSR) were analysed. For the 2015-2016 season a CISR of 85.3% at one week and 87.1% at two weeks and an ILSR of 82.9% and 82% were observed, respectively. The model described is a useful tool although it is hard to evaluate due to uncertainty. The accuracy of prediction at one and two weeks was above 80% globally, but was lower during the peak epidemic period. In order to improve the predictive power, new explanatory variables should be included. Copyright: CC BY 4.0

TI  - The role of complexity studies in the emerging "processual" worldview
T2  - EMERGENCE-COMPLEXITY & ORGANIZATION
M3  - Article
AB  - As writers including Heinz Pagels to Lee Smolin have noted, a new scientific paradigm is emerging to take the place the linear model of Descartes and Newton. This paper explores Complexity Theory studies the patterns that emerge as phenomena evolve in the world suggested by that new paradigm. The co-authors refer to the new paradigm as "processual", because it depicts a world composed fundamentally of processes that flow through each other to create systemic causality, rather than the Newtonian image of a clock-like world of cause-and-effect. The paper relates how the co-authors used Complexity Theory to understand this emergent worldview as they wrote The Axial Ages of World History. In doing so, they discovered a way of understanding world history as extremely "thick" and multi-dimensional, less like a machine than an ecosystem. Complexity Theory, they conclude, stands as a gateway to such an understanding of disciplines from psychology to organizational development.

AB  - The present article considers the questions of semantic sphere of a person in youth in the context of professional and personal self-determination. The main emphasis is made on the study of the peculiarities of life-sense orientations of adolescent personality. Special attention is paid to the peculiarities of life-sense orientations of a person, their content and orientation at this stage of ontogenesis. The results of the empirical research of semantic sphere of personality are described. They are obtained with the usage of the technique "Value-based Orientation" by M. Rokich, the reflective self-report inventory "Who Am I?" by V. Muhina, the "Life-Sense Orientations" test by D. Leontiev, and statistical data processing. According to the results of the research, the author concludes that the formation of life-sense orientations of adolescent personality has its own specific features depending on a number of influencing factors. They are as follows: involvement in professional activity, presence or absence of a partner and composition of parental family. The value of the analysis of peculiarities of life-sense orientations of adolescent personality is determined by the dramatic impact of this age stage on the formation of value system and worldview. It enables creating an internal autonomous system of personal landmarks and content of value-semantic sphere of personality. Personality develops and shapes an individual orientation of life path interacting with moral values and spiritual and social foundations. (C) 2018 Published by Future Academy

AB  - Gamma or beta probes have been used for radioimmunoguided surgery and sentinel lymph node localization. Image-enabled small field of view cameras are usually preferred in these scenarios for a fast survey of an area of several or several tens square centimeters. Beta cameras can utilize the natural collimation of beta particles to achieve high sensitivity and spatial resolution as well as a compact size. In this work, we evaluate the basic imaging properties of a hand-held beta camera (2 cm x 2 cm x 1 cm size) in terms of sensitivity, uniformity, spatial resolution and detection between gamma photons and beta particles using a Cu-64 source. The preliminary results demonstrated satisfactory sensitivity, uniformity and millimeter resolution of the camera, particularly as it is close to the source. The camera is also much more sensitive to the beta particles (two orders of magnitude higher) than gamma photons from Cu-64. This study provides a benchmark quantification of the camera and further studies on murine tumor models will be used to further investigate its in vivo applications.

AB  - Introduction: the article analyzes the specifics of verbal visual means and techniques used in mythology and folklore of people of the North and Siberia to characterize the images intended for visual perception.Objective: to analyze the visual markers of mythological and folklore images within the boundaries of such dimensions as "large" and "small", "beautiful" and "ugly"; to reveal regularities of color symbolism of images.Research materials: the article is based on field materials collected by the author in expeditions of 1984-2015 years to the Koryaks, the Chukchi, the Chuvans, the Teleuts, the Ulch, as well as literary and archival sources.Results and novelty of the research: the article reveals the associations and symbols related to visualization of mythological and folklore images of different categories, such as the universe, other world, people, gods, spirits, objects of nature, large and small objects; considers the principles of visualization of the invisible things (diseases, human physiology, etc.); studies the specificity of the use of such concepts as size, beauty, color in mythology; shows how worldview and religious attitudes determined the principles of visualization of the images; pays attention to telling of dreams as the way of visualization of the images. The scientific novelty of the research lies in the comprehensive analysis of the principles and mechanisms of visualization of worldview, folklore and mythological images on the example of several peoples of Siberia and the Far North, taking into account the ethnic and cultural specificity of these peoples.

TI  - Remote Sensing Soils and Social Geographies of Difference: The Landscape Archaeology of Regur from Iron Age through Medieval Period Northern Karnataka, Southern India
T2  - JOURNAL OF FIELD ARCHAEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper combines analyses of Landsat 8 multispectral data with textual records and diachronic low-density artifact distributions to evaluate how soil differences were incorporated into cultural landscapes around the multicomponent site of Maski, southern India. Spatial analysis indicates that Iron Age (1200-300 b.c.) and Early Historic Period (300 b.c.-a.d. 500) inhabitants differentiated soil types and used more water-retentive, clay-rich soils (regur) for agriculture and sandier soils for locations of metals production. Similar distinctions between soil types are evident in Medieval Period (a.d. 500-1600) inscriptions, but artifact distributions indicate that some inhabitants used less desirable sandier soils for agriculture during the period. Taken together, the distribution, remote sensing, and inscriptional data suggest that social inequalities in access to more valued soils contributed to a socially differentiated landscape by at least the 14th century a.d. and point to the combined role of archaeology and remote sensing to complement and interrogate the historical record.

TI  - A new evidence-based risk stratification system for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma into low, intermediate, and high risk groups with implications for management
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Most primary cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas are cured with surgery. A subset, however, may develop local and nodal metastasis that may eventuate in disease-specific; death. This subset has been variably termed high risk. Herein, we review; an emerging body of data on the risks of these outcomes and propose an evidence-based; risk stratification for low-, intermediate-, and high-risk tumors that takes into; account both tumor and patient characteristics. Finally, we discuss a framework for; management of these tumors on the basis of data, when available, and our; recommendations when data are sparse.

AB  - Goal of the BigPicture project is to enhance satellite-based information with empirical in-situ ground-truthing. In this approach, the symptoms detected from remote sensing data are a mere starting point where additional data-like long-term time series, location of unusually growing areas, and weather conditions-get mixed in to ultimately obtain recommendations on soil treatments and applications of seeds, fertilizers and plant protection products.In this case study we present BigPicture as a practical, non-trivial application of the emerging datacube paradigm It shows a service-centric approach using a high-level standardized query language, the OGC Web Coverage Processing Service (WCPS), rather than low-level procedural programming approaches.

TI  - Infrared reflectance factor of various asphalts
T2  - REMOTE SENSING FOR AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS, AND HYDROLOGY XX
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing for Agriculture, Ecosystems, and Hydrology XX
CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - As streets occupy a growing proportion of our world, they possess great potential as reference for optical, atmospheric research. Moreover, the demand for infrared sensors which distinguish asphalt from other grounds increases due to automation in agriculture, and more generally the introduction of highly autonomous vehicles. Thus, it is favorable to investigate and especially understand the optical properties of asphalt in the near infrared (NIR). In our study, we investigate the infrared reflectance of more than 15 asphalt types with different measurement geometries. As a prerequisite, we analyze the dependence of the diffuse reflectance factor on the light spot size, in order to determine a minimum light spot size for any further optical study. By comparing the BRF (bidirectional reflectance factor) to a nearly-Lambertian Spectralon white standard, we show that asphalt is in general a good diffuse scatterer. While the absolute value of the near-infrared reflectance factor varies dependent on asphalt type and wear, its slope shows typically only slight variations; nevertheless, one asphalt differs significantly from the others. For a more detailed analysis, pieces of this and other asphalts were pulverized and pressed into pellets, suitable for broadband infrared spectroscopy. With this, we are able to identify a feature between 460 nm and 6300 nm, whose intensity determines the slope of the NIR response. Here, we discuss its dependence on the asphalt's ingredients, as well as the contribution of the grain size structure to the actual reflectance of real asphalt.

TI  - Impact of extended lymphadenectomy on morbidity and regional recurrence-free survival in melanoma patients
T2  - JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGICAL TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Introdurction: Current guidelines for malignant melanoma do not set a concrete cutoff limit for the number of lymph nodes to be resected during regional lymph node dissection (LND). Here, we investigate if extended LND (ext-LND) has an impact on surgical morbidity and oncological outcome in melanoma patients.Material and methods: A total of 245 melanoma patients receiving axillary or inguinal LND in curative intention were investigated retrospectively. Ext-LND was defined as axillary LND with 20 or more and inguinal LND with 10 or more resected lymph nodes. Surgical morbidity and regional recurrence-free survival were investigated.Results: Ext-LND did not lead to increased surgical morbidity in the overall study collective. After ext-LND, 55.4% of the patients experienced one of the investigated complications compared to 46.2% in the limited LND group (p=.2113). There was no difference in the occurrence of lymphatic fistula, wound infection, severe bleeding or neurological complications. In addition, patients with positive lymph node status showed improved regional recurrence-free survival following ext-LND (p=.0425).Conclusion: Ext-LND can be considered a quality marker of LND in melanoma patients.
