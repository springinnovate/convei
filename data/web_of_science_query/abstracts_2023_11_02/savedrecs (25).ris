TI  - The Role of Worldviews in Predicting Support for Recreational Cannabis
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We studied the role of worldviews in the endorsement of proposals for the legalisation of recreational cannabis. Drawing on literature on generalised belief structures, we developed categorical measures for five worldviews drawing on commonalities in the typologies reviewed (Orthodox, Localised, Reward, Pragmatist, and Survivor). We proceeded to study the relative influence of worldviews in support of a range of items concerned with the legalisation of recreational cannabis amongst a randomly generated sample (N = 1000) in Malta. Our findings demonstrate that the Orthodox worldview stands in contrast to all others in opposing the proposals and constitutes the resistance group to legalisation. On the other hand, no other worldview unilaterally supports the proposals albeit these are, on an individual basis, favourably perceived. Our study further demonstrates that proportions of variance accounted for by the worldview measures we adopted are comparable to those exercised by demographic variables demonstrating significance. We propose that the study of worldviews is critical in understanding social and political alliances that come together to support or oppose particular politicised projects or collective courses of action.

TI  - Evaluation of diverse-based precipitation data over the Amazon Region
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The skill of the diverse-based precipitation products is investigated in comparison with the observed-derived HYBAM and with GoAmazon and TRMM-LBA field campaigns data. The performance of eight remote sensing-based datasets (CHIRPS, MSWEP, TRMM, CMORPH, IMERG, PERSIANN-CDR, PERSIANN-CCS-CDR, and PERSIANN-CCS) is evaluated from 1998 to 2009 considering different timescales (diurnal, intraseasonal, and seasonal) for the Amazon Basin (AB). To compare the rainfall products, we applied cluster analysis, the Seasonality Index, the Kling-Gupta Efficiency metric, categorical indices, spectral analysis, and composing technique. Overall, the databases poorly represent the precipitation in the northwest of the AB (NWAB), a region with a lack of in situ measurements. CHIRPS underestimates NWAB precipitation at the seasonal scale, while at the intraseasonal timescale most databases do not adequately represent the precipitation anomalies in the NWAB, except for MSWEP. The PERSIANN-CCS-CDR product overestimates precipitation and extreme rainfall, while CMORPH overestimates the number of no rain events. At the diurnal timescale, most databases overestimate nighttime precipitation and underestimate it in the afternoon. Although there is no single database more suitable for the AB at all timescales, CHIRPS, MSWEP, and PERSIANN-CDR are the most accurate databases at seasonal timescale, while at the intraseasonal scale MSWEP would be the most appropriate. The estimates that combine reanalysis data, surface measurements, and infrared and microwave satellite data through more sophisticated techniques, such as artificial neural networks, can improve the representation of the rainfall in the AB, especially at the diurnal timescale.

TI  - A Study on the Cooling Capacities of Urban Parks and Their Interactions with the Surrounding Urban Patterns
T2  - APPLIED SPATIAL ANALYSIS AND POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the climatic interactions between parks and the urban pattern surrounding them were investigated by sampling from two urban parks which are located in the Kadikoy district of Istanbul. Parks are very close to each other but their surrounding areas are different from each other in terms of the building density and the urban pattern. The analyses were carried out by examining the relationships between surface temperatures, distances to the park, and zones. Surface temperature/park distance correlations were examined in different zones by the bivariate method at a 0.01 significance level, and it was observed that the parks displayed different correlations in different pattern types and again each pattern type exhibited different graphics in temperature/distance scatter plots. When the results were evaluated from a climatic perspective, it was seen that a street with trees was more effective than a park area that has a weak plantation. On the other hand, the results also showed that the building geometries can cause the formation of cool islands. So, the study revealed that street planting and urban design are as important as the landscape design of park areas in terms of the cooling of the city.

TI  - Hybrid Broadband Ground Motion Simulation for 2015 Mw 7.9 Nepal Earthquake
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTHQUAKE AND TSUNAMI
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aims at simulating broadband ground motions in the epicentral region of the 2015 Mw 7.9 Nepal event, using hybrid broadband technique. The spectral element method is used to simulate the low-frequency ground motion. The three-dimensional material property variation and the basin geometry at the Kathmandu basin are incorporated in the spectral element model. High frequency synthetics are simulated using scattering Green's function approach by consistently using the source and medium model of low frequency simulation. The simulated Low Frequency (LF) (0-0.3 Hz) results are combined with high-frequency scatterograms to generate broadband ground motions (0-10 Hz). The scattering parameters for broadband ground motion simulation are estimated from the recorded data of Nepal mainshock. These parameters are used further for simulating the ground motions over a grid of stations at 2 km x 2km spacing at the epicentral region. The simulated results are shown as peak ground acceleration (PGA), peak ground velocity, and spectral acceleration contours plots. The maximum PGA in the horizontal and vertical directions are 0.35 g and 0.32 g in the epicentral region. Also, the acceleration time histories and corresponding response spectra are presented for some of the selected cities in the region where no records are available. These simulated outcomes are used for analyzing the validity of Indian seismic codal provisions at the near-field of large Himalayan earthquakes. The results show the significant underestimation of near-field hazard by the codal provisions at the Himalayan region.

TI  - Different remote sensing indicators reveal the transitions of two states along elevation gradients within the Xinjiang Tianshan Bogda Natural World Heritage Site
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In mountainous regions, steppe degradation and desertification, which are transition processes between temperate deserts and montane steppes, are considerably affected by climate change and human disturbance. Consequently, the study of the transition ranges along the elevation gradient is particularly important for the protection, restoration, and sustainable development of natural heritage sites in arid areas. In this study, frequency analysis and the Akaike information criterion (AIC) were used to reveal the existence of two distinct potential states based on three remote sensing indicators (NDVI, normalized difference vegetation index; FVC, fractional vegetation cover; and LST, land surface temperature). The transition ranges of the two ecosystem states along altitudinal zonation were then quantitatively identified using potential energy analysis with a combination of multiple indicators. The results showed that the frequency distribution exhibited two conspicuous modes, the AIC exhibited a sharp decline from modes 1 to 2 and then remained stable with slight fluctuations from modes 2 to 5. Both features of the three indicators indicated the existence of two distinct potential states: temperate deserts and montane steppes. The two states and their transitions along the elevation gradient were detected using a potential analysis model for all three indicators. The results showed that the three indicators revealed the existence of two states, and the state with high NDVI/FVC values or low LST values began to show more attraction than the state with low NDVI/FVC values or high LST values at approximately an elevation of 1066 m. Temperate deserts below an elevation of 1060 m with montane steppes occurring above 1094 m, and two states coexisted between them. Furthermore, the distribution characteristics of local indicators of spatial association high-high, low-low, and not significant with elevation were analyzed, and the transition range (NDVI/FVC, 1040-1100 m; LST, 1040-1150 m) between different modes was consistent with those of the potential analysis, indicating the reliability of the results. This study successfully introduced the theory of multi-stable states and shifts between ecosystem states, and the potential energy analysis model into the study of natural altitudinal zones for mountainous natural world heritage sites, which will provide a scientific basis for the protection and restoration of steppe degradation in alpine regions.

TI  - Vegetation recovery rates provide insight into reburn severity in southwestern Oregon, USA
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Like much of western North America, The Klamath-Siskiyou Ecoregion of southwest Oregon and northern California is experiencing a departure from its historical fire regime, with greater proportions of high severity fire and less low to moderate severity fire compared to historical norms. Reburn events (i.e. when wildfires burn through areas that have recently burned) can exacerbate this departure when high reburn severity contributes to a conversion from mixed-conifer forests to an alternative stable state dominated by pyrogenic shrubs. Spatially explicit understanding of the predictors of reburn severity is necessary to identify areas where the risk of high reburn severity should be mitigated and areas where low to moderate severity fire can be encouraged to promote resilience to future wildfires. Previous research concerning drivers of reburn severity has considered the severity of the initial fire, topography, and fuel and weather conditions immediately preceding the reburning fire, but has not evaluated the potential effects of vegetation dynamics after a fire on reburn severity. We investigated whether remotely sensed rates of vegetation recovery following an initial fire, measured by change in Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) over 2, 5, and 10 years, are important predictors of reburn severity, once other known drivers of fire severity have been accounted for. Though a Random Forests analysis revealed that other variables (notably pre-reburn vegetation cover, average fire season PDSI, and initial fire severity) were more important predictors of reburn severity, vegetation recovery rates after an initial fire were found to be moderately important predictors of reburn severity, with comparable importance to fire weather variables and higher importance than some topographical variables. Short-term (2-year and 5-year) vegetation responses to wildfire representing either delayed mortality or elevated vegetation recovery were both associated with higher reburn severity, as were higher 10-year rates of annual vegetation accumulation. The results indicate that along with previously identified drivers of reburn severity, remotely sensed metrics of vegetation recovery relatively soon after a fire may provide important insight that can support post-fire management decisions and wildfire response planning for future reburn events.

TI  - Assessing Socioeconomic Risks of Climate Change on Tenant Farmers in Pakistan
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The study uses a transformative worldview to give voice to an economically marginalized group of tenant farmers vulnerable to climate changes due to their calamity prone geographical location. Drawing on anthropogenic global warming (AGW) theory lens, we examine the impact of manmade actions on climate change in District "Swat" and "Malakand" of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) province, Pakistan using a sequential mixed methods research design. Through this research design, the results of quantitative survey were complemented with a qualitative analysis of in-depth interviews. In first phase, we conducted a survey of 200 tenant farmers, followed by second wave of data collection involving 12 open-ended in-depth interviews (IDIs). The both qualitative and quantitative results suggest that farmers in both districts are affected by climate change although their crop yield had progressively increased signaling better coping and survival skills than other parts of country. Majority of respondents believed that climate change is something beyond their control in disagreement with AGW theory. Major economic losses were specifically, due to sudden alterations in weather patterns, such as floods, and hailstorms that reduce productivity as well as results in food waste with no avenues available to reclaim the energy laden in organic food waste. Besides, a productivity loss was attributed to outdated farming, lack of awareness regarding sharecropping and crop loan insurance practices. The study concludes that farmers are most vulnerable to climate change in socioeconomic terms as such changes impact their income sources; This inwardly compels cash strapped tenant farmers to delve in practice of informal credit with substantive risks attached which further deteriorates their livelihoods. The study offers understanding of how low-literate and economically marginalized indigenous tenant farmers cope to climate change and offers policy recommendations to advocate for the rights to earn sustainable livelihoods in the face of grand climate challenge.

TI  - Climate change influence on brook trout populations in the Central Appalachians
T2  - ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH
M3  - Article
AB  - Examining variation in fish populations over time is strengthened when climatic variations are understood and incorporated into analyses. We used a 18-year brook trout (Saivelinus fontinalis) data set with samples across a similar to 4800 km(2) spatial area in the Central Appalachian Mountains, combined with PRISM climate data at the HUC-12 subwatershed level to investigate temporal trends of each. We found significant increases in air temperature (p <.01) with no significant trends in precipitation across time, including no trends in changes in variation of temperature and precipitation also. Extreme rainfall events (# of days above 95% percentile for total daily precipitation in a year) and consecutive dry days (cumulative # of consecutive days with <3 mm precipitation in a year) were also examined arid produced no significantly changing trends over time. Using random forests, seasonal climate variables identified as changing over time explained 35.1% of the variability in young-of-the-year brook trout abundance over the 18-year monitoring period. The same procedure explained 25.1% of the variability in juvenile abundance and only 5.1% in adult abundance. Variable selection following random forest generation illustrated significant effects for winter and spring precipitation (both negative on young-of-the-year abundance. Spring degree days and spring precipitation both had significant negative effects on juvenile abundance. Random effects for stream and year explained a maximum of 27.7% and 10.8% of the variation in abundance across all models. A significant, positive interaction between spring degree days and precipitation was also identified, lending support to the important balance between temperature and flow in these systems that is critical to brook trout persistence. This work provides long-term evidence to help understand the dynamics of these sentinel headwater fish populations as they experience a changing climate.

TI  - Satellite, drone and video camera multi-platform monitoring of coastal erosion at an engineered pocket beach: A showcase for coastal management at Elmina Bay, Ghana (West Africa)
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Regular monitoring of coastal areas is a prerequisite to evade any imminent erosive disaster. However, data-driven decisions become more uncertain when a monitoring platform is unable to capture events of a certain frequency. Erosion along Ghana's coastline is endemic as in most of the Gulf of Guinea countries in West Africa. The current challenge is how to document and understand the dimensions of erosion despite limited human and logistical capacity. In the present study, shoreline change was assessed by an intensive multi-platform data collection strategy deployed for a year at Elmina Bay, Ghana through the use of drones, a shore-based camera, Sentinel satellite images and a dumpy level. The potential causes and areas of erosion at Elmina were clearly identified at a very fine scale by our sediment budget calculations. While a section of the beach in front of the Elmina Castle was adequately protected by the presence of jetties , downdrift of the larger unprotected portion of the beach was out of balance with high erosion rates. Furthermore, the results revealed that frequent, local video cameras and drones are more effective for operational monitoring of shoreline changes at all time scales. Satellite imagery is also a potential alternative tool, but its low temporal resolution, compared with video cameras, makes it unsuitable for detecting daily or event-based beach changes, and is of low accuracy for practitioners and management decisions.

TI  - Large-area high spatial resolution albedo retrievals from remote sensing for use in assessing the impact of wildfire soot deposition on high mountain snow and ice melt
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soot deposition from wildfires decreases snow and ice albedo and increases the absorption of shortwave radiation, which advances and accelerates melt. Soot deposition also induces algal growth, which further decreases snow and ice albedo. In recent years, increasingly severe and widespread wildfire activity has occurred in western Canada in association with climate change. In the summers of 2017 and 2018, westerly winds transported smoke from extensive record-breaking wildfires in British Columbia eastward to the Canadian Rockies, where substantial amounts of soot were deposited on high mountain glaciers, snowfields, and icefields. Several studies have addressed the problem of soot deposition on snow and ice, but the spatiotemporal resolution applied has not been compatible with studying mountain icefields that are extensive but contain substantial internal variability and have dynamical albedos. This study evaluates spatial patterns in the albedo decrease and net shortwave radiation (K*) increase caused by soot from intense wildfires in Western Canada deposited on the Columbia Icefield (151 km(2)), Canadian Rockies, during 2017 and 2018. Twelve Sentinel-2 images were used to generate high spatial resolution albedo retrievals during four summers (2017 to 2020) using a MODIS bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model, which was employed to model the snow and ice reflectance anisotropy. Remote sensing estimates were evaluated using site-measured albedo on the icefield's Athabasca Glacier tongue, resulting in a R-2, mean bias, and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.68, 0.019, and 0.026, respectively. The biggest inter-annual spatially averaged soot-induced albedo declines were of 0.148 and 0.050 (2018 to 2020) for southeast-facing glaciers and the snow plateau, respectively. The highest inter-annual spatially-averaged soot-induced shortwave radiative forcing was 203 W/m(2) for southeast-facing glaciers (2018 to 2020) and 106 W/m(2) for the snow plateau (2017 to 2020). These findings indicate that snow albedo responded rapidly to and recovered rapidly from soot deposition. However, ice albedo remained low the year after fire, and this was likely related to a bio-albedo feedback involving microorganisms. Snow and ice K* were highest during low albedo years, especially for south-facing glaciers. These large-scale effects accelerated melt of the Columbia Icefield. The findings highlight the importance of using large-area high spatial resolution albedo estimates to analyze the effect of wildfire soot deposition on snow and ice albedo and K* on icefields, which is not possible using other approaches.

TI  - California wildfire spread derived using VIIRS satellite observations and an object-based tracking system
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Changing wildfire regimes in the western US and other fire-prone regions pose considerable risks to human health and ecosystem function. However, our understanding of wildfire behavior is still limited by a lack of data products that systematically quantify fire spread, behavior and impacts. Here we develop a novel object-based system for tracking the progression of individual fires using 375 m Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite active fire detections. At each half-daily time step, fire pixels are clustered according to their spatial proximity, and are either appended to an existing active fire object or are assigned to a new object. This automatic system allows us to update the attributes of each fire event, delineate the fire perimeter, and identify the active fire front shortly after satellite data acquisition. Using this system, we mapped the history of California fires during 2012-2020. Our approach and data stream may be useful for calibration and evaluation of fire spread models, estimation of near-real-time wildfire emissions, and as means for prescribing initial conditions in fire forecast models.Measurement(s) Wildfire half-daily perimeters and attributes Technology Type(s) Remote sensing Sample Characteristic - Organism Wildfires Sample Characteristic - Environment Ecosystems Sample Characteristic - Location California

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The integration of geophysical and satellite-based monitoring techniques can yield new insights in land surface deformation (LSD) studies. In this study, we integrated the microgravity monitoring geophysical technique with Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) to reveal the possible sources of LSD changes. A microgravity survey was conducted over Al-Ain city for 1 year at one-month intervals, with time-lapse microgravity changes calculated based on the results. Over the same area of interest and time interval, InSAR analysis was performed using Sentinel-1 (C-band) data. The time-lapse microgravity changes for the whole studied period ranged from-36 to 365 mu Gal. The InSAR processing showed periodic land surface deformation over the area of interest varying with the season of the year. The InSAR technique detected land surface subsidence at the northeast and western parts of the study area (-7 mm/year and-8 mm/year, respectively) and land surface uplift in the central and southern parts of the study area (2 mm/year). The recorded subsidence may relate to water extraction in these areas. The integration of the two techniques showed a negative correlation, with coefficients of-0.43 and-0.39 for land surface subsidence and uplift, respectively. Furthermore, groundwater level drawdown zones were identified in the west and center of the study area. Overall, LSD is mainly stimulated by water volume exploitation in the Al-Ain region.

TI  - Quantification of landscape metrics effects on downscaled urban land surface temperature accuracy of satellite imagery
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Improving the spatial resolution of Land Surface Temperature (LST) obtained from satellite images is of great importance in various applications, especially in urban areas Aiming to bridge the gap in the research background, this study attempted to quantify the effect of landscape metrics on the accuracy of urban LST downscaling. The research data included a collection of satellite images from Landsat and Terra satellites and auxiliary data of nine European cities, namely Lisbon, Madrid, Bucharest, Vienna, Prague, Paris, Copenhagen, Stockholm, and Helsinki. In the first stage, surface biophysical, topographic, and thematic property maps affecting the spatial distribution of LST were prepared. Secondly, the effect of the endogenous (influence of intra-pixel properties) and exogenous (influence of landscape metrics) variables of each surface property on LST was evaluated in warm and cold seasonal conditions. Finally, the effect of landscape metrics on the accuracy of LST downscaling from 960 m to 30 m was quantified. The results showed that the mean absolute correlation coefficient (r) values between the endogenous (exogenous) effects of surface biophysical, topographic, and thematic properties and LST in the cold season were 0.25 (0.12), 0.19 (0.06), and 0.09 (0.04), respectively. For the warm season, these values were 0.55 (0.24), 0.11 (0.03), and 0.23 (0.09), respectively. The mean r (root-mean-square error (RMSE)) between the actual LST and downscaled LST (DLST) obtained by considering only the endogenous effects in the cold and warm seasons were 0.79 (0.66) and 0.87 (1.38 degrees C), respectively. Considering the simultaneous effect of endogenous and exogenous variables in LST downscaling, these values reached 0.83 (0.47) and 0.91 (0.99 degrees C), respectively. The greatest effect of landscape metrics on the accuracy of LST downscaling was associated with built-up lands. Accounting for landscape metrics in the downscaling process significantly increases the accuracy of downscaled LST. (C) 2022 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Incorporation of machine learning and deep neural network approaches into a remote sensing-integrated crop model for the simulation of rice growth
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Machine learning (ML) and deep neural network (DNN) techniques are promising tools. These can advance mathematical crop modelling methodologies that can integrate these schemes into a process-based crop model capable of reproducing or simulating crop growth. In this study, an innovative hybrid approach for estimating the leaf area index (LAI) of paddy rice using climate data was developed using ML and DNN regression methodologies. First, we investigated suitable ML regressors to explore the LAI estimation of rice based on the relationship between the LAI and three climate factors in two administrative rice-growing regions of South Korea. We found that of the 10 ML regressors explored, the random forest regressor was the most effective LAI estimator, and it even outperformed the DNN regressor, with model efficiencies of 0.88 in Cheorwon and 0.82 in Paju. In addition, we demonstrated that it would be feasible to simulate the LAI using climate factors based on the integration of the ML and DNN regressors in a process-based crop model. Therefore, we assume that the advancements presented in this study can enhance crop growth and productivity monitoring practices by incorporating a crop model with ML and DNN plans.

TI  - Extraction of snow melting duration and its spatiotemporal variations in the Tibetan Plateau based on MODIS product
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (TP) is one of the most sensitive areas to climate change, and its ecological environment changes directly or indirectly reflect the global climate change trend. The snow cover ratio (SCR) is one of the important indicators reflecting the climate and environmental changes on the TP. The daily remote sensing data of snow cover on the TP from 2003 to 2014 were used to study the spatiotemporal distribution of snow cover on the TP. This dataset is generated based on the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) product. The snowmelt days were extracted using the moving average method. The results have shown that the average snowmelt day on the TP starts on the 103rd day and ends on the 223rd day of a year, and the snowmelt duration has a downward trend. Snow is mainly distributed in the Nyainqentanglha Mountains, Karakoram Mountains and Himalayas. The SCR in summer has a downward trend, while in autumn has a rising trend. This shows that the difference in SCR during the year has enlarged, increasing the risk of snowmelt floods. The SCR is highly correlated with temperature, but weakly correlated with precipitation. Using long-term snow cover remote sensing data, the distribution of glacier coverage on the TP can be roughly extracted, of which the glacier area accounts for about 1.1% of the total area of the TP. This study provides an important reference for understanding the spatiotemporal changes of snow cover in the TP. (C) 2022 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

T2  - ADVANCES IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The normal methods for monitoring environmental pollution with image data have many false positives. Therefore, this study is proposing a single-valued neutrosophic set (SVNS) (a variant of NS)-based method as a decision-making model using intuitionistic fuzzy Hamacher generalized Shapley Choquet integral operators for feature extraction and automatic material classification in mining area using satellite data. The experimental results show that this decision-making model using intuitionistic fuzzy Hamacher generalized Shapley Choquet integral operators for feature extraction and automatic material classification can better predict the presence of four heavy metals, i.e., vanadium(V), iron (Fe), copper (Cu), and nickel (Ni) in the study area than other methods. For vanadium metal, the determination accuracies, namely, producer accuracy, user accuracy, overall accuracy, and Kappa were 94.5%, 94.1%, 93.88%, and 0.93%, respectively. It was found that the estimated results and the distribution trend of heavy metals are almost the same as in actual ground measurements.

TI  - Extraction of Long Time-Series Vegetation Indices from Combined Multisource Satellite Imagery
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Extracting vegetation cover information by combining multisource satellite images can improve the time scale of vegetation cover monitoring, realize encrypted observation in short period, and shorten the regional vegetation remote sensing monitoring cycle. The NDVI and RVI datasets from 2007-2019 were extracted using 9 phases of multisource satellite images (Landsat TM/OLI, Sentinel-2 MSI, and GF-1 PMS) covering Xiaxi, Sichuan. Three typical validation sites representing higher vegetation cover in mountains and no vegetation cover in water bodies in the region, respectively, were selected to extract NDVI and RVI at the corresponding locations. Linear regression and Spearman correlation coefficient (rho) analysis were used to verify the correlation between NDVI and RVI from multisource images. The results showed that the vegetation indices fluctuated smoothly in the time series within the validation sites, and the vegetation indices of multisource satellite images were good measures of long-term vegetation cover in the region; the vegetation indices of the same satellite images showed significant correlations (both R-2 and rho exceeded 0.8), and the vegetation indices of different satellite images (PSM and MSI, PSM and OLI) showed more significant correlations (both R-2 and rho exceeded 0.7); the smaller the difference between the original resolutions of satellite images, the more significant the correlation between the extracted NDVI and RVI.

TI  - Multidecadal Land Use Patterns and Land Surface Temperature Variation in Sri Lanka
T2  - APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural land conversion due to urbanization, industrialization, and many other factors is one of the significant concerns to food production. Therefore, analyzing the temporal and spatial variation of agricultural lands is an emerging topic in the research world. However, an agrarian country like Sri Lanka was given weaker attention to the temporal and spatial variation of the land use, including the agricultural lands. This study presents an extended analysis of temporal and spatial variation of land use patterns in Sri Lanka, specifically looking at the agricultural land conversion and land surface temperature (LST) change. Remote sensing techniques and geographic information system (GIS) were used for the presented work. The satellite images from three Landsat's were analyzed for 2000, 2010, and 2020 to identify the potential land use conversions. In addition, LSTs were extracted for the same period. Significant and continuous increases can be seen in the agricultural lands from 33.94% (of total area) in 2000 to 43.2% in 2020. In contrast, the forest areas showcase a relative decrease from 38.51% to 33.82% (of total area) during the analyzed period. In addition, the rate of conversion from agriculture to settlements is higher in the latter decade (2010-2020) compared to the earlier decade (2000-2010). Only general conclusions were drafted based on the LSTs results as they were not extracted in the same months of the year due to high cloud cover. Therefore, the results and conclusions of this study can be effectively used to improve the land use policies in Sri Lanka and lead to a sustainable land use culture.

TI  - Landscape characteristics effects on Diptera assemblages and their relation with seasonal variations in urban green patches
T2  - AUSTRAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The growth of cities results in the fragmentation of natural habitats, and the alteration of the remaining ones. The effects of landscape-level drivers on arthropod assemblages in urban green spaces remain poorly understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of landscape characteristics in Diptera assemblages of urban green patches and their relation with seasonality in a southern hemisphere temperate city. Flies were sampled in urban green patches in Cordoba city, Argentina, in summer and winter of the same year. Landscape metrics derived from Sentinel 2 images were calculated at two levels of spatial heterogeneity hierarchy, at increasing buffer areas. We used generalized linear models to analyse the effects of landscape characteristics on family abundance and richness. Landscape and seasonal effects on Diptera family composition were also assessed. Abundance, richness and composition of dipteran assemblages were associated with the contrasting conditions of summer and winter, urban landscape fragmentation and the aggregation of vegetation patches. In general, fly assemblages were favoured by the aggregation of vegetation patches. The response of dipterans to landscape characteristics differed between seasons. The effects of landscape characteristics on Diptera assemblages' composition were stronger in winter. We concluded that landscape characteristics appear to have a bigger effect when environmental conditions are less favourable for these organisms. Our study provides further understanding of the effects landscape level drivers have on arthropods in green urban patches. This is particularly relevant if we wish to maintain and manage biodiversity through landscape planning.

T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to identify urban forms that are prone to heat storage in the Tokyo Prefecture in Japan. First, local climate zones (LCZ) were identified with 100 m pixel resolution using Landsat 8 data. LCZs include urban forms that are predominantly defined by building compactness and height. The spatial distribution of urban heat island intensity was obtained using LCZs and MODIS 100 m resolution land surface temperatures from 2013 to 2021. The difference between diurnal and nocturnal heat island intensity (delta UHI) was evaluated as an indicator of the relative heat storage effect between the LCZs. Lower delta UHIs suggest increased relative heat-storage capacities. Seasonal average delta UHIs for compact and super high-rise, high-rise, mid-rise, and low-rise LCZs were 3.1 ?, 4.1 ?, 5.8 ?, and 8.3 ?, respectively. Additionally, & UDelta;UHIs for open and super high-rise, high-rise, and mid-rise LCZs were 5.8 & DEG;C, 6.4 ?, and 7.8 ?, respectively. Slope data also validated the LCZ height. LCZ and slope analyzes found lower delta UHI magnitudes in all LCZs with high-rise buildings. Also, compact LCZs had lower & UDelta;UHI magnitudes than open LCZs at corresponding heights. Therefore, higher-rise and compact LCZs are suggested to have larger relative heat storage effects than lower-rise and open LCZs.

TI  - Remote sensing inversion of soil organic matter by using the subregion method at the field scale
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - To improve the accuracy of remote sensing inversion modeling of soil organic matter (SOM) at the field scale, this study selected a 41.3 ha (hm(2)) field in the black soil region of northeastern China as the study area. The spatial differences of soil physical and chemical properties, reflection spectra and topographic factors, as well as the relationship between spectral index, topographic factor and SOM were analyzed. Multiscale segmentation and hierarchical clustering were also conducted based on measured SOM samples, bare-soil Sentinel-2A images and 4-m-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) data. Then, the stepwise regression SOM prediction models were constructed for the entire study area and its subregions. The results led to the following conclusions: (1) SOM presents significant spatial heterogeneity in the study area; (2) the SOM prediction accuracy of single model for the entire study area was low (R-2 = 0.16, RMSE.cal = 1.61, and RMSE.val = 1.45); and (3) entire study area can be divided into four subregions, i.e., the "sedimentary area," "deposition-buffer area," "erosion-buffer area" and "erosion area," the SOM prediction model was established for each subregion according to its SOM content and spectral as well as topographic characteristics, and SOM prediction accuracy for the entire study area clearly improved (R-2 = 0.58, RMSE.cal = 1.17, and RMSE.val = 1.30). In this study, prediction models employing the subregion method were established and represent a new approach for SOM inversion research in the future. The results can be used as a reference for the study of SOM inversions of farmland blocks in the black soil region of northeastern China and provide theoretical and technical support for soil carbon pool estimations and precision fertilization.

TI  - The protective effect of green space on heat-related respiratory hospitalization among children under 5 years of age in Hanoi, Vietnam
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Combined effects of global warming and rapid urbanization replace green spaces with urban facilities. Children in urban areas are at a higher risk of heat-related adverse health effects. Our study aimed to examine the protective effect of urban green space on heat-related respiratory hospitalization among children under 5 years of age in Hanoi, the capital city of Vietnam. We estimated district-specific meteorological conditions from 2010 to 2014 by using a dynamic downscaling approach with a fine-resolution numerical climate model. The green space in each district was calculated using satellite data. The attributable fraction of heat-related respiratory hospitalization was estimated using a two-stage model, including a distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) coupled with multivariate meta-analysis. The association between heat-related respiratory hospitalization and green spaces at the district level was explored using a linear regression model. The central districts were more crowded and hotter, with less green spaces than the outer districts. At temperatures >34 degrees C (extreme heat threshold), the hospitalizations in the central districts increased significantly; however, in the outer districts, the hospitalization rate was insignificant. On average, extreme heat attributed 0.33% to citywide hospitalization, 0.35% in the center, and 0.32% in the outer region. Every 1% increase in the green space fraction will reduce heat-related respiratory hospitalization risk by 3.8%. Heat significantly increased the risk of respiratory hospitalization among children under 5 years in Hanoi, Vietnam. These findings are valuable for authorities to consider strategies to protect children's health against the effects of heat, including increasing green space.

TI  - Coastline detection using optical and synthetic aperture radar images
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Constant temporal and spatial monitoring of the coastline is essential for environmental protection. Waterlines were extracted from multi-source satellite remote sensing images, e.g., Landsat8, MODIS, HY-1C, and GF-3 SAR. A semi-automatic methodology of threshold segmentation was proposed to detect coastline based on local blocks of images, which is suitable for both optical and microwave remote sensing images and threshold scaling standards across different coastline types. The accuracy assessment of artificial, sandy, and muddy coastlines for each dataset was highly dependent on spatial resolution, and the result was GF-3 SAR. < Landsat8 < HY1C < MODIS for RMSE and STD, and Landsat8 > HY-1C > MODIS > GF-3 SAR for accuracy within 1 pixel. For the angle of imaging effects of them, GF-3 SAR was inferior to other datasets on muddy coastline. The extraction effect of HY-1C was more closely correlated to the tide and its imaging effect of muddy coastline was the best among all datasets we selected. This work fused HY-1C images, which might have omitted some coastline information due to cloud interference, with GF-3 SAR images recorded over the same time period. The result showed that the fusion of optical and microwave remote sensing is effective and allows for better monitoring of the coastline.(c) 2022 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V.

T2  - COUNSELLING & PSYCHOTHERAPY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Therapy process research focuses on understanding how therapy is conducted by professionals in the field. It is a nascent field of psychotherapy enquiry in India. This paper explores how novice therapists in India perceive their clients, and how this influences the process of therapy. In depth interviews were conducted with ten novice therapists, with less than sixyears of practice experience, from Mumbai, India. The data was thematically analysed. The data revealed that therapists' perceptions of their clients were defined by socio-demographic features of age and gender, along with presenting complaints and personal attributes. Participants had defined beliefs about good clients as contrasted with difficult ones. Distinct preferences for particular client types were identified. The antecedents to these beliefs were attributed to the therapist's worldview, their training and the supervision received. These views, and the conceptualisation of the client, influenced the choice of client, the process of therapy and how they proceeded with sessions, and their methods of referral. The data from the study has implications for therapist training, supervision and further research.

TI  - Burn severity in <i>Araucaria araucana</i> forests of northern Patagonia: tree mortality scales up to burn severity at plot scale, mediated by topography and climatic context
T2  - PLANT ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is forcing shifts in wildfire regimes, altering post-fire processes, and threatening the persistence of species and ecosystems. Key to assessing the potential for post-fire conversion to an alternate vegetation type is understanding drivers of burn severity, which in turn influence the material legacies that determine post-fire recovery. In Andean Patagonia, pyrophytic (fire promoting) shrublands juxtaposed with pyrophobic (fire inhibiting) forests of fire-sensitive species are well documented as drivers of fire spread and burn severity. However, the capacity of the highly fire- resistant Araucaria araucana to either promote or dampen burn severity has not previously been examined. This study uses field and remotely sensed data to examine which variables control burn severity at tree-, plot- and fire event-scales in large fires that burned A. araucana-dominated vegetation in four large fire events from 1987 to 2014. Logistic models were developed for each of the three scales to test for the factors influencing burn severity. Our results show that at the level of the individual tree, crown connectivity, tree size, and species strongly affect probability of death of individual trees. At a plot level, stand stocking parameters are less strongly predictive of burn severity. At a landscape-scale, vegetation type and topography, along with climatic and weather conditions are strong drivers of burn severity. These findings quantify the importance of greater tree size in the survival of the fire-resistant A. araucana and reinforce the regional pattern of greater fire severity being associated with tall shrubland vegetation in comparison to forests.

TI  - Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma, Solid-Basaloid Subtype of the Breast: A Case Report
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGICAL PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a rare tumor of adenoid cystic carcinoma, solid-basaloid subtype of the breast. Solid-basaloid adenoid cystic carcinoma may have a worse prognosis than classical adenoid cystic carcinoma. A 70-year-old woman presented with a mass in her left breast. Malignancy was suspected on imaging and confirmed via core needle biopsy. Left breast partial mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy were performed. Histologically, the tumor was composed of basaloid cells with hyperchromatic nuclei and frequent mitotic figures, as are small-cell neuroendocrine carcinomas. Immunohistochemical analysis of the tumor cells showed high expression of KIT and CD10 and focal expression of keratin 7. Synaptophysin, chromogranin A, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 were not expressed. This patient should be followed up carefully for distant metastases and recurrences.

TI  - Mapping riverbed sediment size from Sentinel-2 satellite data
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
AB  - A comprehensive understanding of river dynamics requires the grain size distribution of bed sediments and its variation across different temporal and spatial scales. Several techniques are already available for grain size assessment based on field and remotely sensed data. However, the existing methods are only applicable on small spatial scales and on short time scales. Thus, the operational measurement of grain size distribution of riverbed sediments at the catchment scale remains an open problem. A solution could be the use of satellite images as the main imaging platform. However, this would entail retrieving information at sub-pixel scales.In this study, we propose a new approach to retrieve sub-pixel scale grain size class information from Copernicus Sentinel-2 imagery building upon a new image-based grain size mapping procedure. Three Italian gravel-bed rivers featuring different morphologies were selected for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) acquisitions, field surveys and laboratory analysis meant to serve as ground truth grain size data, ranging from medium sand to coarse gravel. Grain size maps on the river bars were generated in each study site by exploiting image texture measurements, upscaled and co-registered with Sentinel-2 data resolution.Relationships between the grain sizes measured and the reflectance values in Sentinel-2 imagery were analysed using a machine learning framework. Results show statistically significant predictive models (MAE of +/- 8.34 mm and R-2 = 0.92). The trained model was applied on 300 km of the Po River in Italy and allowed us to identify the gravel-sand transition occurring along this river length.Therefore, the approach presented here-based on freely available satellite data calibrated by low-cost drone-derived imagery-represents a promising step towards an automated surface mean grain size mapping over long river length, easily repeated through time for monitoring purposes.

TI  - What plant-pollinator network structure tells us about the mechanisms underlying the bidirectional biodiversity productivity relationship?
T2  - BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Biodiversity - Ecosystem Functioning (B-EF) relationship remains a topic of ongoing debate with most studies focusing on primary productivity, and documenting that this relationship takes many forms. It remains unclear if biodiversity drives productivity or productivity shapes biodiversity or the relationship is bidirectional. B-EF studies explore almost exclusively the relationship between species richness and ecosystem functioning, while the role of biotic interactions, a key component of ecosystem functioning, has been neglected. Here, using data of 80 local plant-pollinator networks on 20 Aegean islands, and of gross primary productivity (GPP) from the MODIS satellite, we explored the bidirectional relationship between interaction network structure (nestedness and specialization), species richness (plants and pollinators) and mean and inter-annual variability of GPP. We found that nestedness and specialisation of plant-pollinator networks is driven by mean GPP. However, specialisation alone was a significant predictor of mean GPP, implying that networks tend to be more specialised in low-productivity areas. Pollinator species richness exerted a strong effect on mean GPP with the remaining factors playing a minor role, while the effect of mean GPP on pollinator species richness was weaker. Furthermore, the nestedness of plant-pollinator networks drives inter-annual variability of GPP with more nested networks displaying less variability, which is in accordance with the predictions of the insurance hypothesis. Plant and pollinator species richness were also associated with inter-annual variability of GPP. (C) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH on behalf of Gesellschaft fur Okologie.

TI  - Senescence in temperate broadleaf trees exhibits species-specific dependence on photoperiod versus thermal forcing
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Incomplete understanding of the processes controlling senescence limits our ability to forecast how the timing of leaf senescence will change in coming decades. In this study, we use a hierarchical Bayesian model (HBM) in association with a 27+ year record of field observations for 12 temperate deciduous tree species collected at Harvard Forest in central Massachusetts to examine how variability in bioclimatic controls affects the timing of leaf senescence. To test how general and extensible our results are over a broader biogeographic range, we used a multi-year record of land surface phenology derived from remote sensing encompassing all forested lands in New England. Results from the HBM showed that while air temperature is an important factor that influences the timing of leaf senescence, photoperiod uniformly exerts the strongest control across all 12 species. Species exhibiting the strongest dependence on photoperiod, particularly Acer species, showed low inter-annual variation and no long-term trends in the timing of leaf senescence. In contrast, species with greater dependence on air temperature, particularly Quercus species, showed statistically significant trends toward later senescence dates in response to long-term warming. Results from analyses conducted at regional scale across all of New England using data derived from remote sensing corroborated results obtained at Harvard Forest. Specifically, relative to ecoregions dominated by Quercus species, the timing of leaf senescence in ecoregions dominated by Acer species exhibited lower interannual variability and lower correlation with year-to-year variation in pre-senescence period mean air temperatures. These results suggest that forecasting how the timing of leaf senescence in temperate forests will change in the future requires species-specific understanding of how bioclimatic forcing controls the timing of leaf senescence.

TI  - A second-order attention network for glacial lake segmentation from remotely sensed imagery
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is increasing the risk of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) in many of the world's most vulnerable and high mountain regions. Simultaneously, remote sensing technologies now facilitate continuous monitoring of glacial lake evolution around the globe, although accurate and reliable automated glacial lake mapping from satellite data remains challenging. In this study, a Second-order Attention Network (SoAN) is devised for the automated segmentation of lakes from satellite imagery. In particular, a novel Second-order Attention Module (SoAM) is proposed to capture the long-range spatial dependencies and establish channel attention derived from the covariance representations of local features. Furthermore, as the dimensions of the input and output tensors are identical and it simply relies on matrix calculations, the proposed SoAM can be embedded into different positions of a given architecture while maintaining similar reference speed. The designed network is implemented on Landsat-8 imagery and outputs are compared against representative deep learning models, demonstrating improved results with a Dice of 81.02% and a F2 Score of 85.17%.

TI  - The Gaia-ESO survey: constraining evolutionary models and ages for young low mass stars with measurements of lithium depletion and rotation
T2  - MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - A growing disquiet has emerged in recent years that standard stellar models are at odds with observations of the colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) and lithium depletion patterns of pre-main sequence stars in clusters. In this work we select 1246 high probability K/M-type constituent members of five young open clusters (5-125 Myr) in the Gaia-ESO Survey to test a series of models that use standard input physics and others that incorporate surface magnetic fields or cool starspots. We find that: standard models provide systematically under-luminous isochrones for low-mass stars in the CMD and fail to predict Li-depletion of the right strength at the right colour; magnetic models provide better CMD fits with isochrones that are similar to 1.5-2 times older, and provide better matches to Li depletion patterns. We investigate how rotation periods, most of which are determined here for the first time from 'Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite data, correlate with CMD position and Li. Among the K-stars in the older clusters we find the brightest and least Li-depleted are the fastest rotators, demonstrating the classic 'Li-rotation connection' for the first time at similar to 35 Myr in NGC 2547, and finding some evidence that it exists in the early M-stars of NGC 2264 at < 10 Myr. However, the wide dispersion in Li depletion observed in fully convective M-dwarfs in the gamma Vel cluster at similar to 20 Myr appears not to be correlated with rotation and is challenging to explain without a very large (> 10 Myr) age spread.

TI  - Inhibitors to Christianity According to Atheist and Nonreligious Chinese Graduate Students Attending a Christian University in the United States: A Grounded Theory Study
T2  - CHRISTIAN HIGHER EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This grounded theory research investigated the experiences of 25 Chinese graduate students attending a Christian university in the United States, most of whom self-identified as atheist or nonreligious upon entry. Interview and questionnaire data identified that 23 of 25 participants experienced an overall increased openness to Christianity during their graduate studies; two students' worldview remained approximately the same. However, in that process of worldview change, all participants experienced competing influences that affected their perceptions of Christianity-some influences increased their openness to Christianity and some influences inhibited their openness to Christianity. To restate: Whereas my first article published in this journal focused on influences that increased openness to Christianity, this sequel article focuses solely on the influences participants described as having decreased (or inhibited) their openness to Christianity in theoretical-curricular and relational-cultural dimensions. These 10 inhibitors include (a) Participants' Surprise at Discovering They Were Attending a Christian University; (b) Modern Chinese Education's Naturalist Training; (c) Nonsystematic Presentations of Christianity; (d) Religious Pragmatism and Relativity; (e) China's Climate of Pressure and Corruption; (f) Chinese Communist Party Membership, Affiliation, or Influence; (g) Pushy Chinese-Speaking Church Movements; (h) Cynicism of "Fake" Conversion; (i) Mockery From Peers; and (j) Perceived Hypocrisy of Christians. The article concludes with Implications for Practice for Christian university administrators and faculty working at institutions that enroll Chinese students as well as student life organizations and other personnel seeking to serve the Chinese university student population.

TI  - Western South Atlantic Climate Experiment (WeSACEx): extreme winds and waves over the Southeastern Brazilian sedimentary basins
T2  - CLIMATE DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Extreme near-surface winds and ocean waves affect several activities over coastal and oceanic regions, such as offshore oil and gas industry, management of port operations, installation of renewable energy systems, and navigation. Our objective is to evaluate the ability of reanalysis/satellite data to reproduce local features of wind speed at 10 m height and significant wave height (SWH), and to assess the climatology (mean and extreme) of regional downscalings using WRF and RegCM4 for the atmosphere and WW3 for the ocean waves over the western South Atlantic. For the present climate, WRF and RegCM4 are forced by two CMIP5 global climate models (HadGEM2-ES and MPI-ESM-MR) and reanalysis, while WW3 is forced by the winds from the downscalings. We found that: (i) CCMP and WAVERYS have a more realistic representation of, respectively, the wind speed and SWH observed by buoys and platforms over the southeastern Brazilian basins; (ii) near the southeastern coast of Brazil, austral spring and winter have the more intense wind and wave extremes; (iii) RegCM4 and WRF present opposite biases over the southwestern South Atlantic, i.e., RegCM4 (WRF) overestimates (underestimates) the wind speed extremes, except for the region of Santos basin where both overestimate the extremes in austral summer and spring; and (iv) the SWH is closer to reanalysis when WW3 is forced by winds from WRF. This first assessment of the mean and extreme winds and oceanic waves from regional climate downscaling provides confidence and knowledge for further investigation on climate projections over the region.

TI  - Hitler's National Socialist Democracy Concept 1919-1933
T2  - POLITICS RELIGION & IDEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A conceptual study of Hitler's development of the National Socialist democracy concept between 1919 and 1933 is presented. Despite the voluminous literature on Hitler and Nazism, our knowledge of the NS democracy concept is seriously incomplete. This article makes a substantial historiographical contribution by providing a more profound understanding of Hitler's NS democracy concept and his position in the broader Weimar debate on democracy. I argue that Hitler prioritized democracy as a core concept in NS ideology. Between 1920 and 1925, Hitler employed a Germanic democracy concept centred on a popularly elected Fuhrer modelled in the reversed mirror image of his Jewish democracy concept. The allegedly Jewish interpretation of democracy was, according to Hitler's conspiracy theory, a precursor for the Jews to achieve a global dictatorship. Between 1925 and 1933 Hitler resettled for an anti-plebiscitary Volksherrschaft concept, abandoning his Germanic democracy, the election of the Fuhrer, and elections per se. This new concept rested on a notion of a Volkswille, which purportedly accommodated a genuine will of the people that could not be expressed in plebiscites and was identical with Hitler's worldview. I contend that Hitler's changeover from Germanic democracy to Volksherrschaft contributed to a totalitarian turn in NS ideology.

TI  - How many gigabytes per hectare are available in the digital agriculture era? A digitization footprint estimation
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The applications of digital agriculture technologies are increasing rapidly with increased interest from the new generation of farmers to use digital solutions. Such technologies include several in-field and remote sensors besides data processing software packages. The accumulation of archived data from season to season has become an issue considering the high spatial and temporal resolution of the generated data from the commercially available sensors. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate and quantify the accumulated data considering the evolution of utilized digital solutions from a farmer's case study. This study estimated the data storage disc space requirements in the last two decades from a 22 ha field located in North Italy. The farmer's accumulated data sources were from an in-field weather station, soil analysis information, soil apparent electrical conductivity scanning, soil moisture sensor, planter performance monitoring system, yield maps, Sentinel-2 satellite images, and recently drone images. The accumulated data were reported on an annual basis with respect to each year's specific contribution. The results showed that the total accumulated data size from the study field reached 18.6 GB in 2020 mainly due to the use of drone images with a predicted total data size of 40.5 GB by 2025.

TI  - High-resolution <i>in situ</i> thermal metrics coupled with acute heat stress experiments reveal differential coral bleaching susceptibility
T2  - CORAL REEFS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The relationship between thermal stress and coral bleaching has been a topic of study for decades, yet there is still a mismatch between remotely sensed bleaching predictors and population-specific bleaching responses. Recent studies have linked greater amounts of thermal variability to coral bleaching resistance over small spatial scales, yet in some sites, this variability appears to push corals beyond their thermal limits. Here, we performed a 12-month reciprocal transplant and acute heat stress experiments in populations of Porites lobata from an American Samoan backreef: the Highly Variable (HV), the Moderately Variable, and the Less Variable pools of Ofu to investigate how natural and experimental stress across different thermal environments related to coral bleaching responses during the 2016-2017 thermal anomaly. We also compared various sea surface satellite versus in situ temperature data to determine which metrics were most aligned with observed bleaching responses. We found similar to 0.6 degrees C higher maximum monthly means for in situ versus remotely sensed data, which resulted in fewer degree heating weeks. Although greater thermal variability and heat loading did not have a strong relationship with the onset of natural bleaching responses, acute heat stress revealed differences in sublethal stress responses that aligned with in situ thermal metrics. We suggest greater thermal spikes and heat loading in the HV pool, detected only in the high-resolution in situ data, best explain the decreased thermal performance seen in HV corals; demonstrating the utility of in situ data (both environmental and experimental) for understanding bleaching responses at population-specific spatial scales (< 5 km).

T2  - Zhonghua yi shi za zhi (Beijing, China : 1980)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Paracelsus, the first person in the history of modern Western medicine, specified to break the shackles of the traditional medical system thoroughly and revolutionise the classical medical system completely. He introduced traditional alchemy into medicine, and changed it from making gold into producing drugs which were helpful to human health. He believed that nature and human were made by God with "three principles" - sulphur, salt and hydrargyrum. He also believed that human body, as a "chemical system", was full of a variety of chemical reactions. His ideas brought a new worldview, a chemical one, to the medical field influenced by the concept of"Humorism" for ages. The chemical worldview laid the foundation for "iatrochemistry" and channelled a path for the following medical development. The "three principles" of Paracelsus did not surpass the "Humorism" proposed by Galen in terms of underlining the balance of human health. However, the idea, that the mineral substances in nature in the "three principles" could be taken as medicines to help the recovery of human body, broke through the traditional medical system proposed by Galen, offered valuable ideological resources and experience for the following expansion and development of medicines.
AB  - 帕拉塞尔苏斯是近代西方医学史上，第一位明确提出要彻底打破传统盖伦医学体系的桎梏，完成对古典医学体系革命的人物。他将传统的炼金术引入医学，并将炼金术的由制取黄金改为制造能够给人带来健康的药品；认为上帝用硫磺、盐和水银这三要素创造了自然和人，人体就是一个不断发生着各种化学反应的化学系统。这为长期处在四体液思想下的医学带来了新的世界观化学世界观。化学世界观的提出，不仅为 医疗化学奠定了基础，也为后来医学发展开辟出了新的世界。虽然帕拉塞尔苏斯的三要素论（three principles） 并没有在强调人体健康平衡这一点上完全超越盖伦的四体液学说，但三要素论中包含了自然中矿物质也可作为药物帮助人体恢复健康平衡这一观点却极大地突破了传统盖伦医学的医药思想体系，为后世药物的扩充和发展提供了宝贵的思想资源和经验借鉴。.

TI  - Remote sensing prediction and characteristic analysis of cultivated land salinization in different seasons and multiple soil layers in the coastal area
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization is the main threat to agricultural development. The ecological environment in the coastal plain is fragile and complex, and it is urgent to realize remote sensing monitoring of cultivated land salinization. This paper took the Kenli District in the Yellow River Delta as the study area, and measured the soil salinity content in four seasons: spring, summer, autumn, and winter, and four layers: surface layer (0-15 cm), superficial layer (15-30 cm), middle layer (30-45 cm), and deep layer (45-60 cm). The vegetation index and salinity index were extracted from Landsat images, and surface salinity inversion models in different seasons were constructed by a random forest algorithm. Then, the conversion model was constructed to achieve salinity prediction in multiple soil layers by simulating the salinity variation relationship, and the variation characteristics of soil salinization were analyzed. The results showed that: (1) Both vegetation and salinity indices are significantly correlated with surface salinity in different seasons, with R2 > 0.694 and RMSE < 3.358. (2) Salinity conversion models are quadratic or cubic, with R2 > 0.621 and RMSE < 5.281, showing strong universality. (3) The underground salinity prediction method based on the conversion model is superior to direct remote sensing modeling, R2 and RMSE can be improved by 0.110 and 0.411, respectively. The prediction effect in autumn and deep layer is relatively poor. But the prediction and interpolation results of salinity grades have similar spatial distribution, and the area error is generally < 6.84%. (4) The cultivated land salinization is the weakest in summer. From surface layer to deep layer, soil salinity increases continuously. The soil salinization of low-grade land is serious, restricting the development of cultivated land quality. This study proposes a remote sensing prediction method for cultivated land salinization in different seasons and multiple soil layers in the coastal plain, which can provide decision support for dynamic monitoring of land salinization and sustainable utilization of land resources.

TI  - Tracking the Cracking: A Holistic Analysis of Rapid Ice Shelf Fracture Using Seismology, Geodesy, and Satellite Imagery on the Pine Island Glacier Ice Shelf, West Antarctica
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ice shelves regulate the stability of marine ice sheets. We track fractures on Pine Island Glacier, a quickly accelerating glacier in West Antarctica that contributes more to sea level rise than any other glacier. Using an on-ice seismic network deployed from 2012 to 2014, we catalog icequakes that dominantly consist of flexural gravity waves. Icequakes occur near the rift tip and in two distinct areas of the shear margin, and TerraSAR-X imagery shows significant fracture in each source region. Rift-tip icequakes increase with ice speed, linking rift fracture to glaciological stresses and/or localized thinning. Using a simple flexural gravity wave model, we deconvolve wave propagation effects to estimate icequake source durations of 19.5-50.0 s and transient loads of 3.8-14.0 kPa corresponding to 4.3-15.9 m of crevasse growth per icequake. These long-source durations suggest that water flow may limit the rate of crevasse opening.

TI  - Spatiotemporal evolution and surface response of land subsidence over a large-scale land creation area on the Chinese Loess Plateau
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - For Yan'an (China) and many other cities on the Loess Plateau, development is limited by a severe lack of available land. To support the city's sustainable development, the Yan'an New District (YND) was constructed in 2012 through a mountain excavation and city construction (MECC) project. However, rapid land creation and urbanization have caused extensive anthropogenic land subsidence, which may impose new constraints on YND development. This study investigated the spatiotemporal development pattern and long-term temporal response of land subsidence related to land creation in the YND. First, 95 Sentinel-1 images acquired from 2016 to 2019 were analyzed with the small baseline subset (SBAS) interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) method to reveal the long-term displacement rates and spatiotemporal displacement patterns in the YND region. The interrelationship between the spatiotemporal variations in ground subsidence and the land creation history was also discussed. Then, an exponential model was employed to characterize the InSAR time series to assess the long-term displacement trends and temporal response of the land-subsidence process related to land creation. The results suggest that the observed long-term subsidence patterns in the land creation area showed an exponentially decaying trend with the fill compaction process. The newer and thicker the loess fill foundation was, the greater the subsidence rate and the smaller the decay trend over the same observation time, indicating slower stabilization relative to the compaction of the filling loess. The spatial variation in the significant land subsidence zone gradually shifted toward the newly formed fill area as the land creation area expanded. In addition, the ground displacement response estimates highlighted that most of the Qiaoergou subsidence zone in the YND will continue to sink for approximately 7.2 years following the InSAR observations used here. These findings have important implications for disaster mitigation and urban planning in similar large-scale land creation areas.

TI  - Satellites Suggest Rising Tropical High Cloud Altitude: 2002-2021
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical upper-troposphere clouds are expected to rise under global warming, contributing a positive radiative feedback. Here we show that Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) retrievals over 2002-2021 from the Terra and Aqua satellites report a tropical-mean high-cloud altitude increase of 6.9 +/- 2.7 m yr(-1) (+/- 2 sigma), while atmospheric models report 5.6 +/- 3.0 m yr(-1) over 1979-2014. During their common overlap period, however, the observed trend is greater than that of the models. The atmospheric models also show a tropically confined cloud-height response to El Nino, whereas the observed cloud height response peak extends into the subtropics. Poleward of the mid-latitudes, Aqua and Terra MODIS have cloud-height drifts relative to each other, highlighting the need for deeper investigation of potential time-dependent biases in MODIS cloud retrievals. Both sensors report significant tropical cloud height increases since 2002, which are statistically consistent with those simulated by climate models.

TI  - Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data for mapping plastic-covered greenhouse farming areas: a study from Dalat City (Lam Dong Province), Vietnam
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Plastic-covered greenhouse (PCG) farming has been practiced worldwide, particularly in highland areas, for planting fruits and garden plants. Highland areas in south-central Vietnam have been witnessing an expansion of PCG farming in recent decades. For sustainable management of plastic-covered greenhouse farming areas, a proper and continuous monitoring of their spatial patterns is necessary. In this study, we used spaceborne multispectral imagery (Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI) for automatic detection and mapping of plastic covered greenhouse farming areas in and surrounding areas of Dalat City in Lam Dong province, south-central Vietnam. Unsupervised (K-Means algorithm) and automatic delineation using spectral indices were applied to the Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 data for mapping plastic-covered greenhouses in Dalat City and surrounding areas. The results were evaluated using field data; automatic spectral index-based mapping of PCGs using Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 data was found as robust in terms of the overall accuracy. The overall accuracies of PCG maps derived from Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 data by applying spectral indices were 90.8% and 88.7%, respectively, and those of unsupervised K-Means classification were estimated as 73.2% and 71.7%, respectively. This study estimated that about 2425 ha of plastic-covered greenhouses existed within in Dalat City in 2020.

TI  - Geospatial characteristics of fire occurrences in southern hemispheric Africa and Madagascar during 2001-2020
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - For this study of long-term spatial patterns and trends of active fires in southern hemispheric Africa and on Madagascar from 2001 to 2020, active fire data from the MODIS FIRMS global fire data products were analyzed. The annual center of fire concentration tended to migrate toward the preserved rainforests and nature conservation areas in the Congo Basin and the mountain forests on the northeastern coast of Madagascar. Fire frequency varied seasonally at both study areas. We used geostatistical analysis techniques, such as measures of dispersion and emerging hot spot analysis, to reveal long-term trends in spatial patterns of fire events. In southern hemispheric Africa, the observed active fires tended to drift northward toward the Zambia-DRC border in the Congo basin. This northward migration progressed toward humid rainforests, which were better suited to sustaining repeated fire events. On Madagascar, the observed active fires tended to migrate toward the east coast in protected mountain forests. The spatial patterns of long-term trends showed a concentration of fires in the tropical regions of southern hemispheric Africa. Moreover, smaller clusters of new hot spots were located over eastern South Africa, overlapping with undifferentiated woodlands. On Madagascar, both hot and cold spots were identified and were separated by the highland region in the center of the island. Most of the eastern island was characterized by cold spots that received less precipitation than did the rest of the island. The presence of increasing hots spots in the densely vegetated areas highlights the urgent need for fire prevention and management in this region.

TI  - Mapping crop leaf area index at the parcel level via inverting a radiative transfer model under spatiotemporal constraints: A case study on sugarcane
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop leaf area index (LAI) mapping from remote sensing observations is highly demanded for regional agricultural applications, such as crop health monitoring and crop yield prediction. However, the popularly used model inversion method inevitably presents an ill-posed problem, which leads to unstable and inaccurate retrieval results. An agricultural parcel is a relatively homogeneous object due to uniform agricultural practices and similar environmental conditions. Crops inside a parcel generally present the same growth stage and similar growth status. In this study, a new method was proposed by adopting spatiotemporal constraints at the parcel level in the model inversion process for LAI retrieval. Firstly, phenology information of parcels was utilized to constrain the LAI ranges based on the established prior knowledge, which described the temporal variation of LAI during the life cycle of crop. Subsequently, spatial constraint was adopted in the model inversion through a proposed novel cost function, which assumed the spatial autocorrelation of parameters inside a parcel according to the first law of geography. Sugarcane was taken as an example to evaluate the proposed method. The method was applied to Sentinel-2 data and validated using ground-measured LAI data. The retrieved model parameters exhibited smoother spatial patterns and lower intra-parcel spatial variations through the proposed parcel-level inversion method, compared to the conventional pixel-level inversion method. Evaluations of LAI retrieval accuracy showed that the parcel-level inversion method yielded more accurate results (root mean square error (RMSE): 0.34 m2/m2; relative root mean square error (RRMSE): 20.89%), compared to the pixel-level inversion method (RMSE: 0.56 m2/m2; RRMSE: 34.53%). The spatiotemporal constraint strategy presented the ability to prevent severe overestimation and underestimation. Among the validation data set, the accuracy of the severely overestimated samples of the pixel-level method (RMSE: 0.93 m2/m2) was improved via the new method (RMSE: 0.43 m2/m2); the accuracy of the severely underestimated samples of the pixel-level method (RMSE: 0.66 m2/ m2) was improved via the new method (RMSE: 0.26 m2/m2). Finally, the proposed method was applied to obtain sugarcane LAI mapping. The study demonstrates that the proposed parcel-level spatiotemporal constraint strategy improves the accuracy of LAI retrieval, has the capability of producing a highly reliable crop LAI mapping, and shows good potential for agricultural applications at regional scales.

TI  - Understanding the Microphysical Control and Spatial-Temporal Variability of Warm Rain Probability Using CloudSat and MODIS Observations
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - By combining measurements from MODIS and the CloudSat radar, we develop a parameterization scheme to quantify the combined microphysical controls by liquid water path (LWP) and cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC) of the probability of precipitation (PoP) in marine low cloud over tropical oceans. We demonstrate that the spatial-temporal variation of grid-mean in-cloud can be largely explained by the variation of the joint probability density function of LWP and CDNC in the phase space specified by the bivariate PoP (LWP and CDNC) function. Through a series of sensitivity tests guided by this understanding, we find that in the Southeastern Pacific and Atlantic the stratocumulus to cumulus transition of the is mainly due to the variation of CDNC while the annual cycle is mainly due to the variation of LWP. The results of this study provide a viable way to diagnose the root cause of warm rain problems in global climate models.

TI  - Topographic indices and two-dimensional hydrodynamic modelling for flood hazard mapping in a data-scarce plain area: a case study of Oued Laou catchment (Northern of Morocco)
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This article aims to assess flood hazard in the Oued Laou basin. It is a catchment on the Mediterranean coast (Northern part of Morocco) potentially periled by flash floods and accelerated development of anthropogenic activities. In this study, two complementary methodologies were applied; the first one introduces a new topographic wetness index (TWI-Ks) that aims to identify flood prone-areas executed on the basin scale. Then were validated using sentinel-1 images. The second one is a two-dimensional (2D) hydrodynamic model applied on a locale scale (plain of Oued Laou), to describe and calculate the flood parameters and mapping flow indicators based on a high grid resolution (DTM) generated using Arial photogrammetry. The results highlight that the new approach of TWI-Ks model provides more reliable results than the classic TWI in terms of delineating areas at potential risk. Even though, both of them provide reliable susceptibility mapping. The analyses of the 200-year flood event simulated by 2D hydrodynamic HEC-RAS model, revealed that the flood inundation extent consequently affected almost all floodplain assets. Especially, crop fields and road N16, as tends to present danger even on buildings as a result.

TI  - Environmental monitoring tools and strategies in salmon net-pen aquaculture
T2  - INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - As global salmon production accelerates in response to higher consumer demand for seafood, so does the need for sophisticated monitoring strategies to enable and maintain ethically sound, productive, and environmentally friendly production of fish. Innovative technologies are needed to ensure proper water quality, react to unfavorable hydrodynamic conditions, monitor for changes in fish health, and minimize ecological interactions with indigenous aquatic life, including fish escapes. Automated sensors connected wirelessly to data stations, visualization aids, and acoustic and physical tagging technologies are emerging tools capable of detecting environmental stress and its associated behavioral changes in farmed fish. Computer modeling of the monitoring data collected from a single salmon farm or collection of farms sharing a data network can be used to spot environmental trends vital for anticipating some of the consequences of climate change. Environmental regulations governing salmon farming in coastal areas are becoming more stringent in response to public pressures to protect coastal and ocean resources and to provide for multipurpose use of marine resources. As net-pen salmon aquaculture expands globally, new technologies will be essential to collect and interpret the anticipated larger volumes of data needed to meet these stringent regulatory requirements and to safeguard the high investment costs inherent in salmon farming.

M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Monitoring whales in remote areas is important for their conservation; however, using traditional survey platforms (boat and plane) in such regions is logistically difficult. The use of very high-resolution satellite imagery to survey whales, particularly in remote locations, is gaining interest and momentum. However, the development of this emerging technology relies on accurate automated systems to detect whales, which are currently lacking. Such detection systems require access to an open source library containing examples of whales annotated in satellite images to train and test automatic detection systems. Here we present a dataset of 633 annotated whale objects, created by surveying 6,300 km2 of satellite imagery captured by various very high-resolution satellites (i.e. WorldView-3, WorldView-2, GeoEye-1 and Quickbird-2) in various regions across the globe (e.g. Argentina, New Zealand, South Africa, United States, Mexico). The dataset covers four different species: southern right whale (Eubalaena glacialis), humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae), fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus), and grey whale (Eschrichtius robustus).

TI  - Contrasting Stratospheric Smoke Mass and Lifetime From 2017 Canadian and 2019/2020 Australian Megafires: Global Simulations and Satellite Observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Stratospheric injections of carbonaceous aerosols and combustion gases by extreme wildfires have become increasingly common. Recent "megafires," particularly large and intense fires, delivered particulate burdens to the lower stratosphere comparable to those of moderate volcanic eruptions. The 2017 Canadian megafire generated four large Pyrocumulonimbi (pyroCbs), injecting up to approximate to 0.3 Tg of smoke in the lower stratosphere. Even more extreme, the 2019/2020 Australian event produced a pyroCb activity resulting in stratospheric smoke intrusions of approximate to 1 Tg. To understand their contrasting behavior, we present global climate simulations of the atmospheric response to these events, applying smoke burdens informed by remote observations. Model outcomes, compared to satellite data of smoke transport, reproduce reasonably well the initial plume rise, at 0.2-0.3 km/day, attaining heights of approximate to 20 km in Canada and above 30 km in Australia. Global dispersal of the plume occurs within about 3 weeks in both cases, consistent with observations. Smoke removal timescales, approximate to 5 months for the Canadian megafire, agree with remote measurements. During the Australian megafire, observations indicate stratospheric injections three times as large, and models predict comparatively longer smoke lifetimes, approximate to 16 months. After the latter event, atmospheric optical depths and radiative cooling achieved values close to those measured following the Pinatubo eruption. Sensitivity tests of model assumptions indicate, in accord with prior studies, that smoke burden, injection heights, and black carbon content can determine plume evolution and possible climate impacts. An empirical relation between peak heights of stratospheric plumes and lifetimes is derived that can help assess megafire impacts on the stratosphere, climate and the Earth system.

TI  - A Simple Model for Tropical Convective Cloud Shield Area Growth and Decay Rates Informed by Geostationary IR, GPM, and Aqua/AIRS Satellite Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep convective system maximum areal extent is driven by the stratiform anvil area since convective area fractions are much less than unity when systems reach peak size. It is important to understand the processes that drive system size given the impact large systems have on rainfall and that of anvils on high cloud feedbacks. Using satellite diabatic heating and convective-stratiform information mapped to convective systems, composite analyses suggest that system maximum sizes occur at the temporal mid-point of system lifecycles with both maximum size and duration correlating with peak heating above the melting level. However, variations in system growth rates exist, with the overall smooth composites emerging as the average of highly variable system trajectories. Thus, this study focuses on understanding convective system growth rates on short (30-min) timescales via development of a simple analytical source-sink model that predicts system area changes. Growth occurs when detrained convective mass (inferred from the vertical gradient of diabatic heating and temperature lapse rates) and/or generation of convective area exceeds a sink term whose magnitude is proportional to the current cloud shield size. The model works well for systems over land and ocean, and for systems characterized by varying degrees of convective organization and duration (1.5-35 hr, with correlations often >0.8 across lifetime bins). The model may serve as a useful foundation for improved understanding of processes driving changes in tropics-wide convective system cloud shields, and further supports conceptual development and evaluation of prognostic climate model stratiform anvil area parameterizations.

TI  - Evaluation of spatio-temporal variations of FVC and its relationship with climate change using GEE and Landsat images in Ganjiang River Basin
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Fractional vegetation cover (FVC) is an important feature of the ecosystem, and continuous evaluation of vegetation status is one of the key issues in the ecological monitoring of river basins. This article divided the Ganjiang River Basin (GRB) into 73 subbasins, and quantitatively evaluated the spatio-temporal FVC changes at multiple scales from 2000 to 2019 using Google Earth Engine and Landsat series images. Theil-Sen slope estimator and Mann-Kendall algorithm were used to monitor the spatio-temporal change trend of the FVC in the basin and subbasins, respectively. Mann-Kendall test was executed to analyze the abrupt change of FVC. Hurst exponent and Theil-Sen Slope were integrated to evaluate the consistency of FVC change and predict its spatio-temporal evolution trend. Grey correlation analysis and Pearson correlation analysis were selected to quantify the relationship between FVC and terrain, climate factors in each subbasin, and further explore the effect of single factor and multiple-factor combination on FVC change. The results showed that: (1) FVC in the GRB was in good condition, and increased with the elevation and slope, but the FVC in the subbasins with elevation less than 200 m ranged from 25.95% to 72.86%. From 2000 to 2019, the area of high coverage increased significantly compared with other coverage grades. The FVC of most subbasins varied from 45% to 80%, and the change range fluctuated from 9.4% to 36.53%. (2) The FVC has presented a fluctuating growth trend in the past 20 years. The area with increasing FVC reached 68.93%, and the area of a significant improvement in FVC was 11.65% more than the area with the significant degradation. The FVC in the 64.38% of subbasins has abrupt changed, and 20.55% of subbasins has changed dramatically with 7 abrupt change points, which demonstrated that the subbasin-scale abrupt change analysis could accurately monitor the spatio-temporal change of FVC. (3) The 76% of basin appeared the weak consistency in the FVC, and the northern and southern of the basin present a trend of degradation in the future. (4) The spatio-temporal distribution of FVC in GRB was greatly affected by terrain. The effect of temperature and relative humidity on the FVC change was greater than that of precipitation. The synergistic effect of three climatic factors on FVC change was more significant than that of a single factor.

TI  - Impact assessment of humanitarian demining using object-based peri-urban land cover classification and morphological building detection from VHR Worldview imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study utilised very high-resolution (VHR) imagery to monitor and evaluate the impact of humanitarian demining activities in a peri-urban environment in Afghanistan. Identifying buildings and mapping the spatial distribution of different types of land cover is of great practical significance for demining organisations, such as the HALO Trust, to assess the impact of their mine-clearance activities, by quantifying change and the growth of a population in a specific area over time. This study had two main objectives: (i) to map the post-clearance land cover, and (ii) to detect and quantify the change in the number and area of buildings. Two independent workflows were implemented and evaluated. To map land cover, this study investigated the implementation of various machine learning algorithms in object-based image classification (OBIA) of VHR satellite imagery (Worldview-1,2,3). Image segmentation was carried out using the Large-Scale Mean-Shift (LSMS) algorithm, before classification was performed based on a machine learning Random Forests (RF) approach. Different parameters and spatial distribution of training samples were tested to analyse the model's performance. Further analysis determined that by using only the segments' mean value per spectral band (Red, Green, Blue), data redundancy in the training stage was eliminated. The final classified map had an overall accuracy of 90.67% and a total builtarea of 643,660.28 m2 was detected in the 4.11 km2 study area. To detect and quantify buildings present in the study area, an alternative, automatic, unsupervised approach based on the morphological building index (MBI) was implemented using MATLAB. Two VHR (0.5 m) panchromatic images acquired by WorldView-1 in 2008 and 2018 were processed using a series of multi-scale and multi-directional morphological operators, before a series of post-processing thresholds were applied to refine the output. Parameters were systematically optimised for the datasets and their sensitivity analysed. By comparing the output to manually labelled reference maps, producer's and user's accuracy of 78.63/81.70% and 75.30/77.91% were attained for 2008 and 2018 imagery respectively. The built-area was found to increase from 58,705 to 611,920 m2 over the ten-year period, indicating a significant increase in the number of people resident in the area. Whilst OBIA was found to be more accurate than MBI for the 2018 pansharpened imagery, with producer's and user's accuracy of 91.00/90.60% versus 84.65/79.44% respectively, it must be considered that the MBI, an unsupervised method requiring no training, offers a fast solution if the sole objective is building detection.

TI  - The coastal front modulates the timing and magnitude of spring phytoplankton bloom in the Yellow Sea
T2  - WATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Major seasonal quasi-stationary fronts on shelves play an important role in regulating the spatiotemporal variations in the phytoplankton community. However, knowledge of their effects on the timing and magnitude of spring phytoplankton bloom (SPB) remains limited. Here, based on decadal satellite data (2003-2020), we examine the climatological relationship between the Shandong coastal front (SCF) and SPB in the Yellow Sea. The results show that the onset of SPB occurs either in March (-56% of the seasons examined) or in April (44%). The peak of SPB most often occurs in April (-56% of the seasons examined) or is advanced to March (16%) or delayed to May (28%), and that the peak ranges from 1.04 to 2.54 mg Chl-a m- 3. The onset of SPB matches with lower turbulence, particularly when the rate of generation of turbulent kinetic energy (TKERT) reaches zero. A higher magnitude of bloom is associated with a greater change in front and a lower TKERT. The in situ observations along the SCF transects in the Yellow Sea indicate that weakened SCF in spring associated with a shallower mixing layer enhances the transport of nutrients from the coastal to the shelf waters. Weakened frontal structure and atmospheric forcing in spring can further increase the water stability and decrease turbulence in the upper waters. The variation in hydrodynamic conditions allows shelf phytoplankton to stay longer in the upper waters with sufficient light and nutrients and consequently generate a Chl-a peak. The results suggest that the seasonal changes in front intensity and structure and turbulence are important prerequisites for initiating SPB on the shelf, and that further determines the magnitude of SPB.

TI  - Exoplanet detection using machine learning
T2  - MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - We introduce a new machine learning based technique to detect exoplanets using the transit method. Machine learning and deep learning techniques have proven to be broadly applicable in various scientific research areas. We aim to exploit some of these methods to improve the conventional algorithm based approaches presently used in astrophysics to detect exoplanets. Using the time series analysis library tsfresh to analyse light curves, we extracted 789 features from each curve, which capture the information about the characteristics of a light curve. We then used these features to train a gradient boosting classifier using the machine learning tool lightgbm. This approach was tested on K2 campaign 7 data with injected artificial transit signals, which showed that it is competitive compared to the conventional box least-squares fitting method. We further found that our method produced comparable results to existing state-of-the-art deep learning models, while being much more computationally efficient and without needing folded and secondary views of the light curves. For Kepler data, the method is able to predict a planet with an AUC of 0.948, so that 94.8 per cent of the true planet signals are ranked higher than non-planet signals. The resulting recall is 0.96, so that 96 per cent of real planets are classified as planets. For the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite data, we found our method can classify light curves with an accuracy of 0.98, and is able to identify planets with a recall of 0.82 at a precision of 0.63.

TI  - A new survey tool for evaluating pandemic preparedness in health services
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Rapid decision-making with limited resources and prior research to draw upon posed challenges for health service leaders globally when preparing for COVID-19. How do health services prepare for a pandemic and evaluate if the preparation has been effective? This study aimed to explore health workers' perceptions and knowledge regarding preparedness for COVID-19 at a regional health service in Australia. Methods A 32-item online survey was developed to evaluate preparedness across five scales: 1) Clinical, 2) Communication, 3) Environment, 4) Human Resources, and 5) General Preparedness. Data were analyzed using parametric and non-parametric statistics and qualitative content analysis. Results Ninety-three employees completed the survey, with most working in clinical roles (58.1%). Respondents largely felt the health service was well-prepared (84.0%) and they were personally prepared (74.4%) to respond to COVID-19. Clinical and communication scale scores varied by role type. Respondents faced personal risk and resource shortages impacted their sense of safety; others felt adequately supported. Conclusions A coordinated "whole hospital response", accessible and inclusive communication, education, adequate resourcing, and employee wellbeing supports are necessary when preparing health services for sentinel events. This survey tool offers health services an approach to evaluating pandemic preparation. Continued advocacy for resources and wellbeing needs of health workers is paramount in future preparations.

TI  - Assessing Important Conservation Areas for Colonial Species From Individual Tracking Data: An Evaluation of the Effects of Colony Structure and Temporal Heterogeneity in Movement Patterns
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sensitivity of marine ecosystems to human disturbance leads to an increasing need to devise effective conservation initiatives. One key conservation leverage tool is the establishment of marine protected areas, which can be derived by inspecting where marine sentinel species forage in their most sensitive life cycle phase (reproduction). Depending on their biological and legislative framework, important conservation areas (hereafter, ICAs) can correspond to Important Bird and biodiversity Areas, Key Biodiversity Areas, Marine Protected Areas, etc. Statistical methods allow for standardized assessment of ICAs based on GPS tracking data. However, several biological processes should be accounted for to provide reliable ICAs. In colonial seabirds and sea mammals, individuals breeding in different parts of a colony often spatially segregate while foraging at sea. Besides, environmental conditions may affect the location of foraging areas across years. To what extent relying on data collected in only one part of a colony or in a single breeding season may affect the location and size of ICAs remains unexplored. Here we aimed at 1) highlighting intra-colony and inter-annual heterogeneity of exploited marine areas during reproduction in a colonial seabird, the Scopoli's shearwaters Calonectris diomedea; and 2) providing guidelines on how to methodologically best account for such spatio-temporal heterogeneity when deriving ICAs. We relied on 397 foraging trips performed by 73 individuals breeding in two distinct areas within the same colony (hereafter, sub-colonies) over 3 years. We showed that areas exploited by shearwaters breeding in two nearby sub-colonies were clearly segregated and differed between years. Relying on only one sub-colony or a single breeding season led to drastically smaller ICAs, biased either east- or west-ward depending on the sub-colony considered. We proposed to account for such heterogeneity by merging the different ICAs obtained for each sub-colony and year, instead of pooling tracking data and deriving a single ICA. Our method led to much larger ICAs, which were less affected by differences in sample sizes across sub-colonies or years, than when ignoring the spatio-temporal heterogeneity. Recently developed standardized statistical procedures and a careful consideration of population spatial structure and temporal heterogeneity will foster robust conservation actions for colonial marine species.

TI  - Caveolin-1-ACE2 axis modulates xenobiotic metabolism-linked chemoresistance in ovarian clear cell carcinoma
T2  - CELL BIOLOGY AND TOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Among epithelial ovarian cancers, ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) remains markedly resistant to platinum-based chemotherapy, leading to poor clinical outcomes. In response to xenobiotic insults, caveolar platforms play crucial roles in modulating stress signaling responses in cancer cells. It has been hypothesized that caveolin-1 (Cav-1), a main component of the lipid raft, may regulate the response to platinum-based treatment in OCCC. The clinical transcriptomic evaluation demonstrated that high Cav-1 expression was positively associated with a favorable prognosis in patients with ovarian cancer. Cav-1 overexpression enhanced sensitivity to cisplatin (CDDP) treatment, whereas Cav-1 deficiency promoted chemoresistance in OCCC cells. Mechanistically, although Cav-1 counteracted angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression, ACE2 positively facilitated resistance to CDDP in OCCC cells. Furthermore, ACE2 restricted aryl hydrocarbon receptor expression and subsequent transcription of drug-metabolizing enzymes. Of note, ACE2 positively regulated the expression of the platinum-clearing enzyme CYP3A4. These findings suggest that the Cav-1-ACE2 axis modulates xenobiotic metabolism-linked chemoresistance in OCCC, predicting potential roles for the stress sentinel networks in oncogenic processes.

AB  - BackgroundSeromas frequently develop in patients who undergo total mastectomy with node surgery. We aimed to prospectively explore whether use of oxidized regenerated cellulose (ORC, SurgiGuard((R))) affects seroma formation after total mastectomy with node surgery (sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) or axillary lymph node dissection (ALND)).Materials and methodsNinety four breast cancer patients were enrolled in the study who underwent total mastectomy with ALND or SLNB. The patients were randomized into two groups, one treated with ORC plus closed suction drainage and the other with closed suction drainage alone.ResultsMean drainage volume was slightly lower in the ORC group on postoperative day 1 (123 +/- 54 vs 143 +/- 104 ml), but was slightly higher at all other time points; however, these differences were not significant. Mean total drainage volume in patients treated with ORC plus drainage did not differ from that of patients treated with drainage alone (1134 +/- 507 ml vs 1033 +/- 643 ml, P = 0.486).ConclusionsUse of ORC (SurgiGuard((R))) did not significantly alter the risk of seroma formation.

TI  - Diurnal Evolution of Cloud Water Responses to Aerosols
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds play an essential role in the global energy budget, but the impact of anthropogenic aerosols on clouds is still poorly understood. We use 15-min temporal resolution geostationary satellite data to study the temporal evolution of polluted cloud tracks detected in the European part of Russia. Previous analysis of polluted cloud tracks shows that cloud water response to aerosols is bidirectional. Here, we show that cloud water gradually increases in the afternoon for polluted clouds in some cases. Aerosol-induced cloud thickening is much more likely in the case of thin unpolluted clouds. However, on average, there is less cloud water in the polluted clouds compared to the nearby unpolluted clouds. The temporal evolution of cloud thinning is not observed, and polluted clouds are thinner than the nearby unpolluted clouds since the early morning. The physical mechanisms leading to the observed changes and the influence of retrieval bias on the detected changes need further clarification. Our findings highlight the need to research the temporal evolution of cloud responses to aerosols to estimate the aerosol radiative forcing more accurately.

TI  - A multidisciplinary approach to heart failure care in the hospital: improving the patient journey
T2  - HOSPITAL PRACTICE
M3  - Review
AB  - Background Despite advancements in care for patients with heart failure (HF), morbidity and mortality remain high. Hospitalizations and readmissions for HF have been the focus of significant attention among health care providers and payers, with an eye toward reducing health care costs. However, considerable variability exists with regard to inpatient workflows and management for patients with HF, which represents a significant opportunity to improve care. Objective Here we provide a summary of optimal inpatient management strategies for HF, focusing on the multidisciplinary team of emergency medicine providers, admitting hospitalists, cardiovascular consultants, pharmacists, nurses, and social workers. Methods The patient journey serves as the template for this review article, from the initial presentation in the emergency department, to decongestion and stabilization, optimization of guideline-directed medical therapy, and discharge and appropriate disposition. Conclusion This review aims not to be proscriptive but rather to provide best practices that are clinically relevant and actionable, with the goal of improving care for patients during the sentinel hospitalization for HF.

TI  - Identifying the rapid intensification of tropical cyclones using the Himawari-8 satellite and their impacts in the Philippines
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical cyclones (TCs) that undergo rapid intensification (RI), defined as the upper 95th percentile increase of TC maximum winds in a 24-hr period, are likely to pose a bigger threat to affected countries in the western North Pacific (WNP). In the Philippines, of the 522 TCs that made landfall from 1951 to 2020, 146 TCs (28%) underwent RI. The majority (82%) of these RI TCs made landfall with at least typhoon intensity, in contrast, only 12% of landfalling non-RI TCs were typhoons. As the region in the WNP basin where most TC RI occurs (bounded by 123 degrees-140 degrees E and 10 degrees-20 degrees N) is located just to the east of the Philippines, TC RI is typically followed by landfall in the Philippines, many of which do so at their peak intensity. Consequently, results suggest that TCs undergoing RI have a larger impact on the country. Comparison of socioeconomic data between landfalling RI and non-RI TCs showed that the former tend to have larger impacts in terms of population affected and number of deaths. Hence, determining TC RI at its onset can aid in the early warning of impending TC intensification. In this study, we explored the use of infrared brightness temperature (Bt) satellite data in the identification of TC RI onset. The 10.4 mu m window band of the Himawari-8 satellite was used to measure the amount of active convection that typically occurs before or during the onset of TC RI. RI onset is determined if 100% of pixels within a 50 km radius from the TC centre have Bt <= 225 K. Assessment of satellite Bt data that fit this set of criteria followed by 25 and 35 kt RI in the next 24 hr have positive Pierce skill scores of 0.47 and 0.48, respectively, false alarm ratio of 0.13-0.20, and probability of false detection of 0.02-0.03.

TI  - Spatially varying WIndow based maximum likelihood feature tracking (SWIFT) method for glacier surface velocity estimations
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier surface velocity is an important variable for glacier dynamics studies. Estimation of accurate surface velocity from remote sensing is a challenge, especially for glaciers with no in-situ observations. To overcome this challenge, a new method for glacier feature tracking named as Spatially varying WIndow based maximum likelihood Feature Tracking (SWIFT) has been proposed. This method utilizes both optical data (to automatically determine the window size [WS] using the concept of Object Based Image Analysis [OBIA]) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data (to perform feature tracking). The proposed method uses a spatially varying WS unlike other existing softwares that cannot provide the flexibility of a spatially varying WS. The proposed method has been tested and validated at three different glaciers (South Glacier [SG], Canada; Chhota Shigri Glacier [CSG], India; and Tasman Glacier [TG], New Zealand) for which field measured data were available. The obtained results for all three glaciers showed consistent improvement in estimated velocity by SWIFT when compared with spatially fixed WS-based estimates from normalized cross correlation-based Correlation Image Analysis Software (CIAS). Considering the data availability, the proposed SWIFT method has been implemented using a variety of SAR and optical satellite data to understand its performance/effectiveness for glacier surface velocity estimation. When validated against field measurements, the results from SWIFT gave an RMSE of 12.8 m/years, 15.32 m/years and 67.1 m/years for SG, CSG and TG, respectively. Moreover, the RMSE of SWIFT estimates were observed to have an RMSE that was 19-36% lower than the best performing spatially fixed WS.

TI  - Spatial distribution and temporal variation of aerosol optical depth in the Western Pacific Ocean
T2  - DYNAMICS OF ATMOSPHERES AND OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - The temporal and spatial characteristics of the aerosol optical depth (AOD) in the Western Pacific Ocean are analyzed using the field observation data and AVHRR remote sensing data. The observation AOD shows a significant north-south difference with a boundary of 25 N. In the north, the AOD spectral distribution shows a feature of decrease with the increase of wavelength in the range of 440-870 nm. In the south, the AOD maximum is at 500 nm. The average AOD (440) in the north is 0.177 larger than that in the south. The northern average Angstrom exponent (alpha) is 3.2 times as large as that of the south. In terms of climatology, as the subtropical high ridge moves northward up to 12 from February to August, the location of AOD(630) maximum around 35 N moves northward by 10.5 . In addition to the northern maximum, the zonal mean of AOD (630) from AVHRR shows another maximum, located at 10N. The AOD(630) at 35N reaches its maximum in April, while the AOD(630) at 10N reaches its maximum in March. The multi-year variation of AOD(630) at 35N is consistent with that at 10N with a correlation coefficient of 0.77. Research on the month of the climatological AOD(630) maximum at around 10N shows that it is attributed to the joint action of aerosols from the sea south of 10N and East Asia.

TI  - Risk prediction of 30-day mortality after stroke using machine learning: a nationwide registry-based cohort study
T2  - BMC NEUROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Backgrounds We aimed to develop and validate machine learning (ML) models for 30-day stroke mortality for mortality risk stratification and as benchmarking models for quality improvement in stroke care. Methods Data from the UK Sentinel Stroke National Audit Program between 2013 to 2019 were used. Models were developed using XGBoost, Logistic Regression (LR), LR with elastic net with/without interaction terms using 80% randomly selected admissions from 2013 to 2018, validated on the 20% remaining admissions, and temporally validated on 2019 admissions. The models were developed with 30 variables. A reference model was developed using LR and 4 variables. Performances of all models was evaluated in terms of discrimination, calibration, reclassification, Brier scores and Decision-curves. Results In total, 488,497 stroke patients with a 12.3% 30-day mortality rate were included in the analysis. In 2019 temporal validation set, XGBoost model obtained the lowest Brier score (0.069 (95% CI: 0.068-0.071)) and the highest area under the ROC curve (AUC) (0.895 (95% CI: 0.891-0.900)) which outperformed LR reference model by 0.04 AUC (p < 0.001) and LR with elastic net and interaction term model by 0.003 AUC (p < 0.001). All models were perfectly calibrated for low (< 5%) and moderate risk groups (5-15%) and approximate to 1% underestimation for high-risk groups (> 15%). The XGBoost model reclassified 1648 (8.1%) low-risk cases by the LR reference model as being moderate or high-risk and gained the most net benefit in decision curve analysis. Conclusions All models with 30 variables are potentially useful as benchmarking models in stroke-care quality improvement with ML slightly outperforming others.

TI  - Estimation of Rice Aboveground Biomass by Combining Canopy Spectral Reflectance and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle-Based Red Green Blue Imagery Data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating the aboveground biomass (AGB) of rice using remotely sensed data is critical for reflecting growth status, predicting grain yield, and indicating carbon stocks in agroecosystems. A combination of multisource remotely sensed data has great potential for providing complementary datasets, improving estimation accuracy, and strengthening precision agricultural insights. Here, we explored the potential to estimate rice AGB by using a combination of spectral vegetation indices and wavelet features (spectral parameters) derived from canopy spectral reflectance and texture features and texture indices (texture parameters) derived from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) RGB imagery. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of the combined spectral and texture parameters and improve rice AGB estimation. Correlation analysis was performed to select the potential variables to establish the linear and quadratic regression models. Multivariate analysis (multiple stepwise regression, MSR; partial least square, PLS) and machine learning (random forest, RF) were used to evaluate the estimation performance of spectral parameters, texture parameters, and their combination for rice AGB. The results showed that spectral parameters had better linear and quadratic relationships with AGB than texture parameters. For the multivariate analysis and machine learning algorithm, the MSR, PLS, and RF regression models fitted with spectral parameters (R-2 values of 0.793, 0.795, and 0.808 for MSR, PLS, and RF, respectively) were more accurate than those fitted with texture parameters (R-2 values of 0.540, 0.555, and 0.485 for MSR, PLS, and RF, respectively). The MSR, PLS, and RF regression models fitted with a combination of spectral and texture parameters (R-2 values of 0.809, 0.810, and 0.805, respectively) slightly improved the estimation accuracy of AGB over the use of spectral parameters or texture parameters alone. Additionally, the bior1.3 of wavelet features at 947 nm and scale 2 was used to predict the grain yield and had good accuracy for the quadratic regression model. Therefore, the combined use of canopy spectral reflectance and texture information has great potential for improving the estimation accuracy of rice AGB, which is helpful for rice productivity prediction. Combining multisource remotely sensed data from the ground and UAV technology provides new solutions and ideas for rice biomass acquisition.

TI  - An evolving marine environment and its driving forces of algal blooms in the Southern Yellow Sea of China
T2  - MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuing global warming and intensification of human activities have substantially disturbed the balance of coastal marine ecosystems, potentially creating favorable conditions for algal blooms. Using serial remote sensing data and various national and provincial statistics, we investigated the spatial and temporal variations of the environmental driving forces for algal blooms in the Southern Yellow Sea between 2003 and 2017. The findings suggest that (1) Continual warming was observed in the Southern Yellow Sea. The study area evidenced more than three times the warming speed (0.41 degrees C/decade) of the global oceans (0.12 degrees C/decade) during the same period. There was an apparent warming zone in the region where macroalgal blooms tended to spread, with a heating of 1.0-1.5 degrees C (May-June). (2) Nutrient loadings have diverse patterns, characterized by fast-growing aquaculture activities and declining nutrients from land-based agriculture fertilizers and sewage discharge (based on published national and provincial statistics). (3) Growing expansion of algal blooms in the Southern Yellow Sea was confirmed by the relative increases in average May-June chlorophyll-a concentration of 46.7% and floating biomass area from 3.3% in 2003 to 13.4% in 2017. (4) While spatial correlation analysis showed a positive influence of the ocean surface temperature on chlorophyll-a, their relatively moderate (r = 0.40, p < 0.15) and declining correlations suggest that nutrient enrichment could be comparatively more influential on macroalgal blooms. Nutrient loading from the discharge of wastewater sourced from coastal aquaculture and organic residuals from land-sourcing sewage and industrial pollution, even though declining as reported, is still upholding a high level of nutrient enrichment in the study area. In addition, the fixed facilities for seaweed mariculture in the region provide vast breeding surfaces for algae. Consequently, the Southern Yellow Sea has become an ideal marine area for algal blooms.

TI  - Unraveling the Photovoltaic, Mechanical, and Microstructural Properties and Their Correlations in Simple Poly(3-pentylthiophene) Solar Cells
T2  - MACROMOLECULAR RAPID COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The power conversion efficiency of polythiophene organic solar cells is constantly refreshed. Despite the renewed device efficiency, very few efforts have been devoted to understanding how the type of electron acceptor alters the photovoltaic and mechanical properties of these low-cost solar cells. Herein, the authors conduct a thorough investigation of photovoltaic and mechanical characteristics of a simple yet less-explored polythiophene, namely poly(3-pentylthiophene) (P3PT), in three different types of organic solar cells, where ZY-4Cl, PC71BM, and N2200 are employed as three representative acceptors, respectively. Compared with the reference poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)-based solar cells, P3PT-based devices, all perform more efficiently. Particularly, the P3PT:ZY-4Cl blend exhibits the highest efficiency (ca. 10%) among the six combinations and outperforms the prior top-performance system P3HT:ZY-4Cl. Furthermore, the blend films based on N2200 exhibit a high crack-onset strain of similar to 38% on average, which is approximately 15- and 17-times higher than those of ZY-4Cl and PC71BM, respectively. The microstructural origins for the above difference are well elucidated by detailed grazing incidence X-ray scattering and microscopy analysis. This work not only underlines the potential of P3PT in prolific solar cell research but also demonstrates the superior tensile properties of polythiophene-based all-polymer blends for the preparation of stretchable solar cells.

TI  - UAV remote sensing applications in marine monitoring: Knowledge visualization and review
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - With the booming development of information technology and the growing demand for remote sensing data, un-manned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing technology has emerged. In recent years, UAV remote sensing technology has developed rapidly and has been widely used in the fields of military defense, agricultural monitoring, surveying and mapping management, and disaster and emergency response and management. Currently, increasingly serious marine biological and environmental problems are raising the need for effective and timely monitoring. Compared with traditional marine monitoring technologies, UAV remote sensing is becoming an important means for marine monitoring thanks to its flexibility, efficiency and low cost, while still producing systematic data with high spatial and temporal resolutions. This study visualizes the knowledge domain of the application and research advances of UAV remote sensing in marine monitoring by analyzing 1130 articles (from 1993 to early 2022) using a bibliometric approach and provides a review of the application of UAVs in marine management mapping, marine disaster and en-vironmental monitoring, and marine wildlife monitoring. It aims to promote the extensive application of UAV remote sensing in the field of marine research.

TI  - Contribution of the Tibetan Plateau Winter Snow Cover to Seasonal Prediction of the East Asian Summer Monsoon
T2  - ATMOSPHERE-OCEAN
M3  - Article
AB  - How to improve the prediction skill of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) is a challenging but essential issue. This study examines the impact of the winter Tibetan Plateau (TP) snow cover (TPSC) on the subsequent EASM during the past two decades. Based on the high-resolution MODIS/Terra snow cover data, a new snow cover critical area (76 degrees-83 degrees E, 28 degrees-35 degrees N) is identified in the southwestern TP for the EASM seasonal prediction. Results show that the increase of the TPSC within this critical area during prior winter significantly increases summer precipitation over the Yangtze River Basin (YRB). The TPSC anomaly induces anomalous cooling in the overlying atmospheric column, leading to an anomalous cyclonic circulation in the upper troposphere. Such anomalous cyclonic circulation may further contribute to the local snow cover increase, and through such a snow-albedo feedback process, the excessive TPSC anomaly is strengthened and persists through the following summer. Coexisting with the positive anomalous TPSC, the South Asian High, the western Pacific Subtropical High, and the Subtropical Westerly Jet shift southward. A deep cyclonic circulation is induced in northeastern China by the excessive TPSC anomaly, which is reproduced in the linear baroclinic model simulation. Northerly flow is crucial for accumulating water vapour and favours more rainfall over the YRB. A physical empirical prediction model is established to quantify the TPSC contribution to the seasonal prediction of the EASM. Empirical hindcast output shows the prediction skill of the EASM is significantly improved with the additional predictor of the winter TPSC. In particular, the TPSC has greatly improved the prediction of the extreme EASM in 2020. The above results indicate that the prior winter TPSC anomaly in this critical area can provide another predictability source for the EASM, besides El Nino-Southern Oscillation and the North Atlantic Oscillation.

TI  - Estimation of the net primary productivity of winter wheat based on the near-infrared radiance of vegetation
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying net primary productivity (NPP) is important for understanding the global carbon cycle and for assessing ecosystem carbon dynamics. However, uncertainties remain in NPP estimation. Using winter wheat data obtained from an experimental station in 2019, this study evaluated the ability of the near-infrared radiance of vegetation (NIRV,Rad) to estimate NPP at different time scales and established an estimation model based on NIRV,Rad, where NIRV,Rad was defined as the product of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the near-infrared radiance. The results showed that the linear relationship between NIRV,Rad and NPP was superior to the relationship between NPP and NDVI, enhanced vegetation index-2 (EVI2), and near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRV,Ref) at each time scale (hourly, daily, and growth period). The advantage of NIRV,Rad was more evident on the hourly scale, in which the R-2 of NIRV,Rad and NPP reached 0.77, whereas the R-2 values of the correlation of NDVI, EVI2, and NIRV,Refwith NPP were 0.30, 0.16, and 0.14, respectively. There existed a strong linear relationship between absorbed photosynthetically active radiation, net photosynthetic rate, leaf area index, and NIRV,Rad, which explained the good relationship between NIRV,Rad and NPP. Through a comparative analysis of the various models, the NIRV,Rad model was found to have the strongest ability to estimate NPP and the R-2, with the measured NPP reaching 0.81. The accuracy of NIRV,Rad provides a new method for estimating NPP and a scientific basis for estimating NPP using high resolution satellite remote sensing data on a regional scale.

TI  - Retrieving spatial variation of aerosol level over urban mixed land surfaces using Landsat imageries: Degree of air pollution in Dhaka Metropolitan Area
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosols, or suspended particles in the atmosphere, are critical in the production of cloud nuclei, climate change, poor air quality and reduced ambient visibility, as well as public health and disease. Since there are limited ground monitoring stations in the Dhaka Metropolitan Area (DMA), calculating the degree of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and PM2.5 is thus a challenge. The research aimed to retrieve the AOD at 30 m spatial resolution using the Simplified Aerosol Retrieval Algorithm (SARA) based on Landsat imageries. Landsat 4-5 and 8 cloud-free images at 30 m spatial resolution were obtained from 1999 to 2019 at 5 years interval to retrieve AOD and estimate Particulate Matter 2.5 (PM2.5) concentrations. The results showed significant increase in PM2.5 concentrations and the average PM2.5 were estimated for the year of 1999, 2004, 2009, 2014, 2019 were 48.41, 55.26, 66.42, 72.9 and 90.13 mu g/m(3), respectively. The AOD, mostly generated from the built-up area was 2.6 in 2019, which was 3 times higher than in 1999. Besides, to find out the relationship among AOD, LST (Land Surface Temperature) and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), results revealed a strong positive correlation of AOD with LST but negative correlation with NDVI. Based on AERONET and NASA SEDAC data, the AOD and PM2.5 were validated using statistically significant (p value 0.05) correlation analysis. By presenting a growing pattern and coverage of air pollution over time, the study will assist urban planners, policymakers, and health sectors.

AB  - Up-to-date and accurate land use and land cover (LULC) maps are vital for monitoring various environmental and natural resources management. In this study, we evaluate classification performance of three optical satellite data in an area located in northwestern Morocco. Images from Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, and PlanetScope were exploited between 2020 and 2021. Then, twelve different multitemporal/multisensor combinations were evaluated using overall accuracy, Cohen's kappa, and F-score. A supervised classification was carried out using random forest algorithm. The study area was classified into two levels, including twelve and sixteen land use/ cover classes. These results suggest that when spatial and spectral resolution increase, classification accuracy improves. PlanetScope's LULC classification (overall accuracy > 97%) performs better than Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data. In addition, combining three sensors did not significantly improve the overall classification with regards to PlanetScope only. The high-resolution obtained map can be exploited as input for environmental modeling and could help decision makers for sustainable land and ecosystem management.

TI  - Diagnostic performance and survival outcome following sentinel lymph node biopsy in breast cancer patients from a tertiary cancer centre in India
T2  - ECANCERMEDICALSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has replaced axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for axillary staging in early node-negative breast cancer (BC) patients in developed countries. However, in resource-constrained developing countries, adoption of SLNB is slow due to logistic issues and lack of outcome data from non-screened BC cohort. Therefore, we aim to report diagnostic performance, surgical morbidity and survival outcome of SLNB in BC patients from a tertiary care cancer centre in India.Methodology: 1,521 consecutive early node-negative T1-3N0 BC patients having SLNB from 2011 to 2020 were included in the study. Data were retrieved from the institutional Redcap database and electronic medical records. Analysis was done using Stata14.Results: SLNB was done by dual dye (methylene blue (MB) + radioisotope (RI)/indo cyanine green (ICG)) in 57.7%, MB only in 39.3%, and RI alone in 3% of patients. The identification rate (IR) and SLNB positivity rate were 96% and 27.7%, respectively. IR was highest (98%) with MB + ICG and lowest (94%) with MB alone SLNB. UltraSonoGraphy guided fine needle aspiration cytology of radiological suspicious nodes has significantly reduced the SLNB positivity rate from 34.6% to 26.4% (p < 0.01). One patient had skin necrosis, and 16 had persistent blue staining of the skin in the MB injection site. All were managed conservatively. The lymphedema rate was significantly higher (5.2%) in the ALND versus 0.5% in the SLNB alone patients (p < 0.05). In a median follow up of 27 months, the axillary recurrence rate was 0.04% (4/1,023), and false-negative rate was 0.9% in SLNB negative patients. There were 35 recurrences and 25 deaths in SLNB negative patients, with 10 years predicted disease-free survival of 81% (95% CI 66% to 89%) and overall survival of 79% (95% CI 59% to 90%).Conclusions: SLNB should be offered as an axillary staging procedure to all eligible BC patients from developing countries to avoid the morbidity associated with ALND. Fluorescent dye can be used as an alternative for RI in a resource-constrained setup.

TI  - Quantitative estimation of drainage characteristics of the Pohru Catchment, Kashmir valley, India: a remote sensing and GIS based approach
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The applicability of remotely sensed data and geographic information systems (GIS) for catchment area characterization are found of enormous utility in soil and water management. Morphometric parameters were evaluated using Digital Elevation Model to characterize the hydrological behaviour. The catchment is seventh order with sub-dendritic to sub-parallel pattern and high drainage density upstream. Youthful geomorphic stage, fine drainage texture and high runoff probability eventually influence the low lying areas. High relief and steep surface gradient makes faster surface water circulation with less water-table recharge resulting into more surface flow towards low lying areas to be severely affected by this extra amount of unusual water. Heavy rainfall and maximization of first-order streams in uplands triggers the likelihood of sudden flash-floods in the downstream areas. The stream order of the catchment is primarily regulated by the lithological and physiographical setting of the locale. The area of study under observation is designated as the seventh order catchment with the calculated drainage density value being as 3.077 km/km(2). The changing stream length proportion from lower to higher order explains that the area is yet to reach the phase of geomorphic maturity. The elongation ratio (Re) of Pohru catchment is 0.75, which indicates steep ground slope and high relief. The drainage texture of the Pohru catchment is 34.171 indicating very fine drainage texture, resulting by the impact of various geomorphological processes of the area. To minimize the catchment degradation and future risk, proper treatment should be given to the low lying areas where drainage density is naturally low and death of streams is more common due to human intervention.

TI  - Combining rapid antigen testing and syndromic surveillance improves community-based COVID-19 detection in a low-income country
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Diagnostics for COVID-19 detection are limited in many settings. Syndromic surveillance is often the only means to identify cases but lacks specificity. Rapid antigen testing is inexpensive and easy-to-deploy but can lack sensitivity. We examine how combining these approaches can improve surveillance for guiding interventions in low-income communities in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Rapid-antigen-testing with PCR validation was performed on 1172 symptomatically-identified individuals in their homes. Statistical models were fitted to predict PCR-status using rapid-antigen-test results, syndromic data, and their combination. Under contrasting epidemiological scenarios, the models' predictive and classification performance was evaluated. Models combining rapid-antigen-testing and syndromic data yielded equal-to-better performance to rapid-antigen-test-only models across all scenarios with their best performance in the epidemic growth scenario. These results show that drawing on complementary strengths across rapid diagnostics, improves COVID-19 detection, and reduces false-positive and -negative diagnoses to match local requirements; improvements achievable without additional expense, or changes for patients or practitioners.Rapid antigen tests and syndromic surveillance for identification of COVID-19 cases are limited by low sensitivity and specificity, respectively. Here, the authors use data from Bangladesh and show that combining the two methods improves diagnostic accuracy in a range of epidemiological scenarios.

TI  - Modelling Arctic coastal plain lake depths using machine learning and Google Earth Engine
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerous shallow thermokarst lakes in northern Alaska's Arctic coastal plains recently show a decline in lake abundance and area due to global warming. While in a few lakes, bathymetric surveys have been completed using sonar instruments, the majority of the lakes in the region have not been surveyed primarily because of logistical issues pertaining to the remoteness of these sites. Employing machine learning models together with Google Earth Engine (GEE), in this study, we mapped the bathymetry of hundreds of Arctic coastal lakes using Landsat-8 OLI images. Our results show that satellite-derived bathymetry is capable of retrieving depths up to 21 m, consistent with field data. Furthermore, the results show agreement to within 0.55 m mean absolute error (MAE) and 0.9 m root mean square error (RMSE), with an accuracy of over 88%. The average lake depth in the region was found to be 1.44 m. Among the various machine learning models employed, random forest (RF) outclassed both classification and regression trees (CART) and support vector machines (SVM) in estimating the depth values. High-resolution and spatially extensive bathymetric datasets developed in this study complement climate warming and degradation studies in the Arctic coastal plains.

TI  - Glacier Mass Balance Based on Two Digital Elevation Models and Ground Observation Records for the Baishui River Glacier No. 1 in Yulong Snow Mountain, Southeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier mass balance is a key idea in understanding the relationship between glaciers and climate. In this study, Landsat images, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, and Advance Land Operation Satellite digital elevation models, and ground observation records for 2000-2010 and 2019-2020 were used to analyze a mass balance of the Baishui River Glacier No. 1 (BRG1) in Yulong Snow Mountain, southeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Both glaciological and geodetic methods were used to understand the spatial pattern of the mass balance. A mass balance contour line map of the glacier was created for the first time. From 2000 to 2010, the mean annual mass balance of the BRG1 was calculated to be -0.99 m w.e., -1.01 m w.e., and -1.18 m w.e. using the contour line, profile curve, and geodetic methods, respectively. In addition, the analysis revealed that strong melting of the glacier occurred from July 27 to 15 September 2019, with an averaged glacier mass balance of -1.75 m w.e. and a mean daily melting rate of 35 mm w.e. The annual mass balance was assessed to be -1.31 m w.e. during 2019/20 using the contour line method. In addition, the spatial patterns on the mass balance contour maps for 2000-2010 and the summer of 2019, and the climate change in this region were analyzed. The results indicate that the increased air temperature was the main cause of the accelerated glacial melting.

TI  - Factors influencing the use of social media by academic librarians in Zimbabwe: a UTAUT model analysis
T2  - GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE MEMORY AND COMMUNICATION
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Purpose - This study aims to examine the use of social media by academic librarians at universities in Zimbabwe with particular focus on the application of the four key constructs of the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology model. This study assesses the degree to which academic librarians in Zimbabwe believe that using social media enhances service delivery, the extent to which academic librarians perceive social media as easy to use, the influence of peers on social media use among academic librarians and the extent to which facilitating conditions influence social media use.Design/methodology/approach - A pragmatist worldview in which both quantitative and qualitative methods were adopted, this multiple case study used face-to-fact interviews, self-administered questionnaires and content analysis for collecting data.Findings - Academic librarians in Zimbabwe perceive social media tools to be useful and easy to use in the provision of services. Social influence had a moderate effect on academic librarians' use of social media for service delivery at universities in Zimbabwe, but they feel that their supervisors do not provide enough help for them to use social media.Originality/value - To the best of the authors' knowledge, no similar study has been done previously in Zimbabwe. This multiple case study presents useful findings on the acceptance and use of social media by academic librarians in Zimbabwe.

TI  - Analysis of MTG-IRS observations and general channel selection for numerical weather prediction models
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Infrared Sounder (IRS) is an infrared Fourier transform spectrometer that will be on board the Meteosat Third Generation series of the future European Organization for the Exploitation ofMeteorological Satellites geostationary satellites and will have a unique four- dimensional look at the atmosphere. After its planned launch in 2024, it will be able to measure the radiance emitted by the Earth at the top of the atmosphere using 1,960 channels in two spectral bands between 680-1,210 cm(-1) (long-wave infrared) and 1,600-2,250 cm(-1) (mid-wave infrared) at a spectral sampling of 0.6 cm(-1). It will perform measurements over the full Earth disk with high spatial and temporal resolution of 4 km at nadir and 30 min over Europe. Thus, the huge amount of data from IRS will present challenges, particularly in data transmission, data storage, and assimilation into numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. To reduce the volume of data, various methods are available, including spatial sampling, principal component analysis, and channel selection. The latter technique will be discussed in this paper by proposing general channel selection to provide NWP models. The objective of this selection is to improve essential variables for NWP such as temperature, humidity, skin temperature, and ozone. This work has required the development of a large observation database and takes into account the main developments in assimilation techniques, including the use of full observation-error covariance matrices or the assimilation of ozone in global models, for example. This study performs a specific analysis of the sensitivity of IRS observations and proposes a first general selection of 300 channels for NWP models. This selection allows us to reduce the analysis error in the troposphere by 48% in temperature, 65% in humidity, and 17% in ozone.

TI  - GIS-based analysis of green space in urban Himalayas and modelling the effects on destination business performance
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TOURISM CITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose This paper aims to analyse the changes in the extent of the green space in the city of Srinagar, a unique urban Himalayan destination, and examine whether the difference in the green space has a significant effect on the destination business performance measured in terms of loss of ecological attractiveness. Design/methodology/approach This study was carried out in two phases in the study area. In phase I, the changes in the extent of the green space area were analysed using Landsat TM and Sentinel Images for classification. The study has used the period from 2001 to 2018 to understand changes in the green space. The Post-Classification Comparison technique was used to investigate the variation in the green space zones in the city of Srinagar. In phase II, the paper evaluated the impact of change in the green space on the destination business performance. The data was collected from the tour operation companies through a questionnaire survey, and the impact path was examined using structural equation modelling. Findings Results reveal that the green space in the city of Srinagar has decreased over the past 18 years, and the decreasing green space has a significant effect on the destination business performance. Research limitations/implications Identifying the impact of decreasing green space on the destination business performance of the study area under investigation is essential for tourism development both in terms of new product development and resource preservation. Developing a measurement scale showing the impact of decreasing green space on destination business performance could offer destination managers a means of identifying the essence of the green space in the destination regions. These findings add to the growing literature on the attributes of tourism destinations, providing scholars with new insights into the role of green space in destination performance. The current study offers evidence of the impact of decreasing green space on the destination's performance. This provides a new perspective for future studies on visitor satisfaction as a potential mediator of the relationship between reducing greenspace and destination business performance. The main limitation of this study is that the researchers have only analysed the impact of decreasing green space on the destination business performance in terms of its ecological competitiveness. Other destinations business performance verticals, such as hotels, restaurants and grocery stores were not considered by this study and can be taken up for future investigation. Practical implications This study provides empirical insights that can have significant implications for researchers, policymakers, destination management organizations, academia and practitioners and further enrich the existing literature by establishing an empirical argument in the context of urban destinations positioned with a fragile Himalayan ecosystem. Originality/value This study aims to assist the urban administrators in improving the green space ecosystem in the region, which can help attain the sustainability of the city environment and assist in economic regeneration in urban settings.

TI  - The impact of grading scheme on non-muscle invasive bladder cancer progression: potential utility of hybrid grading schemes
T2  - PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) grade is a major determinant of progression risk. The most widely utilised grading systems are the World Health Organization (WHO) 1973 and 2004 schemes. Recent publications suggest the utility of combining both into a four-tier or a hybrid three-tier system, subdividing WHO 2004 high grade into two separate categories while maintaining low grade as a single group.We identified two retrospective cohorts of bladder resections/biopsies of papillary urothelial NMIBC with long term clinical follow-up. The sentinel specimen was assessed for WHO 2004 and 1973 grade, along with pathological stage and carcinoma in situ. Each case was additionally stratified into a hybrid three-tier system (low grade; high grade, grades 2 and 3) and a four-tier system (low grade, grades 1 and 2; high grade, grades 2 and 3). Uni- and multivariable analysis for progression and event free survival (PFS/EFS) were calculated along with the time dependent area under the curve (AUC) for each grading scheme.There were 609 cases (Cohort A, n=343; Cohort B, n=266), including 449 (74%) pTa, 156 pT1 (26%) and four pTx with 338 (56%) low grade (177, grade 1; 161, grade 2) and 271 (44%) high grade (137, grade 2; 134, grade 3). A total of 108 patients progressed (17.7%): 97 high grade, (grade 3, n=59; grade 2, n=38). Multivariable analyses of PFS with the hybrid 3- and 4-tier systems showed higher Harrell's concordance indices (0.851 and 0.853, respectively) than WHO 1973 (0.844) and WHO 2004 (0.846). In both cohorts AUC values were higher (0.77-0.85) for the two hybrid grading systems compared to WHO 1973 or WHO 2004 (0.72-0.82). Similar results were seen on analysis of EFS. The data support the use of a hybrid three-tier or four-tier grading system to improve stratification of NMIBC patients.

TI  - The impact of climate change on land degradation along with shoreline migration in Ghoramara Island, India
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea level rise (SLR) due to climate change is affecting the coastline, causing shoreline changes, the degradation of mangrove forests, and the destruction of coastal resources. This is the cause of a huge amount of mangrove degradation in many parts of the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna delta. A total of 90% of people have been forced to migrate from the island due to extreme weather conditions. In this study, remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) techniques were used for LULC change and shoreline shift analyses of Ghoramara Island. LULC classification was carried out using thirty years of Landsat datasets with intervals of ten years (1990 and 2000) and intervals of five years (2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020). The classification was conducted using a supervised classification method. The field survey data were used to validate the classification results. The total area was reduced from 608 ha (in 1990) to 375 ha (in 2020) due to the extreme weather conditions. Around 39% of the land area was found to be degraded due to shoreline changes. The LULC classes of built-up area, agricultural land, water bodies, and vegetation were found to have lost around 62.345 ha, 63.328 ha, 0.836 ha, and 113.241 ha, respectively, from the year 1990-2020. It was observed that the shoreline shifted towards the northeast, north-west, and southern directions in the last thirty years. This study identified the land use changes due to shoreline shifting and proposed the appropriate to achieve the sustainable development of Ghoramara Island.

TI  - A geospatial approach for environmental risk susceptibility mapping of Khulna city in Bangladesh
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The entire coastal region of Bangladesh is highly susceptible to multiple disasters and hazards. With the increased pace of urbanization and change in climatic events, the hazard induced environmental risks are likely to increase in coastal cities and towns. Therefore, the identification of environmentally susceptible zones is very important for disaster risk reduction planning and building city resilience. This research aims to prepare the risk profile of coastal Khulna - a fast-growing metropolis and highly susceptible to multiple hazards. Three sets of Landsat images of 10 years intervals during 2000-2020 were analyzed against a dozen climatic, hydrological, geographical, and biophysical parameters/indicators derived from the literature survey. Eleven factors have been considered through the simple average method, where unequal weightage was assigned to the indicators depending on their relative role to make an area susceptible to risk. Hence, the environmental risk zones were identified after applying the Weighted Overlay Method. The finding shows that during the period the build-up areas increased by 27%, and the temperature by 2 degrees C. Additionally, an enormous increase in carbon outflows has made about 41% of additional areas susceptible to environmental risk during 2000-2020. The deterioration of environmental parameters and the risk profile is not uniform throughout the city, yet if the current trend of environmental degradation continues, it would seriously affect the resilience of Khulna city. The policy implication of this research is that the city authorities could take targeted intervention to lower specific risk and composite risk of a particular area based on informed choice.

TI  - Machine learning based modeling for future prospects of land use land cover change in Gopalganj District, Bangladesh
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - During the last decade, urban growth has been increased rapidly in Gopalganj district of Bangladesh. Therefore, this study seeks to observe fluctuations in land use and land cover (LULC) in Gopalganj with its effects over the past two decades. Through Landsat 5 (TM) and 8 (OLI) data, this research focuses on Maximum Likelihood Supervised Classification (MLSC) technique for creating land-use classes of different years. Built-up areas have increased by 21.17% over the last two decades. Urban vegetation has declined in parallel with the increase in vacant land in the district from 2000 to 2010. However, in the next ten years, it has occupied about 72.76 square km of bare-land. By using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with integrated cellular automation (CA) simulation, the model predicted that urban areas would grow by 10.88% in the central and north-western regions of the district by 2050. Urban vegetation will decrease by 4.09%, with a significant reduction in bare land and water bodies. The accuracy of the predicted LULC is 89.48% based on validation result. This prediction may help municipal and administrative authorities, urban planners to achieve a planned and sustainable future city of Gopalganj.

T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) changes are one of the world-wide variations which have the most significant effects on the natural environment and ecosystem due to human activities. Pakistan is facing enormous changes in LULC patterns without any good arrangement from the last few years. The main objective of this study is to identify the LULC changes in district Okara inat 3 different years, (2000, 2010, and 2020) using various Landsat images and to detect the reasons for the variations. Supervised classification was used to identify the LULC changes over the district of Okara, as it explains the maximum likelihood algorithm using ERDAS imagine 15 software. The total population in district Okara was 2.2 Million in 1998 that increased by 3 Million in 2017. The vegetation area was 91.6% in 2000, which decreased by 89.3% in 2020 in the study area. The built-up area was increased 4.5% from 2000 to 2020 due to the increasing population in district Okara. Overall accuracy assessment was observed 90% for 2000, 87% for 2010, and 85% for 2020 in the study area. Our result showed that, land which was used for vegetation area is changed into the build-up area due to the increasing in infrastructural and commercial areas in district Okara. As a result, proper observation of LULC changes will help the related agencies, government and policymakers for developing the land management.

TI  - Spatial mapping and monitoring thermal anomaly and radiative heat flux using Landsat-8 thermal infrared data - A case study of Lamurde hot spring, upper part of Benue trough, Nigeria
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The upper Benue trough, northeastern Nigeria is characterized by prominent geologic and tectonic features of diverse scientific and economic interest. Lamurde hot spring is located within one of several deformational structures of the trough; the Lamurde anticline. In this work, we assessed the geothermal energy potential of the area using the Thermal Infra-Red (TIR) band of Landsat-8 data. We used four datasets representing the four seasons of the year to retrieve the Land Surface Temperature (LST) by converting the pixel digital numbers into LST based on the single-channel algorithm. We also used the retrieved LST to spatially map Radiative Heat Flux (RHF) based on the Stefan-Boltzmann radiation law. We validated the results by comparing the Landsat TIR-retrieved LST with MODIS LST product of the same area using a cross-validation technique. The results indicate a reliable fitting coefficient (R-2 = 0.801) and Root Mean Square Error RMSE value of 0.756 K. Although significant seasonal variation of both LST and RHF was observed, the rock outcrops associated with the hot spring high surface temperature and heat loss anomalies for all seasons of the year. Peak LST values of 43.7 degrees C, 35.6 degrees C, 29.4 degrees C, and 27.5 degrees C were respectively recorded in January, April, July, and October from the active thermal area. The average values of RHF obtained from the active thermal area are 11.78, Wm(-2), 10.76 Wm(-2), 1.22 Wm(-2) and 0.168 Wm(-2) for January, April, July and October respectively. These are much higher than the global continental value. Comparison with known active geothermal areas from different parts of the world indicates that the area has significantly high surface geothermal parameter indicators.

TI  - Spatiotemporal dynamics of NO<sub>2</sub> concentration with linear mixed models: A Bangladesh case study
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - There is currently a limited understanding of how climatic and anthropogenic factors affect atmospheric NO2 concentration, and how these factors are associated with air pollution over space and time. Using high-resolution TROPOMI satellite data, this study estimates both the degree of association between climatic and anthropogenic factors, and the spatiotemporal variability of NO2 concentration over Bangladesh. Several linear mixed models were developed to isolate possible factors affecting the NO2 concentration values recorded between July 2018 and June 2019). This included monthly mean maximum temperature (MMAXT), rainfall, wind speed (WS), relative humidity (RH), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), population density, and distance from industrial activities. The study revealed that the very urbanized central region of Bangladesh experienced high NO2 concentrations, particularly from September through to March. Dynamic variables such as RH, MMAXT, RAIN, and WS can positively or negatively influence NO2 depending on the time of year. Areas with a high vegetation cover, a low population density, and located some distance from industrial areas tended to have low NO2 concentrations. This study concluded that policy measures such as transboundary air quality agreements, the introduction of a month-specific green tax, decentralization, industrial relocation, and increased urban tree plantation activities could all prove valuable in reducing NO2 pollution in Bangladesh.

T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents an enhanced convolutional neural network model, AgriFloodNet, to map flood-affected agricultural lands on remote sensing images. It consists of a dual patch convolutional neural network to effectively learn the permanent and flood water features from the bi-temporal Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images of Sentinel-1 and the agricultural land features from the pre-flood cloud-free multispectral images (MS) of Sentinel-2. A decision-level fusion of the processing results of multisensory images is applied to create a change map to depict flooding in agricultural lands. The proposed AgriFloodNet shows superior performance in flood mapping on the images of agricultural lands from the SEN12-FLOOD dataset with an accuracy of 98.75%. In comparison, the single-sensor solutions give accuracies of 96.88% and 91.11% for SAR and MS images, respectively. Additionally, the model has been evaluated for a new flood event in Patna, India. It is estimated that 75% of the test site was covered with agricultural lands when the flood occurred, of which 61% was affected.

TI  - Incorporating satellite remote sensing for improving potential habitat simulation of <i>Prosopis cineraria</i> (L.) Druce in United Arab Emirates
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Predicting the suitable habitat of a species is one of the adequate and enhancing approach in biodiversity conservation planning and implementation. Species habitat distribution is closely linked with environmental factors and bioclimatic variables used as prediction variables in species distribution models (SDMs). Recent application of satellite remote sensing data and the bioclimatic variables has created an advanced way to improve the SDMs performance. In this study, MaxEnt was used to predict species habitat distribution. Our objectives are to assess the application of satellite remote sensing data in predicting the potential habitat suitability of the arid plant species. We have selected Prosopis cineraria (L.) Druce (Ghaf), the national tree of the UAE. We have chosen 33 environmental variables along with 90 species occurrences and for the final model simulation we have used three modeling scenarios. MaxEnt results showed that the model simulation with all key variables has substantially improved the potential habitat suitability prediction with a mean Area Under receiver operating Curve (AUC) value of 0.984, indicating a better predictive accuracy in the integration of satellite remote sensing data, edaphic variables and topographic parameters. Model results showed that the spatial proportions of the potential habitat suitability in the UAE consisted of high (2%), medium (6%) and low (9%) habitat suitability classes. The MaxEnt results revealed that precipitation of the coldest quarter (32.5%), NDVI (12.1%) and elevation (8%), had significant contribution to the potential habitat distribution of UAE Ghaf trees. Cold season precipitation is the most significant climate constraint on the habitat distribution. The most habitat suitability of Ghaf tree in the UAE was within a certain range of NDVI, LST, elevation, aspect, and precipitation patterns. This paper finding could be useful for environmental managers for implementing reforestation not only in UAE but also for the entire middle eastern regions with similar hyper arid conditions.

TI  - pyCRTM: A python interface for the community radiative transfer model
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER
M3  - Article
AB  - The Community Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM) is a powerful and versatile scalar radiative transfer model for satellite data assimilation and remote sensing applications. It is implemented as an object oriented Fortran library, enabling flexible code development and optimal runtime performance on clusters. The downsides of the Fortran interface are a steep learning curve for students and the reduced productivity of users that is typical for static compiled languages, in contrast to dynamic interpreted languages like Python. pyCRTM is a new software framework that directly interfaces the CRTM Fortran data structures and procedures in Python, leveraging both the simplicity and ease of use of Python syntax as well as the flexibility arising from the vast contemporary Python ecosystem. The goal of pyCRTM is to lower the barrier of entry for university students to learn and use the CRTM and to boost the productivity of researchers seeking to create new methods in radiative transfer and data assimilation, or seeking to apply the CRTM to study atmospheric phenomena without having to go through the pre-existing complexity of the CRTM Fortran interface.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Male metaplastic breast cancer with poor prognosis: A case report
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF CLINICAL CASES
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND Metaplastic breast cancer (MBC) is a rare subtype of breast cancer. They constitute less than 1% of breast cancer cases and are much rarer in males. There are few reports of MBC because of its rarity. MBC, an aggressive type of cancer, is refractory to common treatment modalities of breast cancer and has a poor prognosis. CASE SUMMARY We report a case of MBC in a 78-year-old man. He visited our clinic with a palpable mass on the left breast with no masses in the axillary areas. He had previously undergone robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer, but there was no family history of malignancy. The breast mass was visible on ultrasonography, mammography, and magnetic resonance imaging, and chest computed tomography revealed a lung mass in the posterior basal segment of the right lower lobe. The patient was diagnosed with metaplastic carcinoma on core needle biopsy with lung metastasis. Total mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy and video-assisted segmentectomy of the right lung was performed. However, multiple metastases appeared 3 mo after surgery in the brain, chest, and abdomen, and the patient died 5 mo after the initial diagnosis. CONCLUSION MBC is an aggressive and extremely rare breast cancer type. Further case reports are needed to determine the optimal treatment. (c) The Author(s) 2022.

TI  - Landuse and landcover change assessment in the Upper Runde sub-catchment, Zimbabwe and possible impacts on reservoir sedimentation
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - This work assesses land cover changes on the Upper Runde sub-catchment, Zimbabwe, and associated effects on sedimentation rates and risks. The model was implemented using the common Geographic Information Systems tools. To achieve this objective, mean annual and monthly rainfall, as well as sediment data, were used (December 2016 and April 2017). Land use and land cover changes were assessed using time-series Landsat data acquired between the years 2000 and 2016. The Revised Universal Soil Loss (RUSLE) model was used to model sedimentation rates in the catchment. Land cover results showed that the catchment experienced significant (alpha = 0.05) changes during the period of monitoring. For example, forests and woodlands decreased by 39% and 23% between 2000 and 2016, respectively. Sedimentation results indicated that the catchment had an average sediment load of 6272 mg/l as compared to the expected maximum of 3000 mg/l. RUSLE soil loss simulation results showed an increase in average soil loss from 1.2 ton/ha/yr. in 2000 to 1.7 ton/ha/yr. in 2016 and an increase in sediment yield by 19.2% from 3476 mg/l in 2000-4144 mg/l in 2016. Overall, the findings of this study demonstrate that the catchment experiences high sedimentation. Therefore, catchment sediment monitoring and soil conservation actions should be a priority.

TI  - Surface urban heat islands in 932 urban region agglomerations in China during the morning and before midnight: spatial-temporal changes, drivers, and simulation
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Research was insufficient on the surface urban heat islands (SUHIs) in China during the morning and before midnight. Therefore, we studied the spatio-temporal variations and ten determinants of SUHI intensities (SUHIIs) at similar to 10:30 am and similar to 10:30 pm of 932 urban region agglomerations in the five ecological regions in China and further simulate these SUHIIs using the machine learning algorithm. The main findings were as follows. (1) The daytime SUHIIs in all regions were largest in the summer, and when the humid regions had higher SUHIIs than other regions. The maximum SUHIIs were usually significantly positively correlated with the minimum ones. (2) The SUHIIs were significantly partially correlated with the enhanced vegetation index, nighttime light intensity, PM2.5, albedo, population density, precipitation, urban area size and landscape shape index in many or a few cases. (3) The root-mean-square errors of simulated daytime and nighttime SUHIIs were mostly less than 1.22 and 2.00 degrees C, respectively.

TI  - Satellite-Based Lagrangian Model Reveals How Upwelling and Oceanic Circulation Shape Krill Hotspots in the California Current System
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the California Current System, wind-driven nutrient supply and primary production, computed from satellite data, provide a synoptic view of how phytoplankton production is coupled to upwelling. In contrast, linking upwelling to zooplankton populations is difficult due to relatively scarce observations and the inherent patchiness of zooplankton. While phytoplankton respond quickly to environmental forcing, zooplankton grow slower and tend to aggregate into mesoscale "hotspot" regions spatially decoupled from upwelling centers. To better understand mechanisms controlling the formation of zooplankton hotspots, we use a satellite-based Lagrangian method where variables from a plankton model, forced by wind-driven nutrient supply, are advected by near-surface currents following upwelling events. Modeled zooplankton distribution reproduces published accounts of euphausiid (krill) hotspots, including the location of major hotspots and their interannual variability. This satellite-based modeling tool is used to analyze the variability and drivers of krill hotspots in the California Current System, and to investigate how water masses of different origin and history converge to form predictable biological hotspots. The Lagrangian framework suggests that two conditions are necessary for a hotspot to form: a convergence of coastal water masses, and above average nutrient supply where these water masses originated from. The results highlight the role of upwelling, oceanic circulation, and plankton temporal dynamics in shaping krill mesoscale distribution, seasonal northward propagation, and interannual variability.

TI  - Detecting and mapping the spatial distribution of Chromoleana odorata invasions in communal areas of South Africa using Sentinel-2 multispectral remotely sensed data
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Alien Invasive Plants (AIPs) have been proclaimed to be a significant non-climatic driver of global change. The Siam weed (Chromoleana odorata) is highly invasive in South African rangelands, with serious environmental, agricultural and socio-economic consequences. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of C.odorata's spatial distribution is necessary for implementing relevant mitigation and management approaches to vulnerable and invaded landscapes. Remotely sensed data offer a viable opportunity for detecting and mapping AIPs spatial extents. Hence, this study sought to compare the value of algorithms (i.e. maximum likelihood and random forest) in detecting and mapping C.odorata's spatial distribution in relation to other land use land cover classes (LULC) using the freely available Sentinel-2 multispectral image data. The findings of the study revealed that the vegetation red edge and near-infrared spectral bands of Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery (MSI) sensor were the most important spectral variables for discriminating C.odorata from other land cover classes. The random forest algorithm yielded the highest overall classification accuracy of 83%, outperforming the traditional maximum likelihood classifier (75%) in classifying C.odorata's spatial distribution. Overall, results demonstrate that the combination of freely available Sentinel-2 MSI satellite data and machine learning random forest algorithm produces the highest accuracies for detecting the spatial distribution of C.odorata, particularly in heterogeneous environments. These results could be beneficial to sustainable rangeland management and the adoption of sitespecific mitigation approaches in areas invaded by C.odorata.

TI  - Assessment on controlling factors of urbanization possibility in a newly developing city of the Vietnamese Mekong delta using logistic regression analysis
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban development is dominated by various factors ranging from natural and social factors to accessibility to urban infrastructures. Urbanization in an unfavorable location in terms of the above factors can create difficulties with connecting to the city center, adjacent urban areas, and wastage of land resources. In the context of Can Tho city, a newly developing city, its urban expansion process and factors affecting urbanized possibility were explored by applying multiple logistic regression (MLR) on Landsat imagery and accessible geospatial data sources. The analyses confirmed a significant urban expansion in the entire city between 2003 and 2017, mostly in central districts and along the Hau river. The primary dynamics of urban expansion were explained by an efficient MLR (Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic - AUROC = 0.803), based on six factors related to accessibility to transportation, developed urban areas, industrial zone, elevation, soil type, and population. A simulation of urbanization probability revealed that most remote areas with low accessibility to urban infrastructures are difficult to urbanize with a probability of less than 40%. In contrast, the high potentially urbanized regions expanded the already built-up areas in riverside districts. Our findings facilitate the understanding of urbanized driven factors in the newly developing delta cities for long-term planning when urbanization remains under control.

TI  - Navigating nature's complexities through Terra MODIS information and downscaled regional climate model: Mainstreaming space-based information for drought disaster risk management
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study utilised Terra MOD13Q1 satellite data to assess drought disaster events and their spatiotemporal patterns over the Free State Province of South Africa between 2001 and 2019 for the summer, autumn, winter, and spring seasons. The study also used high-resolution downscaled climate change projections under three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP). Three future periods comprising the short (the 2030s), medium (2040s), and long term (2050s) compared to the current period are analysed to understand the potential magnitude of projected climate change-related drought. The study revealed that the year 2001 and 2016 witnessed extreme drought conditions where the drought index is between 0 and 20% across the entire province during summer, while the years 2003, 2004, 2007, and 2015 observed severe drought conditions across the region with variation from one part to the other. The result shows that from-24.5 to-25.5 latitude, the area witnessed a decrease in precipitation (80-120 mm) across the time slice and an increase in the latitude -26 degrees to -28 degrees S for summer seasons, which is more prominent in the year 2041-2050. This study emphasises the substantial spatio-environmental impacts within the province and highlights the associated factors that characterise high drought stress risk, especially on the environment and ecosystems. This study contributes to a disaster risk framework to identify areas for specific research and adaptation activities on drought disaster risk and environmental planning in the study area.

TI  - An optical water classification and quality control model (OC_QC model) for spectral diffuse attenuation coefficient
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spectral diffuse attenuation coefficient of down-welling irradiance (Kd(lambda)) is a fundamental optical parameter for water color and of significance for heat budget calculation, photosynthesis modeling and carbon sequestration. Uncertainties exist in both in situ measured and satellite derived Kd(lambda), therefore, evaluation of its data quality is essential. In addition, optical water classification of Kd(lambda) is still limited. To address these issues, we proposed an optical water classification and quality control model (OC_QC model) based on a globally collected high-quality in situ Kd(lambda) data. The model consists of the reference Kd(lambda) spectra for 7 optical water types (OWT, ranging from clear open ocean water to highly turbid water) and a scoring system. An individual Kd(lambda) spectrum can be assigned an OWT and quality control score (QC score) with this model. The performance of the OC_QC model is tested with independent in situ Kd(lambda) spectra from the turbid coastal water (Bohai Sea) and clear oceanic water (Indian Ocean). Questionable or erroneous Kd(lambda) spectra can be identified, suggesting the model's robustness. The model was also evaluated with the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) Level-2 and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Level-3 Kd(lambda) data in the Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea, East China Sea and South China Sea. Satellite derived maps clearly showed the spatial and temporal variations of OWTs and QC scores, and the regions of low-quality Kd(lambda) were reasonably extracted. Global maps of Kd(lambda)-based optical water types and corresponding QC scores were also obtained with OC_QC model. With the quality controlled Kd(lambda) data, the retrieval accuracy of Secchi disk depth was improved. The retrieval accuracies of Chlorophyll-a concentration and total seawater absorption coefficient were also improved with the Kd(lambda) optical water classification based algorithms. The OC_QC model would be valuable for evaluating Kd(lambda) data (especially the operational global Kd(lambda) products), investigation of water optical properties, and development and merging of bio-optical algorithms.

TI  - Soil moisture estimation using triangular method at higher resolution from MODIS products
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture plays a vital role in high agriculture yield and many satellite products are available to study their potentiality in soil moisture estimation. Hence, we considered a triangular network method based on MODIS products for soil moisture estimation. The reflectance data of MODIS was used to derive NDVI at 250 m and surface temperature was downscaled from 1 km to 250 m using TsHARP and TPS models. Furthermore, we have explored the applicability of the TVDI at 250 m spatial resolution to capture daily soil moisture. TVDI and in-situ soil moisture has high negative correlation (R2 = -0.80). The results show that the TVDI value on 19 January 2013 was highly co-related with in-situ soil moisture on 19 January 2013. The TVDI value after irrigation of second week of February 2013 was lower than for periods of no irrigation month (January). Therefore, mapping of soil moisture under crop condition can be possible with TVDI and satellite data input.

TI  - Woody perennial polycultures increase ant diversity and ant-mediated ecosystem services compared to conventional corn-soybean rotations
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The role plant diversity has played in regulating insect communities has been of interest for decades. Recent syntheses from agroecosystems suggest increasing plant diversity can positively affect beneficial insects like predators, reducing pest pressure and increasing yield. However, the agricultural landscape of the Midwestern United States is dominated by just two crops-corn and soybean-which cover approximately 180 million acres of arable land yearly. New ideas to conserve wildlife that additionally provide economic opportunities for farmers must be developed in order to promote sustainable and resilient ecosystems. Here we tested the capacity of an alternative cropping system to support more diverse insect populations than conventional cropping systems. We quantified differences in the diversity of an insect taxon, ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), over an annual cycle using pitfall traps in thirty-two 2-m(2) plots of either woody perennial polycultures that contained apples, chestnuts, currants, hazelnuts, and raspberries or conventional corn-soybean rotations. In doing so, we found that woody perennial polycultures supported 2.4-fold more ant species and maintained a unique fauna of specialist and predatory ants. The observed differences in diversity were linked to higher levels of predation as 18.2-fold more sentinel prey were consumed during each month of the growing season. Combined, our results suggest that agricultural landscapes in the Midwestern United States can be modified to support important beneficial insects like ants while still producing commodities that can be economically beneficial to farmers.

TI  - Mapping terrestrial ecosystem health in drylands: comparison of field-based information with remotely sensed data at watershed level
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context Combining field-based assessments with remote-sensing proxies of landscape patterns provides the opportunity to monitor terrestrial ecosystem health status in support of sustainable development goals (SDG). Objectives Linking qualitative field data with quantitative remote-sensing imagery to map terrestrial ecosystem health (SDG15.3.1 "land degradation neutrality"). Methods A field-based approach using the Interpreting Indicators of Rangeland-Health (IIRH) protocol was applied to classify terrestrial ecosystem health status at the watershed level as "healthy", "at-risk", and "unhealthy". Quantitative complex landscape metrics derived from Landsat spaceborne data were used to explore whether similar health statuses can be retrieved on a broader scale. The assignment of terrestrial ecosystem health classes based on field and the remotely sensed metrics were tested using multivariate and cluster analysis methods. Results According to the IIRH assessments, soil surface loss, plant mortality, and invasive species were identified as important indicators of health. According to the quantitative landscape metrics, "healthy" sites had lower amounts of spectral heterogeneity, edge density, and resource leakage. We found a high agreement between health clusters based on field and remote-sensing data (NMI = 0.91) when using a combined approach of DBSCAN and k-means clustering together with non-metric multi-dimensional scaling (NMDS). Conclusions We provide an exemplary workflow on how to combine qualitative field data and quantitative remote-sensing data to assess SDGs indicators related to terrestrial ecosystem health. As we used a standardized method for field assessments together with publicly available satellite data, there is potential to test the generalizability and context-dependency of our approach in other arid and semi-arid rangelands.

TI  - An assessment of water consumption patterns and land productivity and water productivity using WA plus framework and satellite data inputs
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Water Accounting Plus (WA+) framework uses open access remote sensing and GIS data and hydrological model output. This framework uses Budyko hypothesis and thus makes use of 'green' water and 'blue' water accounting. We applied the WA+ framework to the Subarnarekha basin, India, to assess the total water consumptions and land productivity (LP) and water productivity (WP) for a period of 12 years from 2003 to 2014 by using satellite and open data sources. The total water consumptions in the basin for 2013-14 (wet year) and 2010-11 (dry year) are 27.1 BCM/year and 23.1 BCM/year, respectively. The LP in the basin is found to vary from 1575 to 2141 kg/ha/year (with an average of 1921 kg/ha/year) and 1315-2325 kg/ha/year (with an average of 1948 kg/ha/year) during the period of 2003-04 to 2013-14, respectively for rainfed and irrigated cereals. Similarly, the WP is found to vary from 0.34 to 0.49 kg/m3 (with an average of 0.42 kg/m3) and 0.38-0.69 kg/m3 (with an average of 0.59 kg/m3) during the period of 2003-04 to 2013-14, respectively for rainfed and irrigated cereals. This study shows that the WA+ framework can be successfully applied for analyzing water consumption patterns, land productivity and WP of irrigated and rainfed crops individually. The results are available in map form, it is easy to identify the places/farmers with low LP and WP and work with them to improves these. Such efforts will ultimately lead to efficient management of water resources in the basin and poverty alleviation.

TI  - Psychological benefits of believing conspiracy theories
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Many people believe conspiracy theories, even though such beliefs are harmful to themselves and their social environment. What is the appeal of conspiracy theories? In this contribution, I propose that conspiracy theories have psychological benefits by imbuing perceiver's worldview with meaning and purpose in a rewarding manner. Conspiracy theories enable an alternative reality in which perceivers (a) can defend a fragile ego by perceiving themselves and their groups as important, (b) can rationalize any of their beliefs and actions as legitimate, and (c) are entertained through the opportunity to uncover a mystery in an exciting tale. These are short-term benefits, however, suggesting that conspiracy theories provide people with a form of instant gratification.

TI  - MelRisk: Using neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio to improve risk prediction models for metastatic cutaneous melanoma in the sentinel lymph node
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLASTIC RECONSTRUCTIVE AND AESTHETIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - <bold>Background: </bold>Identifying metastatic melanoma in the sentinel lymph node (SLN) is important because 80% of SLN biopsies are negative and 11% of patients develop complications. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), a biomarker of micrometastatic disease, could improve prediction models for SLN status. We externally validated existing models and developed 'MelRisk' prognostic score to better predict SLN metastasis.<bold>Methods: </bold>The models were externally validated using data from a multicenter cohort study of 1,251 adults. Additionally, we developed and internally validated a new prognostic score `MelRisk', using candidate predictors derived from the extant literature.<bold>Results: </bold>The Karakousis model had a C-statistic of 0.58 (95% CI, 0.54-0.62). The Sondak model had a C-statistic of 0.57 (95% CI 0.53-0.61). The MIA model had a C-statistic of 0.60 (95% CI. 0.56-0.64). Our 'MelRisk' model (which used Breslow thickness, ulceration, age, anatomical site, and the NLR) showed an adjusted C-statistic of 0.63 (95% CI, 0.56-0.64).<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Our prediction tool is freely available in the Google Play Store and Apple App Store, and we invite colleagues to externally validate its performance .

TI  - Incidence of Occult Breast Cancer in Carriers of <i>BRCA1/2</i> or Other High-Penetrance Pathogenic Variants Undergoing Prophylactic Mastectomy: When is Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Indicated?
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background This study sought to determine the likelihood of occult malignancy during risk-reducing mastectomy in high-penetrance pathogenic variant carriers to help refine axillary staging recommendations. Methods The authors performed a retrospective cohort study analyzing all female carriers of pathogenic variants in BRCA1/2, PALB2 or other genes who underwent prophylactic surgery at their institution between 2006 and 2021. Occult breast cancer was defined as the unanticipated presence of in situ or invasive malignancy on pathologic evaluation of prophylactic mastectomy specimens. Results Of 523 women, 243 carriers met the inclusion criteria for the study including 124 BRCA1 (51.0%), 108 BRCA2 (44.4%), and 11 PALB2, TP53, CDH1, or PTEN (4.6%) carriers. The median age was 44 years (interquartile range, 37-52 years). Overall, 128 women (52.7%) underwent bilateral prophylactic mastectomies, and 115 (47.3%) underwent contralateral prophylactic mastectomy. In the 371 mastectomies performed, 16 (4.3%) occult malignancies were diagnosed. Most of the occult malignancies were ductal carcinoma in situ (13 mastectomies, 3.5%), whereas 3 mastectomies (0.8%) contained invasive breast cancer. If Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BIRADS) 1-2 or BIRADS 3 findings were reported on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the rate of occult malignancy decreased to 3.0 and 2.8%, respectively, per mastectomy. The patient-level factors associated with a likelihood of occult breast cancer greater than 10% included a history of prior breast cancer, age exceeding 60 years, and BIRADS 4 findings on preoperative imaging. Conclusions Occult invasive malignancy was detected in less than 1% of the risk-reducing mastectomies performed for women with BRCA1/2 or PALB2 pathogenic variants. Sentinel lymph node biopsy can be safely avoided when BIRADS 1-3 findings are reported on preoperative MRI.

T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Istanbul Airport will be one of the biggest airports in the world when the construction in old open-pit mining areas which turned into wetlands is completed. To investigate the structural health monitoring of the Istanbul Airport, firstly the temporal evaluation of land use/land cover (LULC) in the region was generated for determining reclaimed lands using Random Forest classifier with Landsat images between 1984 and 2020. The outcomes were then examined with results of multi-temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) methods, namely Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) for general displacement overview and Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) for detailed analysis of the settlement rate in the airport and runways which were applied to Sentinel-1 images. Both of the methods showed similar results for the same regionsand it is determined that there are movements up to 10 mm in Runway A and Runway B and more than 20 mm subsidence in Runway C.

TI  - Spillover Effects of Built-Up Land Expansion Under Ecological Security Constraint at Multiple Spatial Scales
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-use change is a global issue, and the built-up land expansion has affected the ecological landscape patterns of the major river basins in the world. However, measurement of the ecological risks of potential landscape and identification of the dynamic relationships by natural and human-driven built-up land expansion at different zoning scales are still less understood. Based on multi-period Landsat satellite image data, we combined remote sensing (RS) and geography information systems (GIS) technologies with Spatial Durbin Panel Model to quantitatively analyze the landscape ecological effects under the built-up land expansion in the Yellow River Basin. The results showed that there is spatial heterogeneity in the built-up land expansion and ecological security patterns, with the expansion gravity center gradually spreading from the downstream to the middle and upstream areas, and the most dramatic change in landscape patches of ecological safety patterns occurring around the year 2000. At different zoning scales, there is a spatial spillover effect on the interaction between built-up land expansion and ecological security, with the significance of the regression estimates decreasing from large sample sizes to small sample sizes. Our findings highlighted the importance of spatial heterogeneity at different zoning scales in identifying the dynamic relationship between built-up land expansion and ecological security, scientific planning of land resources, and mitigation of ecological and environmental crises.

TI  - Surface downward longwave radiation estimation from new generation geostationary satellite data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface downward longwave radiation (SDLR) is a key component of the Earth's energy budget. To use newgeneration geostationary satellite data with high spatial and spectral resolution for SDLR estimation, we developed a clear-sky SDLR algorithm based on multi-channel brightness temperature (BT) and precipitable water vapor (PWV), named as MBTW, for strictly clear conditions, and a clear-sky SDLR algorithm based on atmospheric parameters (named as NewAtmos) for probably clear conditions. Then, we developed a framework to estimate all-sky SDLR; the framework combined the two clear-sky algorithms and an existing cloudy-sky algorithm. Finally, the clear-sky and all-sky SDLRs were calculated using the proposed algorithms and framework for the FY-4A and GOES-16 data. The validation results against field measurements indicated that the MBTW and NewAtmos algorithms performed well under the expected clear-sky conditions. The clear-sky SDLRs combined using MBTW and NewAtmos algorithms had RMSEs of 24.8 W/m2 and 18.3 W/m2 for the FY-4A and GOES-16 data, which is comparable to those derived using a single algorithm based on atmospheric parameters; the former portrayed better consistency with field measurements than the latter. The RMSE of instantaneous all-sky SDLR calculated using the proposed method were 24.6 W/m2 and 20.1 W/m2 for FY-4A and GOES-16 data, and they were 23.7 W/m2 and 18.3 W/m2 for the hourly SDLR. The hourly SDLR from the combined algorithms showed a better accuracy than those of the ERA5 SDLR at the same resolution, and also yielded more details of spatial variation than those from ERA5 and from single atmospheric-parameter-based algorithm, because highresolution thermal infrared (TIR) BT was used in our method. Furthermore, using ERA5 derived PWV, cloud liquid water path and ice water path produced very similar SDLR to those produced using satellite parameters; therefore, for the conditions missing satellite parameters, the ERA5 parameters can be an alternative to achieve continuous SDLR estimation.

TI  - Fast and accurate sea-land segmentation of SAR imagery based on multi-source data registration
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Targeted on accurate and efficient ship detection of Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery, sea-land segmentation is key for the complex port scenes. Despite the importance of this task, current methods are still severely influenced by several limitations, such as high level of image speckle noise, complicated backscattering characteristics. In order to overcome these issues, we propose a sea-land segmentation method of Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery based on multi-source data registration. To be specific, high-resolution optical remote sensing images and high-precision coastline vector data are integrated with Synthetic Aperture Radar images for accurate sea-land segmentation. First, the Pyramid Level-by-level Guided-Histogram of the Orientated Phase Congruency method is developed for the registration of Synthetic Aperture Radar and optical images, making two types of images into the same spatial reference. Following this, the high-precision coastline vector data collected from optical images is transferred to the Synthetic Aperture Radar image, realizing accurate sea-land segmentation. Finally, aiming at ship detection tasks, two quantitative evaluation indicators for sea-land segmentation are proposed: (1) the Absolute Segmentation Accuracy; and (2) the Ship Mis-segmentation Index. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method are tested and verified on Gaofen-3 SAR images of Yokosuka Port, Japan. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves an Absolute Segmentation Accuracy of 3.15 pixels, a Ship Mis-segmentation Index of 9.23% and processing time of 82.92 s on average, which reveals that the proposed method outperforms current popular approaches in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

TI  - Safety, pharmacokinetics, and antimalarial activity of the novel triaminopyrimidine ZY-19489: a first-in-human, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single ascending dose study, pilot food-effect study, and volunteer infection study
T2  - LANCET INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background New antimalarials with novel mechanisms of action are needed to combat the emergence of drug resistance. Triaminopyrimidines comprise a novel antimalarial class identified in a high-throughput screen against asexual blood-stage Plasmodium falciparum. This first-in-human study aimed to characterise the safety, pharmacokinetics, and antimalarial activity of the triaminopyrimidine ZY-19489 in healthy volunteers.Methods A three-part clinical trial was conducted in healthy adults (aged 18-55 years) in Brisbane, QLD, Australia. Part one was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose study in which participants enrolled into one of six dose groups (25,75,150,450,900, or 1500 mg) were randomly assigned (3:1) to ZY-19489 or placebo. Part two was an open-label, randomised, two-period cross-over, pilot food-effect study in which participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to a fasted-fed or a fed-fasted sequence. Part three was an open-label, randomised, volunteer infection study using the P falciparum induced blood-stage malaria model in which participants were enrolled into one of two cohorts, with participants in cohort one all receiving the same dose of ZY-19489 and participants in cohort two randomly assigned to receive one of two doses. The primary outcome for all three parts was the incidence, severity, and relationship to ZY-19489 of adverse events. Secondary outcomes were estimation of ZY-19489 pharmacokinetic parameters for all parts; how these parameters were affected by the fed state for part two only; and the parasite reduction ratio, parasite clearance half-life, recrudescent parasitaemia, and pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling parameters for part three only. This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12619000127101, ACTRN12619001466134, and ACTRN12619001215112).Findings 48 participants were enrolled in part one (eight per cohort for 25-1500 mg cohorts), eight in part two (four in each group, all dosed with 300 mg), and 15 in part three (five dosed with 200 mg, eight with 300 mg, and two with 900 mg). In part one, the incidence of drug-related adverse events was higher in the 1500 mg dose group (occurring in all six participants) than in lower-dose groups and the placebo group (occurring in one of six in the 25 mg group, two of six in the 75 mg group, three of six in the 150 mg group, two of six in the 450 mg group, four of six in the 900 mg group, and four of 12 in the placebo group), due to the occurrence of mild gastrointestinal symptoms. Maximum plasma concentrations occurred 5-9 h post-dosing, and the elimination half-life was 50-97 h across the dose range. In part two, three of seven participants had a treatment-related adverse event in the fed state and four of eight in the fasted state. Dosing in the fed state delayed absorption (maximum plasma concentration occurred a median of 12.0 h [range 7-5-16.0] after dosing in the fed state vs 6.0 h [4.5-9-1] in the fasted state) but had no effect on overall exposure (difference in area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 [dosing] extrapolated to infinity between fed and fasted states was -0.013 [90% CI -0.11 to 0.08]). In part three, drug-related adverse events occurred in four of five participants in the 200 mg group, seven of eight in the 300 mg group, and both participants in the 900 mg group. Rapid initial parasite clearance occurred in all participants following dosing (clearance half-life 6.6 h [95% CI 6.2-6.9] for 200 mg, 6.8 h 195% CI 6.5-7.11 for 300 mg, and 7.1 h [95% CI 6.6-7.6] for 900 mg). Recrudescence occurred in four of five participants in the 200 mg group, five of eight in the 300 mg group, and neither of the two participants in the 900 mg group. Simulations done using a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model predicted that a single dose of 1100 mg would clear baseline parasitaemia by a factor of 10(9).Interpretation The safety, pharmacokinetic profile, and antimalarial activity of ZY-19489 in humans support the further development of the compound as a novel antimalarial therapy.

TI  - Improved estimation of volcanic SO<sub>2</sub> injections from satellite retrievals and Lagrangian transport simulations: the 2019 RaikoKe eruption
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring and modeling of volcanic plumes are important for understanding the impact of volcanic activity on climate and for practical concerns, such as aviation safety or public health. Here, we apply the Lagrangian transport model Massive-Parallel Trajectory Calculations (MPTRAC) to estimate the SO2 injections into the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere by the eruption of the Raikoke volcano (48.29 degrees N, 153.25 degrees E) in June 2019 and its subsequent long-range transport and dispersion. First, we used SO2 retrievals from the AIRS (Atmospheric Infrared Sounder) and TROPOMI (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument) satellite instruments together with a backward trajectory approach to estimate the altitude-resolved SO2 injection time series. Second, we applied a scaling factor to the initial estimate of the SO2 mass and added an exponential decay to simulate the time evolution of the total SO2 mass. By comparing the estimated SO2 mass and the mass from TROPOMI retrievals, we show that the volcano injected 2.1 +/- 0.2 Tg SO2, and the e-folding lifetime of the SO2 was about 13 to 17 d. The reconstructed SO2 injection time series are consistent between using the AIRS nighttime and the TROPOMI daytime products. Further, we compared forward transport simulations that were initialized by AIRS and TROPOMI SO2 products with a constant SO2 injection rate. The results show that the modeled SO2 change, driven by chemical reactions, captures the SO2 mass variations from TROPOMI retrievals. In addition, the forward simulations reproduce the SO2 distributions in the first similar to 10 d after the eruption. However, diffusion in the forward simulations is too strong to capture the internal structure of the SO(2 )clouds, which is further quantified in the simulation of the compact SO2 cloud from late July to early August. Our study demonstrates the potential of using combined nadir satellite retrievals and Lagrangian transport simulations to further improve SO2 time-and height-resolved injection estimates of volcanic eruptions.

TI  - Developing a spatial information system of biomass potential from crop residues over India: A decision support for planning and establishment of biofuel/biomass power plant
T2  - RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - The study demonstrates effective utilization of geospatial technology to amalgamate crop statistics, satellite derived crop maps and productivity proxies to generate spatial maps of biomass potential from crop residues over a diverse country like India. District level crop production statistics were used to estimate gross biomass potential (GBP) of the selected crops (rice, wheat, sugarcane and cotton). Multi-temporal satellite data were used to generate crop maps. District level GBP was disaggregated at 1 km grid using satellite derived crop fraction and seasonal Gross Primary Production. The GBP maps were further converted to surplus biomass potential (SBP) followed by bioenergy potential using district specific surplus factors (ground survey) and crop specific calorific values respectively. These maps could capture the spatial variations of the available biomass resources and prospective zones to prioritize its utilization. The study found the presence of rice-wheat based SBP over Punjab and Haryana (>0.30 Ktonnes km-2), eastern Uttar Pradesh (0.15-0.30 Ktonnes km-2); sugarcane-wheat based SBP over western Uttar Pradesh (>0.25 Ktonnes km-2); cotton-wheat based SBP over the southern Haryana and western Punjab (>0.20 Ktonnes km-2); and sugarcane-cotton based SBP over central India and Gujarat (>0.20 Ktonnes km-2). Geospatial maps of crop residue biomass along with other thematic layers were hosted in a geoportal (BHUVAN-JAIVOORJA) with an online query module to assess the amount and types of biomass, land resources, logistics support based on user defined point of interest and fetch/buffer area towards planning/ establishment of tailor-made biofuel/biomass plants.

TI  - Sentinel node navigation surgery in cervical cancer: a systematic review and metaanalysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Sentinel node navigation surgery (SNNS) is used in clinical practice for the treatment of cervical cancer. This study aimed to elucidate the appropriate sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping method and assess the safety and benefits of SNNS. We searched the PubMed, Ichushi, and Cochrane Library databases for randomized controlled trials (RCT) and studies on SLN in cervical cancer from January 2012 to December 2020. Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. We quantitatively analyzed the detection rate, sensitivity/specificity, and complications and reviewed information, including the survival data of SLN biopsy (SLNB) without pelvic lymphadenectomy (PLND). The detection rate of SLN mapping in the unilateral pelvis was median 95.7% and 100% and in the bilateral pelvis was median 80.4% and 90% for technetium-99 m (Tc) with/without blue dye (Tc w/wo BD) and indocyanine green (ICG) alone, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of each tracer were high; the area under the curve of each tracer was 0.988 (Tc w/wo BD), 0.931 (BD w/wo Tc), 0.966 (ICG), and 0.977 (carbon nanoparticle). Morbidities including lymphedema, neurological symptoms and blood loss were associated with PLND. One RCT and five studies all showed SNNS without systematic PLND does not impair recurrence or survival in early-stage cervical cancer with a tumor size <= 2-4 cm. Both Tc w/wo BD and ICG are appropriate SLN tracers. SNNS can reduce the morbidities associated with PLND without affecting disease progression in early-stage cervical cancer.

TI  - Global, regional and seasonal analysis of total ozone trends derived from the 1995-2020 GTO-ECV climate data record
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present an updated perspective on near-global total ozone trends for the period 1995-2020. We use the GOME-type (Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment) Total Ozone Essential Climate Variable (GTO-ECV) satellite data record which has been extended and generated as part of the European Space Agency's Climate Change Initiative (ESA-CCI) and European Union Copernicus Climate Change Service (EU-C3S) ozone projects. The focus of our work is to examine the regional patterns and seasonal dependency of the ozone trend. In the Southern Hemisphere we found regions that indicate statistically significant positive trends increasing from 0.6 +/- 0.5(2 sigma) % per decade in the subtropics to 1.0 +/- 0.9 % per decade in the middle latitudes and 2.8 +/- 2.6 % per decade in the latitude band 60-70 degrees S. In the middle latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere the trend exhibits distinct regional patterns, i.e., latitudinal and longitudinal structures. Significant positive trends (similar to 1.5 +/- 1.0 % per decade) over the North Atlantic region, as well as barely significant negative trends (-1.0 +/- 1.0 % per decade) over eastern Europe, were found. Moreover, these trends correlate with long-term changes in tropopause pressure. Total ozone trends in the tropics are not statistically significant. Regarding the seasonal dependence of the trends we found only very small variations over the course of the year. However, we identified different behavior depending on latitude. In the latitude band 40-70 degrees N the positive trend maximizes in boreal winter from December to February. In the middle latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere (35-50 degrees S) the trend is maximum from March to May. Further south toward the high latitudes (55-70 degrees S) the trend exhibits a relatively strong seasonal cycle which varies from 2 % per decade in December and January to 3.8 % per decade in June and July.

TI  - A robust but straightforward phenology-based ginger mapping algorithm by using unique phenology features, and time-series Sentinel-2 images
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ginger (Zingiber officinale), a commonly used spice, dietary supplement, and medical plant, is expanding rapidly in China due to its increasing demands and price in the international market. However, the existing information on its area and spatial distribution can only be derived from statistical data, and spatially explicit maps of ginger planting areas are unavailable. We proposed a simple but robust ginger planting area mapping algorithm using the time-series Sentinel-2 images and Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Changyi city, the hotspot city with the highest ginger production in China, was selected as our study area. Two ginger indices (Ginger phenological features index and Ginger cultivating management index) were generated based on the four unique phenology features: 1) high reflectance at the start of the growing season due to white agricultural mulching films, 2) a slower green-up feature in the early season, 3) low reflectance in summer due to black sunshade nets cover, 4) a unique green feature at the end of the growing season. The accuracy assessment based on the ground truth data showed fairly reasonable overall accuracies of 96.7%-97.3%, while the Matthews correlation coefficients (MCC) were 0.871-0.924. We found a rapid ginger expansion from 63.0 km(2) in 2019 to 101.5 km(2) in 2021 in the study area, by 61% from 2019 to 2021. Moreover, about 78% of ginger land in the study area had crop rotation every two years to boost yield and prevent bacterial diseases in the soil. Our study identified four critical features of ginger and demonstrated the potential of the phenology-based approach, Sentinel-2 data, and GEE platform for ginger mapping. This study is expected to apply to regional or national ginger mapping to provide valuable information for the ginger planting plan and guide the international ginger trade.

TI  - A Sentinel-2 derived dataset of forest disturbances occurred in Italy between 2017 and 2020
T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Forests absorb 30% of human emissions associated with fossil fuel burning. For this reason, forest disturbances monitoring is needed for assessing greenhouse gas balance. However, in several countries, the information regarding the spatiotemporal distribution of forest disturbances is missing. Remote sensing data and the new Sentinel-2 satellite missions, in particular, represent a game-changer in this topic.Here we provide a spatially explicit dataset (10-meters resolution) of Italian forest disturbances and magnitude from 2017 to 2020 constructed using Sentinel-2 level-1C imagery and exploiting the Google Earth Engine GEE implementation of the 3I3D algorithm. For each year between 2017 and 2020, we provide three datasets: (i) a magnitude of the change map (between 0 and 255), (ii) a categorical map of forest disturbances, and (iii) a categorical map obtained by stratification of the previous maps that can be used to estimate the areas of several different forest disturbances. The data we provide represent the state-of-the-art for Mediterranean ecosystems in terms of omission and commission errors, they support greenhouse gas balance, forest sustainability assessment, and decision-makers forest managing, they help forest companies to monitor forest harvestings activity over space and time, and, supported by reference data, can be used to obtain the national estimates of forest harvestings and dis-turbances that Italy is called upon to provide.

TI  - Small Area Estimates for National Applications: A Database to Dashboard Strategy Using <i>FIESTA</i>
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper demonstrates a process for translating a database of forest measurements to interactive dashboards through which users can access statistically defensible estimates and analyses anywhere in the conterminous US. It taps the extensive Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) plot network along with national remotely sensed data layers to produce estimates using widely accepted model-assisted and small area estimation methodologies. It leverages a decade's worth of statistical and computational research on FIA's flexible estimation engine, FIESTA, and provides a vehicle through which scientists and analysts can share their own tools and analytical processes. This project illustrates one pathway to moving statistical research into operational inventory processes, and makes many model-assisted and small area estimators accessible to the FIA community. To demonstrate the process, continental United States (CONUS)-wide model-assisted and small area estimates are produced for ecosubsections, counties, and level 5 watersheds (HUC 10) and made publicly available through R Shiny dashboards. Target parameters include biomass, basal area, board foot volume, proportion of forest land, cubic foot volume, and live trees per acre. Estimators demonstrated here include: the simplest direct estimator (Horvitz-Thompson), model-assisted estimators (post-stratified, generalized regression estimator, and modified generalized regression estimators), and small area estimators (empirical best linear unbiased predictors and hierarchical Bayes both at the area- and unit-level). Auxiliary data considered in the model-assisted and small area estimators included maps of tree canopy, tree classification, and climatic variables. Estimates for small domain sets were generated nationally within a few hours. Exploring results across estimators and target variables revealed the progressive gains in precision using (in order of least gain to highest gain) Horvitz-Thompson, post-stratification, modified generalized regression estimators, generalized regression estimators, area-level small area models, and unit-level small area models. Substantive gains are realized by expanding model-assisted estimators beyond post-stratification, allowing FIA to continue to take advantage of design-based inference in many cases. Caution is warranted in the use of unit-level small area models due to model mis-specification. The dataset of estimates available through the dashboards provides the opportunity for others to compare estimators and explore precision expectations over specific domains and geographic regions. The dashboards also provide a forum for future development and analyses.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is considered as one of the most effective factors in urban ecology, which plays an important role in connecting urban surface energy. In urban regions, LST reveals lots of inconsistencies due to the effect of such factors as normalized difference built up index (NDBI), vegetation fraction (P-v), solar radiation, population, GDP and land use. The mono-window algorithm (MWA) was used to simulate the urban LST. We compared the results of mono-window algorithm (MWA) and radiative transfer equation (RTE), and used the MODIS LST data to verify the inversion results. The calculations showed a good correlation between MWA and RTE, and the comparison revealed that the results of MWA were also in good agreement with the MOD11A1 LST observations. At the same time, the influence of these factors on the spatial distribution of LST was also quantified by using geographic detector. The influence mechanism of these factors on the spatial distribution of LST through interaction. According to geographic detector, NDBI was the main influencing factor for the spatial distribution of urban LST, followed by vegetation fraction (P-v), land use, population density, GDP, and solar radiation. These factors showed mutual enhancement and nonlinear enhancement on the spatial distribution of LST.

TI  - Molar-incisor hypomineralisation: Knowledge and perception of Syrian undergraduate and postgraduate dental students
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DENTAL EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Dentists' knowledge and expertise, especially in their early career, are primarily shaped during undergraduate studies. This cross-sectional study aimed to assess the knowledge and perception of Syrian under- and postgraduate students regarding diagnosing and managing molar-incisor hypomineralisation (MIH)-affected teeth. Materials and Methods Final-year dental students (FY-students), postgraduates in paediatric dentistry (PD-postgraduates) and postgraduates in other lines of specialty (OS-postgraduates) in all Syrian dental schools were invited to participate in an established web-based survey covering the knowledge and attitudes regarding the prevalence, aetiology, diagnosis and management of MIH. Data were analysed with descriptive statistics and Fisher's exact/chi-squared tests at 5%. Results In total, 1142 post- and undergraduate students from six public and five private dental schools in Syria participated in this study (867 FY-students, 74 PD-postgraduates and 201 OS-postgraduates). PD-postgraduates were found to present statistically significantly better knowledge regarding MIH compared with the two other groups. Only 19% of FY-students and 54% of OS-postgraduates reported themselves familiar with MIH (compared with 97% of PD-postgraduates). Similarly, 18% of FY-students and 27% of OS-postgraduates were capable of diagnosing MIH (compared with 81% of PD-postgraduates). Stainless-steel crowns and direct composite fillings were chosen as most suitable for treating MIH-affected molars from all responders. Conclusions FY-students and even OS-postgraduates in Syria lack knowledge and confidence when confronted with MIH. The university curricula need to include more educational materials to equip the students with the necessary tools to manage MIH clinically.

TI  - Cropland abandonment and flood risks: Spatial analysis of a case in North Central Vietnam
T2  - ANTHROPOCENE
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural land abandonment due to floods has become a significant global problem, causing multiple environmental issues, deteriorating rural landscapes, and impacting the socioeconomic conditions of farmers. Although research on agricultural abandonment has addressed different spatial scales, very few studies have focused on Southeast Asian countries, particularly Vietnam, where abandonment rates have significantly increased due to flooding and urbanization. This study assessed the drivers of land abandonment in a river valley in Central Vietnam. The analysis comprised: 1) quantifying changes in land use/cover using satellite data; 2) conducting socioeconomic field surveys; 3) simulating flooding using a 2013 dataset on flood occurrences; and 4) mapping community resilience. Results suggested that the tendency of farmers to abandon agricultural land in high-flood zones and community resilience were vital factors influencing agricultural land outcomes. From a planning perspective, findings of this study highlight the potential for spatial planning to limit the adverse effects of flood events. This approach provides a consistent framework for further research on landscape and agricultural management in similar regions around the world. It is also applicable for other economically developing countries.

TI  - A cross-sectional study evaluating cardiovascular risk and statin prescribing in the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network database
T2  - BMC PRIMARY CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Canada. Assessment and management of CVD risk is essential in reducing disease burden. This includes both clinical risk factors and socioeconomic factors, though few studies report on socioeconomic status in relation to CVD risk and treatment. The primary objective of this study was to estimate the cardiovascular risk of patients attending primary care practices across Canada; secondly, to evaluate concordance with care indicators suggested by current clinical practice guidelines for statin prescribing according to patients' cardiovascular risk and socioeconomic status. Methods This cross-sectional observational study used the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN) database, which is comprised of clinical data from primary care electronic medical records. Patients aged 35-75y with at least one visit to their primary care provider between 2012 and 2016 were included. Patients were assigned to a CVD risk category (high, medium, low) and a deprivation quintile was calculated for those with full postal code available. Descriptive analyses were used to determine the proportion of patients in each risk category. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the consistency of statin prescribing according to national clinical guidelines by risk category and deprivation quintile. Results A total of 324,526 patients were included. Of those, 116,947 (36%) of patients were assigned to a high CVD risk category, primarily older adults, males, and those with co-morbidities. There were statistically significant differences between least (quintile 1) and most (quintile 5) deprived socioeconomic quintiles, with those at high CVD risk disproportionately in Q5 (odds ratio 1.4). Overall, 48% of high-risk patients had at least one statin prescription in their record. Patients in the lower socioeconomic groups had a higher risk of statin treatment which deviated from clinical guidelines. Conclusions Primary care patients who are at high CVD risk are more often male, older, have more co-morbidities and be assigned to more deprived SES quintiles, compared to those at low CVD risk. Additionally, patients who experience more challenging socioeconomic situations may be less likely to receive CVD treatment that is consistent with care guidelines.

TI  - Cerebral protection during percutaneous intervention for left ventricular assist device outflow graft obstruction
T2  - CATHETERIZATION AND CARDIOVASCULAR INTERVENTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) outflow graft obstruction is an uncommon complication but carries significant morbidity and mortality. Here we provide a case series of patients with LVAD intrinsic outflow graft obstruction who are deemed to be a high surgical risk for pump exchange and, therefore, underwent percutaneous intervention with the concomitant use of neuroprotective device-Sentinel cerebral protection system (CPS) (Boston Scientific) to prevent embolic stroke. Methods We retrospectively analyzed patients who underwent LVAD placement in our institution and developed LVAD outflow graft obstruction. The diagnosis of LVAD outflow graft obstruction was confirmed by utilizing various cardiac imaging modalities such as echocardiography and/or computed tomography angiography. All patients were treated with percutaneous intervention and a catheter-based CPS. Results From a total of 501 LVAD implants in our institute, 6 (1.2%) patients with LVAD outflow graft obstruction who underwent percutaneous treatment were included; 4 patients with HeartMate-III LVAD, 1 patient with HeartMate-II LVAD, and 1 patient with HeartWare (HVAD). The median age of patients was 56.5 years at the time of LVAD implantation. The median time from the LVAD implantation to the episode of LVAD outflow obstruction was 1343 days. Utilization of Sentinel CPS resulted in the capture and removal of thrombus/debris in all patients. Conclusions Percutaneous intervention of LVAD outflow graft obstruction is less invasive than surgical pump exchange and an acceptable alternative in properly selected patients. In our experience, utilization of a catheter-based CPS can help in reducing the incidence of periprocedural embolic events.

TI  - Treatments approved, boosts eschewed: Moral limits of neurotechnological enhancement
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In six vignette-based experiments, we assessed people's moral reactions towards various cognition-enhancing brain implants, including their overall approval and perceived fairness, as well as the dehumanization of brain-implanted agents. Across the domains of memory (Studies 1-4, 6), general intelligence (Study 5A), and emotional stability (Study 5B), people in general approved of alleviating ailments, and even of attaining optimal human performance, but expressed greater opposition towards superhuman levels of enhancement. Further analyses of individual differences indicated that the tendency to condemn transhumanist technologies, such as brain implants, was linked to sexual disgust sensitivity and the binding moral foundations - two characteristic correlates of a conservative worldview. In turn, exposure to science fiction was tied to greater approval of brain implants. We also examined potential idiosyncrasies associated with our stimulus materials and did not find reliable effects of any secondary factors on moral attitudes. Taken together, our studies reveal certain moral boundaries to neurotechnological enhancement, strong among those with conservative affective and moral dispositions but relaxed among those familiar with science fiction themes.

TI  - A method to derive satellite PAR albedo time series over first-year sea ice in the Arctic Ocean
T2  - ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE
M3  - Article
AB  - Deriving sea ice albedo from spaceborne platforms is of interest to model the propagation of the photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) through Arctic sea ice. We show here that use of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) operational surface reflectance satellite product to derive albedo in the PAR spectral range is possible. To retrieve PAR albedo from the remote sensing surface reflectance, we trained a predictive model based on a principal component analysis with in situ and simulated data. The predictive model can be applied to first-year sea ice surfaces such as dry snow, melting snow, bare ice and melt ponds. Based on in situ measurements and the prescribed atmospheric correction uncertainty, the estimated PAR albedo had a mean absolute error of 0.057, a root mean square error of 0.074 and an R-2 value of 0.91. As a demonstration, we retrieved PAR albedo on a 9-km(2) area over late spring and early summer 2015 and 2016 at a coastal location in Baffin Bay, Canada. On-site measurements of PAR albedo, melt pond fraction and types of precipitation were used to examine the estimated PAR albedo time series. The results show a dynamic and realistic PAR albedo time series, although clouds remained the major obstacle to the method. This easy-to-implement model may be used for the partitioning of PAR in the Arctic Ocean and ultimately to better understand the dynamics of marine primary producers.

TI  - Deep learning-based individual tree crown delineation in mangrove forests using very-high-resolution satellite imagery
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests are vulnerable ecosystems that require broad-scale monitoring. Various solutions based on satellite imagery have emerged for this purpose but still suffer from the lack of methods to accurately delineate individual tree crowns (ITCs). Within-stand variability in crown size and shape, crown clumping and fragmentation, and understory vegetation hamper the delineation in these ecosystems. To cope with these factors, the proposed method combines a deep learning-based enhancement of ITCs with a marker-controlled watershed segmentation algorithm. The MT-EDv3 neural network is employed to compute the normalized Euclidean distance of crown pixels to treetops and a Laplacian of Gaussian filter is applied to the resulting image to enhance crown borders before segmentation. The method was applied to WorldView imagery over four mangrove sites worldwide and compared to previously published methods using standardized metrics. Accurate detection (Overall Accuracy > 0.93 and Kappa > 0.87) and area estimation (R2 > 0.66, NRMSE <= 12%) of crowns was achieved for all sites using either the panchromatic band or a combination of the pan-sharpened visible-nearinfrared bands. Based on Precision, Recall, and F1-score, the proposed method outperformed previous watershed segmentation and software-based algorithms of crown delineation, as well as the Mask R-CNN segmentation framework. The viewing geometry of images and the forest heterogeneity were identified as important contributors to the delineation accuracy. This study is the first to achieve accurate delineation of ITCs in mangrove forests across sites, opening perspectives of applications to satellite-based monitoring. The method shows promising transferability to other very-high-resolution satellite sensors as well as to aerial and unmanned aerial vehicle imagery and could be improved by including more spectral information and LiDAR-derived canopy height models.

TI  - Construction and application of comprehensive drought monitoring model considering the influence of terrain factors: a case study of southwest Yunnan, China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Droughts in winter and spring are one of the most prominent natural disasters in the Yunnan Province in China. They occur frequently, with long durations and have a wide range of damage, which has a serious impact on social and economic development, as well as agricultural production and, therefore, strongly impacts the lives of the people living in the region. The traditional drought monitoring model does not take terrain into consideration, thereby affecting the comparative nature of results, as baseline conditions are not the same. Therefore, this study proposed a comprehensive drought monitoring model considering the influence of terrain factors to improve the evaluation effect. Firstly, based on NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM 3B43) data, vegetation condition index (VCI), temperature condition index (TCI), precipitation condition index (TRCI), and three terrain factors ground elevation (DEM), slope (SLOPE), aspect (ASPECT) were selected as model parameters. Then, a comprehensive drought monitoring model without considering terrain factors (Model A) and a comprehensive drought monitoring model of considering terrain factors (Model B) were constructed by using multiple linear regression models. Finally, the effects of the two models were evaluated by using standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) in southwest Yunnan Province, China, and model B was used to analyze the drought in winter and spring in the study area from 2008 to 2019. The results showed that (1) the correlation coefficient of model B was higher than that of model A in winter and spring and the standard error of model B was lower than that of model A. (2) The grade consistency rate of Model A and SPEI was 0.92 in winter and 0.33 in spring; the grade consistency between model B and SPEI was 0.83 in winter and 0.75 in spring, and therefore the monitoring effect of model B was more stable. (3) There were periodic droughts during the study period, and the degree of drought in spring was less than in winter. Medium and severe droughts were observed in winter. Thus, this study concluded that the effect of terrain has an important influence on the evaluation of droughts. The comprehensive drought monitoring model which considers topographic factors can effectively identify the occurrence of drought, and therefore provide significant input with regards to disaster prevention and mitigation policies in southwest Yunnan.

TI  - Construction of a magnetic-fluorescent-plasmonic nanosensor for the determination of MMP-2 activity based on SERS-fluorescence dual-mode signals
T2  - BIOSENSORS & BIOELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) is a crucial biomarker of tumor growth, invasion and metastasis. In the present study, a core-satellite magnetic-fluorescent-plasmonic nanosensor (FMNS@Au) was constructed through biological self-assembly to generate localized SERS "hot spots" and an efficient FRET system for the sensitive determination of MMP-2 activity in a SERS-fluorescence dual-mode assay. In this hybrid nanosensor, a biotinlabeled peptide containing a specific MMP-2 substrate (PLGVR) was employed as a bridge for the assembly of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and avidin functionalized fluorescent-magnetic nanospheres (FMNS). The modified RB on FMNS served as a Raman reporter and a donor of FRET, while the AuNPs assembled on FMNS acted as SERS substrates and acceptors of FRET. In the presence of MMP-2, the SERS "hot spot" effect was weakened and the FRET system was disrupted through enzymatic cleavage of PLGVR, resulting in a reduction of SERS signal and the recovery of fluorescence emission. Importantly, this combination of SERS and fluorescence assay methods in the dual-mode nanosensor broadened the detection range for MMP-2 to 1-200 ng mL-1, with a limit of detection of 0.35 ng mL-1 and a limit of quantitation of 1.17 ng mL-1. In addition, our novel nanosensor affords semi-quantitative sensing of MMP-2 by naked-eye observation and accurate detection of MMP-2 through dual-mode analysis. The practicality of FMNS@Au was validated by determination of MMP-2 activity in cell secretions and human serum samples. The designed FMNS@Au nanosensor holds great potential for clinical diagnosis of protease-related diseases.

TI  - The structural dimensions and community vibrancy: An exploratory analysis in Guangzhou, China
T2  - CITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Most of the existing studies captured the social and ambient elements of urban built environment, but rarely have the structural elements that influence community vibrancy been addressed. In this paper, we composed indices to assess community vibrancy in Guangzhou, China using population density, social- intensity, and economic activity intensity. We then utilized the Local Entropy Map and Random Forest Regression to investigate the spatialtemporal variation of vibrancy and how it relates to the communities' structural and social & ambient elements using social and remote sensing data. We found their relationships to be spatially dependent and contrasting between functionally different regions. Our analysis at the wholistic level revealed that the vibrancy of the city was influenced more by the social & ambient elements, while analysis at the functional-region level showed this to be also true for the commercial regions of the city, that of residential regions was influenced more by the structural elements. We argue that urban vibrancy should be treated at the functional- region level, and that the importance of structural elements and social and ambient elements should both be recognized in urban research and the policy-making process.

TI  - Large loss and rapid recovery of vegetation cover and aboveground biomass over forest areas in Australia during 2019-2020
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Australia experienced multi-year drought and record high temperatures, and massive forest fires occurred across the southeast in 2019 and early 2020. In the fire-affected forest areas, understory and often tree canopies were burned, and in-situ observations in late 2020 reported rapid vegetation recovery, including grasses, shrubs, and tree canopies from burned-but-not-dead eucalyptus trees. Considering the strong fire resilience and resistance of eucalyptus trees and above-average rainfall in 2020, we assessed how much and how quickly vegetation structure and biomass changed from loss to post-fire and drought recovery in 2020 for all forest areas in Australia. Here, we analyzed space-borne optical, thermal, and microwave images to assess changes in the structure and function of vegetation using four vegetation indices (VIs), leaf area index (LAI), solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), gross primary production (GPP), and aboveground biomass (AGB). We found that all eight variables show large losses in 2019, driven by fires and climate (drought and high temperature), but large gains in 2020, resulting from the high resilience of most trees to fire and rapid growth of understory vegetation under wet condition in 2020. In 2019, the forest area has an AGB loss of 0.20 Pg C, which is similar to 15% of the pre-fire AGB. Attribution analyses showed that both fire and climate (prior and co-occurring severe drought and record high temperatures) are responsible for the AGB loss in 2019, approximately 0.09 Pg C (fire) and 0.11 Pg C (climate), respectively. In 2020, the forest area has a total AGB gain of 0.26 Pg C, composed of 0.22 Pg C from fire-affected forest area and 0.04 Pg C from fire-unaffected forest area. Fire-adapted Eucalyptus forests and above-average annual precipitation in 2020 brought by a moderate La Nina drove the recovery of vegetation cover, productivity, and AGB. The results from this study shows the potential of multiple sensors for monitoring and assessing the impacts of fire and climate on the forest areas in Australia and their post-fire recovery.

TI  - Building spectral catalogue for salt marsh vegetation, hyperspectral and multispectral remote sensing
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes are coastal wetlands dominated by the grasslands and they are one among the most productive coastal ecosystems which provide several benefits and multiple ecosystem services. Their spatial distribution is at risk due to wide range of human activities and sea level rise. Remote sensing technique can be applied to assess their spatial coverage in quick time. Field spectrometry, an accessory tool of remote sensing, measures the reflectance using spectroradiometer to acquire continuous spectrum from a target. Developing spectral catalogue for salt marsh vegetation is essential to discriminate the vegetation into species level. In the present study, species canopy spectral signatures for seven salt marsh species were measured using spectroradiometer. Several post-processing steps were conducted for noise removal and the spectral catalogue was developed. In addition, Landuse/Landcover (LULC) spectral signatures for salt marsh vegetation were acquired from Multispectral data ofSentinel-2B satellite in near real-time using field ground truth coordinates. The species canopy and LULC spectral signatures were applied in the MSI data to perform species level classification of salt marsh vegetation. The results were significant, and indicated an overall accuracy of 65.8%, and 73.55% for species canopy and LULC spectral signatures respectively. The spectral outcome of this study can be utilized directly for rapid classification and to assess the change in the dynamics of salt marsh ecosystems for the areas with low accessibility. Further the mapping results can be used as baseline information for change detection analysis which would support coastal resources management, and help in strengthening the regulatory framework for protection and conservation purposes.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Fusing Earth observation and socioeconomic data to increase the transferability of large-scale urban land use classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring and understanding urban development requires up-to-date information on multiple urban land-use classes. Manual classification and deep learning approaches based on very-high resolution imagery have been applied successfully, but the required resources limits their capacity to map urban land use at larger scales. Here, we use a combination of open-source satellite imagery, constituting of data from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, and socioeconomic data, constituting of points-of-interest and spatial metrics from road networks to classify urban land-use at a national scale, using a deep learning approach. A related challenge for large-scale mapping is the availability of ground truth data. Therefore, we focus our analysis on the transferability of our classification approach, using ground truth labels from a nationwide land-use dataset for the Netherlands. By dividing the country into four regions, we tested whether a combination of satellite data and socioeconomic data increases the transferability of the classification approach, compared to using satellite data only. The results indicate that socioeconomic data increases the overall accuracy of the classification for the Netherlands by 3 percentage points. In a transfer learning approach we find that adding socioeconomic data increases the accuracy between 3 and 5 percentage points when trained on three regions and tested on the independent fourth one. In the case of training and testing on one region and testing on another, the increase in overall accuracy increased up to 9 percentage points. In addition, we find that our deep learning approach consistently outperforms a random forest model, used here as benchmark, in all of the abovementioned experiments. Overall, we find that socioeconomic data increases the accuracy of urban land use classification, but variations between experiments are large.

TI  - Synergy of Using Nadir and Limb Instruments for Tropospheric Ozone Monitoring (SUNLIT)
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite measurements in nadir and limb viewing geometry provide a complementary view of the atmosphere. An effective combination of the limb and nadir measurements can give new information about atmospheric composition. In this work, we present tropospheric ozone column datasets that have been created using a combination of total ozone columns from OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) and TROPOMI (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument) with stratospheric ozone column datasets from several available limb-viewing instruments: MLS (Microwave Limb Sounder), OSIRIS (Optical Spectrograph and InfraRed Imaging System), MIPAS (Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding), SCIAMACHY (SCanning Imaging Spectrometer for Atmospheric CHartographY), OMPS-LP (Ozone Mapping and Profiles Suite - Limb Profiler), and GOMOS (Global Ozone Monitoring by Occultation of Stars).We have developed further the methodological aspects of the assessment of tropospheric ozone using the residual method supported by simulations with the chemistry transport model SILAM (System for Integrated modeLling of Atmospheric coMposition). It has been shown that the accurate assessment of ozone in the upper troposphere and the lower stratosphere (UTLS) is of high importance for detecting the ground-level ozone patterns.The stratospheric ozone column is derived from a combination of ozone profiles from several satellite instruments in limb-viewing geometry. We developed a method for the data homogenization, which includes the removal of biases and a posteriori estimation of random uncertainties, thus making the data from different instruments compatible with each other. The high-horizontal- and vertical-resolution dataset of ozone profiles is created via interpolation of the limb profiles from each day to a 1 degrees x 1 degrees horizonal grid. A new kriging-type interpolation method, which takes into account data uncertainties and the information about natural ozone variations from the SILAM-adjusted ozone field, has been developed. To mitigate the limited accuracy and coverage of the limb profile data in the UTLS, a smooth transition to the model data is applied below the tropopause. This allows for the estimation of the stratospheric ozone column with full coverage of the UTLS. The derived ozone profiles are in very good agreement with collocated ozonesonde measurements.The residual method was successfully applied to OMI and TROPOMI clear-sky total ozone data in combination with the stratospheric ozone column from the developed high-resolution limb profile dataset. The resulting tropospheric ozone column is in very good agreement with other satellite data. The global distributions of tropospheric ozone exhibit enhancements associated with the regions of high tropospheric ozone production.The main datasets created are (i) a monthly 1 degrees x 1 degrees global tropospheric ozone column dataset (from ground to 3 km below the tropopause) using OMI and limb instruments, (ii) a monthly 1 degrees x 1 degrees global tropospheric ozone column dataset using TROPOMI and limb instruments, and (iii) a daily 1 degrees x 1 degrees interpolated stratospheric ozone column from limb instruments.Other datasets, which are created as an intermediate step of creating the tropospheric ozone column data, are (i) a daily 1 degrees x 1 degrees clear-sky and total ozone column from OMI and TROPOMI, (ii) a daily 1 degrees x 1 degrees homogenized and interpolated dataset of ozone profiles from limb instruments, and (iii) a daily 1 degrees x 1 degrees dataset of ozone profiles from SILAM simulations with adjustment to satellite data.These datasets can be used in various studies related to variability and trends in ozone distributions in both the troposphere and the stratosphere. The datasets are processed from the beginning of OMI and TROPOMI measurements until December 2020 and are planned to be regularly extended in the future.

TI  - Mapping Annual Urban Evolution Process (2001-2018) at 250 m: A normalized multi-objective deep learning regression
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Global urbanization changes land cover patterns and affects the living environment of humans. However, urbanization and its evolution process, i.e., conversions among diverse land covers, are hard to measure, as existing land cover maps usually have low temporal resolutions; conversely, long-term and temporally dense land cover maps, such as vegetation-impervious-soil decomposition maps base on MODIS, ignore the important land cover of cropland in urban evolution process (UEP). To resolve the issue, this study suggests a novel model named time extended non-crop vegetation-impervious-cropland (Time V-I-C) to represent and quantify different stages of UEP; then, a normalized multi-objective T-ConvLSTM (NMT) method is proposed to unmix cropland, non-crop vegetation, and impervious based on the intra-annual remotely-sensed time series, and obtain their fractions in each pixel for generating UEP maps. Consequently, UEP maps from 2001 to 2018 are generated for two Chinese urban agglomerations, i.e., Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and Yangtze River Delta urban agglomerations. The mapping results have high accuracies with a small standard error of regression (SER) of 13.1%, small root mean square error (RMSE) of 12.6%, and small mean absolute error (MAE) of 8.4%, and the maps reveal the different UEP in the two urban agglomerations. Therefore, this study provides a new idea for expressing UEP and contributes to a wide range of urbanization studies and sustainable city development.

TI  - Global total ozone recovery trends attributed to ozone-depleting substance (ODS) changes derived from five merged ozone datasets
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We report on updated trends using different merged zonal mean total ozone datasets from satellite and ground-based observations for the period from 1979 to 2020. This work is an update of the trends reported in Weber et al. (2018) using the same datasets up to 2016. Merged datasets used in this study include NASA MOD v8.7 and NOAA Cohesive Data (COH) v8.6, both based on data from the series of Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet (SBUV), SBUV-2, and Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS) satellite instruments (1978-present), as well as the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME)-type Total Ozone - Essential Climate Variable (GTOECV) and GOME-SCIAMACHY-GOME-2 (GSG) merged datasets (both 1995-present), mainly comprising satellite data from GOME, SCIAMACHY, OMI, GOME-2A, GOME-2B, and TROPOMI. The fifth dataset consists of the annual mean zonal mean data from ground-based measurements collected at the World Ozone and Ultraviolet Radiation Data Centre (WOUDC).Trends were determined by applying a multiple linear regression (MLR) to annual mean zonal mean data. The addition of 4 more years consolidated the fact that total ozone is indeed slowly recovering in both hemispheres as a result of phasing out ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) as mandated by the Montreal Protocol. The near-global (60 degrees S-60 degrees N) ODS-related ozone trend of the median of all datasets after 1995 was 0.4 +/- 0.2 (2 sigma) %/decade, which is roughly a third of the decreasing rate of 1.5 +/- 0.6 %/decade from 1978 until 1995. The ratio of decline and increase is nearly identical to that of the EESC (equivalent effective stratospheric chlorine or stratospheric halogen) change rates before and after 1995, confirming the success of the Montreal Protocol. The observed total ozone time series are also in very good agreement with the median of 17 chemistry climate models from CCMI-1 (Chemistry-Climate Model Initiative Phase 1) with current ODS and GHG (greenhouse gas) scenarios (REF-C2 scenario).The positive ODS-related trends in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) after 1995 are only obtained with a sufficient number of terms in the MLR accounting properly for dynamical ozone changes (Brewer-Dobson circulation, Arctic Oscillation (AO), and Antarctic Oscillation (AAO)). A standard MLR (limited to solar, Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO), volcanic, and El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)) leads to zero trends, showing that the small positive ODS-related trends have been balanced by negative trend contributions from atmospheric dynamics, resulting in nearly constant total ozone levels since 2000.

TI  - Improving landscape-scale productivity estimates by integrating trait-based models and remotely-sensed foliar-trait and canopy-structural data
T2  - ECOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing the impacts of anthropogenic degradation and climate change on global carbon cycling is hindered by a lack of clear, flexible and easy-to-use productivity models along with scarce trait and productivity data for parameterizing and testing those models. We provide a simple solution: a mechanistic framework (RS-CFM) that combines remotely-sensed foliar-trait and canopy-structural data with trait-based metabolic theory to efficiently map productivity at large spatial scales. We test this framework by quantifying net primary productivity (NPP) at high-resolution (0.01-ha) in hyper-diverse Peruvian tropical forests (30040 hectares) along a 3322-m elevation gradient. Our analysis captures hotspots and elevational shifts in productivity more accurately and in greater detail than alternative empirical- and process-based models that use plant functional types. This result exposes how high-resolution, location-specific variation in traits and light competition drive variability in productivity, opening up possibilities to fully harness remote sensing data and reliably scale up from traits to map global productivity in a more direct, efficient and cost-effective manner.

TI  - Data Mining of a Geoscience Database Containing Key Features of Gold Deposits and Occurrences in Southwestern Uganda: A Pilot Study
T2  - NATURAL RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Data mining is a promising new tool in mineral exploration. Here, we combined data-mining procedures with spatial prediction modeling for gold exploration targeting in the Buhweju area in southwestern Uganda. It was employed in a data-rich context of unavoidably partly redundant and correlated information that offered challenges in extracting significant relationships. Our study utilized a database of co-registered digital maps related to gold mineralization. It comprised Landsat TM, Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM), and geophysical (radiometric and magnetic) datasets for geological and structural mapping. The locations of 15 orogenic gold deposits and 87 gold occurrences were obtained from the Geological Survey of Uganda database. These were considered direct evidence of the presence of gold mineralization. The geological and geophysical settings at the gold deposit/occurrences locations were based on geological units as host rocks, contacts, and structural elements, together with continuous field values of geophysics, radiometry, and other remotely sensed imagery. A gold exploration targeting proposition (T-p) was defined as: "That a point p within the study area contains a gold deposit given the presence of spatial evidence." All outstanding combinations of spatial evidence were obtained using empirical likelihood ratios. With a data-mining strategy, the ratios were filtered and modeled to identify stronger spatial associations, to rank the study area according to the likelihood of future discoveries, to represent ranking quality, to estimate associated uncertainty, and to select prospective target areas. The empirical likelihood ratios facilitated a transparent strategy for generating prediction patterns and extracting small prospective target areas with higher likelihood of discovery and lower-ranking uncertainty. Conclusions are provided on the knowledge extraction for prospectivity with further data and the challenges of reducing the arbitrariness of decisional steps.

TI  - Participation in paid and unpaid work one year after injury and the impact of subsequent injuries for Maori: Results from a longitudinal cohort study in New Zealand
T2  - INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Indigenous populations experience greater injury burdens than non-indigenous groups. This paper investigated, for injured M aori (New Zealand's indigenous population): 1) participation in paid and unpaid work 12 months after injury, 2) whether subsequent injuries are predictive of reduced participation, and 3) if particular characteristics of subsequent injuries predict reduced participation.Methods: The Subsequent Injury Study utilised data from the earlier Prospective Outcomes of Injury Study, a study of 2856 injured New Zealanders (including 566 M aori; 20%) who had an Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC; New Zealand's no-fault injury insurer) entitlement claim (sentinel injury). Data about subsequent injuries reported to ACC and hospital discharge data for injuries resulting in hospitalisation were also utilised. Multivariable models were used to examine if certain aspects of subsequent injury predicted either of two outcomes - reduced participation in paid, and unpaid work 12 months after a sentinel injury.Results: Eligible participants were identified from the 405 M aori participants interviewed at 12 months. Thirty-two percent sustained at least one ACC subsequent injury, and 16% reported reduced participation in unpaid work. Of the eligible participants working for pay at the time of their sentinel injury, 35% reported reduced participation in paid work. Although the relationship between sustaining a subsequent injury (or not) and reduced participation in paid work was unclear (aRR 1.4, 95%CI 0.9,2.3), particular subsequent injury characteristics were identified as being independently predictive: subsequent injury resulting from an assault (aRR 2.4, 95%CI 1.2,4.9), a subsequent injury involving an entitlement claim (aRR 2.0, 95%CI 1.1,3.4), sustaining more than one subsequent injury (aRR 2.0, 95%CI 1.1,3.6), and only non-work-related subsequent injuries (aRR 1.6, 95%CI 1.0,2.7).Conclusions: Reduced participation in paid work is prevalent for M aori after an ACC entitlement claim injury. Particular characteristics of subsequent injuries after such an event impacts on participation in paid work 12 months after the sentinel injury, but the picture is less clear for unpaid work. Understanding the changes in paid and unpaid work, and the predictive characteristics of subsequent injuries for injured M aori, is important for future injury prevention strategies and supporting return to work rehabilitation programmes, specifically for M aori.0 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Enhanced mangrove vegetation index based on hyperspectral images for mapping mangrove
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As a specific forest community in tropical and subtropical coastal zones, mangrove has unique ecological functions and great social and economic value. Accurate mangrove mapping is important to the protection and restoration of mangrove ecosystem. Traditional classification methods rely on a large number of samples and complex classifiers, which are unsuitable for the large-scale extraction of mangroves because of low computational efficiency and poor generalization ability. This study proposes an Enhanced Mangrove Vegetation Index (EMVI) based on hyperspectral images. This index enhances the difference in greenness and canopy moisture content between mangroves and other vegetation using a green band and two shortwave-infrared bands in the form (Green-SWIR2)/(SWIR1-Green). Six typical mangrove areas (i.e., Qinglan Harbor in Hainan, Zhenzhu Harbor-Fangcheng Harbor in Guangxi, Lianzhou Bay in Guangxi, Zhangjiang Estuary in Fujian, Quanzhou Bay in Fujian, and Oujiang Estuary in Zhejiang) were selected as the study areas, and sample datasets were produced by field surveys and Google Earth high-resolution images. Compared with other VIs, such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Enhanced Vegetation Index, Moisture Stress Index, Mangrove Vegetation Index, and Combined Mangrove Recognition Index, EMVI exhibited better ability to distinguish mangroves and other vegetation. EMVI was applied to mangrove extraction in the six study areas based on ZY1-02D images, and the extraction results were compared with existing mangrove maps (GMW_2016 and CAS_Mangrove 2015) and the results of SVM. Results showed that EMVI featured the better overall accuracy and the Kappa coefficient than existing mangrove maps and the performance was similar to SVM. Further tests showed that EMVI was also suitable to other hyperspectral remote sensing images (i.e., GF-5, Hyperion, and PRISMA), but not to Sentinel-2 images. These results indicate that EMVI can be applied to different hyperspectral remote sensing images and different types of mangrove extraction. This index also has excellent application potential in mangrove mapping.

TI  - Unusual Mass Appearance of <i>Salpa fusiformis</i> (Thaliacea: Salpida) in Early Spring at a Nuclear Power Plant at Mid-western Boundary of the East Sea
T2  - OCEAN SCIENCE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In the spring of 2021, a large number of Salpa fusiformis suddenly appeared along the east coast of the Korean Peninsula and invaded a nuclear power plant (NPP) in large numbers. To understand the mechanisms and causes of the mass appearance and intrusion of S. fusiformis, field surveys were undertaken and collected observational data such as temperature, salinity, and ocean currents, and wind data were tabulated and analyzed. Field surveys in the offshore area of the NPP revealed that warm, saline, and less-oxygenated water flowed northward at approximately 25 km from the coastline, and that this water mass was that of the East Korean Warm Current (EKWC), with aggregated individuals (blastozooids) dominating the population of S. fusiformis. In the EKWC region, S. fusiformis were more abundant in the coastal area than in the center of the EKWC. Sea surface temperature and surface currents from satellite data showed that a thermal front was formed between the EKWC and the cold coastal waters off the NPP. The main path of the EKWC was close to the coast, and on days when S. fusiformis invaded the NPP in large numbers, the wind direction near the NPP was west-northwest. We suggest that large-scale invasions of the NPP by S. fusiformis can be predicted by incorporating appropriate field survey data into a particle tracking model that considers the direction and speed of the EKWC, the abundance of S. fusiformis in the EKWC, the location of thermal fronts, and wind direction and speed.

TI  - Putative Novel Avian Paramyxovirus (AMPV) and Reidentification of APMV-2 and APMV-6 to the Species Level Based on Wild Bird Surveillance (United States, 2016-2018)
T2  - APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Most species of APMVs are understudied and/or underreported, and many species were incidentally identified from asymptomatic wild birds; however, the disease significance of APMVs in wild birds is not fully determined. The rapid rise in high-throughput sequencing coupled with avian influenza surveillance programs have identified 12 different APMV species in the last decade and have challenged the resolution of classical serological methods to identify new viral species.Avian paramyxoviruses (APMVs) (subfamily Avulavirinae) have been isolated from over 200 species of wild and domestic birds around the world. The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) currently defines 22 different APMV species, with Avian orthoavulavirus 1 (whose viruses are designated APMV-1) being the most frequently studied due to its economic burden to the poultry industry. Less is known about other APMV species, including limited knowledge on the genetic diversity in wild birds, and there is a paucity of public whole-genome sequences for APMV-2 to -22. The goal of this study was to use MinION sequencing to genetically characterize APMVs isolated from wild bird swab samples collected during 2016 to 2018 in the United States. Multiplexed MinION libraries were prepared using a random strand-switching approach using 37 egg-cultured, influenza-negative, hemagglutination-positive samples. Forty-one APMVs were detected, with 37 APMVs having complete polymerase coding sequences allowing for species identification using ICTV's current Paramyxoviridae phylogenetic methodology. APMV-1, -4, -6, and -8 viruses were classified, one putative novel species (Avian orthoavulavirus 23) was identified from viruses isolated in this study, two putative new APMV species (Avian metaavulavirus 24 and 27) were identified from viruses isolated in this study and from retrospective GenBank sequences, and two putative new APMV species (Avian metaavulavirus 25 and 26) were identified solely from retrospective GenBank sequences. Furthermore, coinfections of APMVs were identified in four samples. The potential limitations of the branch length being the only species identification criterion and the potential benefit of a group pairwise distance analysis are discussed. IMPORTANCE Most species of APMVs are understudied and/or underreported, and many species were incidentally identified from asymptomatic wild birds; however, the disease significance of APMVs in wild birds is not fully determined. The rapid rise in high-throughput sequencing coupled with avian influenza surveillance programs have identified 12 different APMV species in the last decade and have challenged the resolution of classical serological methods to identify new viral species. Currently, ICTV's only criterion for Paramyxoviridae species classification is the requirement of a branch length of >0.03 using a phylogenetic tree constructed from polymerase (L) amino acid sequences. The results from this study identify one new APMV species, propose four additional new APMV species, and highlight that the criterion may have insufficient resolution for APMV species demarcation and that refinement or expansion of this criterion may need to be established for Paramyxoviridae species identification.

TI  - How Populists Construct Public Selves during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Case Study of the Czech Prime Minister
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTIVIST PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper adopts a psychological perspective to analyze the self-presentation of a populist leader in times of a national crisis during the COVID-19 pandemic, examining the narrative he presents to his audience. Using a constructivist approach of the Dialogical Self Theory (DST), we analyze I-positions emergent in speeches by Czech Prime Minister Babis released on his Facebook profile during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings are consistent with existing literature on populist self-presentation, highlighting that the leader constructs himself as being responsive and prototypical, as expected by the Social Identity Approach, and employs a hyper-personal model of online communication. Furthermore, we suggest, based on our results, that it might be useful to extend the DST to analyze how populist politicians relate to the people. In these positions, the politician relates to the out-group as if they were an in-group member or vice versa. This positioning might reflect the underlying worldview of public figures that try to relate to the common people. Overall, our research shows that the DST serves as a useful framework for further research in the area of political populism.

TI  - Calibration and validation of phenological models for Biome-BGCMuSo in the grasslands of Tibetan Plateau using remote sensing data
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Modeling vegetation phenology is crucial to assessing how climate change impacts carbon cycles in terrestrial ecosystems. The process-based biogeochemical model Biome-BGCMuSo is widely used for simulating carbon and water storages and fluxes of grassland ecosystems. However, the lack of accurate phenological information, such as the start of the growing season (SOS), impedes better simulations of the biogeochemical processes in the Tibetan Plateau (TP). Here, based on the snow-free satellite-derived SOS and the end of the growing season (EOS) in the TP during 1982-2018, we calibrated and validated three phenological models for SOS (i.e., the Biome-BGC phenological (BBGC) model, the heatsum growing season index (HSGSI) model, and the alpine meadow prognostic phenological (AMPP) model) and five phenological models for EOS (i.e., BBGC, HSGSI, AMPP, the low temperature and photoperiod multiplicative model induced by photoperiod (TPMP) and temperature (TPMT)) using particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. For SOS, all three phenological models with calibrated parameters performed similarly and all captured the change in SOS well along gradients of aridity. The performance of BBGC, HSGSI, and AMPP models were largely improved with the calibration. The AMPP model simulated SOS with the lowest estimation errors with the mean absolute error (MAE) of 18.67 days and the Kling Gupta efficiency (KGE) of 0.47 in validation. For EOS, the calibrated HSGSI and AMPP models, with mean MAEs of 9.85 and 9.29 days, respectively, captured the change in EOS well along the gradients of aridity and performed better than other models. The calibration significantly improved the simulation performance of all five models. Therefore, the phenological models can be calibrated and validated at a large scale with snow-free satellite derived phenological data. Our study recommends that calibration and validation for the phenological model play a vital role in accurately simulating SOS and EOS in the regional carbon cycle simulation.

TI  - Geomorphological and spatial analysis of dust sources in Ilam Province, Iran
T2  - SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Dust storms, which have become an environmental crisis in the Middle East in recent years, are associated with increased sources of sediment production. There are several reasons for the emergence of these sources, with the interplay between geomorphological processes and the production of landforms, which are susceptible to dust emission under certain conditions, being considered as its main reason. In this research, the most important dust production regions in Ilam province, located in the west of Iran, have been identified and their geomorphological characteristics have been analyzed in order to manage the environment. First, using MODIS images, applying the thermal-infrared dust index (TDI) and the HYSPLIT model during 21 dusty days from 2008 to 2013, the dust source areas were identified. Subsequently, a geomorphic map was produced and overlaid on the dust source map to determine the distribution and frequency of dust source points in each geomorphic class. Finally, field observations were conducted to analyze the geomorphological characteristics of the most important dust emission areas. The results revealed heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of dust sources in the area (235 points) concentrating in the regions of Mehran, Dehloran and Abu Ghovair where poor rangelands and agricultural lands predominate and abundant supplies of alluvial sediments exist. Indeed, dust mostly originates from landforms such as alluvial fans and floodplains whose dust-sized particles are renewed by seasonal floods annually. Thus, the availability of fine particles (clay and silt) in various geomorphic units plays a significant role in determining the dust emission capacity.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - SARS-CoV-2 cases reported from long-term residential facilities (care homes) in South Africa: a retrospective cohort study
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Globally, long-term care facilities (LTCFs) experienced a large burden of deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study aimed to describe the temporal trends as well as the characteristics and risk factors for mortality among residents and staff who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in selected LTCFs across South Africa. Method We analysed data reported to the DATCOV sentinel surveillance system by 45 LTCFs. Outbreaks in LTCFs were defined as large if more than one-third of residents and staff had been infected or there were more than 20 epidemiologically linked cases. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess risk factors for mortality amongst LTCF residents. Results A total of 2324 SARS-CoV-2 cases were reported from 5 March 2020 through 31 July 2021; 1504 (65%) were residents and 820 (35%) staff. Among LTCFs, 6 reported sporadic cases and 39 experienced outbreaks. Of those reporting outbreaks, 10 (26%) reported one and 29 (74%) reported more than one outbreak. There were 48 (66.7%) small outbreaks and 24 (33.3%) large outbreaks reported. There were 30 outbreaks reported in the first wave, 21 in the second wave and 15 in the third wave, with 6 outbreaks reporting between waves. There were 1259 cases during the first COVID-19 wave, 362 during the second wave, and 299 during the current third wave. The case fatality ratio was 9% (138/1504) among residents and 0.5% (4/820) among staff. On multivariable analysis, factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 mortality among LTCF residents were age 40-59 years, 60-79 years and >= 80 years compared to < 40 years and being a resident in a LTCF in Free State or Northern Cape compared to Western Cape. Compared to pre-wave 1, there was a decreased risk of mortality in wave 1, post-wave 1, wave 2, post-wave 2 and wave 3. Conclusion The analysis of SARS-CoV-2 cases in sentinel LTCFs in South Africa points to an encouraging trend of decreasing numbers of outbreaks, cases and risk for mortality since the first wave. LTCFs are likely to have learnt from international experience and adopted national protocols, which include improved measures to limit transmission and administer early and appropriate clinical care.

TI  - Regenerative urbanism: a causal layered analysis
T2  - FORESIGHT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose This paper aims to analyse both traditional and regenerative fields across four layers, litany, systems, worldviews and myth/metaphor. It aims to provide in-depth insight into the beliefs, values epistemologies and assumptions that scaffold thinking and practice. As a result of this analysis, future implications for regenerative urban practice are also considered. Design/methodology/approach Prevailing sustainability approaches seek to mitigate further harm in urban centres by increasing efficiency and minimising resource consumption and impact. They are primarily underpinned by a reductionist worldview that separates human objectives from those of the natural world. In contrast, regenerative approaches to urban sustainability have emerged out of an ecological worldview and aim to achieve net positive outcomes as a result of co-evolutionary relationships between social and ecological systems. This paper explores both approaches in urban communities through futures thinking tool, causal layered analysis. Findings As a result of the causal layered analysis undertaken, this paper provides insights into regenerative thinking and practice in urban settings. These insights cover four main thematic categories: purpose, place, practice and progress. Moving to the deeper layers of worldview and myth metaphor analysis, in particular, has significant implications for ongoing practice, including facilitating processes by which communities can reflect upon, unpack and reconstruct their concepts of future "success". Originality/value Anthropogenic climate change continues to deliver worsening ecological, social and economic impacts globally. Urban centres are particularly central to this crisis given their massive resource consumption and rapid population growth. This paper provides an alternative, deep analysis to consider thinking and practice required for urban regeneration. It reveals the need for a shift in purpose and a deeper understanding of place, illustrating the roles that futures tools may place in this transition.

M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundLobular breast carcinoma (LBC) is considered an exceptionally rare disease in men, including only 1% of all male breast malignancies. The majority of LBCs have negative immunohistochemical staining for E-cadherin (CDH1) expression, and the loss of CDH1 function was traditionally implicated in the tumorigenesis of diffuse gastric cancer as well as LBC. It is well recognized that LBC in women could be involved in both hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) and hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) syndromes; however, there are no data present in literature about the involvement of male LBC in these inherited conditions. MethodsBRCA1, BRCA2, and CDH1 genes were performed on DNA from peripheral blood using next-generation sequencing (NGS), Sanger sequencing, and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analyses. BRCA2 and CDH1 somatic gene analyses were performed on breast tumoral DNA using the NGS sequencing approach. Results and conclusionsHere, we describe two men affected by LBC, the carriers of a pathogenic variant of BRCA2 and CDH1 genes, respectively. Our data, including somatic and germline results, demonstrate a strong relationship between male LBC and HBOC/HDGC syndromes, excluding a sporadic origin of LBC in these two patients. Male LBC could represent a sentinel cancer for inherited syndrome identification, and early identification of cancer susceptibility could improve cancer prevention both for men and women in these families. The history of the LBC patient carrier of the CDH1 variant suggests to include male LBC genetic testing criteria and male breast surveillance in HDGC guidelines.

TI  - Effects of Groundwater Depth and Salt Content on Vegetation in Dry Lake Basins: A Case Study of Chahan Lake, Northern China
T2  - GEOFLUIDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Under the dual influences of global climate change and human activities, inland lakes in arid areas are shrinking and drying up, and a large area of bare lake bed has become the source of the release of chemical dust. The aim of this study is to study the control of groundwater on the distribution and development of natural vegetation and the effects of the groundwater conditions on soil salinization. In this study, a typical modern dry lake in northern China, Chahan Lake, was taken as the study area. Through field investigations, field sampling and analysis, and statistical analysis, the influence of groundwater on the ecosystem of this dry lake was studied. The results revealed that the vegetation communities in the lakeside zone were Kalidium foliatum, Nitraria tangutorum, Suaeda glauca, Leymus chinensis, Chloris virgata, and Carex duriuscula communities from the dry lake bed outwards. The groundwater table suitable for vegetation growth in Chahan Lake is 2.0-3.0 m deep. The groundwater table suitable for the growth of Kalidium foliatum vegetation is 1.5-2.5 m deep. The groundwater table suitable for the growth of Leymus chinensis vegetation is 3.0-4.0 m deep. In Chahan Lake, the critical groundwater depth and total dissolved solids (TDS) for moderate salinization, severe salinization, and saline soil occurrence are 4.0 m and 2.0 g/L, 3.0 m and 3.0 g/L, and 1.5 m and 4.0 g/L, respectively. Regarding the prevention and control of salt-dust storms, the ecological threshold of the groundwater, which can effectively increase the vegetation coverage and prevent soil salinization, is groundwater depths of 2.0-4.0 m and TDS values of <2 g/L.

TI  - Detection of sentinel lymph node in vulvar cancer using <SUP>99m</SUP>Tc-labeled colloid lymphoscintigraphy, blue dye, and indocyanine-green fluorescence: a meta-analysis of studies published in 2010-2020
T2  - ARCHIVES OF GYNECOLOGY AND OBSTETRICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Objectives Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is widely accepted in the surgical staging of early vulvar cancer, although the most accurate method for its identification is not yet defined. This meta-analysis aimed to determine the technique with the highest pooled detection rate (DR) for the identification of SLN and compare the average number of SLNs detected by planar lymphoscintigraphy (PL), single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT), blue dye and indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence. Methods The meta-analysis was conducted according to the PRISMA guideline. The search string was: "sentinel" and "vulv*", with date restriction from 1st January 2010 until Dec 31st, 2020. Three investigators selected studies based on: (1) a study cohort or a subset of a minimum of 10 patients with vulvar cancer undergoing either PL, SPECT/CT, blue-dye, or ICG fluorescence for the identification of SLN; (2) the possibility to extrapolate the DR or the average number of SLNs detected by a single technique (3) no evidence of other malignancies in the patient history. Results A total of 30 studies were selected. In a per-patient and a per-groin analysis, the DR for SLN of PL was respectively 96.13% and 92.57%; for the blue dye was 90.44% and 66.21%; for the ICG, the DR was 91.90% and 94.80%. The pooled DR of SPECT/CT was not calculated, since only two studies were performed in this setting. At a patient-based analysis, no significant difference was documented among PL, blue dye, and ICG (p = 0.28). At a per-groin analysis, PL and ICG demonstrated a significantly higher DR compared to blue dye (p < 0.05). The average number of SLNs, on a per-patient analysis, was available only for PL and ICG with a median number of 2.61 and 1.78 lymph nodes detected, respectively, and no significant statistical difference. Conclusions This meta-analysis favors the use of ICG and PL alone and in combination over blue dye for the identification of the SLN in vulvar cancer. Future studies may investigate whether the combined approach allows the highest DR of SLN in patients with vulvar cancer.

TI  - Intraoperative Touch Imprint Cytology in Breast Cancer Patients After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Intraoperative touch imprint cytology (ITIC) is less likely positive in breast cancer patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) due to lower tumor burden in the axilla. Among 144 patients after NAC (73 with N0 before NAG and 71 with N1 before NAC), ITIC was positive in 20.8 % (9.6% in N0 group and 32.4% in N1 group). In N0 group, ITIC was positive in < 5 % for tumors <= 20 mm after NAC and in triple negative or Her-2 subtypes. Sensitivity and specificity of ITIC was 50.8% and 100%.Background: Intraoperative touch imprint cytology (ITIC) is used for intraoperative detection of sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases with intention to spare the patients another surgery. However, ITIC prolongs surgery, and ads costs. It is less likely positive in breast cancer (BC) patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) due to low axillary tumor burden. We aimed to evaluate ITIC in patients after NAC and assess how often it changes the ongoing surgery. Materials and Methods: BC patients treated with NAC followed by surgery at the Institute of Oncology Ljubljana, Slovenia, from January 2008 to July 2020 with ITIC performed were selected for analysis. Sensitivity, specificity, and the proportion of positive ITIC were calculated for different subgroups. Results: Overall, 144 patients were identified. 73 of 144 (50.7%) patients were N0 before NAC and 71 of 144 (49.3%) were initially N1 and downstaged to N0 after NAC. ITIC was positive in 30 of 144 (20.8%) of patients, 7 of 73 (9.6%) in N0 group and 23 of 71 (32.4%) in N1 group. In N0 group, ITIC was positive in 1 of 20 (5%) if the tumor size was <= 20 mm after NAC, and 2 of 39 (5.1%) if the tumor was triple negative (TN) or Her-2+. In the N1 group ITIC was positive in > 20% in all subgroups. The sensitivity and specificity of ITIC was 50.8% and 100%, respectively and did not differ between groups. Conclusion: ITIC after NAC is accurate with comparable sensitivity to ITIC in upfront surgery. We suggest omission of ITIC after NAC in initially N0 patients, particularly for tumors <= 20 mm after NAC, and in TN or Her-2+ subtypes. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc. AM rights reserved.

TI  - A Multi-Angle Method for Simultaneous Retrieval of Aerosol Optical Depth and Bidirectional Reflectance Over Case II Waters
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Retrieval of aerosol optical depth (AOD) and bidirectional reflectance over Case II waters is a challenging task because of the optical complexity of water and the significant influence of atmospheric scattering. We present a simultaneous retrieval algorithm, coupled with a bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model centered on the water's Inherent Optical Property (IOP), to retrieve AOD and bidirectional reflectance based on multi-angle measurements from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) sensor. The algorithm was evaluated through retrievals performed in the proximity of four AERONET sites characterized by various water types. Consistency was observed between the results and in situ measurements. Accurate AODs can be retrieved, and atmospheric overcorrection can be avoided when obtaining remote sensing reflectance. Furthermore, the normalized remote sensing reflectance derived from our results showed a good correlation with the AERONET-OC products derived using the IOP-based correction approach. Our study provides theoretical support for future quantitative remote-sensing studies.

TI  - Underuse of cardiorenal protective agents in high-risk diabetes patients in primary care: a cross-sectional study
T2  - BMC PRIMARY CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) have shown benefits in patients with diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD), heart failure (HF), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Objective We assessed benchmark outcomes (Hemoglobin A1c, LDL-C, and blood pressure), identified the prevalence of cardiorenal indications for SGLT2i and GLP-1RA, and compared prescribing rates of GLP1-RA and SGLT2i in those with and without cardiorenal indications. Methods We analyzed data from January 2018-June 2019 for 7168 patients with diabetes using electronic medical records from the Northern Alberta Primary Care Research Network, a regional network of the Canadian Primary Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN). Patients with and without cardiorenal comorbidities were compared using descriptive statistics and two proportion Z tests. Results Hemoglobin A1c <= 7.0% was met by 56.8%, blood pressure < 130/80 mmHg by 62.1%, LDL-C <= 2.0 mmol/L by 45.3% of patients. There were 4377 patients on glucose lowering medications; metformin was most common (77.7%), followed by insulin (24.6%), insulin secretagogues (23.6%), SGLT2i (19.7%), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (19.3%), and GLP-1RA (9.4%). A quarter of patients had cardiorenal indications for SGLT2i or GLP-1RA. Use of SGLT2i in these patients was lower than in patients without cardiorenal comorbidities (14.9% vs 21.2%, p < 0.05). GLP-1RA use in these patients was 4.6% compared with 11% in those without cardiorenal comorbidities (p < 0.05). Discussion Contrary to current evidence and recommendations, SGLT2i and GLP1-RA were less likely to be prescribed to patients with pre-existing CVD, HF, and/or CKD, revealing opportunities to improve prescribing for patients with diabetes at high-risk for worsening cardiorenal complications.

TI  - Rapid Land-Cover and Land-Use Change in the Indo-Malaysian Region over the Last Thirty-Four Years Based on AVHRR NDVI Data
T2  - ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF GEOGRAPHERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Indo-Malaysian region is a hot spot of rapid land-cover and land-use change (LCLUC) with little consensus about the rates and magnitudes of such change. Here we use temporal convolutional neural networks (TempCNNs) to generate a spatiotemporally consistent LCLUC data set for nearly thirty-five years (1982-2015), validated against two reference data sets with over 80 percent accuracy, better than other LCLUC products for the region. Our results both confirm and complicate estimates from earlier work that relied on decadal, rather than interannual, changes in regional land cover. We find forests decrease in mainland and maritime Southeast Asia and increase in South China and South Asia. Consistent with geographic theory about the drivers of land-use change, we find cropland expansion is a driving force for deforestation in mainland Southeast Asia with savannas playing a superior role, suggesting widespread forest degradation in this region. In contrast to earlier work and theory, we find that South China's increasing forest cover comes principally from savanna (rather than cropland) conversion. The explicit interannual LCLUC patterns, rates, and transitions identified in this study provide a valuable data source for studies of land-use theory, environmental and climate changes, and regional land-use policy evaluations.

TI  - Digital inequality beyond the digital divide: conceptualizing adverse digital incorporation in the global South
T2  - INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY FOR DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital systems are significantly associated with inequality in the global South. That association has traditionally been understood in terms of the digital divide or related terminologies whose core conceptualization is the exclusion of some groups from the benefits of digital systems. However, with the growing breadth and depth of digital engagement in the global South, an exclusion worldview is no longer sufficient. What is also needed is an understanding of how inequalities are created for some groups that are included in digital systems. This paper creates such an understanding, drawing from ideas in the development studies literature on chronic poverty to inductively build a model of a new concept: 'adverse digital incorporation', meaning inclusion in a digital system that enables a more-advantaged group to extract disproportionate value from the work or resources of another, less-advantaged group. This new model will enable those involved with digital development to understand why, how and for whom inequality can emerge from the growing use of digital systems in the global South. It creates a systematic framework incorporating the processes, the drivers, and the causes of adverse digital incorporation that will provide detailed new insights. The paper concludes with implications for both digital development researchers and practitioners that derive from the model and its exposure to the broader components of power that shape the inclusionary connection between digital and inequality.

TI  - PRAME immunohistochemistry of spitzoid neoplasms
T2  - JOURNAL OF CUTANEOUS PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Spitzoid melanocytic neoplasms are well known to be diagnostically challenging. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and molecular approaches have been used as ancillary diagnostic tests. Herein, we investigate the use of PRAME IHC for the assessment of spitzoid melanocytic neoplasms. Methods Ten Spitz nevi, 14 atypical Spitz tumors, and 11 spitzoid melanomas were retrieved, and PRAME IHC was scored on a scale of 1-4 (in % quartiles). Intensity of staining was categorized as weak or strong. Cases with no staining received a score of 0. Positive lymph nodes from three spitzoid melanomas were also analyzed. Results Spitz nevi, atypical Spitz tumors, and spitzoid melanomas had mean PRAME IHC scores of 1.20, 0.93, and 3.36, respectively. The percentage of cases with a score 3 or higher for each category of spitzoid neoplasms are as follows: Spitz nevus (20%), atypical Spitz tumor (0%), and spitzoid melanoma (82%). Among the spitzoid melanomas, three cases had positive sentinel lymph nodes, which showed PRAME score of 2, 4, and 4 in the metastatic deposits. Conclusions Previous reports revealed PRAME IHC as useful tool to distinguish benign from malignant melanocytic lesions. The results presented here are concordant with the prior studies, but expand the application of this marker to Spitz nevi/tumors and spitzoid melanomas. The present findings suggest the potential diagnostic utility of PRAME IHC in the assessment of spitzoid melanocytic lesions, particularly in distinguishing spitzoid melanomas from Spitz nevi and atypical Spitz tumors.

TI  - Detecting, Monitoring, and Analyzing the Surface Subsidence in the Yellow River Delta (China) Combined with CenterNet Network and SBAS-InSAR
T2  - JOURNAL OF SPECTROSCOPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term industrial activities tend to cause surface subsidence and damage to ground facilities and local ecological environment. Monitoring and analyzing surface subsidence is of great significance to prevent potential disasters. The surface type of the Yellow River Delta in China is complex and there are many industrial activities, so it is necessary to monitor the surface subsidence in this area. Small Baseline Subset InSAR (SBAS-InSAR) can monitor the surface subsidence with millimeter-level accuracy, but it takes a long time to process wide images (Sentinel-1) and is seriously affected by atmospheric errors. To avoid these limitations, we constructed a method combining the CenterNet network and SBAS-InSAR (CNSBAS-InSAR). Firstly, the CenterNet network is used to automatically detect the subsidence areas from the wide differential interferogram formed by two SAR satellite images and determine the location of the subsidence area. Then, the SBAS-InSAR monitoring is performed on the detected multiple subsidence areas. Finally, the small-scale subsidence results are obtained. In this study, based on 24 Sentinel-1A satellite images acquired from 10 January 2018 to 24 December 2018, nine subsidence areas in Yellow River Delta were detected. Three of them had long-term surface subsidence. They were located in Zhanhua District, Xianhe Town, and Hongguang Village, respectively. This paper focuses on analyzing these three areas. The maximum subsidence rate of Zhanhua District, Xianhe Town, and Hongguang Village were -135.21 mm/a, -330.91 mm/a, and -209.68 mm/a, respectively. In addition, the analysis showed that precipitation in the Zhanhua District could effectively slow down the subsidence rate of the area. The subsidence of Xianhe Town threatened the safety of the Shugang Expressway. The subsidence of Hongguang Village caused the safety risks of buildings. The results of this study prove that CNSBAS-InSAR method is reliable for monitoring subsidence areas and it can provide a reference for local construction and protection of Yellow River Delta.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Change of Net Primary Productivity and Its Response to Climate Change in Temperate Grasslands of China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The temperate grasslands in China play a vital part in regulating regional carbon cycle and climate change. Net primary productivity (NPP) is a crucial index that reflects ecological function of plants and the carbon sequestration capacity of grassland ecosystem. Climate change can affect NPP by changing vegetation growth, but the effects of climate change on the NPP of China's temperate grasslands remain unclear. Based on MODIS data and monthly climate data during 2000-2020, this study explored the spatiotemporal changes in grassland NPP and its response to climate change in temperate grasslands of China. We found that the annual NPP over the entire China's temperate grasslands increased significantly by 4.0 gC/m(2)/year from 2000 to 2020. The annual NPP showed increasing trends for all the different grassland vegetation types, with the smallest increase for temperate desert steppe (2.2 gC/m(2)/year) and the largest increase for temperate meadow (5.4 gC/m(2)/year). The correlation results showed that increased annual precipitation had a positive relationship with the NPP of temperate grasslands. Increased summer and autumn precipitation could increase grassland NPP, particularly for the temperate meadow. With regard to the effects of temperatures, increased temperature, particularly the summer maximum temperature, could decrease annual NPP. However, increased spring minimum temperature could increase the NPP of temperate desert steppe. In addition, this study found, for the first time, an asymmetric relationship between summer nighttime and daytime warming and the NPP of temperate meadow. Specifically, nighttime warming can increase NPP, while daytime warming can reduce NPP in temperate meadow. Our results highlight the importance of including seasonal climate conditions in assessing the vegetation productivity for different grassland types of temperate grasslands and predicting the influences of future climate change on temperate grassland ecosystems.

TI  - De-escalating Locoregional Therapy for Axillary Micrometastases in Breast Cancer: How Much is Too Much?
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Optimal adjuvant radiotherapy fields in patients with micrometastases are controversial. In this retrospective study, 156 patients with micrometastases were analyzed. Women with grade 3 histology were observed to be at substantial risk for LRR. Adjuvant RT was associated with a lower risk of LRR. Adjuvant RT, including comprehensive nodal irradiation, should be strongly considered for women with grade 3 micrometastases.Background: The applicability of modern prospective data on adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) fields in patients with micrometastases is limited because many trials occurred prior to routine measurement of nodal metastasis size and modern sentinel lymph node evaluation techniques. We aimed to determine prognostic factors for patients with micrometastases and evaluate the impact of adjuvant RT on disease outcomes. Patients and Methods: Patients diagnosed with pathologic T1-T3 N1mi breast cancers between 2004-2015 were identified. Cox proportional hazards methods were used to determine characteristics predictive of locoregional recurrence (LRR). Tumor and treatmentspecific factors were further evaluated using log-rank statistics to compare rates of LRR-free survival. Results: This analysis included 156 patients. On multivariable analysis, grade 3 histology (HR 10.84, 95% CI 2.72-43.21) and adjuvant RT (HR 0.22, 95% CI 0.06-0.81) were independent predictors of LRR. Among patients with grade 1-2 histology, 5-year LRR-free survival was 98.8% in patients who received adjuvant RT versus 100% in patients who did not receive adjuvant RT (P = .82). Among patients with grade 3 histology, 5-year LRR-free survival was 90.1% in patients who received adjuvant RT versus 53.0% in patients who did not receive adjuvant RT (P = .025), and 100% in patients receiving comprehensive nodal irradiation versus 76.7% in patients receiving whole breast irradiation or no RT (P = .045). Conclusion: Patients with grade 3 micrometastases are at substantial risk for LRR. Adjuvant RT, including comprehensive nodal irradiation, should be strongly considered in these women.

TI  - Real-World Adherence to Nodal Surveillance for Sentinel Lymph Node-Positive Melanoma
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Patients with sentinel lymph node-positive (SLN+) melanoma are increasingly undergoing active nodal surveillance over completion lymph node dissection (CLND) since the Second Multicenter Selective Lymphadenectomy Trial (MSLT-II). Adherence to nodal surveillance in real-world practice remains unknown. Methods In a retrospective cohort of SLN+ melanoma patients who underwent nodal surveillance at a single institution from July 2017 through April 2021, this study evaluated adherence to nodal surveillance ultrasound (US). Adherence to nodal US was compared with adherence to other surveillance methods based on receipt of adjuvant therapy. Early recurrence data were reported using descriptive statistics. Results Among 109 SLN+ patients, 37 (34%) received US surveillance at recommended intervals. Of the 72 (66%) non-adherent patients, 16 were lost to follow-up, and 33 had planned follow-up at an outside institution without available records. More patients had a minimum of bi-annual clinic visits (83%) and cross-sectional imaging (53%) compared to those who were adherent with nodal US. The patients who received adjuvant therapy (60%) had fewer ultrasounds (p < 0.01) but more exams (p < 0.01) and a trend toward more cross-sectional imaging (p = 0.06). Of the overall cohort, 26 patients (24%) experienced recurrence at a median follow-up period of 15 months. Of these recurrences, 10 were limited to the SLN basin, and all of these isolated nodal recurrences were resectable. Conclusions Pragmatic challenges to real-world delivery of nodal surveillance remain after MSLT-II, and adjuvant therapy appears to be associated with a decreased likelihood of US adherence. Understanding US utility alongside cross-sectional imaging will be critical as increasingly more patients undergo nodal surveillance and adjuvant therapy.

TI  - Air pollution trends measured from MODIS and TROPOMI: AOD and CO over Pakistan
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The TROPOMI (TROPOspheric monitoring instrument) onboard Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) satellite provides high spatial resolution data of carbon monoxide (CO) while the MAIAC (Multiangle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction) is a newly developed algorithm applied to MODIS collection 6 observations to retrieve AOD (Aerosol Optical Depth) at a high spatial resolution of 1 km. The present study utilized the MAIAC AOD from MODIS Terra and Aqua polar-orbiting satellites between March 2000 to December 2021 and CO from Sentinel-5P during the available period July 2018-December 2021 over Pakistan. Moreover, we used three trend techniques (Linear regression, Mann-Kendall (MK), and Theil-Sen's Slope) to examine the trends of AOD and CO over Pakistan. The results show that both AOD and CO have high values over central Punjab, western Balochistan, central Sindh, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The mean annual high AOD of > 1.2 is observed in eastern Punjab because of an increase in urbanization, industrialization, and economical activities whereas the AOD of similar to 1.0 is observed over Balochistan, Sindh, and a few parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The highest mean annual CO of (>)0.03 mol/m<^>2 is seen over central Punjab, Sindh, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The results show that seasonal mean MAIAC AOD ranging from 0.7 to > 0.9 was seen over Punjab and Sindh province during the monsoon season whereas the lowest AOD is detected in the winter season over few parts of Balochistan. In contrast, the highest mean seasonal CO ranging from 0.040 to > 0.055 mol/m<^>2 was seen in the winter season over Punjab. The lowest CO concentration is observed in the winter season over the northern region of Pakistan. Non-parametric analyses (MK and Theil-Sen's slope) also show an increasing trend of CO over Pakistan from 2018 to 2021. Furthermore, we have also investigated the trends of AOD and CO over selected cities of Pakistan using linear regression, MK test, and Theil-Sen's slope to reveal long-term air pollution trends.

TI  - Comparing frameworks for biomass prediction for the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - NASA's Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) mission offers data for temperate and pan-tropical estimates of aboveground forest biomass (AGB). The spaceborne, full-waveform LiDAR from GEDI provides sample footprints of canopy structure, expected to cover about 4% of the land area following two years of operation. Several options are available for estimating AGB at different geographical scales. Using GEDI sample data alone, gridded biomass predictions are based on hybrid inference which correctly propagates errors due to the modeling and accounts for sampling variability, but this method requires at least two GEDI tracks in the area of interest. However, there are significant gaps in GEDI coverage and in some areas of interest GEDI data may need to be combined with other wall-to-wall remotely sensed (RS) data, such as those from multispectral or SAR sensors. In these cases, we may employ hierarchical model-based (HMB) inference that correctly considers the additional model errors that result from relating GEDI data to the wallto-wall data. Where predictions are possible from both hybrid and HMB inference the question arises which framework to choose, and under what circumstances? In this paper, we make progress towards answering these questions by comparing the performance of the two prediction frameworks under conditions relevant for the GEDI mission. Conventional model-based (MB) inference with wall-to-wall TanDEM-X data was applied as a baseline prediction framework, which does not involve GEDI data at all. An important feature of the study was the comparison of AGB predictors in terms of both standard deviation (SD: the square root of variance) and root mean square error (RMSE: the square root of mean square error - MSE). Since, in model-based inference, the true AGB in an area of interest is a random variable, comparisons of the performance of prediction frameworks should preferably be made in terms of their RMSEs. However, in practice only the SD can be estimated based on empirical survey data, and thus it is important also to study whether or not the difference between the two uncertainty measures is small or large under conditions relevant for the GEDI mission. Our main findings were that: (i) hybrid and HMB prediction typically resulted in smaller RMSEs than conventional MB prediction although the difference between the three frameworks in terms of SD often was small; (ii) in most cases the difference between hybrid and HMB inference was small in terms of both RMSE and SD; (iii) the RMSEs for all frameworks was substantially larger than the SDs in small study areas whereas the two uncertainty measures were similar in large study areas, and; (iv) spatial autocorrelation of model residual errors had a large effect on the RMSEs of AGB predictors, especially in small study areas. We conclude that hybrid inference is suitable in most GEDI applications for AGB assessment, due to its simplicity compared to HMB inference. However, where GEDI data are sparse HMB inference should be preferred.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variation of seasonal heat islands mapping of Pakistan during 2000-2019, using day-time and night-time land surface temperatures MODIS and meteorological stations data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban heat islands (UHIs) create severe human health risks. Pakistan has about 220 million inhabitants, with 287 people per Km2 on average. Over the last 100 years, the maximum extreme temperature during the previous summer and winter seasons has been recorded. The forecast for the coming 50 years indicates a temperature rise in Pakistan, directly affecting physical and mental health. To address this challenge, this paper analyzes the spatial variability in Heat Islands (HI) in Pakistan from 2000 to 2019, combining MODIS satellite imagery with data from fifty meteorological stations. Different statistical and geostatistical models were applied, including geographically weighted regression (GWR), simple regression, and Geostatistical interpolation models. The results reveal the variations in nocturnal thermal on a fixed temperature of 11 degrees C, variations in frequency, and the change in day and night temperatures during summer and winter. Data fusion between MODIS and data from fifty metrological stations in Pakistan shows that spatial-temporal variation in the patterns of HI must be considered in planning processes when responding to climate change. The heat island's maximum nocturnal temperatures indicated a high rate of extension and magnitude compared to the daily recorded temperature, which implies that the overall area in the metropolitan category is covered by a temperature value of greater than 20 degrees C, raising severity to 10 degrees C in June. During June, intense night-time temperature values spread their concentration, heading towards the urban center over the Islamabad, Gilgit, Peshawar, Lahore, Quetta, and Karachi station sectors. During the day, the extension difference of the heat island was in the range of 8-10 degrees C, declining steadily from summer 2006 to summer 2015 before finally covering almost the entire metropolitan area. Higher values emerged after 2015-2019, rising in magnitude and expansion until 2019.

TI  - Towards high-level protein, beta-carotene, and lutein production from <i>Chlorella sorokiniana</i> using aminobutyric acid and pseudo seawater
T2  - BIOCHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Microalgae produced lipids, pigments, lutein, and valuable chemicals under stressful conditions, making them as attractive feedstock for biorefineries. However, high cell density culture of microalgae in harsh condition using seawater is still a challenge. In this study, we used aminobutyric acid (GABA) from an in vitro biotransformation of monosodium glutamate (MSG) to alleviate salinity stress in Chlorella sorokiniana (Cs). Initially, Chlorophyll a/b content was suppressed under the stress of 20 g/L sodium chloride (NaCl), leading to an extreme decline in protein and pigment accumulation. While the biomass and protein of Cs cultured in 10 g/L NaCl reached 3.44 g/L and 1.14 g/L with 5 mM GABA, with 56.3% and 171% increase compared to control. The optimal conditions were 10 mM GABA and 20 g/L NaCl in modified BG11 medium, with a biomass, protein, lutein and p-carotene content of 4.56 g/L, 2.07 g/L, 24 mg/L and 27.48 mg/L, respectively. Finally, protein from Cs was used as a prebiotic for cultivating Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) and Lactobacillus rhamnosus ZY (LGG). We provided an effective and sustainable approach for the simultaneous production of biomass and high-end products by microalgae using GABA and seawater for the first time.

TI  - Retrieval of cloud properties from thermal infrared radiometry using convolutional neural network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a deep learning algorithm is developed to consistently retrieve the daytime and nighttime cloud properties from passive satellite observations without auxiliary atmospheric parameters. The algorithm involves the thermal infrared (TIR) radiances, viewing geometry, and altitude into a convolutional neural network (denoted as TIR-CNN), and retrieves the cloud mask, cloud optical thickness (COT), effective particle radius (CER), and cloud top height (CTH) simultaneously. The TIR-CNN model is trained using daytime Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products during a full year, and the results are validated and evaluated using passive and active products observed in independent years. The evaluation results show that the cloud properties retrieved by the TIR-CNN are well consistent with all available MODIS day-time products (cloud mask, COT, CER, and CTH) and night-time products (cloud mask and CTH). The retrieved COT and CTH also show good agreements with active sensors for both daytime and nighttime, indicating that the algorithm performs stably in the diurnal cycle.

TI  - Construction of cloud-free MODIS-like land surface temperatures coupled with a regional weather research and forecasting (WRF) model
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a key parameter in the physics of land surface processes. Currently, the technique most commonly used to obtain LST is thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing (RS). However, this technique is affected by clouds and cannot obtain complete spatiotemporal LST images. To solve this problem, RS and weather research and forecasting (WRF) coupled model (RS-WRF coupled model) was developed to produce cloud-free MODIS-like LST data. (i) The WRF model is used to simulate the cloud-free LST with a 1 km resolution. (ii) The optimal machine learning model is utilized to fit the simulated LSTs and produce cloud-free MODIS-like LSTs. (iii) Combined with a median filtering algorithm, the salt and pepper noise in the fitted image is optimized. Taking Beijing as a test site. Under relatively little cloud cover and greater cloud contamination, the root mean square error of the LST constructed by the RS-WRF coupled model is approximately 1.2 and 1.8 K, respectively. The correlation coefficients under both conditions exceed 0.9. Overall, the RS-WRF coupled model can provide cloud-free time series MODIS-like LST images in areas with frequent cloud cover, thereby compensating for the disadvantage that satellite TIR images contaminated by clouds cannot obtain complete LST estimates.

TI  - A Bio-optical Numerical Approach for Remote Retrieval of Total Suspended Matter from Turbid Waters
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel semi-analytical algorithm was developed to retrieve total suspended matter (TSM) in turbid waters. A turbidity index developed from remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) of three bands of visible spectrum was employed to estimate TSM. Adopting a partial differentiation approach, wavelength lambda(1) at which maximum absorption of TSM was identified between 650 nm and 750 nm. The second (lambda(2)) and third (lambda(3)) wavelengths were identified through radiative transfer modelling and parameterization of particulate backscattering to minimize the effect of other optically active substances and account for backscattering effects, respectively. Thus, the wavelengths identified were 679 nm (lambda(1)), 695 nm (lambda(2)), and 704 nm (lambda(3)). Regressing the index with 50 randomly chosen in situ data points (Zuary River estuary, Goa) resulted in a best-fit polynomial form of algorithm. This algorithm was validated with a different set of in situ data points (n = 116), and resulted in a correlation coefficient, r = 0.88. In addition, a comparative analysis of the developed algorithm with forty-one empirical and semi-analytical models of TSM indicated their non-suitability in varying optical conditions. The study further pointed out the significance of 695 nm as an inseparable band of any future optical sensor to retrieve TSM from remotely sensed data.

TI  - Estimation of annual groundwater changes from InSAR-derived land subsidence
T2  - WATER AND ENVIRONMENT JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the extent and quantity of groundwater drawdown is critical for developing a mitigation strategy for water management. This study illustrates that the data-driven model can be used for the spatial estimation of groundwater drawdown using interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR)-based deformation data. Here, InSAR derived from Sentinel-1 imagery is used to estimate surface deformations in the Choshui river alluvial fan, Taiwan, between 2016 and 2018. Spatial regression (SR) is applied to estimate the annual groundwater drawdown with a calculated R-square of 0.96, which is shown to be superior to a nonspatial model. This study demonstrates the potential of the satellite-based groundwater drawdown map prediction using InSAR-derived land deformation. In predication, the SR model can reliably catch the patterns of annual predicted drawdown without requiring detailed groundwater observations.

M3  - Article
AB  - A modern worldview has developed in rural methods, devices, and advances. Exactness in agribusiness is required to guarantee site-specific editing of administration, which incorporates soil supplement arrangements that are custom fitted to each crop's needs. In spite of the fact that preparation is vital for expanding efficiency, it is vital to dissect the possibilities and impediments of soil as a premise for selecting the correct manure sort, amount, and application time to dodge compost utilization instability. Farmers' dependence on instinct, trial and mistake, mystery, and assessing significantly includes major wasteful aspects such as efficiency misfortunes, asset squandering, and expanded natural defilement due to the complexity of deciding the perfect preparing extend. Agriculturists cannot successfully estimate the impacts of their choices on yield and the environment when utilizing these. This paper illustrates why manure regimes should be adjusted to meet the demands of certain crops and regions, as well as to safeguard the environment by reducing pollution caused by fertilizer and manure waste. A few soil-richness administration strategies, such as the utilization of versatile research facilities or imported gear, have confronted obstacles in terms of fetched, comfort of utilization, and adaption to the neighborhood environment. Other choices, such as sending soil to research facilities for testing, are badly designed, time-consuming, and conflicting. Based on the climate estimate, this thing should be suggested according to the development of an ANN and show the estimates of NPK supplement levels and offer the fitting compost treatment and application timing.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy versus selective neck dissection in patients with early oral squamous cell carcinoma: A cost analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF STOMATOLOGY ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has been proved to be as efficient as selective neck dissection (SND) for the treatment of occult metastases in T1 -T2cNO oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). The aim of our study was to assess and compare the cost of these two surgical procedures.Patients and methods: This retrospective cost analysis includes consecutive patients treated between 2012 and 2017 in two French hospitals either by SLNB or SND. Hospital cost (hospital stay for initial surgery and re-hospitalizations over a period of 60 days after the initial surgery), the length of hospital stay for the initial surgery and the perioperative management were described and compared between the two techniques. The propensity score regression adjustment method was used to address selection bias.Results: Ninety-four patients underwent SLNB procedure and seventy-seven patients underwent SND. The length of hospital stay for initial surgery was lower in SLNB group: 5.8 days (SD: 3.8) versus 9.2 days (SD: 5) in the SND group. Hospital costs were lower in SLNB group: (sic)7 489 (standard deviation: (sic)3 691) versus (sic)8 886 (standard deviation: (sic)4 381) but this difference was not significant after propensity score regression adjustment. The rate of complication, the delay of full oral feeding and postoperative drainage were lower in SLNB group.Conclusion: SLNB in Tl-T2cNO OSCC is less invasive than SND with fewer complications, a shorter length of hospital stay and favorable perioperative management. This study shows that this technique could be also less expensive than SND. (C) 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI  - Drivers and outcomes of between-group conflict in vervet monkeys
T2  - PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Neighbouring groups compete over access to resources and territories in between-group encounters, which can escalate into between-group conflicts (BGCs). Both the ecological characteristics of a territory and the rival's fighting ability shape the occurrence and outcome of such contests. What remains poorly understood, however, is how seasonal variability in the ecological value of a territory together with fighting ability related to the likelihood of between-group encounters and the extent to which these escalate into conflicts. To test this, we observed and followed four vervet monkey groups in the wild, and recorded the group structure (i.e. size, composition), the locations and the outcomes of 515 BGCs. We then assessed key ecological measures at these locations, such as vegetation availability (estimated from Copernicus Sentinel 2 satellite images) and the intensity of usage of these locations. We tested to what extent these factors together influenced the occurrence and outcomes of BGCs. We found that the occurrence of BGCs increased at locations with higher vegetation availability relative to the annual vegetation availability within the group's home territory. Also, groups engaging in a BGC at locations far away from their home territory were less likely to win a BGC. Regarding group structure, we found that smaller groups systematically won BGCs against larger groups, which can be explained by potentially higher rates of individual free-riding occurring in larger groups. This study sheds light on how the ecology of encounter locations in combination with a group's social characteristics can critically impact the dynamics of BGCs in a non-human primate species.This article is part of the theme issue 'Intergroup conflict across taxa'.

AB  - Capturing forest disturbances over time is increasingly important to determine the ecosystem's capacity to recover as well as aiding a timely response of foresters. With changes due to climate change increasing the frequencies, a better understanding of forest disturbances and their role in historical development is needed to, on the one hand, develop forest management approaches promoting ecosystem resilience and, on the other hand, provide quick and spatially explicit information to foresters. A large, publicly available satellite imagery spanning more than two decades for large areas of the Earth's surface at varying spatial and temporal resolutions represents a vast, free data source for this. The challenge is 2-fold: (1) obtaining reliable information on forest condition and development from satellite data requires not only quantification of forest loss but rather a differentiated assessment of the extent and severity of forest degradation; (2) standardized and efficient processing routines both are needed to bridge the gap between remote-sensing signals and conventional forest condition parameters to enable forest managers for the operational use of the data. Here, we investigated abiotic and biotic disturbances based on a set of ground validated occurrences in various forest areas across Germany to build disturbance response chronologies and examine event-specific patterns. The proposed workflow is based on the R-package "npphen" for non-parametric vegetation phenology reconstruction and anomaly detection using MODIS EVI time series data. Results show the potential to detect distinct disturbance responses in forest ecosystems and reveal event-specific characteristics. Difficulties still exist for the determination of, e.g., scattered wind throw, due to its subpixel resolution, especially in highly fragmented landscapes and small forest patches. However, the demonstrated method shows potential for operational use as a semi-automatic system to augment terrestrial monitoring in the forestry sector. Combining the more robust EVI and the assessment of the phenological series at a pixel-by-pixel level allows for a changing species cover without false classification as forest loss.

TI  - Taking the time for range testing: an approach to account for temporal resolution in acoustic telemetry detection range assessments
T2  - ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background In acoustic telemetry studies, detection range is usually evaluated as the relationship between the probability of detecting an individual transmission and the distance between the transmitter and receiver. When investigating animal presence, however, few detections will suffice to establish an animal's presence within a certain time frame. In this study, we assess detection range and its impacting factors with a novel approach aimed towards studies making use of binary presence/absence metrics. The probability of determining presence of an acoustic transmitter within a certain time frame is calculated as the probability of detecting a set minimum number of transmissions within that time frame. We illustrate this method for hourly and daily time bins with an extensive empirical dataset of sentinel transmissions and detections in a receiver array in a Belgian offshore wind farm. Results The accuracy and specificity of over 84% for both temporal resolutions showed the developed approach performs adequately. Using this approach, we found important differences in the predictive performance of distinct hypothetical range testing scenarios. Finally, our results demonstrated that the probability of determining presence over distance to a receiver did not solely depend on environmental and technical conditions, but would also relate to the temporal resolution of the analysis, the programmed transmitting interval and the movement behaviour of the tagged animal. The probability of determining presence differed distinctly from a single transmission's detectability, with an increase of up to 266 m for the estimated distance at 50% detection probability (D-50). Conclusion When few detections of multiple transmissions suffice to ascertain presence within a time bin, predicted range differs distinctly from the probability of detecting a single transmission within that time bin. We recommend the use of more rigorous range testing methodologies for acoustic telemetry applications where the assessment of detection range is an integral part of the study design, the data analysis and the interpretation of results.

TI  - Nudging for eco-friendly online shopping-Attraction effect curbs price sensitivity*
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The current study investigates the efficiency of nudging people to purchase more eco-friendly electronic devices in an emulated online milieu. To this end, participants were presented with three different products (smart phones, monitors and portable speakers) with two different nudges (attraction and default) and a control condition. Results from two experiments show that, while there was already a strong preference to make eco-friendly choices in control conditions, when eco-friendly choices were costlier, there was a clear positive effect of an attraction nudge on participants' eco-friendly preferences. In other words, when product prices were generally high, or when there are large price differences between options, the attraction nudge resulted in a higher probability of eco-friendly choices compared to when no attraction effect is used. The default nudge was less efficient, sometimes producing a negative effect, while its effect was mediated by whether participants endorsed a strong bio-centric worldview, in which case the default nudge promoted more eco-friendly choices. The results are discussed in relation to potential challenges pertaining to deceit and perceived paternalistic intentions with use of nudges.

TI  - Analysis of rising treatment cost of elevated BMI in patients with proximal femoral fracture
T2  - UNFALLCHIRURGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - Driven by the aging population, the proximal femoral fracture is a rising fracture entity, challenging trauma surgeons as well as the German healthcare system as a whole. The rising average age of the population is accompanied by a rising BMI in the German population, resulting in longer operation times, longer average length of stay (ALOS) as well as more postoperative complications.The aim of this study was to demonstrate the economic correlation between body mass index and hospital costs. The retrospective analysis of 950 patient cases suffering from a proximal femoral fracture resulted in the finding of rising treatment costs being positively associated with rising BMI due to longer operation times and longer length of hospitalization (10,452Euro, 11,505Euro, 12,085Euro and 13,681Euro for patients with BMI <18.5kg/m(2), BMI=18.5-24.9kg/m(2), BMI=25.0-29.9kg/m(2) and BMI >= 30.0kg/m(2), respectively).

TI  - Assessing the multi-decadal shoreline dynamics along the Purba Medinipur-Balasore coastal stretch, India by integrating remote sensing and statistical methods
T2  - ACTA GEOPHYSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring decadal shoreline change is essential to understand the influence of coastal processes on the coastline. The shoreline is constantly shaped by natural and anthropogenic factors, and so, it is critical to understand decadal trends. The prediction of future shoreline positions is a must for effective long-term coastal zone management. This study was conducted along a 90-km-stretch of the coastline from the mouth of the Haldi River (Purba Medinipur) in the Northeast to the Subarnarekha estuary (Balasore) in the Southwest. The primary objectives of the study were to analyze the decadal shoreline migration using the End Point Rate (EPR) method and then predict future shoreline change prediction using the Kalman Filter method. Shoreline positions were digitized after extracting the shorelines using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) from Multi-temporal (1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020) and Multisensor (Landsat TM, ETM + , and OLI) satellite data. A total of 887 transects were cast to compute change statistics of the time series shoreline. It was observed that the average shoreline change rate was - 8.41 m/year in the periods of 1990-2000 and 2000-2010, and - 8.80 m/year from 2010 to 2020. Accretion along this coastal stretch is caused by the growth of morphological features such as sand bars, beaches, and dunes. We also found that erosion occurred from 1990 to 2000 along the coastline of Bhograi, Ramnagar-I, Ramnagar-II, a few parts of Contai-I, Khejuri-I, and the Nandigram-I coastal block. Accretion mostly occurred due to Land reclamation in the Northern portion of Bhograi, Contai-1 blocks and Nandigram- I block from 2000 to 2010 and 2010 to 2020. Root mean square error (RMSE) and Regression Coefficient values were computed for the future shoreline prediction of 2031 and 2041. The calculated RMSE value of +/- 4.7 m and value of 0.97 shows a good relationship between the actual and predicted coastline of 2020. This study concludes that the coastline of Purba Medinipur-Balasore experienced severe erosion and needs management action and also proves the efficiency of the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) tool for decadal analysis and prediction of shoreline change. The findings of this study may help the coastal planners, environmentalists, and coastal managers in preparing both short-term and long-term coastal zone management plans.

TI  - MODIS Observed Spatiotemporal Variation of Snow Cover in Zanskar Valley, North-Western Himalaya
T2  - FRONTIERS IN WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The investigation of variations in the snow cover in response to the ongoing climate change is crucial for the understanding of hydrological and climatological processes in the Himalaya. Apart from contributing significantly to river discharge, the extent of the snow cover influences glacier nourishment, melting dynamics, and the intensity of the summer monsoon. Considering that the meteorological data is often scarce and unevenly distributed in the high mountain region, remote sensing studies become particularly crucial. In this study, we investigate the spatiotemporal characteristics and trends of snow cover percentage in Zanskar valley using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) eight-day snow cover product (MOD10A2) from 2001 to 2021. Our findings indicate that the proportion of snow cover in the Zanskar valley has not decreased significantly during the last two decades. The annual average snow cover in Zanskar is 68%, with a maximum in the month of March (96%) and minimum in August (32%). Trend analysis showed no change in the snow cover below an altitude of 3500 m above mean sea level (asl) during the study period. The majority of the changes in snow cover percentage occurred between an altitude of ~4,500 and 5,500 m asl. An overall positive trend in the percentage of snow cover was observed from 2001 to 2021. The snow cover data was also compared to the Climatic Research Unit's (CRU) station interpolated data to look for any substantial contradiction; however any significant incongruity was not observed.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variations of Microwave Land Surface Emissivity (MLSE) over China Derived from Four-Year Recalibrated Fengyun 3B MWRI Data
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Microwave Land Surface Emissivity (MLSE) over China under both clear and cloudy sky conditions was retrieved using measurements of recalibrated microwave brightness temperatures (Tbs) from Fengyun-3B Microwave Radiation Imager (FY-3B MWRI), combined with cloud properties derived from Himawari-8 Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) observations. The contributions from cloud particles and atmospheric gases to the upwelling Tbs at the top of atmosphere were calculated and removed in radiative transfer. The MLSEs at horizontal polarizations at 10.65, 18.7, and 36.5 GHz during 7 July 2015 to 30 June 2019 over China showed high values in the southeast vegetated area and low values in the northwest barren, or sparsely vegetated, area. The maximum values were found in the belt area of the Qinling-Taihang Mountains and the eastern edge of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, which is highly consistent with MLSEs derived from AMSR-E. It demonstrates that the measurements of FY-3B MWRI Tbs, including its calibration and validation, are reliable, and the retrieval algorithm developed in this study works well. Seasonal variations of MLSE in China are mainly driven by the combined effects of vegetation, rainfall, and snow cover. In tropical and southern forest regions, the seasonal variation of MLSE is small due to the enhancement from vegetation and the suppression from rainfall. In the boreal area, snow causes a significant decrease of MLSE at 36.5 GHz in winter. Meanwhile, the MLSE at lower frequencies experiences less suppression. In the desert region in Xinjiang, increases of MLSEs at all frequencies are observed with increasing snow cover.

TI  - Generating gapless land surface temperature with a high spatio-temporal resolution by fusing multi-source satellite-observed and model-simulated data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a key parameter when monitoring land surface processes. However, cloud contamination and the tradeoff between the spatial and temporal resolutions greatly impede the access to highquality thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing data. Despite the massive efforts made to solve these dilemmas, it is still difficult to generate LST estimates with concurrent spatial completeness and a high spatio-temporal resolution. Land surface models (LSMs) can be used to simulate gapless LST with a high temporal resolution, but this usually comes with a low spatial resolution. In this paper, we present an integrated temperature fusion framework for satellite-observed and LSM-simulated LST data to map gapless LST at a 60-m spatial resolution and halfhourly temporal resolution. The global linear model (GloLM) model and the diurnal land surface temperature cycle (DTC) model are respectively performed as preprocessing steps for sensor and temporal normalization between the different LST data. The Landsat LST, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST, and Community Land Model Version 5.0 (CLM 5.0)-simulated LST are then fused using a filter-based spatiotemporal integrated fusion model. Evaluations were implemented in an urban-dominated region (the city of Wuhan in China) and a natural-dominated region (the Heihe River Basin in China), in terms of accuracy, spatial variability, and diurnal temporal dynamics. Results indicate that the fused LST under all-weather conditions is highly consistent with actual Landsat LST data (in situ LST measurements), in terms of a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.94 (0.96-0.99), a mean absolute error of 0.71-0.98 K (0.82-3.34 K), and a root-mean-square error of 0.97-1.26 K (1.09-4.36 K). The generated diurnal Landsat-like LSTs under all weather conditions are able to support diurnal dynamic studies that are the most relevant to human activities, such as the study of urban heat islands (UHIs) and water resource management at the field scale.

TI  - Understanding worldview beliefs to allay skepticism toward CSR advertising
T2  - JOURNAL OF BRAND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding consumers' worldview beliefs can lead to more effective brand communication. Study 1 demonstrates that addressing consumers' worldview beliefs directly in brand CSR communications can offset the influence of their trait skepticism toward persuasive messages. Study 2 provides evidence that worldview beliefs function independently of trait skepticism in predicting brand attitudes, particularly concerning brand warmth. Worldview beliefs can also account for an apparent relationship between consumers' skepticism and their attribution of motives to a firm. Thus, the theoretical contribution underscores the importance of understanding consumers' worldview beliefs as a construct that is distinct from trait skepticism. For managers, the manuscript offers guidance in ways to fend off possible consumer skepticism when crafting environment-related CSR communication. In terms of a methodological contribution, consumers' attributions of a firm's motives typically involve measuring a mixture of altruistic and firm-oriented motives, and the attributions can be assessed more precisely by using separate unipolar measures instead of relying on typical bipolar measures.

TI  - Trends in methamphetamine use, markets and harms in Australia, 2003-2019
T2  - DRUG AND ALCOHOL REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction To describe trends in methamphetamine use, markets and harms in Australia from 2003 to 2019. Methods Data comprised patterns of use and price from sentinel samples of people who inject drugs and who use MDMA/other illicit stimulants and population-level amphetamine-related police seizures, arrests, hospitalisations, treatment episodes and deaths from approximately 2003 to 2019. Bayesian autoregressive time-series models were analysed for: no change; constant rate of change; and change over time differing in rate after one to three changepoints. Related indicators were analysed post hoc with identical changepoints. Results The percentage of people who inject drugs reporting weekly use increased from 2010 to 2013 onwards, while use among samples of people who regularly use ecstasy and other illicit stimulants decreased. Seizures and arrests rose steeply from around 2009/10 to 2014/15 and subsequently plateaued. Price increased ($15.9 [95% credible interval, CrI $9.9, $28.9] per point of crystal per year) from around 2009 to 2011, plateauing and then declining from around 2017. Hospitalisation rates increased steeply from around 2009/10 until 2015/16, with a small subsequent decline. Treatment also increased (19.8 episodes [95% CrI 13.2, 27.6] with amphetamines as the principal drug of concern per 100 000 persons per year) from 2010/11 onwards. Deaths involving amphetamines increased (0.285 per 100 000 persons per year) from 2012 until 2016. Discussion and Conclusions These findings suggest that problematic methamphetamine use and harms escalated from 2010 to 2012 in Australia, with continued demand and a sustained market for methamphetamine.

TI  - Forecasting seasonal plot-specific crop coefficient (Kc) protocol for processing tomato using remote sensing, meteorology, and artificial intelligence
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The crop coefficient (Kc) is a key parameter in irrigation scheduling decision-making and depends on local conditions, e.g., crop type, weather, and topography. Kc protocol or curve, and the derived growth stages, describe generally the expected behavior of the crop during the growing season and growers use it to different extents. However, Kc protocols are usually experimentally determined and hence spatially limited. This study shows an approach to generate an estimated plot-specific Kc protocol in a more cost-effective way that is not spatially limited. To that end, data for almost 600 commercial processing tomato plots were collected. The data included the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8, meteorological data, and plot properties such as country, and the season start date. Then, an artificial intelligence model was trained on the 2017-2019 growing seasons and validated for 2020. At the beginning of the season, the model estimated the crop behavior in terms of Kc for the entire season. Additionally, a piecewise regression model was employed to estimate the crop growth stages in terms of days from the season start. The results of this study show improvement in both Kc and growth stage estimation, compared to experimental Kc protocols. The results can help design the irrigation regime (when and how much irrigation is needed) at the plot level and thus improve the ability to allocate the required water amounts between plots in real-time and even to plan it before the season starts.

TI  - Evolution of Frozen Section in Carcinoma Breast: Systematic Review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BREAST CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Background. The frozen section (FS) has been a good technique in surgical management of breast lesions since many years. But complete agreement and cooperation have not been achieved everywhere among surgeons and pathologists especially in the developing countries. FS undergoes continuous criticism due to various shortcomings but continued to be evaluated especially in developing countries. Objectives. This review was conducted to synthesize information on the use of frozen section in carcinoma breast. Data Sources. The MEDLINE database for frozen section since its origin and its implication in recent breast surgery techniques was studied. Study Eligibility Criteria. Sixty-five articles were reviewed with complete analysis on FS in both benign and malignant breast lesions. Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods. The analysis of frozen section was done as a diagnostic tool in breast lesions, margin status in breast conservative surgery in carcinoma breast, and sentinel lymph node and use of immunohistochemistry for sentinel lymph node FS. Results. It was analysed that the FS gives accurate results in margin status analysis, decreasing rerecurrence. Conclusion. The accuracy of FSA, low recurrence rate, avoidance of reoperation, and good cosmesis are the key points of its use in breast conservative surgery. Its use in sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is equivocal. However, application of immunohistochemistry on frozen section of SLNB is an evolving trend in today's era.

TI  - Soil Salinity Estimation Over Coastal Wetlands Based on Random Forest Algorithm and Hydrological Connectivity Metric
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Owing to climate warming and human activities (irrigation and reservoirs), sea level rise and runoff reduction have been threatening the coastal ecosystem by increasing the soil salinity. However, short-term sparse in situ observations limit the study on the response of coastal soil salinity to external stressors and thus its effect on coastal ecosystem. In this study, based on hydrological connectivity metric and random forest algorithm (RF), we develop a coastal soil salinity inversion model with in situ observations and satellite-based datasets. Using Landsat images and ancillary as input variables, we produce a 30-m monthly grid dataset of surface soil salinity over the Yellow River Delta. Based on the cross-validation result with in situ observations, the proposed RF model performs higher accuracy and stability with determination coefficient of 0.89, root mean square error of 1.48 g center dot kg(-1), and mean absolute error of 1.05 g center dot kg(-1). The proposed RF model can gain the accuracy improvements of about 11-43% over previous models at different conditions. The spatial distribution and seasonal variabilities of soil salinity is sensitive to the changing signals of runoff, tide, and local precipitation. Combining spatiotemporal collaborative information with the hydrological connectivity metric, we found that the proposed RF model can accurately estimate surface soil salinity, especially in natural reserved regions. The modeling results of surface soil salinity can be significant for exploring the effect of seawater intrusion and runoff reduction to the evolution of coastal salt marsh ecosystems.

TI  - Response of drought index to land use types in the Loess Plateau of Shaanxi, China
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is influenced by numerous factors, and traditional studies have only considered meteorological factors, but human activities are also an important influencing factor. From 1980 to 2010, the reform and opening up and the project of returning farmland to forest have largely changed the land use type of Loess Plateau in Shaanxi. In order to study the influence of land use types on drought in the study area, 8 stations with different land use types were selected based on remote sensing data and meteorological data. Based on univariate linear regression, the response of the drought index SPI to land use types was analyzed sequentially in each of the five time stages. The results showed that from 1980 to 2000, forest had the greatest drought intensity, followed by arable land and town and country. However, the response of arable land to the drought index was the greatest, followed by town and country. Forest had the weakest response to the drought index. From 2000 to 2010, the greatest degree of drought was observed in forest, followed by town and country and arable land. And forest has the strongest response to the drought index, followed by town and country, and finally, arable land. The area of forest, grass and town and country keeps increasing. The area of arable land is decreasing year by year. Land use types are constantly undergoing complex transformations. The drought index responds strongly to the change of both arable land to grass and arable land to town and country, while it responds weakly to the mutual transformation of both grass and town and country. In the areas where meteorological conditions are difficult to change, the local drought is considered to be improved by changing the substrate type.

AB  - Cervical cancer is the most common gynecological malignant carcinoma in Chinese women, which seriously threatens women's health. Lymph node metastasis is the most important factor affecting the prognosis and adjuvant treatment of patients with early cervical cancer. Conventional systematic lymphadenectomy has always been a reliable method to detect lymph node metastasis. However, this procedure may affect the quality of life of patients because of high risks of complications. Recently, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has been researched aiming to assess the status of pelvic lymph node metastasis intraoperatively, avoid unnecessary lymphadenectomy and achieve the goal of individualized diagnosis and treatment. Exploring efficient tracing methods and pathological ultra-staging is the key to the clinical application of SLNB for cervical cancer, and understanding the latest relevant clinical research progress will help SLNB to be applied in the clinic as soon as possible to benefit patients with cervical cancer.
AB  - 子宫颈癌是中国女性最常见的妇科恶性肿瘤，严重危害女性健康。淋巴结转移是影响早期子宫颈癌预后和辅助治疗的最主要因素。传统的盆腔淋巴结清扫术一直是确定淋巴结转移情况的可靠手段，但其并发症发生率高，严重影响患者的生活质量。前哨淋巴结活检术(SLNB)的应用旨在高效、准确评估盆腔淋巴结转移状态，以避免不必要的淋巴结清扫术，达到个体化诊疗目的。探索高效的前哨淋巴结示踪方法和病理学检测方法是子宫颈癌SLNB临床应用的关键，了解最新相关临床研究进展，有助于SLNB早日应用于临床，使子宫颈癌患者受益。.

T2  - Zhonghua zhong liu za zhi [Chinese journal of oncology]
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: To explore the independent risk factors of internal mammary lymph nodes (IMN) metastasis and the risk assessment method of IMN metastasis preoperatively in breast cancer patients with negative IMN in imaging examination, and guide the radiotherapy of IMN in patients with different risk stratification of IMN metastasis. Methods: The clinical and pathological data of 301 breast cancer patients who underwent internal mammary sentinel node biopsy(IM-SLNB) and/or IMN dissection in Shandong Cancer Hospital with negative IMN on CT and/or MRI from January 2010 to October 2019 were analyzed retrospectively. The independent risk factors were analyzed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression, and the independent risk factors of IMN metastasis were used to risk stratification. Results: Among the 301 patients, 43 patients had IMN metastasis, and the rate of IMN metastasis was 14.3%. Univariate analysis showed that vascular tumor thrombus, progesterone receptor (PR) expression, T stage and N stage were associated with IMN metastasis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that tumor located in medial quadrant, positive PR and axillary lymph node metastasis were independent risk factors for IMN metastasis. The risk of IMN metastasis was assessed according to the independent risk factors of the patients: low-risk group is including 0 risk factor, medium-risk group is including 1 risk factor, and high-risk group is including 2-3 risk factors. According to this evaluation criteria, 301 patients with breast cancer were divided into low-risk group (with 0 risk factors), medium-risk group (with 1 risk factor) and high-risk group (with 2-3 risk factors). The IMN metastasis rates were 0 (0/34), 4.3% (6/140) and 29.1% (37/127), respectively. Conclusions: The risk stratification of IMN metastasis according to three independent risk factors of IMN metastasis including tumor located in medial quadrant, positive PR and axillary lymph node metastasis in breast cancer patients can guide the radiotherapy of IMN in newly diagnosed breast cancer patients. For N1 patients, radiotherapy of IMN is strongly recommended when the primary tumor is located in the medial quadrant and/or PR positive.

M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Randomized Controlled Trial
AB  - Objective: To evaluate the feasibility of identification and preservation of arm lymphatics (DEPART) in axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for breast cancer to prevent arm lymphedema. Methods: A randomized controlled study method was used. Two hundred and sixty-five patients who underwent breast cancer surgery at the Department of Thyroid and Breast Surgery, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from November 2017 to June 2018 were included, and the patients were randomly divided into ALND+ DEPART group (132 patients) and standard ALND group (133 patients) by random number table method. In the ALND+ DEPART group, indocyanine green and methylene blue were injected as tracers before surgery, and the arm sentinel nodes was visualized by staged tracing during intraoperative dissection of axillary lymph nodes. Partial frozen sections were made of arm lymph nodes >1 cm in length and hard and suspicious of metastasis, and arm lymph nodes and lymphatic vessels were selectively preserved. Patients in the standard ALND group underwent standard ALND. Objective and subjective indexes of arm lymphedema were evaluated by 5-point circumference measurement and Norman questionnaire. Results: Among 132 breast cancer patients in the ALND+ DEPART group, 121 (91.7%) completed DEPART. There were no statistically significant differences in age, body mass index, pathological type, dissection number of axillary lymph node, N stage, TNM stage, molecular typing, and regional radiotherapy between the ALND+ DEPART and standard ALND groups (P>0.05). At a median follow-up of 24 months, assessment by the 5-point circumference measurement showed that the incidence rates of lymphedema in the ALND+ DEPART and standard ALND groups were 5.0% (6/121) and 15.8% (21/133), respectively, with statistically significant differences (P=0.005). Assessment by the Norman questionnaire showed that the incidence rates of lymphedema in the ALND+ DEPART and standard ALND groups were 5.8% (7/121) and 21.8% (29/133), respectively, with a statistically significant difference (P<0.001). No local regional recurrence was observed in either group during the follow-up period. Conclusion: For breast cancer patients with positive axillary lymph nodes, the administration of DEPART during ALND can reduce or avoid the occurrence of arm lymphedema without compromising oncology safety.
AB  - 目的： 评估腋窝淋巴结清扫术(ALND)中施行识别并保护上肢淋巴系统技术(DEPART)对预防或减轻乳腺癌患者术后上肢淋巴水肿的效果。 方法： 采用随机对照研究方法。纳入2017年11月至2018年6月在武汉大学中南医院甲乳外科拟行乳腺癌手术的265例患者，通过随机数字表法，将患者随机分为ALND+DEPART组(132例)和标准ALND组(133例)。ALND+DEPART组患者术前注射示踪剂吲哚菁绿和亚甲蓝，术中清扫腋窝淋巴结时，采用分级显影方法示踪上肢淋巴系统，对长径>1 cm、质硬可疑转移的上肢淋巴结做1/4部分冰冻切片，选择性保留上肢淋巴结及淋巴管。标准ALND组患者行标准ALND。术后分别采用5点周径测量体积法和Norman问卷调查，对患者的上肢淋巴水肿情况进行客观和主观指标评估。 结果： ALND+DEPART组132例乳腺癌患者中，121例(91.7 %)完成DEPART。ALND+DEPART组和标准ALND组患者的年龄、体质指数、病理类型、腋窝淋巴结清扫数目、N分期、TNM分期、分子分型、区域放疗差异均无统计学意义(均P>0.05)。中位随访24个月，5点周径测量体积法评估显示，ALND+DEPART组和标准ALND组的淋巴水肿发生率分别为5.0%(6/121)和15.8%(21/133)，差异有统计学意义(P＝0.005)。Norman问卷调查法评估显示，ALND+DEPART组和标准ALND组的淋巴水肿发生率分别为5.8%(7/121)和21.8%(29/133)，差异有统计学意义(P<0.001)。两组患者均未出现局部区域复发。 结论： 对腋窝淋巴结阳性的乳腺癌患者，ALND术中施行DEPART，能在保证肿瘤安全性的基础上，减少或避免上肢淋巴水肿的发生。.

TI  - LAI-NOS: An automatic network observation system for leaf area index based on hemispherical photography
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The leaf area index (LAI) is an important indicator reflecting the growth status of vegetation and is widely used in agriculture, ecology, climate change, and other fields. The shortcomings of the currently available methods for manually measuring LAI include labor-intensive, low sampling frequency, and asynchronous data collection. Focusing on these issues, a LAI sensor based on hemispherical photogrammetry and an automatic network observation system (LAI-NOS) for LAI were developed, which consists of four parts: LAI sensor, sensor node, sink node, and online data management system. The LAI sensor measures LAI values based on hemispherical photography. The sensor node is responsible for controlling the sensor and obtaining the data measured by the LAI sensor. The sink node is responsible for local networking and communication with the remote server. Data storage, data management, data display, and sampling frequency are managed by the online data management system. Comparative studies with LAI-2200C and satellite products were also conducted in this study. The comparative study with LAI-2200C showed that the LAI measurements of different vegetation types from both sources were highly significantly correlated whether based on Pearson regression or Passing & Bablok regression. A preliminary study comparing LAI-NOS measurements with Sentinel-2 inversion LAI and MODIS LAI products (MOD15A2H) showed (1) all LAI-NOS nodes measurements agreed very well with Sentinel-2 inversion LAI in the experimental period (average R-2=0.94, RMSE=0.41); (2) the possible overestimate of Sentinel-2 inversion LAI was found in the middle stage of wheat (jointing-anthesis); (3) MOD15A2H and LAI-NOS measurements showed similar crop growth trends in long-term observations.

TI  - iTRAQ proteomics of sentinel lymph nodes for identification of extracellular matrix proteins to flag metastasis in early breast cancer
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Patients with early breast cancer are affected by metastasis to axillary lymph nodes. Metastasis to these nodes is crucial for staging and quality of surgery. Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy that is currently used to assess lymph node metastasis is not effective. This necessitates identification of biomarkers that can flag metastasis. Early stage breast cancer patients were recruited. Surgical resection of breast was followed by identification of sentinel lymph nodes. Fresh frozen section biopsy was used to assign metastatic and non-metastatic sentinel lymph nodes. Discovery phase included iTRAQ proteomics coupled with mass spectrometric analysis to identify differentially expressed proteins. Data is available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD027668. Validation was done by bioinformatic analysis and ELISA. There were 2398 unique protein groups and 109 differentially expressed proteins comparing metastatic and non-metastatic lymph nodes. Forty nine proteins were up-regulated, and sixty proteins that were down regulated in metastatic group. Bioinformatic analysis showed ECM-receptor interaction pathways to be implicated in lymph node metastasis. ELISA confirmed up-regulation of ECM proteins in metastatic lymph nodes. ECM proteins have requisite parameters to be developed as a diagnostic tool to assess status of sentinel lymph nodes to guide surgical intervention in early breast cancer.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In the recent decades, cities have been expanding at a great pace which changes the landscape rapidly as a result of inflow of people from rural areas and economic progression. Therefore, understanding spatiotemporal dynamics of human induced land use land cover changes has become an important issue to deal with the challenges for making sustainable cities. This study aims to determine the rate of landscape transformations along with its causes and consequences as well as predicting urban growth pattern in Delhi and its environs. Landsat satellite images of 1989, 2000, 2010 and 2020 were used to determine the changes in land use land cover using supervised maximum likelihood classification. Subsequently, Land Change Modeler (LCM) module of TerrSet software was used to generate future urban growth for the year 2030 based on 2010 and 2020 dataset. Validation was carried out by overlaying the actual and simulated 2020 maps. The change detection results showed that urban and open areas increased by 13.44% and 2.40%, respectively, with a substantial decrease in crop land (10.88%) from 1989 to 2020 and forest area increased by 3.48% in 2020 due to restoration programmes Furthermore, the simulated output of 2030 predicted an increase of 24.30% in urban area and kappa coefficient 0.96. Thus, knowledge of the present and predicted changes will help decision-makers and planners during the process of formulating new sustainable policies, master plans and economic strategies for rapidly growing cities with urban blue-green infrastructures.

TI  - Spatial patterns of unburned refugia in Siberian larch forests during the exceptional 2020 fire season
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim Wildfire is an essential disturbance agent that creates burn mosaics, or a patchwork of burned and unburned areas across the landscape. Unburned patches, fire refugia, serve as carbon sinks and seed sources for forest regeneration in burned areas. In the Cajander larch (Larix cajanderi Mayr.) forests of north-eastern Siberia, an unprecedented wildfire season in 2020 and little documentation of landscape patch dynamics have resulted in research gaps about the characteristics of fire refugia in northern latitude forests, which are warming faster than other global forest ecosystems. We aim to characterize the 2010 distribution of fire refugia for these forest ecosystems and evaluate their topographic drivers. Location North-eastern Siberia across the North-east Siberian Taiga and the Cherskii-Kolyma Mountain Tundra ecozones. Time period 2001-2020. Major taxa studied Cajander larch. Methods We used Landsat imagery to define burned and unburned patches, and the Arctic digital elevation model to calculate topographic variables. We characterized the size and density of fire refugia. We sampled individual pixels (n = 80,000) from an image stack that included a binary burned/unburned, elevation, slope, aspect, topographic position index, ruggedness, and tree cover from 2001 to 2020. We evaluated the topographic drivers of fire refugia with boosted regression trees. Results We found no substantial difference in fire refugia size and density across the region. The fire refugia size averaged 7.2 ha (0.09-150,439 ha). The majority of interior burned patches exceed the potential wind dispersal distance from fire refugia. Topographic position index and terrain steepness were important predictors of fire refugia. Main conclusions Unprecedented wildfires in 2020 did not impact fire refugia formation. Fire refugia are strongly controlled by topographic positions such as uplands and lowlands that influence microsite hydrological conditions. Fire refugia contribute to postfire landscape heterogeneity that preserves ecosystem functions, seed sources, habitat, and carbon sinks.

TI  - A novel nomogram and risk classification system for predicting lymph node metastasis of breast mucinous carcinoma: A SEER-based study
T2  - CANCER MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Mucinous breast cancer (MBC) is a rare disease, and patients with lymph node metastasis (LNM) have a poor prognosis. We aimed to explore the predictive factors of LNM and to construct a nomogram for predicting the risk of LNM and to identify the suitable axillary surgery for patients with diverse risks. Patients and Methods Data were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Chi-square and rank-sum tests were used to analyze the differences between groups. Survival analysis was performed with Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests. Independent factor identification and nomogram construction were performed with logistic regression analysis. The nomogram was qualified with a discrimination and calibration plot. Propensity score matching was performed to balance the disparities between groups. Results Patients with metastatic lymph nodes have a worse prognosis. Univariate and multivariate analyses indicated that tumor size, grade, and age were independent risk factors for LNM. The nomogram constructed with these three factors can predict the risk of LNM with high accuracy (AUC: 0.767, 95% CI: 0.697-0.838) and good calibration. Based on the nomogram, a risk classification system satisfactorily stratified the patients into 3 groups with diverse risks of LNM. In the low-risk group, there were no significant differences between sentinel lymph node biopsy and no axillary surgery. In the middle- and high-risk groups, both SLNB and axillary lymph node dissection were superior to no axillary surgery, with similar survival benefits. Conclusions The nomogram based on tumor size, grade, and age could conveniently and accurately predict the risk of LNM in MBC and assist clinicians in optimizing surgical strategies.

TI  - Mono-temporal and multi-temporal approaches for burnt area detection using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery (a case study of Rokan Hilir Regency, Indonesia)
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and up-to-date information about the burnt area is important in estimating environmental losses, prioritizing rehabilitation areas, and determining future planning strategies. The publicly available medium resolution optical Sentinel-2 satellite data provides a practical and effective solution for burnt area detection. In this study, we proposed two different approaches using mono-temporal and multi-temporal Sentinel-2 satellite imagery to detect burnt areas in Rokan Hilir Regency, Indonesia. The multi-temporal approaches utilized two different ensemble machine learning algorithms (Random Forest and XGBoost) and used six composite spectral indices of the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR), differenced Normalized Burn Ratio 2 (dNBR2), differenced Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (dNDVI), differenced Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (dSAVI), differenced Char Soil Index (dCSI), differenced Burnt area Index for Sentinel-2 (dBAIS2), and differenced Mid infrared Burn Index (dMIRBI) as model inputs. The burnt areas are labeled by combining hotspots with confidence intervals above 95%, fire spots, and change detection methods. The XGBoost model achieved the best performance with an F1 score of 0.97 and an accuracy of 96%. Furthermore, we use the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to quantify the contribution of each feature as well as its correlation with the target class. The dNBR, dMIRBI, and dNBR2 indices contribute the most to the XGBoost model. In comparison, this study also investigates and compares a mono-temporal approach with One-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN-1D) architecture and the performance obtained is slightly better than both machine learning models. Overall, both mono-temporal and multi-temporal approaches satisfactorily detect the burnt area.

TI  - Accurate Ranging Based on Transmission Line Channel Monitoring Image and Point Cloud Data Mapping
T2  - SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS
M3  - Article
AB  - Three-dimensional (3D) mapping of power lines is essential for power line inspection. Many remotely sensed data products like light detection and ranging (LiDAR) have been examined for power line surveys. More and more data are being obtained via photogrammetric measurements. This increases the need for the implementation of advanced processing techniques. In recent years, there has been a significant advancement in visualization techniques for power lines using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platform photography. The most advanced of such imaging systems can create dense point clouds. However, the accuracy is very often unstable and dependent on the radiometric quality of images and the efficiency of the image processing technique. In this study, the two-dimensional information is obtained by photographing the real-time panorama of the transmission line channel using a 3D camera, and the three-dimensional information is acquired using laser radar technology. The three-dimensional point orientation of the target object and the transmission line is determined using the mapping relationship between two and three dimensions, the obtained data are calculated, and the calculation results are produced. The proposed method can solve the problem of the image sensor being unable to map spatial distance and can provide broad coverage of the transmission line channel and 24-hours accurate real-time remote monitoring.

TI  - Long-term monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in sewage samples from specific public places and STPs to track COVID-19 spread and identify potential hotspots
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Coronavirus pandemic started in March 2020 and since then has caused millions of deaths worldwide. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) can be used as an epidemiological surveillance tool to track SARS-CoV-2 dissemination and provide warning of COVID-19 outbreaks. Considering that there are public places that could be potential hotspots of infected people that may reflect the local epidemiological situation, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was analyzed by RT-qPCR for approximately 16 months in sewage samples from five public places located in the metropolitan area of Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil: the sewage treatment plant of Confins International Airport (AIR), the main interstate bus terminal (BUS), an upscale shopping centre (SHC1), a popular shopping centre (SHC2) and a university institute (UNI). The results were compared to those of the influent sewage of the two main sewage treatment plants of Belo Horizonte (STP1 and STP2). Viral monitoring in the STPs proved to be an useful regional surveillance tool, reflecting the trends of COVID-19 cases. However, the viral concentrations in the samples from the selected public places were generally much lower than those of the municipal STPs, which may be due to the behaviour of the non-infected or asymptomatic people, who are likely to visit these places relatively more than the symptomatic infected ones. Among these places, the AIR samples presented the highest viral concentrations and concentration peaks were observed previously to local outbreaks. Therefore, airport sewage monitoring can provide an indication of the regional epidemiological situation. For the other places, particularly the UNI, the results suggested a greater potential to detect the infection and trace cases especially among employees and regular attendees. Taken together, the results indicate that for a regular and permanent sentinel sewage surveillance the sewage from STPs, AIR and UNI could be monitored.

TI  - Research of urban atmospheric aerosols of the Lower Volga under conditions of anthropogenic load and active zones of Earth
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In settlements, special attention is given to the study of anthropogenic aerosol pollution, and insufficient attention is given to natural sources of pollution, especially from active zones of the Earth. The aim of this work was to study atmospheric pollution (the Srednyaya Akhtuba village (Volgograd region, Russia)) using indicators (pH; EC, mu S/cm) of aerosol suspensions (washing off aerosols from the leaves of Prunus armeniaca L.) during 2018-2020 and the forecast of pollution sources. Research hypothesis: low mineralization and close to neutral acidity of aerosol suspensions indicate the purity of the atmospheric air, and there is no load of anthropogenic and natural sources. Acid mineralized aerosols were found in the residential area of Srednyaya Akhtuba, which indicates air pollution during 2018-2020. The correlation relationship between pH and EC in mu S/cm was investigated using standard least squares regression. The results obtained indicate statistically significant differences between the experimental territory and the (relatively) clean location from 2018 to 2020 in terms of the studied indicators, as well as the revealed correlation between them in Srednyaya Akhtuba village, which indicates the revealed patterns and the influence of the system factor. Anthropogenic and natural sources were the system factors. The authors predict an active underground ancient volcanic zone in the area of Srednyaya Akhtuba with a possible natural load on the residential areas of the village, the assumption of which is based on analysis of heat anomaly maps using the Landsat-8 program and other programs.

TI  - Density Map-based vehicle counting in remote sensing images with limited resolution
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Observing traffic flow is of great significance to contemporary urban management. Overhead images, as represented by remote sensing images, provide a major source of information about traffic flow. However, the spatial resolutions of most common high-resolution remote sensing images are often limited to 0.5 m and even below, which makes it unrealistic to count vehicles by means of widely used object detection methods. Therefore, to explore the potential of remote sensing data for studying global urban development and management, this paper introduces a density map-based vehicle counting method for remote sensing imagery with limited resolution. Density map-based models regard the vehicle counting task as estimating the density of vehicle targets in terms of pixel values. We propose an improved CNN-based network, called Congested Scene Recognition Network Minus (CSRNet-), that generates a density map of vehicles from the input remote sensing imagery. A new dataset, RSVC2021, which was generated from the public DOTA and ITCVD datasets, is also introduced for network training and testing. A benchmark on the RSVC2021 dataset is accordingly established and CSRNet- is selected as the baseline model for subsequent experiments. A set of GF-2 time series images with a resolution of 1 m taken before, during and after the COVID-19 epidemic lockdown covering Wuhan city are applied for realworld application testing. The testing results on both the RSVC2021 dataset and real satellite images confirm that, in terms of both the counting values and the visualized density maps, the proposed method achieves good performance and exhibits considerable application potential in this task. The generating codes of RSVC2021 dataset will be publicly available at https://github.com/YinongGuo/RSVC2021-Dataset.

TI  - A new deep learning approach based on bilateral semantic segmentation models for sustainable estuarine wetland ecosystem management
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays, estuarial areas have been strongly affected by the construction of electrical power dams from upstream, downstream urbanization and many types of hazards along the coastal regions. It has resulted in significant changes in estuarine wetland ecosystems between rainy and dry seasons. To avoid estuary vulnerability, monitoring and evaluation of the estuarine ecosystems are very critical tasks. The main goal of this research is to propose and implement a novel deep learning method in monitoring various ecosystems in estuarine regions. The processing speed and accuracy of common neural networks is improved more than ten times through spatial and context paths integrated into a novel Bilateral Segmentation Network (BiSeNet). The multi-sensor and multi-temporal satellite images (including Sentinel-2, ALOS-DEM, and NOAA-DEM images) served as input data. As a result, four BiSeNet models out of 20 trained models achieved a greater than 90% accuracy, especially for interpreting estuarine waters, intertidal forested wetlands, and aquacultural lands in subtidal regions. These models outperformed Random Forest and Support Vector Machine approaches. The best one was used to map estuarine ecosystems from 12 satellite images over a five-year period in the largest estuary in northern Vietnam. The ecosystem changes between dry and rainy seasons were analyzed in detail to assess the ecological succession in estuaries. Furthermore, this model can potentially update new estuarine ecosystem types in other estuarine areas across the world, making possible real-time monitoring and assessing estuarine ecological conditions for sustainable management of wetland ecosystem.

TI  - Tree-fruits crop type mapping from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data integration in Egypt?s New Delta project
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Horticulture maps are absent in Egypt, despite the vital importance of horticulture crops as a main part of the agriculture economy. The available land use/cover datasets have only one cropland category, with no detailed information on crop types, areas, and spatial distribution, which are essential information for a wide range of agriculture applications. Hence, producing crop type maps from remote sensing was addressed in many studies, focusing more on mapping herbaceous crop types rather than horticulture crops. The earlier studies also indicated the high spectral and phenological similarities among various tree-fruits crops, which hampered the accurate mapping of horticulture crops. Hence, the current study aims to find the best approach for accurate tree-fruits mapping by testing different temporal stacking windows, spectral stacking methods, and various integration scenarios between Sentinel-2 optical (S2) and Sentinel-1 SAR (S1) data as inputs to the random forest (RF) classifier. Comparative accuracy analysis showed that using time series S2 spectral bands (SBs) and vegetation indices (VIs) can classify various tree crop types with very high accuracy (96%), while using S1 polarization channels with some added S1 textural features could yield a high classification accuracy (85.2%). Hence, the optical and SAR data integration further improved the discrimination of tree crops, particularly those with similar spectral characteristics (e.g., mango, citrus, and olive). The use of annual or seasonal time series images achieved better accuracy (by 7-8%) than the monthly stacked images. Despite its high dimensionality, the temporal image that contains all months' S2 SBs & VIs achieved higher accuracy (by 1.5%) than the reduced image that contains the annual statistical layers (e.g., maximum and minimum values of each SBs and VIs). The best integration scenario that achieved the highest accuracy (OA = 96.31 & Kappa = 0.96) was adding S1 textural features to S2 spectral features.

TI  - Vegetation response to soil moisture and groundwater in west-central Africa revealed by satellite observations
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we explore the soil water effect on vegetation growth in west-central Africa using remotely sensed near-surface soil moisture content (nSMC), terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA), and leaf area index (LAI). TWSA is the only data to reflect deeper soil water used by perennial plants with their deep root systems, which microwave sensors cannot observe. However, deep groundwater complicates investigating the water availability of plants using TWSA. We confirmed that the TWSA's slope during the dry season, which might be caused by vegetation transpiration, was steeper towards equatorial regions. Our results show that the relationship between LAI and the TWSA's inclination during the dry season was negatively correlated in areas where the LAI was below 2 and the precipitation was less than 40 mm/month. This finding might enable us to investigate the water availability of perennial plants by focusing on the TWSA's slope during the dry season.

TI  - Luojia-HSSR: A high spatial-spectral resolution remote sensing dataset for land-cover classification with a new 3D-HRNet
T2  - GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - High Spatial and Spectral Resolution (HSSR) remote-sensing images can provide rich spectral bands and detailed ground information, but there is a relative lack of research on this new type of remote-sensing data. Although there are already some HSSR datasets for deep learning model training and testing, the data volume of these datasets is small, resulting in low classification accuracy and weak generalization ability of the trained models. In this paper, an HSSR dataset Luojia-HSSR is constructed based on aerial hyperspectral imagery of southern Shenyang City of Liaoning Province in China. To our knowledge, it is the largest HSSR dataset to date, with 6438 pairs of 256 x 256 sized samples (including 3480 pairs in the training set, 2209 pairs in the test set, and 749 pairs in the validation set), covering area of 161 km(2) with spatial resolution 0.75 m, 249 Visible and Near-Infrared (VNIR) spectral bands, and corresponding to 23 classes of field-validated ground coverage. It is an ideal experimental data for spatial-spectral feature extraction. Furthermore, a new deep learning model 3D-HRNet for interpreting HSSR images is proposed. The conv-neck in HRNet is modified to better mine the spatial information of the images. Then, a 3D convolution module with attention mechanism is designed to capture the global-local fine spectral information simultaneously. Subsequently, the 3D convolution is inserted into the HRNet to optimize the performance. The experiments show that the 3D-HRNet model has good interpreting ability for the Luojia-HSSR dataset with the Frequency Weighted Intersection over Union(FWIoU? reaching 80.54%, indicating that the Luojia-HSSR dataset constructed in this paper and the proposed 3D-HRnet model have good applicable prospects for processing HSSR remote sensing images.

TI  - Improving the spatiotemporal resolution of remotely sensed ET information for water management through Landsat, Sentinel-2, ECOSTRESS and VIIRS data fusion
T2  - IRRIGATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Robust information on consumptive water use (evapotranspiration, ET) derived from remote sensing can significantly benefit water decision-making in agriculture, informing irrigation schedules and water management plans over extended regions. To be of optimal utility for operational usage, these remote sensing ET data should be generated at the sub-field spatial resolution and daily-to-weekly timesteps commensurate with the scales of water management activities. However, current methods for field-scale ET retrieval based on thermal infrared (TIR) imaging, a valuable diagnostic of canopy stress and surface moisture status, are limited by the temporal revisit of available medium-resolution (100 m or finer) thermal satellite sensors. This study investigates the efficacy of a data fusion method for combining information from multiple medium-resolution sensors toward generating high spatiotemporal resolution ET products for water management. TIR data from Landsat and ECOSTRESS (both at similar to 100-m native resolution), and VIIRS (375-m native) are sharpened to a common 30-m grid using surface reflectance data from the Harmonized Landsat-Sentinel dataset. Periodic 30-m ET retrievals from these combined thermal data sources are fused with daily retrievals from unsharpened VIIRS to generate daily, 30-m ET image timeseries. The accuracy of this mapping method is tested over several irrigated cropping systems in the Central Valley of California in comparison with flux tower observations, including measurements over irrigated vineyards collected in the GRAPEX campaign. Results demonstrate the operational value added by the augmented TIR sensor suite compared to Landsat alone, in terms of capturing daily ET variability and reduced latency for real-time applications. The method also provides means for incorporating new sources of imaging from future planned thermal missions, further improving our ability to map rapid changes in crop water use at field scales.

TI  - Downscaling MODIS nighttime land surface temperatures in urban areas using ASTER thermal data through local linear forest
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial downscaling effectively produces high spatiotemporal resolution land surface temperature (LST) in urban areas. Although nighttime LST is an essential indicator in urban thermal research, few LST downscaling studies have focused on nighttime in fine resolution. This study proposed a novel approach using local linear forest (LLF) to downscale 1 km Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) nighttime LSTs to 250 m spatial resolution in three cities: Rome, Madrid, and Seoul. First, we used Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) to select a set of past clear-sky ASTER LSTs (ALST) which showed a high spatial correlation with the target MODIS LST. Downscaling models were then developed using input kernels of the selected ALSTs and eight auxiliary variables: normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), elevation, slope, built-up area percentage, road density, population density, wind speed, and distance from the built-up weighted center of the study area. Three schemes were evaluated: scheme 1 (S1) using only auxiliary variables as input kernels with a random forest (RF) model; scheme 2 (S2) using selected ALSTs and auxiliary variables as input kernels with an RF model; and scheme 3 (S3) using input kernels as in S2 but with the LLF model. Validation was performed using bias-corrected ALSTs for seven reference dates in the three cities. LLF-based S3 showed the highest accuracy with an average correlation coefficient (R) -0.94 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) -0.64 K while maintaining the dynamic range of the original LST at the finer resolution. The downscaled LST (DLST) based on S3 effectively depicted the nocturnal thermal spatial pattern in greater detail than the other two schemes did. The S3-based DLST also showed a relatively high spatial correlation with the in-situ nighttime air temperature within the cities. When compared to the original 1 km LST, S3-based DLST showed larger surface urban heat island intensity for the urban-type surfaces and a higher temporal correlation with nighttime air temperature.

TI  - A novel composite vegetation index including solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence for seedling rapeseed net photosynthesis rate retrieval
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Net photosynthesis rate (Pn) can be used to characterize the health status of plants and their ability to accumulate organic matter. In this study, remotely sensed vegetation indices (VIs) and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) were retrieved to build regression models to estimate rapeseed canopy Pn. Multi-source unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing data collected from seedling stage rapeseed were used in this study. The results showed that Pn was significantly related to traditional VIs and SIF (R-2 = 0.52, p < 0.01). A quadratic polynomial regression model built using the normalized difference vegetation index performed the best on the inversion of Pn (R-2 = 0.63, RMSE = 2.56, NRMSE = 0.18). Moreover, this study coupled SIF with traditional VIs by mathematical operations. The composite indices obtained by multiplication resulted in increased correlations. The inversion model established using SIF x VARI (visible atmospherically resistant index) achieved the best overall performance with 0.14 increase in R-2 (0.54-0.68) and 0.48 decrease in RMSE (2.87-2.39) compared to SIF, 0.13 increase in R-2 (0.55-0.68) and 0.45 decrease in RMSE (2.84-2.39) compared to VARI. Therefore, a novel composite index obtained from the multiplication operation of individual indices improved Pn retrieval of seedling rapeseed from remotely sensed UAV data. The results from this study indicate that the novel composite index has the potential for improving the accuracy of growth status monitoring compared with traditional indices.

TI  - Land use/land cover changes in the central part of the Chitwan Annapurna Landscape, Nepal
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Land use/land cover assessment and monitoring of the land cover dynamics are essential to know the ecological, physical and anthropogenic processes in the landscape. Previous studies have indicated changes in the landscape of mid-hills of Nepal in the past few decades. But there is a lack of study in the Chitwan Annapurna Landscape; hence, this study was carried out to fill in study gap that existed in the area. Methods: This study evaluates land use/land cover dynamics between 2000 to 2020 in the central part of the Chitwan Annapurna Landscape, Nepal by using Landsat images. The Landsat images were classified into eight different classes using remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS). The accuracy assessment of classified images was evaluated by calculating actual accuracy, producer's accuracy, user's accuracy and kappa coefficient based on the ground-truthing points for 2020 and Google Earth and topographic maps for images of 2010 and 2000. Results: The results of land use/land cover analysis of Landsat image 2020 showed that the study area was composed of grassland (1.73%), barren area (1.76%), riverine forest (1.93%), water body (1.97%), developed area (4.13%), Sal dominated forest (15.4%), cropland (28.13%) and mixed forest (44.95%). The results of land cover change between 2000 to 2020 indicated an overall increase in Sal dominated forest (7.6%), developed area (31.34%), mixed forest (37.46%) and decrease in riverine forest (11.29%), barren area (20.03%), croplands (29.87%) and grasslands (49.71%). The classification of the images of 2000, 2010 and 2020 had 81%, 81.6% and 84.77% overall accuracy, respectively. This finding can be used as a baseline information for the development of a proper management plan to protect wildlife habitats and forecasting possible future changes, if needed.

TI  - Personality and Character: A Comparative Qualitative Analysis of Trait Descriptions in NEO-PI-3 and <i>Character Strengths and Virtues</i>
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAPPINESS STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The theoretical relationship between personality and character, as two approaches to conceptualizing individual differences, remains poorly defined. Attempts to clarify the relationship by analyzing leading personality and character frameworks-NEO-PI-3 and Peterson and Seligman's Character Strengths and Virtues (CSV)-have yielded divergent, unclear results. In this paper, we use a qualitative thematic analysis method to systematically compare NEO-PI-3 and CSV trait descriptions. Our analysis found 35 overlapping facet-strength trait pairs, including 22 morally-toned facet-strength relationships. For the CSV, the overlap was spread out among the strengths, while the overlap for NEO-PI-3 was mostly located in the factors of Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness. We also found traits that were uniquely evaluated or emphasized by each framework. NEO-PI-3 tended to emphasize traits related to emotions, tasks, and socializing; the CSV tended to emphasize self-management, prosocial, and worldview traits. Our analysis indicates that the two frameworks share substantial description of traits-including moral traits-but are not redundant. Our conceptual results were largely supported by empirical studies. Future research should continue to synthesize conceptual and empirical scholarship to advance understanding of the relationship between these two frameworks for evaluating individual differences.

TI  - Development of High Resolution Cloud Cover Climatology Databank Using Merged Manual and Satellite Datasets over Ghana, West Africa
T2  - ATMOSPHERE-OCEAN
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and reliable total cloud cover (TCC) observation is essential for astronomy, renewable energy resource assessment, climate impact studies, and agriculture. In order to improve the spatial coverage for a climatological distribution pattern of TCC observation across different climatic zones in Ghana - West Africa, this paper developed a merged database comprising ground-based manual TCC observation dataset (TCCM) at 22 tropical synoptic stations and satellite-based TCC dataset retrieved from the NASA Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resource (POWER) climatological archives (TCCN) spanning 30 years (1983-2013) for each dataset. Firstly, the satellite data was assessed statistically for merging with station data. From the results, it is shown that on the overall, the satellite data (TCCN) is a good representation of local TCC climatology comparative to station observation by a mean percentage deviation of 7.8 +/- 1.7, and indices of agreement between 0.7 and 0.99 +/- 0.01, indicating strong zonal and seasonal similarities. Moreover, the best station-by-station similarities are over the northern half, being predominantly Savannah climate areas, while the southernmost half show the weakest similarities. This can be attributed to a complex interplay of coastal ocean-land-atmosphere interactions obstructing satellite sensing. Finally, the gridded merged dataset established that December-February is the lowest TCC season countrywide, whereas June-August is the highest TCC season, more pronounced over the southern half, being predominantly Forest climate type and showing significant non-linearity with atmospheric clarity indices. The results have useful applications for solar energy resource assessment, crop yield models, and provides a framework for development of cloud property and cloud radiative effect assessment for climate related studies.

TI  - The Struggle Over Education in the Yishuv: Rav Kook and the Herzliya Gymnasium
T2  - MODERN JUDAISM
M3  - Article
AB  - The following discussion seeks to clarify the attitude of Rav Kook, the chief rabbi of Jaffa and one of the most important moral figures in the Jewish community, regarding the founding and early development of the Herzliya Gymnasium in 1905, the world's first secondary school to employ Hebrew as its language of instruction. The Gymnasium was criticized for two reasons: the way of life it promoted, which ran counter to the spirit of the Halacha (Jewish law), and its method of teaching Bible studies. Despite his opposition to the worldview of the founders and teachers of the Gymnasium, Kook refrained from speaking out against them publicly, preferring a less confrontational approach. He also wholeheartedly believed that they contained a degree of inner goodness that would cause them to return to what he regarded as the righteous path. Moreover, he was convinced that so long as he was unable to offer the public an alternative religious institution, one that would provide the same level of general studies as the Gymnasium, embarking on a public campaign against it was ill-advised. In his view, the situation also had a positive side: the existence of the Gymnasium provided an incentive for Jewish religious educational institutions to raise their own academic levels in order to compete. Had the Gymnasium not had something positive to offer, it would not have posed a threat at all.

TI  - Analysis of Degree of Polarization for Marine Vessels Detection in SAR Images
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an active sensor. All weather, day and night observation capability of SAR made it special as compared to the passive sensors. This study proposed a methodology for marine vessel detection based on degree of polarization (DOP). It is a function of surface roughness and incident angle. The large dynamic range, DOP signature and substructure of ship help to distinguish it from ocean. DOP is used to optimize transmitted polarization mode that is generated by the multiplication of transmitted Stokes vector and Kennaugh matrix. The proposed methodology and an analysis of the same on different data sets is presented in this paper. This analysis leads us to understand the mode of polarization and range of orientation and ellipticity in polarization ellipse for better distinguishing vessels and non-vessel-targets. The methodology presented here identifies why DOP will not be able to detect some of the vessel's targets and it counts and marks the centroid of detected vessels. Images acquired by two different spaceborne sensors, Radarsat-2 (C-band) and ALOS-1 (L-band) in descending and ascending passes, respectively, are used in this study. Detection accuracy of full polarization for the images used in this study is 85%, 91% in RS2, ALOS1 with false alarm of 0 and 3, respectively, which is much better than other polarization modes. The results show significant improvement in vessel-detection performance of the methodology compared to other state-of-the-art techniques for the same application.

TI  - Nuclear-medicine probes: Where we are and where we are going
T2  - MEDICAL PHYSICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Nuclear medicine probes turned into the key for the identification and precise location of sentinel lymph nodes and other occult lesions (i.e., tumors) by using the systemic administration of radiotracers. Intraoperative nuclear probes are key in the surgical management of some malignancies as well as in the determination of positive surgical margins, thus reducing the extent and potential surgery morbidity. Depending on their application, nuclear probes are classified into two main categories, namely, counting and imaging. Although counting probes present a simple design, are handheld (to be moved rapidly), and provide only acoustic signals when detecting radiation, imaging probes, also known as cameras, are more hardware-complex and also able to provide images but at the cost of an increased intervention time as displacing the camera has to be done slowly. This review article begins with an introductory section to highlight the relevance of nuclear-based probes and their components as well as the main differences between ionization- (semiconductor) and scintillation-based probes. Then, the most significant performance parameters of the probe are reviewed (i.e., sensitivity, contrast, count rate capabilities, shielding, energy, and spatial resolution), as well as the different types of probes based on the target radiation nature, namely: gamma (gamma), beta (beta) (positron and electron), and Cherenkov. Various available intraoperative nuclear probes are finally compared in terms of performance to discuss the state-of-the-art of nuclear medicine probes. The manuscript concludes by discussing the ideal probe design and the aspects to be considered when selecting nuclear-medicine probes.

TI  - Islamic Worldview As A Model For De-Westernising Journalism Studies And Profession
T2  - JAVNOST-THE PUBLIC
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the various attempts to de-Westernise journalism studies and profession, the dominance of Western theories and practices remains absolute. This article seeks to develop a hybrid Islamic/Western worldview that represents a comprehensive, flexible and multicultural paradigm that emphasises sharing rather than imposing one's heritage and view. The article particularly reflects on resolving the existing ontological, epistemological and methodological issues as a crucial task in overcoming obstacles and stagnation related to the hybridisation of theory-building efforts. This article demonstrates how the proposed normative paradigm can be grounded in the realistic context of journalistic practice by examining two research issues: media and democratisation and the globalisation of journalism ethics.

TI  - Bilateral invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast; a case report with literature review
T2  - ANNALS OF MEDICINE AND SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Carcinoma of breast is a heterogeneous disease. Using their light microscopic appearance, the invasive forms are usually divided into three main types: infiltrating lobular carcinomas, infiltrating ductal carcinomas, and other infiltrating carcinomas. This paper aims to discuss and report a case of bilateral invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast.Case report: A 48-year-old female presented with bilateral breast masses of 5-month duration. On examination. she had bilateral palpable breast masses, which were hard, mobile, and irregular. On the right side, there was skin tethering and palpable axillary lymph nodes. Ultrasound examination showed a heterogeneous, irregular, illdefined, mass-like lesion, seen in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast along with a hypoechoic. irregular mass 12*13mm in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. FNA showed bilateral invasive ductal carcinoma. Right axillary lymph nodes were positive for adenocarcinoma. She received 4 sessions of NACT which was followed by right-side mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection and left-side mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy.Discussion: Bilateral breast carcinomas are very rare. They form 2-5% of all breast malignancies. About 2-11% of breast cancer patients develop cancer in the opposite breast in their lifetime with an incidence rate varying from 4 to 8 per 1000 people per year.Conclusion: Bilateral carcinoma of the breast is very rare. Microscopically, the findings usually reveal infiltrative ductal carcinoma. The treatment of choice is bilateral modified radical mastectomy.

AB  - Pasifika communities in Aotearoa New Zealand (NZ) are a vibrant, diverse and heterogenous population. Following their migration to Aotearoa NZ they experienced the challenges of western world concepts, ideologies and frameworks being imposed on their worldview(s), a process that has led to social and economic disparities alongside health inequities which include mental distress and ill-health. This article explores whether there is a place for person-centered experiential psychotherapy and counseling within a worldview of Pasifika people in Aotearoa NZ. This will also have relevance to Polynesian, indigenous and ethnic minority communities at a global level. Drawing on Pasifika methodologies, and specifically a Tongan one, this article explores a Pasifika person-centered approach that is informed by Pasifika values and practice. It concludes with recommendations for the field of person-centered experiential psychotherapy and counseling when working with Pasifika communities.

T2  - PHILOSOPHY OF MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This article casts in high relief the paradigmatic rigidity in strategy research by highlighting the underlying philosophical assumptions (ontological, epistemological, methodological), their advantages, and their limitations. The article discusses four philosophical paradigms that underpin strategy research. While positivism and constructivism are the dominant paradigms, critical realism and pragmatism as relevant philosophical perspectives are also discussed. Using entrepreneurial opportunity as an exemplar, the article explains how philosophical assumptions inform the researchers' worldview and guide research within a paradigm. The article contends that paradigmatic dogmatism is undesirable in any discipline, more so in a relatively young discipline such as strategic management. Rather than adhering to and nestling inside a single metatheoretical paradigm, the article calls for a more reflexive philosophical approach in strategy research to gain fresh perspectives.

TI  - Estimation of high-resolution precipitation using downscaled satellite soil moisture and SM2RAIN approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) and precipitation play an essential part in land surface and atmospheric processes. Availability of high-resolution SM and precipitation data are quintessential for regional and global studies in hydro climatology. There exists a strong interconnection between the varying amounts of SM and the precipitation over a given area, giving rise to the bottom-up approach of estimating precipitation from SM2RAIN. This study examines precipitation derived from SM, downscaled using a unique cognation of land surface temperature (LST), vegetation index (VI), and SM. For this work, MODIS optical data having one km spatial resolution has been used to downscale the SMOS (25 km) and ESA CCI (25 km) SM data to generate four fine-resolution SM products SMOS-LST-NDVI, SMOS-LST-EVI, ESA CCI-LST-NDVI, and ESA CCI-LST-EVI, respectively. In this study, the Ganga basin in India is used as a case study area to assess the bottom-up SM2RAIN approach. The correlation analysis of SM products with LST, NDVI, and EVI, shows that LST has a robust negative correlation, whereas NDVI and EVI have a significant positive correlation. Results obtained from the SM2RAIN simulation from downscaled SM managed to capture the spatial variation of the high precipitation event. Validation with IMERG GPM precipitation data shows that the SMOS-LST-NDVI precipitation product best captures the spatial variation of observed precipitation. The present study results provide convincing evidence that high-resolution precipitation can be estimated using satellite-derived SM data at basin level, as long as better calibration and validation data are available.

TI  - Determining the optimal areas of effort in terms of force and force-velocity based on the functional state of the neuromuscular system in the training of elite female judokas
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. The evaluation of the functional state of the neuromuscular system (NMS) in elite female judokas according to the muscular activity indices is influenced by the force (F) and force-velocity (F-V) efforts. The implementation of the individual correction plan in the elite female judokas' process of instruction and training must be based on the accurate determination of the force and force-velocity effort areas throughout the training and competitive periods.Methods. The research involved 44 elite female judokas, divided in to two experimental groups (A, C) and two control groups (B, D). To diagnose the NMS, 21 elite female judokas were evaluated, belonging to different classification categories, divided into three groups: group I-category I (Cat. I), group II-candidates for Masters of Sports (CMS) and group III-Masters of Sports (MS).The evaluation of NMS was performed at the end of each two-week cycle, using 3 tests: T-max-time to reach the maximum muscle contraction, (msec); F-y-examination of elasticity indices in different muscles, (Hz); J-explosive muscular strength, (kg/s). Measurements were made for six muscle groups and 9 indices of fitness tests: 5 force tests (F) and 4 force-velocity tests (F-V). The research was carried out during 24 cycles, each one lasting two weeks: 12 training cycles and 12 competitive ones. Each cycle lasted two weeks. During the research, the model plan of training for F and F-V was used, determining the optimal areas of F and F-V training efforts in the preparation and competitive periods. In the experimental groups (A and C), according to the data of judokas' NMS functional state evaluation, the individual correction of the F and F-V efforts was performed every two weeks. As for the control groups (B, D), traditional methods of training were used.Results. The NMS evaluation of the female judokas was made every two weeks and the level of correlation of T-max, F-y and J indices was determined. The value of the F-y index at F effort is 32% in group I, 30% - in group II, 27% - in group III, 28-30% at the effort of F-V. The total number of corrections in group A: 79 negative corrections and 59 positive corrections, while in group C: 65 negative corrections and 89 positive ones. Within the F-V effort, the number of effort corrections in group A was: 68 negative corrections and 92 positive; in group C - 81 positive and 78 negative corrections. The female judokas' results in the final stage of EG-A were significantly improved in F indices by 52.15%, F-V by 6.22% and 6.18%. In the EG-C, the F increased considerably by 7.52%, F-V by 5.67% and 7.20%. These results characterize the level of physical training.Conclusion. The functional state of the NMS in elite judokas, determined according to the temporal indices of reaching the maximal muscular contraction, the muscle explosive strength and the muscles elasticity, is subjected to dynamics under the influence of force effort and force-velocity effort.

TI  - Utilization of sentinel lymph node biopsy in the early ovarian cancer surgery
T2  - ARCHIVES OF GYNECOLOGY AND OBSTETRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy has been incorporated into surgical care for many malignancies; however, the utility has not been examined in ovarian cancer. This study examined population-level trends, characteristics, and outcomes related to SLN biopsy in early stage ovarian cancer. Methods This is a retrospective cohort study querying the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Result Program from 2003-2018. The study population consisted of 11,512 women with stage I ovarian cancer who had adnexectomy-based surgical staging including lymph node evaluation. Exposure allocation was based on SLN biopsy use. Main outcomes measured were (i) trends and characteristics associated with SLN biopsy use, assessed by multivariable logistic regression model, and (ii) overall survival assessed with inverse provability of treatment weighting propensity score. Results SLN biopsy was performed in less than 1% of study population. In a multivariable analysis, recent surgery (2011-2018 versus 2003-2010, odds ratio [OR] 1.64, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-2.59), smaller tumor size (< 10 versus >= 10 cm, OR 3.07, 95% CI 1.20-7.84), and East registry area (OR 2.74, 95% CI 1.73-4.36) remained independent characteristics for SLN biopsy use. In a propensity score weighted model, 5-year overall survival rate was 90.5% for the SLN biopsy-incorporated group and 88.6% for the lymphadenectomy group (hazard ratio 0.96, 95% CI 0.53-1.73). Conclusion SLN biopsy was rarely performed for early ovarian cancer surgery during the study period with insufficient evidence to interpret the survival effect. SLN biopsy in early ovarian cancer appears to be in early development phase, warranting further study and careful evaluation to assess feasibility and oncologic outcome.

AB  - Study Region: Middle Niger River Basin (MNRB), Ansongo to Niamey, Sahel, West Africa. Study Focus: Although MNRB hydrology and the red flood phenomena have been addressed in the past literature, water quality parameters and suspended particulate matter (SPM) dynamics remain poorly known. SPM impacts dam silting, exacerbating flooding, and microbial water quality. This study couples in-situ SPM measurements to radiometric measurements by in-situ and satellite sensors to analyse the temporal and spatial evolution of SPM in the MNRB and assess the contribution of the local flood (red flood) to SPM in Niamey. New Hydrological Insights for the Region: SPM is composed of very fine kaolinites with a major mode around 200-300 nanometers which results in high reflectance in the visible and infrared bands. Radiometric measurements by both radiometer and Sentinel-2 MSI sensors are well correlated to in-situ SPM, allowing efficient spatio-temporal monitoring of SPM concentration. SPM increases very rapidly at the beginning of the rainy season, reaching a peak, characterized by very high SPM values, about one month before the red flood. Satellite data highlight the significant contribution of the right bank tributaries to SPM in the MNRB during this period. SPM then decreases and remains low despite the second runoff increase (black flood) arriving in Niamey after the end of the rainy season from the upper basin.

TI  - The future of plant volatile organic compounds (pVOCs) research: Advances and applications for sustainable agriculture
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Volatile organic compounds emitted by plants (pVOCs) protect themselves from abiotic and biotic stresses. Plants are under constant threats from biotic stress especially herbivores which facilitate plants to emit herbivoreinduced plant volatiles (HIPVs), an inducible defense in plants against herbivores by communicating to herbivores' natural enemies and neighboring plants. HIPVs are reported to act as feeding and/or oviposition deterrents to herbivores, belonging to four major groups including terpene/terpenoids, benzenoids and phenylpropanoids, the volatile fatty acid derivatives, and the volatile aminoacid derivatives. However, the plant volatile profiles induced by herbivores have been reported to be altered by silicon (Si)-fertilization, priming of plants with chemical elicitors and climate change which can induce plants to produce and emit novel plant volatiles that are not expressed by plants in response to damage by herbivory. Transgenic crops and/or sentinel crops with enhanced pVOCs emission profiles have been proposed to improve plant resistance, health and yields. Currently several technological advances in devices including field-portable electronic devices (e-Nose) and hand-held smartphone-based biosensors for in situ early detection of pVOCs profiles which are now available and supported by artificial intelligence (AI), to increase detection accuracy of these systems. The present review highlights the multi-dimension approaches emerging in pVOCs research for early and rapid detection of specific VOCs indicators as markers with associated plant biotic stressors.

T2  - SUSTAINABLE FUTURES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was an endeavor to compare crowdsourced-based and geostatistical modeled projected temperature within the City of Atlanta during a September 2019 snapshot tied to a heat event. This study also ventured to decipher how spatially-variable discrepancies of prediction may be correlated to economic status via zip code and land cover/land use (LC/LU). Results suggests that satellite-correlated crowdsourced and geostatistical simulated temperature in the City of Atlanta during this snapshot to decipher differences in the spatial variations of forecasts may be correlated to economic status and LC/LU and can be implemented to potentially help with urban heat management strategies.

TI  - Satellites quantify the spatial extent of cyanobacterial blooms across the United States at multiple scales
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous studies indicate that cyanobacterial harmful algal bloom (cyanoHAB) frequency, extent, and magnitude have increased globally over the past few decades. However, little quantitative capability is available to assess these metrics of cyanoHABs across broad geographic scales and at regular intervals. Here, the spatial extent was quantified from a cyanobacteria algorithm applied to two European Space Agency satellite platforms-the MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) onboard Envisat and the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) onboard Sentinel-3. CyanoHAB spatial extent was defined for each geographic area as the percentage of valid satellite pixels that exhibited cyanobacteria above the detection limit of the satellite sensor. This study quantified cyanoHAB spatial extent for over 2,000 large lakes and reservoirs across the contiguous United States (CONUS) during two time periods: 2008-2011 via MERIS and 2017-2020 via OLCI when cloud-, ice-, and snow-free imagery was available. Approximately 56% of resolvable lakes were glaciated, 13% were headwater, isolated, or terminal lakes, and the rest were primarily drainage lakes. Results were summarized at national-, regional-, state-, and lake-scales, where regions were defined as nine climate regions which represent climatically consistent states. As measured by satellite, changes in national cyanoHAB extent did have a strong increase of 6.9% from 2017 to 2020 (vertical bar Kendall's tau (tau)vertical bar = 0.56; gamma (gamma) = 2.87 years), but had negligible change (vertical bar tau vertical bar = 0.03) from 2008 to 2011. Two of the nine regions had moderate (0.3 <= vertical bar tau vertical bar < 0.5) increases in spatial extent from 2017 to 2020, and eight of nine regions had negligible (vertical bar tau vertical bar < 0.2) change from 2008 to 2011. Twelve states had a strong or moderate increase from 2017 to 2020 (vertical bar tau vertical bar >= 0.3), while only one state had a moderate increase and two states had a moderate decrease from 2008 to 2011. A decrease, or no change, in cyanoHAB spatial extent did not indicate a lack of issues related to cyanoHABs. Sensitivity results of randomly omitted daily CONUS scenes confirm that even with reduced data availability during a short four-year temporal assessment, the direction and strength of the changes in spatial extent remained consistent. We present the first set of national maps of lake cyanoHAB spatial extent across CONUS and demonstrate an approach for quantifying past and future changes at multiple spatial scales. Results presented here provide water quality managers information regarding current cyanoHAB spatial extent and quantify rates of change.

TI  - Remote sensing of water use efficiency in Southwest China's karst area
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - As the largest contiguous karst area in China, the southwestern karst area is a typical ecologically fragile area affecting local vegetation dynamics. Ecosystem water use efficiency (WUE) is an important factor reflecting the ability of vegetation to produce organic matter with a limited water supply. Therefore, determining the WUE variation trends in this ecologically fragile region is important. In this paper, we used MODIS remote sensing datasets, meteorological data, and land cover data to analyze the spatiotemporal changes in vegetation water use efficiency in the southwestern karst region from 2001 to 2017. We also further quantitatively analyzed the effects of climate change and human activities on the spatial and temporal patterns of vegetation WUE in the study area. The main conclusions were as follows. (1) From 2001 to 2017, in terms of temporal characteristics, the interannual variation in WUE fluctuated greatly, ranging from 1.33 to 1.51 g C kg(-1) H2O, with a multiyear average of 1.43 g C kg(-1) H2O and an average rate of change of - 0.0046 g C kg(-1) H2O year(-1). In terms of spatial characteristics, areas with a higher WUE were concentrated in central Sichuan and northeastern Yunnan. (2) The annual average WUE of each vegetation type decreased in the following order: evergreen coniferous forest > evergreen broad-leaved forest > mixed forest > deciduous broad-leaved forest > cultivated land > deciduous coniferous forest > grassland > cultivated land and natural vegetation > shrub forest. (3) The vegetation WUE of 70.66% in this area was positively correlated with temperature. Additionally, 79.68% of the vegetation WUE was negatively correlated with precipitation. The relative contribution rates of climate change and human activities to the change trend in WUE were 15% and 85%, respectively. Compared with WUE results in other studies, the WUE of different karst landform areas obtained in this study was quite different, indicating that the geological and landform features of the karst area are complex. Our study provides scientific support for local vegetation restoration and protection policies and promotes the understanding of the principle of the carbon-water cycle in karst areas.

TI  - Predicting wetland area and water depth in Barind plain of India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study attempts to delineate wetlands in the lower Tangon river basin in the Barind flood plain region using spectral water body extraction indices. The main objectives of this present study are simulating and predicting wetland areas using the advanced artificial neural network-based cellular automata (ANN-CA) model and water depth using statistical (adaptive exponential smoothing) as well as advanced machine learning algorithms such as Bagging, Random Subspace, Random Forest, Support vector machine, etc. The result shows that RmNDWI and NDWI are the representative wetland delineating indices. NDWI map was used for water depth prediction. Regarding the prediction of wetland areas, a remarkable decline is likely to be identified in the upcoming two decades. The small wetland patches away from the master stream are expected to dry out during the predicted period, where the major wetland patches nearer to the master stream with greater water depth are rather sustainable, but their depth of water is predicted to be reduced in the next decades. All models show satisfactory performance for wetland depth mapping, but the random subspace model was identified as the best-suited water depth predicting method with an acceptable prediction accuracy (root mean square error <0.34 in all the years) and the machine learning models explored better result than adaptive exponential smoothing. This recent study will be very helpful for the policymakers for managing wetland landscape as well as the natural environment.

TI  - Biological site suitability for exposed self-regulating cultivation of blue mussel (<i>Mytilus edulis</i>): A Belgian case study
T2  - AQUACULTURAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Several reasons, from stakeholder conflicts to water quality issues, are pushing bivalve cultivation to less accessible, exposed, and offshore waters. Because sheltered areas are absent along the Belgian coastline, the possibility to culture mussels with self-regulated systems in exposed conditions has been explored by various research projects. Farmers consider offshore environments unsuitable on the assumption that spat densities are low, and growth is insufficient for commercialization. This study evaluates the potential for self-regulated mussel cultivation in an exposed North Sea environment based on data collected from several research projects that evaluated the biological and technical feasibility of commercial longline cultivation in Belgium. The cultivation methods were variable, but always relied on wild spat that was grown to market size. No husbandry practices such as seed harvesting, thinning, grading, or socking were performed. This cultivation technique, also called self-regulating cultivation, reduces operational costs when extreme weather and exposed conditions limit handling. A 3D hydro-dynamic larvae dispersal model (LDM) was used to simulate the spatial variability in arrivals and the timing of the arrival peak. In addition, a locally validated metabolic model (DEB) for the blue mussel (M. edulis) was forced with 10 year optimized remote sensing observations (Copernicus, Sentinel-3/OLCI) to predict industry-relevant information such as site suitability, inter-annual growth variability, and cultivation time. This study concludes that exposed mussel cultivation near the Belgian east coast is characterised by fast growth. Mussels grown in this area will reach a marketable size (6 cm) after 12-15 months of cultivation, which is just in time for the peak consumption season (July-August). Moving offshore prolongs the cultivation cycles to 17-25 months, but provides more stable growth conditions with less inter-annual variability. When considering a cultivation period of 12 months, the mussels originating from offshore cultivation are comparable in size to the smaller Dutch "Smitse " and French "Bouchots ".

TI  - Improving remote sensing of salinity on topsoil with crop residues using novel indices of optical and microwave bands
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing indices have been proposed to characterize soil salinity. However, the sensitivity of these indicators is unstable owing to differences in geographic environment and vegetation type. This study investigated the performance of several existing indices to estimate the salinity of topsoil with residues in southern Xinjiang, China. The results showed that these indices were not satisfactory. In order to construct an index that can be used to directly indicate soil salinity in a specific area, novel salinity indices were calculated using optical bands (blue, green, red, vegetation red edge, and shortwave infrared bands) derived from Sentinel-2 multispectral data and Sentinel-1 radar data (backscattering coefficient VV, VH). To enhance the sensitivity of the optical bands, five transformation methods (logarithmic, reciprocal, first-, second-, and third-derivative) were applied to the original spectra. Based on previous studies, statistical methods were used to construct two-, three-, and four-bands indices. One constructed three-bands index with the second-derivative transformation, called the Enhanced Residues Soil Salinity Index (ERSSI), showed the highest correlation with topsoil salinity (r = 0.65 and 0.68 in training and testing). ERSSI establishes a linear relationship in soil salinity estimation with an R-2 of 0.53 and a LCCC of 0.65 in training dataset, with an R-2 of 0.51 and a LCCC of 0.73 in testing dataset. And it shows contribution in random forest regression with an R-2 of 0.80 and a LCCC of 0.86 in training dataset, with an R-2 of 0.77 and a LCCC of 0.81 in testing dataset. The ERSSI consisted of the B, G, and SWIR1 bands, and was sensitive to salinity variations in the residues remaining in farmland soils. This study provides a novel index and method for the accurate and robust assessment and mapping of salinity in farmland covered by crop residues.

TI  - Enhancing disaster risk resilience using greenspace in urbanising Quito, Ecuador
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Greenspaces within broader ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction (Eco-DRR) strategies provide multiple benefits to society, biodiversity, and addressing climate breakdown. In this study, we investigated urban growth, its intersection with hazards, and the availability of greenspace for disaster risk reduction (DRR) in the city of Quito, Ecuador, which experiences multiple hazards including landslides, floods, volcanoes, and earthquakes. We used satellite data to quantify urban sprawl and developed a workflow incorporating high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) to identify potential greenspaces for emergency refuge accommodation (DRR greenspace), for example, following an earthquake. Quito's historical urban growth to-talled similar to 192 km(2) for 1986-2020 and was primarily on flatter land, in some cases crossed by steep ravines. By contrast, future projections indicate an increasing intersection between easterly urbanisation and steep areas of high landslide susceptibility. Therefore, a timely opportunity exists for future risk-informed planning. Our workflow identified 18.6 km(2) of DRR greenspaces, of which 16.3 km(2) intersected with potential sources of landslide and flood hazards, indicating that hazard events could impact potential "safe spaces". These spaces could mitigate future risk if designated as greenspaces and left undeveloped. DRR greenspace overlapped 7 % (2.5 km(2)) with municipality-designated greenspace. Similarly, 10 % (1.7 km(2)) of municipality-designated "safe space" for use following an earthquake was classified as potentially DRR suitable in our analysis. For emergency refuge, currently designated greenspaces could accommodate similar to 2 %-14 % (depending on space requirements) of Quito's population within 800 m. This increases to 8 %-40 % considering all the potential DRR greenspace mapped in this study. Therefore, a gap exists between the provision of DRR and designated greenspace. Within Quito, we found a disparity between access to greenspaces across socio-economic groups, with lower income groups having less access and further to travel to designated greenspaces. Notably, the accessibility of greenspaces was high overall with 98 % (2.3 million) of Quito's population within 800 m of a designated greenspace, of which 88 % (2.1 million) had access to potential DRR greenspaces. Our workflow demonstrates a citywide evaluation of DRR greenspace potential and provides the foundation upon which to evaluate these spaces with local stakeholders. Promoting equitable access to greenspaces, communicating their multiple benefits, and considering their use to restrict propagating development into hazardous areas are key themes that emerge for further investigation.

T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: To monitor changes in seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in populations over time and between different demographic groups. Methods: A subset of practices in the Oxford-Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) sentinel network provided serum samples, collected when volunteer patients had routine blood tests. We tested these samples for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using Abbott (Chicago, USA), Roche (Basel, Switzerland) and/or Euroimmun (Luebeck, Germany) assays, and linked the results to the patients' primary care computerised medical records. We report seropositivity by region and age group, and additionally examined the effects of gender, ethnicity, deprivation, rurality, shielding recommendation and smoking status. Results: We estimated seropositivity from patients aged 18-100 years old, which ranged from 4.1% (95% CI 3.1-5.3%) to 8.9% (95% CI 7.8-10.2%) across the different assays and time periods. We found higher Euroimmun seropositivity in younger age groups, people of Black and Asian ethnicity (compared to white), major conurbations, and non-smokers. We did not observe any significant effect by region, gender, deprivation, or shielding recommendation. Conclusions: Our results suggest that prior to the vaccination programme, most of the population remained unexposed to SARS-CoV-2.

TI  - Tracing surface water change from 1990 to 2020 in China's Shandong Province using Landsat series images
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and long-term series surface water extraction is of great significance for development of agro-ecosystem and sustainable management of water resources. Data and knowledge of the spatial-temporal dynamics of surface water are still very limited in Shandong Province, China. This study provides a rapid and robust method for open-surface water detecting based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The 30-m annual maps of surface water frequency are generated to analyze the distribution and variation of surface water in Shandong Province during 1990-2020. In addition, the effects of climatic and anthropogenic drivers are investigated on the temporal and spatial dynamics of surface water. A previously published global surface water dataset is used to valid our results. The results show that the correlation coefficient (R) of permanent surface water area (SWA) is 0.95 from 1990 to 2020. And in this study, the surface water area is well extracted in 1994 which is underestimated by Joint Research Centre (JRC). Surface water is widely distributed in Shandong Province; however, the interannual variation of SWA is substantial. The permanent SWA presents an increasing trend in Shandong Province, especially from 1990 to 2004. Multitemporal monitoring results show that the permanent SWA of Dongping Lake, Xiashan Reservoir, and Chanzhi Reservoir fluctuate most in 1990-1994 and 2013-2018. Precipitation and water supply significantly affect the permanent SWA, with R of 0.38 and -0.70. The results will provide a critical guidance for implementing sustainable water resources management so as to avoid flood-hazards and drought disasters.

TI  - Pan-European urban green space dynamics: A view from space between 1990 and 2015
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Creating and managing urban green infrastructure is an essential part of the sustainable urban development initiative promoted by the EU governments. To achieve a synergistic development of urban green spaces in various countries, acquiring spatially explicit information on urban green areas on a continental scale in Europe thus becomes necessary. Yet, the currently available European urban land use/cover products may fail to provide this comprehensive view as, due to their coarse spatial resolutions, they only pick up the large patches of green but fail to account for sparsely distributed urban green types. To address this issue, we applied a support vector regression model trained on samples collected from 50 European cities to urban green space mapping on a subpixel scale based on Landsat imagery. The model was validated in 10 other European cities, yielding a robust model performance (RMSE for the modeled green area fractions ranging from 0.09 to 0.16). Thus, we successfully mapped the spatial distribution of European urban green areas in 1990, 2000, and 2015. Given these results, we obtained three major conclusions: (i) previous studies might have underestimated the green space growth in Eastern European countries; (ii) most European countries have been building new settlements with more green spaces as the primary way to increase their urban greenness; (iii) the gap in urban green space per capita is widening among European countries, and Southern European countries are experiencing a decrease in access to urban green spaces.

TI  - Estimating estuarine primary production using satellite data and machine learning
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Net primary production (NPP) plays an important role in estuarine carbon cycling, which has been increasingly impacted by human activities and global climate change. Spatiotemporal trends of NPP in the open ocean have been well studied using satellite data and standard primary production algorithms such as the Vertically Generalized Production Model (VGPM), but these algorithms are generally not suitable for estuarine and coastal waters. Previous remote sensing studies on estuarine NPP mainly focused on the tuning of the standard VGPM based on extensive local in situ data. Here we make a first attempt to use machine learning algorithms to estimate NPP in an estuarine environment from satellite measurements. Tampa Bay, the largest estuary in Florida (United States), has abundant in situ measurements of NPP, although the spatiotemporal variability of NPP within the bay remains unrevealed. Combining these data with concurrent MODIS/Aqua image data, we developed and evaluated seven machine learning algorithms (support vector regression, random forest, decision tree, bagging, adaptive boosting, gradient tree boosting, and neural network), and applied the one with the least root mean square error (RMSE) and highest correlation coefficient to establish a time-series NPP record for Tampa Bay from 2002 to 2020. Results of the best performing algorithm (Pearson's r = 0.82, RMSE = 151.0 mgC m- 2 d-1) showed substantial improvement over the standard or tuned VGPM (Pearson's r = 0.51, RMSE = 364.9 mgC m- 2 d-1), using the same independent variables for NPP ranging from 157.5 to 1368.8 mgC m- 2 d-1. MODIS NPP shows temporal variations that are largely driven by temperature: lowest values in winter, highest values in summer, and an increasing trend from 2003 to 2020, highlighting the impact of global warming on estuarine NPP. The spatial distribution of MODIS NPP shows higher values in Hillsborough Bay, Middle Tampa Bay and Lower Tampa Bay, and relatively lower values in Old Tampa Bay, a pattern that likely reflects differences in river discharge. The long-term NPP product derived from machine learning algorithms and satellite data can complement existing field-based monitoring programs and help to understand estuarine responses to climate changes and human impacts, and design relevant mitigation strategies.

TI  - Spatial and temporal distribution of satellite turbidity in response to different environmental variables in the Bahia Blanca Estuary, South-Western Atlantic
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This work combines in situ measurements with a time series of satellite turbidity derived from Landsat 8-OLI images to provide a first synoptic overview of the main hydrometeorological drivers of turbidity in the Bahia Blanca Estuary (Argentina). An empirical relationship between turbidity and SPM concentrations was established for the study area (R-2 = 0.92; RMSE = 0.098 mg m(-3); NMAE = 6.2%). Several atmospheric correction schemes and turbidity retrieval algorithms were tested and the combination of the SWIR-v and the retrieval algorithm by Dogliotti et al. (2015) were applied to 121 Landsat 8-OLI scenes (2013-2021). The effects of tides, winds, and rainfall on satellite turbidity were evaluated through Generalized Linear Models (GLM) built for three different sectors along Canal Principal, from the inner zone to its mouth. Regardless of the zone, cumulative rainfall had negligible effects on turbidity. Tides had a significant effect in the inner and middle zones. In the inner zone, higher turbidity values significantly associated with ebb tide conditions, which produce erosion. In the middle section tidal current speeds positively correlated with turbidity, suggesting sediment resuspension over shallow banks. Close to the mouth of the estuary, turbidity responded entirely to winds. Winds blowing from de NW, aligned with the azimuth of Canal Principal, would aid to the export of estuarine sediments to the shelf.

TI  - Linking remote sensing data to the estimation of pollination services in agroecosystems
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wild bees are key providers of pollination services in agroecosystems. The abundance of these pollinators and the ecosystem services they provide rely on supporting resources in the landscape. Spatially explicit models that quantify wild bee abundance and pollination services in food crops are built on the foundations of foraging and nesting resources. This dependence limits model implementation as land-cover maps and pollination experts capable of evaluating habitat resource quality are scarce. This study presents a novel approach to assessing crop pollination services using remote sensing data (RSD) as an alternative to the more conventional use of land-cover data and local expertise on spatially explicit models. We used landscape characteristics derived from remote sensors to qualify nesting resources in the landscape and to evaluate the delivery of pollination services by mining bees (Andrena spp.) in 30 fruit orchards located in the Flemish region of Belgium. For this study, we selected mining bees for their importance as local pollinators and underground nesting behavior. We compared the estimated pollination services derived from RSD with those derived from the conventional qualification of nesting resources. We did not observe significant differences (p = 0.68) in the variation in mining bee activity predicted by the two spatial models. Estimated pollination services derived from RSD and conventional characterizations explained 69% and 72% of the total variation, respectively. These results confirmed that RSD can deliver nesting suitability characterizations sufficient for estimating pollination services. This research also illustrates the importance of nesting resources and landscape characteristics when estimating pollination services delivered by insects like mining bees. Our results support the development of holistic agroenvironmental policies that rely on modern tools like remote sensors and promote pollinators by considering nesting resources.

TI  - Urban footprint detection from night light, optical and SAR imageries: A comparison study
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The rise of large cities and their increasing spatial effects cause strong imbalances between the city and its hinterland. In such cities, the need for effective and timely handling of urban planning and management processes has been strongly felt in recent years. This situation has led to an increasing demand for temporal data with high spatial accuracy. Today, with the existence of Spaceborne Earth observations that meet this demand, it has become possible to follow the spatial distribution of urban footprints and their development over time in constantly changing big cities. In this study, urban footprints were determined from optical Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images using Support Vector Machines (SVMs) image classification, from Luojia 1-01 (LJ101) night light data using the Human Settlement Index (HSI), and from Sentinel-1A Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data using the speckle divergence approach. According to the results, the general accuracy of urban footprints obtained by the HSI method from night images of the Lj1-01 satellite is 92%. The general accuracy of urban footprint obtained with SVM classification from optical images is 86%. The general accuracy of urban areas obtained with the Speckle Divergence approach for Vertical-Vertical (VV) and Horizontal-Vertical (VH) polarizations are 83% and 81%, respectively. The accuracies obtained with the analyzes revealed that the data and methods used in the study can be effectively used in determining the urban footprints.

TI  - Assessing the role of low volume disease in endometrial cancer
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY AND REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The role of retroperitoneal staging in endometrial cancer is still unclear. Although the prognostic value of lymphadenectomy has been demonstrated no data support the therapeutic value of nodal dissection. Sentinel node mapping represents an evolution of lymphadenectomy. Sentinel node mapping allows a more accurate identification of low-volume diseases (i.e., micrometastasis and isolated tumor cells) that are not always detectable via conventional histopathological evaluation. Adjuvant therapy might play a role in patients with low-volume disease. However, the presence of isolated tumor cells alone seems to not impact outcomes of endometrioid endometrial cancer patients. Hence, the choice to deliver adjuvant therapies has to be tailored based on uterine factors only. The introduction of molecular and genomic profiling would be useful in selecting appropriate surgical and adjuvant treatments. The molecular-integrated risk profile should be integrated in clinical practice to overcome the need of retroperitoneal staging (in case of non-bulky nodes) in patients at low risk.

TI  - Oral health of children in Aotearoa New Zealand-time for change
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF NEW ZEALAND
M3  - Review
AB  - Aotearoa New Zealand (NZ) has a long tradition of providing publicly funded oral health care for children and young people; however, substantial inequities in child oral health remain. Dental caries is the most prevalent non-communicable childhood disease in NZ, with Maori and Pasifika, those from low socio-economic backgrounds, and those without access to community water fluoridation most affected. Children and whanau with dental caries suffer consequences that seriously affect their day-to-day lives; it is critical not to underestimate the disease or fail to include it when considering children's overall health. Dental caries is a complex disease, as is its prevention. This is particularly so in the current social context of child poverty, our food environment, the exploitation of children in advertising of non-healthy foods and drinks, and the immense challenges of meeting demand for oral health care in primary, secondary and tertiary care within current constraints. We review children's oral health in NZ and make recommendations for change among oral health professionals, all health professionals, health services and society. Further research in oral health services will be an essential part of improving oral health, recognising that there is an urgent need for a shift towards much greater prevention of caries.Glossary of Maori terms: Aotearoa: New Zealand; He Korowai Oranga: New Zealand Maori Health Strategy; Hui: meeting; Manaakitanga: hospitality, kindness, generosity and support; Mana Motuhake: self-determination; Maori: the indigenous people of Aotearoa New Zealand; Matauranga Maori: Maori knowledge; Rangatahi: adolescents; Tamariki: children; Te Ao Maori: the Maori worldview; Te Kauae Paraoa: Division of Health Sciences Policy on Admissions; Te reo Maori: the indigenous Maori language; Te Tiriti o Waitangi: Maori language version of the Treaty of Waitangi; Tikanga: customs; Whanau: family; Whakamaua: Maori Health Action Plan 2020-2025; Whakawhanaungatanga: the process of establishing relationships and relating well to others

TI  - A new algorithm for landslide dynamic monitoring with high temporal resolution by Kalman filter integration of multiplatform time-series InSAR processing
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Free and open access to the earth observation synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite images has enabled the implementation of landslide time-series monitoring. However, with the restriction of the low revisit period of satellite, it is difficult to meet the requirements of landslide dynamic monitoring with high temporal resolution. Moreover, with the multiplication of SAR satellite platforms, a corresponding data integration algorithm is needed to obtain the complementary displacement information from every single observation orbit. In this work, an integrated algorithm for landslide multi-source displacement optimization estimation based on Kalman filter (KF) is proposed to improve the temporal resolution and realize the dynamic monitoring and prediction of landslide movement. Specifically, the landslide migration coordinate system is established firstly, and the interferometric SAR (InSAR) displacement results in line of sight (LOS) are projected to the downslope direction. Then, with the introduction of the acceleration variable into the process covariance matrix of prediction model and the observation noise variance weight determination, the downslope displacements of multiplatform InSAR observations are dynamically integrated into a unified time series by KF dynamic prediction and correction. So as to achieve the high temporal resolution monitoring of landslide. For validation purpose, the Baige landslide in Tibet, China is selected as the test area, and 55 Sentinel-1A ascending images, 42 Sentinel-1A descending images, and 10 ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 images collected over this area from May 2017 to April 2019 are used to estimate the high temporal time series. The temporal resolution of landslide monitoring is successfully improved from 12 days with a single orbit to the shortest 1 day and repeatedly 2-5 days with multiple platforms, and the prediction of subsequent displacement is also realized. Prospectively, with the continuous multiplication of the InSAR satellite platforms, this proposed algorithm can provide high temporal monitoring data for landslide and better assist relevant emergency response, which is necessary for the dynamic monitoring and early warning of landslide.

TI  - Distribution and disturbance dynamics of habitats suitable for <i>Suaeda salsa</i>
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Suaeda salsa, as the last biological barrier of coastal wetlands from land to sea, is one of the best nature-based restoration solution for shoreline stabilization and soil improvement in coastal wetlands. The quality of habitat determines the potential scope of wetland ecological restoration. To enlarge the Suaeda salsa area and to prevent the erosion and degradation of coastal wetland shorelines, we assessed the suitability of habitats for Suaeda salsa growth and identified the causes of encroachment into areas suitable for Suaeda salsa growth. Assessing the habitat suitability of the community and its disturbance status can not only effectively determine the suitable areas for Suaeda salsa ecological restoration, but also can propose targeted solutions according to the interference factors. Moreover, this way can greatly improve the survival rate and coverage area of Suaeda salsa restoration, reduce unnecessary input and loss, enhance the ability to resist coastal wetland shoreline erosion and degradation, and maintain the stability and integrity of the coastal wetland ecosystem. In this study, based on the data of 180 sampling points in the Liaohe estuary wetland, habitat suitability was identified, and the MaxEnt model (habitat suitability model) was used to analyze the suitable distribution area. The interannual changes in Suaeda salsa and reclamation activities in the Liaohe estuary wetland during the past 30 years were extracted from Landsat remote sensing images, and the temporal and spatial dynamic relationship between the distribution of Suaeda salsa and reclamation was analyzed. The dominant factors affecting the distribution of Suaeda salsa were water salinity as well as soil Cd and Zn levels, with influence weights of 49.1%, 28.9%, and 18.0%, respectively, and a total weight of 96%. Compared with the existing 596 hm2 of Suaeda salsa vegetation in the Liaohe estuary wetland, the area highly suitable for growth was 12,306 hm(2), whereas the area with medium suitability was 12,100 hm2. Reclamation and aquaculture areas accounted for 33.31% of the highly suitable area and were the main reasons for habitat fragmentation. The study explained the reasons for the difficulty of ecological restoration of Suaeda salsa due to unsuitable habitat quality, and revealed a strong conflict between coastal reclamation and environmental protection, suggesting that the protection of coastal wetlands should consider changes in industrial model strategy. The restoration, reconstruction, and sustainable management of Suaeda salsa communities can be achieved by reducing the proportion of reclamation areas. This study improves the ecological restoration theory of degraded wetlands and provides a theoretical basis for coastal wetland protection and nature-based restoration programs.

TI  - Harmonizing surface reflectance between Landsat-7 ETM + , Landsat-8 OLI, and Sentinel-2 MSI over China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing dynamic monitoring methods often benefit from a dense time series of observations. To enhance these time series, it is sometimes necessary to integrate data from multiple satellite systems. In particular, the Landsat and Sentinel series provide a rich source of data for Earth observations. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) scientists proposed a method that creates global fixed per-band transformation coefficients to reduce the reflectance difference between Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 for the harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) surface reflectance product. However, the coefficient has yet to be further validated in the target study area and the coefficient can only be used for Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2, and is not useful for other sensors. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential of integrating surface reflectance data from Landsat-7, Landsat-8, and Sentinel-2. Some differences in the surface reflectance of the sensor pairs were identified, based upon which a cross-sensor conversion model was proposed, i.e., a suitable adjustment equation was fitted using an ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regression method to convert the Sentinel-2 reflectance values closer to the Landsat-7 or Landsat-8 values. The results show that the model adjusted the Sentinel-2 surface reflectance to match Landsat-7 or Landsat-8. The maximum MRE of the adjusted sensor for surface reflectance was reduced from 17.96 to 12.15%. Differences in reflectance produce corresponding differences in estimates of biophysical quantities, such as NDVI, with MRE as high as 18.33%. However, adjusting the Sentinel-2 sensor was able to reduce this part of the discrepancy to about 12.56%. The study believes that despite the differences in these datasets, it appears feasible to integrate these datasets by applying a linear regression correction between the bands.

TI  - Estimation of Landsat-like daily evapotranspiration for crop water consumption monitoring using TSEB model and data fusion
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) plays an essential role in agricultural water resource management. Understanding regional agricultural water consumption characteristics can be improved by predicting ET using remote sensing. However, due to the lack of high-resolution images on clear-sky days or the limitation of ET reconstruction on cloudy-sky days, it remains challenging to continuously derive ET at the field scale. In this study, the Landsat and MODIS data were initially fused to obtain the Landsat-like vegetation index and land surface temperature on clear-sky days. Then the two-source energy balance (TSEB) model was applied to calculate the daily ET during the clear-sky. A canopy resistance-based gap-filling method was involved in reconstructing regional ET on cloudy days while considering different environmental factors. The estimations were validated by automatic weather system data (AWS) and eddy covariance (EC) measurements in Guantao County. The results demonstrated that the proposed scheme performed well in estimating cropland ET, with an RMSE of 0.86 mm center dot d(-1) and an R-2 of 0.65, and the NSE and PBias were 0.61 and -0.29%, respectively. The crop water consumption analysis revealed that the daily ET of winter wheat peaked during the maturation stage. Nevertheless, summer maize water consumption peaked in the middle of the growing season in this area. The temperature during the early development stage and the soil moisture in the mid and late growth stages had the greatest impact on the ET of winter wheat. During the entire growing period, soil moisture had the largest effect on the ET of summer maize. The findings showed that the TSEB model can be effectively applied to field-scale water consumption monitoring in North China through MODIS and Landsat data fusion and ET temporal reconstruction considering environmental factors.

TI  - Research on Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices of Influenza Vaccination Among Healthcare Workers in Chongqing, China-Based on Structural Equation Model
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundInfluenza is associated with a large number of disease burdens, and it is generally recommended that all healthcare workers (HCWs) get an influenza vaccination. However, the vaccination rates among HCWs are still low. This study aimed to assess HCWs' knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) about the influenza vaccine, and by establishing a structural equation model (SEM) to explore the influencing factors of medical personnel's influenza vaccination in Chongqing, China. MethodsFrom September to November 2019, we conducted a cross-sectional survey in four sentinel hospitals and four non-sentinel hospitals in Chongqing, China. We calculated knowledge, attitude, and behavior scores for each study participant and assessed the level of knowledge, attitude, and behavior of the medical staff. An SEM was used to evaluate the relationship between latent variables, and the path graph between knowledge, attitude, and behavior was established. ResultsA total of 1,412 valid questionnaires were collected in this survey, including four sentinel hospitals (N = 606, 42.92%) and four non-sentinel hospitals (N = 806, 57.08%). Women (N = 1,102, 78.05%) were more than men (N = 310, 21.95%), with an average age of 32.36 +/- 7.78 years old and under 30 years old (N = 737, 52.20%), respectively. Nurses (741, 52.48%) were the main subjects, followed by physicians (457, 32.37%). The final SEM model was obtained after the model was modified and adjusted. A bootstrap analysis of path coefficients was carried out on the final model. Knowledge has a direct influence on behavior. The normalized path coefficient is 0.071 (95% CI: 0.002-0.161), and the value of P of the hypothesis test result of the path coefficient is 0.042. The direct influence of knowledge on attitude standardization was 0.175 (95% CI: 0.095-0.281). The direct influence of attitude on practice standardization was 0.818 (95% CI: 0.770-0.862). The indirect effect of knowledge on the standardization of practice through attitude was 0.144 (95% CI: 0.076-0.235). ConclusionsAccording to the SEM, there is a direct positive correlation between KAP and the influenza vaccine. The indirect influence of knowledge on the standard of behavior through attitude is about two times as much as the direct influence on behavior, indicating that attitude plays a strong mediating role between knowledge and practice.

In this study, the role of heat wave events in the occurrence and persistence of thermal stratification was analysed by simulating the water temperature of the North Sea from 2011 to 2018 using a fully coupled hydrodynamic and wave model within the framework of the Geesthacht Coupled cOAstal model SysTem (GCOAST). The model results were assessed against reprocessed satellite data and in situ observations from field campaigns and fixed Marine Environmental Monitoring Network (MARNET) stations. To quantify the degree of stratification, the potential energy anomaly throughout the water column was calculated. The air temperatures and potential energy anomalies in the North Sea (excluding the Norwegian Trench and the area south of 54 degrees N) were linearly correlated. Different from the northern North Sea, where the water column is stratified in the warm season each year, the southern North Sea is seasonally stratified in years when a heat wave occurs. The influences of heat waves on the occurrence of summer stratification in the southern North Sea are mainly in the form of two aspects, i.e. a rapid rise in sea surface temperature at the early stage of the heat wave period and a higher water temperature during summer than the multiyear mean. Another factor that enhances the thermal stratification in summer is the memory of the water column to cold spells earlier in the year. Differences between the seasonally stratified northern North Sea and the heat wave-induced stratified southern North Sea were ultimately attributed to changes in water depth.

TI  - Lateral NAc Shell D1 and D2 Neuronal Ensembles Concurrently Predict Licking Behavior and Categorize Sucrose Concentrations in a Context-dependent Manner
T2  - NEUROSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The palatability and concentration of sweet foods promote hedonic feeding beyond homeostatic need. Understanding how neurons respond to sweet taste is thus of great importance. The dorsomedial nucleus accumbens shell (dNAcMed) is considered a "sensory sentinel," promoting hedonic feeding. However, it is unknown how neurons in the lateral part (NAcLat) respond to oral sucrose stimulation. Using in vivo calcium imaging of individual D1 and D2 cells in NAcLat of mice performing behavioral licking tasks, we find that D1 and D2 neurons do not act as single homogeneous populations. Instead, their responses are organized into ensembles with context-dependent temporal dynamics around licking sucrose. At the macrostructure of licking (meals), D1 and D2 population activity recorded on the first day predict the licking behavior on subsequent days. However, at the level of the microstructure of licking (bouts), calcium activity increased concurrently in D1 and D2 neurons prior to licking bouts, whereas during licking, calcium signals decreased. Importantly, in a Brief Access Taste Task, calcium responses for D1 and D2 exhibit much more heterogeneity than during a freely licking task. Specifically, D1 and D2 neurons form distinct ensembles: some ramp up in anticipation of the first lick, some respond at the end of the taste-access period, and some categorize sucrose concentrations as low or high. Collectively, NAcLat D1 and D2 neurons are organized in ensembles that adapt to the behavioral context to monitor task relevant events and sucrose concentrations. (c) 2022 IBRO.

TI  - The drivers for the collapse of Lake Haramaya and proposed integrated rehabilitation strategies
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RIVER BASIN MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake ecosystem is facing a threat of shrink in many parts of the world and the same in Ethiopia. Lake Haramaya, one of the highland lakes in Ethiopia, has been dried a decade ago in 2004. This study was conducted in Lake Haramaya watershed, Eastern Hararge, Ethiopia, with the objectives of identifying drivers of dried Lake Haramaya and proposing rehabilitation strategies. Various methodologies were employed to meet the intended objectives. Drivers are identified by the study of triangulated data from landsat images of five decades, trend of climate change, focus group discussions, and review of previous research results. To see the effect of land use dynamics on the lake environment, major LULC types were detected and the change analysis of the watershed was executed. To investigate association between climate change and lake environment, the rainfall index method was employed to evaluate 30 years annual rainfall distribution of Haramaya meteorological stations. The results of this method reveal that land use for settlement, climate change, and overexploitation of the lake within and out of the watershed were primary drivers. To propose lake rehabilitation strategies, the study employed the United Nation man and biosphere protection zones. The study classified the watershed into three classes as core, buffer, and transition zones. The size of the lake in 1985 was decided as the core area and 100 metre surrounding the core area as the buffer zone. The result of the study proposed protection of the core area and introduction of apple fruits replacing chat in the buffer zone with prohibition of human settlement. In addition, this study suggests that all activities that take place in the transition zone should comply with sustainable development goal strategies. Therefore, it is highly recommended to adopt the output and proposed strategies of this study in future rehabilitation strategies of Lake Haramaya and its watershed.

TI  - Evaluation on sea surface wind speed product of Fengyun-3D satellite microwave radiation imager using ERA-5 dataset
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we evaluate the two years (from 1 May 2019 to 30 April 2021) global operational sea surface wind speed (SWS) product of Fengyun-3D (FY-3D) polar-orbit meteorological satellite microwave radiation imager (MWRI) using ERA-5 reanalysis data. The total mean bias error (MBE), mean absolute error (MAE) and correlation coefficient of FY-3D/MWRI SWS product are -0.432 +/- 3.09 m/s, 1.896 +/- 2.50 m/s and 0.76, respectively. The current FY-3D/MWRI SWS data are comparable with the wind speed data of ERA-5 at most of the sea areas, especially the farther offshore sea areas. However, we still find significant overestimations (more than 5 m/s) near the coasts and typical differences in horizontal MBE values in different ascending and descending orbits. Besides, the rainy pixels as another negative impact factor are also common in FY-3D/MWRI SWS product, which can induce manifest overestimations of SWS. Therefore, the future FY-3/MWRI SWS operational algorithm should further develop a rigorous and robust quality-control module and a joint rainy pixel identification algorithm to better eliminate the unreasonable (or anomalous) pixels and rainy pixels. Moreover, the detailed evaluation on the on-orbit calibration performance of MWRI sensor is also necessary for both ascending and descending orbits.

TI  - Air pollution and internal migration: evidence from an Iranian household survey
T2  - EMPIRICAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Air pollution has become an important national issue in Iran in recent years. Several studies in Iran have shown that air pollution harmfully impacts the physical and mental health of citizens, reducing labor productivity and student academic performance. One aspect of air pollution that is yet to be examined is if it explains migration behavior across the provinces of Iran. Between 2011 and 2016, approximately 4.3 million Iranians (about 5% of the population) left their habitual residences and moved to new locations (mostly within the borders of Iran). The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of air pollution (measured using satellite data of aerosol optical depth) on net outmigration. We used data from the 2011 and 2016 National Population and Housing Censuses for 31 provinces in Iran and applied panel fixed effects and instrumental variable procedures to analyze the data. Our results show that air pollution has a positive and significant effect on net outmigration. We also found that higher levels of economic activities discourage outmigration.

TI  - Adherence to inhalers in patients with severe asthma treated with anti-interleukin-5 biologics
T2  - FARMACIA HOSPITALARIA
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Objective: Given poor medication adherence in severe asthma is difficult to evaluate in daily practice, using at least two methods concurrently is recommended. We aimed to determine the prevalence of nonadherence to inhalers using the Test of Adherence to Inhalers questionnaire and the medication possession ratio obtained from the pharmacy refill data in patients with severe asthma treated with anti-interleukin-5 biologics and to evaluate their concordance.Method: This was a cross-sectional retrospective observational study of 53 patients with severe asthma recruited from the severe asthma unit of a tertiary hospital in Madrid from June to December 2020. We registered demographic data, comorbidities and concomitant therapy for asthma. Nonadherence was defined as pharmacy refill data < 80% and/or Test of Adherence to Inhalers questionnaire results < 50. Concordance was assessed by determining the Cohen's kappa statistic.Results: The median age was 61 years (interquartile range 51.8-67.0), and 33 (61%) were women. According to the pharmacy refill data lack of adherence to the primary inhaler was 58.5%. However, when using the Test of Adherence to Inhalers questionnaire, it was 22.6%. Combining both methods, 17% of patients were considered to have nonadherence to inhalers. Likewise, when identifying nonadherence by either of these methods, it reached a prevalence of 64.2%. The pharmacy refill data and Test of Adherence to Inhalers questionnaire agreed in 53.1% and disagreed in 46.9% of patients (k = 0.137; 95% confidence interval -0.057 to 0.331; p = 0.318).Conclusions: We observed a higher prevalence of non-adherence to inhalers in patients with severe asthma treated with anti-interleukin-5 biologics. The agreement between the Test of Adherence to Inhalers questionnaire and the pharmacy refill data is lower when evaluating nonadherence in patients with severe asthma treated with anti-interleukin-5 biologics. The pharmacy refill data detect a higher proportion of nonadherence compared with the Test of Adherence to Inhalers questionnaire.

TI  - 3D porosity structure of the earliest solar system material
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbonaceous chondrites (CCs) contain the earliest preserved Solar System material, and objects containing this material are targets of numerous sample return missions. Both laboratory and remote sensing data have shown that this material can be highly porous, but the origin and nature of this porosity is currently not well understood. Because the majority of porosity within CCs is submicron to micron in size, previous lab efforts have been restricted by the limited observational scale required to examine this porosity with currently available techniques. Here we present results from a newly developed technique that allows submicron porosity to be examined in 3D within a 12 mm(3) volume of CM Murchison. We use X-ray computed tomography combined with the highly attenuating noble gas xenon to characterize porosity well below the spatial resolution of the data (3.01 mu m/voxel). This method not only allows examination of submicron porosity within a significantly larger volume than previously possible but also reveals the full three-dimensional porosity structure and pore connectivity. Our data reveal that some fine-grained rims (FGRs) surrounding chondrules have a complex 3D porosity structure, suggesting formation of the FGRs via dust aggregates or variable secondary processing around the rim after accretion.

AB  - This study examines how first-generation (FG) college students make meaning of their social class during their first-year of college. As a method, photovoice allowed for the creation of a rich set of data using student photos and accompanying narratives, through which three key themes were derived: (a) broken American dream, (b) honoring family sacrifices, and (c) lifting generations. This study informs both future practice and research by providing a deep understanding of the intersection of students' individual identities, contexts, and motivations through the lens of the social class worldview model (SCWM).

TI  - A transmissible γδ intraepithelial lymphocyte hyperproliferative phenotype is associated with the intestinal microbiota and confers protection against acute infection
T2  - MUCOSAL IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Intraepithelial lymphocytes expressing the gamma delta T cell receptor (gamma delta IELs) serve as a first line of defense against luminal microbes. Although the presence of an intact microbiota is dispensable for gamma delta IEL development, several microbial factors contribute to the maintenance of this sentinel population. However, whether specific commensals influence population of the gamma delta IEL compartment under homeostatic conditions has yet to be determined. We identified a novel gamma delta IEL hyperproliferative phenotype that arises early in life and is characterized by expansion of multiple V gamma subsets. Horizontal transfer of this hyperproliferative phenotype to mice harboring a phenotypically normal gamma delta IEL compartment was prevented following antibiotic treatment, thus demonstrating that the microbiota is both necessary and sufficient for the observed increase in gamma delta IELs. Further, we identified two guilds of small intestinal or fecal bacteria represented by 12 amplicon sequence variants (ASV) that are strongly associated with gamma delta IEL expansion. Using intravital microscopy, we find that hyperproliferative gamma delta IELs also exhibit increased migratory behavior leading to enhanced protection against bacterial infection. These findings reveal that transfer of a specific group of commensals can regulate gamma delta IEL homeostasis and immune surveillance, which may provide a novel means to reinforce the epithelial barrier.

TI  - GRF: guided residual fusion for pansharpening
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fusion of a multispectral (MS) image and a panchromatic (PAN) image is known as the pansharpening, which is a very important preprocessing step in remote sensing. Component substitution (CS)-based methods such as intensity-hue-saturation (IHS) may be the most widely used pansharpening methods and have been adopted in most of the professional software. However, the CS-based methods generally suffer from severe spectral distortions. In this paper, we propose a post-processing technique called guided residual fusion (GRF) to compensate the results of CS-based methods, which inherits high spatial fidelity from generalized IHS (GIHS, take it as an example) and greatly alleviates the spectral distortions. The main idea of our method is to estimate a residual map between the result of GIHS and the ideal high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) image. Specifically, we first obtain an approximate HRMS by inserting the pixels of the MS image according to the spatial resolution ratio between the PAN and MS. Most of the pixels in this HRMS are unknowns. We can get a masked residual map by subtracting the known values of HRMS and their corresponding counterparts of the result of GIHS. Then, we use an interpolation filter and an edge-preserving image smoothing filter to efficiently fill missing pixel values in the masked residual map, obtaining an accurate residual map. Extensive experiments on six real datasets (including datasets acquired by the Geoeye1, IKONOS, Landsat-8, QuickBird, SPOT6, and Worldview-3 sensors) demonstrate that our method outperforms the compared state-of-the-art methods, that is, the performance of our method ranks the best among all nine methods on three datasets (Geoeye1, IKONOS, and SPOT6), the second on two datasets (QuickBird and Worldview-3), and the third on the Landsat-8 dataset.

TI  - Detection and attribution of long-term and fine-scale changes in spring phenology over urban areas: A case study in New York State
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Spring phenology plays an essential role in climate change, terrestrial ecosystem, and public health. Field-based monitoring and understanding of changes in spring phenology for long periods and in large regions are challenging due to the limited in-site observations. Space-based remotely sensed observations offer great potentials for monitoring decadal spring phenology changes from regional to global scales. However, the coarse-scale remotely sensed observations are insufficient to capture fine-scale spring phenology dynamics, especially in urban areas, and this makes it challenging for understanding the combined effects of climate change and urbanization on spring phenology. We derived the start of phenology season (SOS) in New York State using 30 m Landsat observations from 1990 to 2015 to understand the impact of the environment and urbanization on SOS. The results show that SOS for different years reveals heterogeneous spatial distribution. Most regions of New York State have been experiencing significant spring phenology changes in form of earlier onset of vegetation greening, ranging from 0.2 to 0.6 day/year during 1990 to 2015, and this trend varies slightly with latitudes and urbanization levels. Further, spatial correlation analysis shows that the increase in temperature and urbanization could both promote the advancement of SOS. However, the effect of urbanization (partial correlation coefficient (R) ranges from-0.289 to-0.542) on SOS is greater than the effect of temperature (R ranges from 0.006 to-0.192). The study generates a high spatio-temporal resolution spring phenology dataset for ecological, environmental and public health studies, especially in urban areas, and reveals the importance of better accounting for the urbanization effects when quantifying the SOS dynamics in phenology models.

TI  - Tongan Volcanic Eruption Intensifies Tropical Cyclone Cody (2022)
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The aerosol-cloud impacts of the Tongan volcanic eruptions on the nearby tropical cyclone (TC) Cody on January 14 similar to 15, 2022 are investigated by the MODIS satellite and ERA5 reanalysis data. Both the precipitation and intensity of Cody were obviously enhanced after the main blast of the Tongan volcanic eruption on January 15, although the sea surface temperature and vertical wind shear of the environmental wind did not change much according to ERA5 data. The vision that a large amount of volcanic aerosol flowed from the Tongan eruption into the inflow of Cody was captured by the MODIS observations on January 15. The cloud top temperature dropped, and the cloud particle effective radius decreased in Cody from then on, which indicated the occurrence of deep convection. The analyzed results of ERA5 show that convection was strengthened in the periphery of Cody at the beginning of the volcanic eruption at 03:00 UTC on January 15 and later in Cody's inner core after the main blast at 06:00 UTC on January 15. This could be because of the microphysical process of aerosol-cloud interactions, which inhibited stratiform precipitation, increased vertical velocity and enhanced convective precipitation further. Since the deep convection in the inner core was conducive to the development of Cody, both the total precipitation and intensity of Cody increased after the main blast of the volcanic eruption. The result also suggests that major volcanic eruptions could increase the convective intensity and induce heavy precipitation in a nearby organized convective system (e.g., TC or mesoscale convective systems).

TI  - Global coastal geomorphology-integrating earth observation and geospatial data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal geomorphic classification identifying the type of depositional environment, is an important indicator for coastal state and vulnerability, e.g., beach, bedrock and wetland (tidal flat and estuarine/delta/back-barrier depression). Accurate and current maps of these geomorphology classes from local (100 m(-1) km) to global (105 km) scales are important for a range of objectives in the coastal zone. Previous methods to create coastal geomorphic maps relied heavily on manual efforts and expert opinions. However, these approaches are labour intensive and impractical for consistent application at a global scale, while still including local details. Existing global coastal geomorphology datasets are a compilation of different local-scale datasets, with varying spatial, categorical resolutions and accuracies. The recent availability of "big " and "open " data as well as increased processing capabilities resulted in the use of satellite images and digital elevation models to identify sandy beach and cliff separately. In our work, these raster data were processed on Google Earth Engine, combined with shape descriptors of coastline vectors and then fitted into machine learning models to classify the intertidal coastal geomorphology into bedrock, beach or wetland classes on the global scale (from 56 S to 60 N, excluding coral reef/fringing reef and fjord dominated coasts). A unique attribute of this new method was the incorporation of shape descriptors extracted from shoreline vector data, which substantially improved the classification accuracy. Using existing data from European Union (EU), the United States of America (US) and Australia for training and testing, the model achieved averaged 85% accuracy for testing datasets in these continents and 84% accuracy for 10,000 independent global validation samples beyond these continents. Successful classification was achieved for coasts dominated by a single geomorphology class, as well as more complex environments, such as headland bay and barrier island systems, where multiple classes appear next to each other. The model had relatively less confidence in coasts with sandy cliffs, tall canopy cover and engineered structures. Complete statistics from this study covering 56 S to 60 N showed 36.8% (142,845 km) wetland, 26.7% (103,762 km) beach and 36.5% (141,579 km) bedrock. Beach and bedrock geomorphic classes were commonly detected at mid-latitudes (30o to 60o N/S), while wetland dominated tropical latitudes (0o to 30o N/S). The output dataset can be used for different coastal management purposes. The accuracy and categorical resolution of the classification can be further improved with the development of Earth Observation Big Data in the future.

It caused the death of around 200 people and devastated the hydropower projects and other associated infrastructure in the downstream areas of the basin. While the extent of damage and devastation in the downstream region around Rini and Tapovan has been extensively reported, the reconstruction of the event has still not been definitively established. Based on an analysis of the data reported in previous papers and our field and remote-sensing data, we present a detailed reconstruction of the events that occurred in Raunthi Gad that morning. Our analysis supports previous reports that the basic cause was that a portion of the hanging glacier located at Raunthi peak (5600 m asl) along with a large amount of rock fell and hit the Raunthi valley at about 1.5 km downstream of the current snout of Raunthi glacier at an elevation of around 3800 m asl. We present evidence, supported by previous data of transient ponding in the region between the impact zone and the confluence of Raunthi Gad and Rishi Ganga. We estimate the flood volume at Rini to be around 10 MCM and the volume of water available in the valley in the form of ice and snow to be around 6 MCM. We argue that this deficit can be accounted for by the debris volume. The material gained around 8 x 10(14) J of energy during the initial slide whereas around 1.5 x 10(14) J is required to melt the ice and snow.

TI  - Evaluation of College Students' Ideological and Political Education Management Based on Wireless Network and Artificial Intelligence with Big Data Technology
T2  - SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS
M3  - Article
AB  - The construction of a correct worldview, outlook on life, and values for students is linked to the development and breakthrough in the management of ideological as well as political education of students. At the same time, college students must be encouraged to follow well-rounded education and struggle to be well-prepared for the challenges of the new era. In order to raise students' understanding of the critical role that political and ideological education plays in their academic success, it is authoritative that efforts to integrate these two spheres of learning be extended and new encounters made. That's what prompted this study, which is focused on assessing college students' level of ideological and political education administration, and it uses a mixture of big data technologies as well as artificial intelligence (AI) to do it. The accuracy of the traditional ideological as well as political education management quality assessment algorithm is not high, feature information extracted by the single-scale neural network (NN) is not rich enough, and the multiscale convolutional network (CN) fusion cannot consider the different values and importance for each scale. In this paper, the convolution kernel of the two-dimensional CN is changed to a one-dimensional convolution kernel, and the multiscale feature fusion CN model MCNN is first designed. The model is optimized and improved, the attention mechanism is integrated, and the MACNN model for the management evaluation of ideological as well as political education is proposed. Besides, this work organizes the network model in a wireless network environment that users can contact and operate at any time.

TI  - Suspended particulate matter and secchi disk depth in the Chilika Lagoon from in situ and remote sensing data: a modified semi-analytical approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing sediment load and deteriorating water clarity are the key challenges for many inland water bodies. The uncertainty associated with the bio-optical complexity of these water bodies limits remote-sensing approaches to monitor such fragile ecosystems. Therefore, we measured optical properties along with water quality parameters in the Chilika lagoon, the second-largest brackish water lagoon in the world. We evaluated exiting quasi-analytical algorithms (QAAs) to retrieve particle back-scattering coefficients (b (bp)) and diffuse attenuation coefficient (K (d)) from surface remote-sensing reflectance (R (rs)) data. However, existing QAAs underestimated the observed b (bp) and K (d) values in the Chilika lagoon. Therefore, a modified inversion algorithm (MIA) using the combined features of the sixth version of QAA (QAA v6) and the IOPs inversion model of inland waters (IIMIW) is proposed and validated. Values of b (bp) at 665 nm and K (d) at 490 nm were then used to estimate suspended particulate matter (SPM) and Secchi disk depth (Z(SD)), respectively. The bias for b (bp) and K (d) was significantly reduced using MIA, which improved the accuracy of SPM and Z(SD) estimation. We further used MIA to retrieve b (bp)(665) and K (d)(490) values from the Sentinel 2A/2B (S2A/S2B) multispectral instrument (MSI) R (rs) data for each pixel over the Chilika lagoon to estimate SPM and Z(SD) respectively. Better root-mean-squared error (RMSE) value of 10.91 mg L-1 for SPM (ranging from 11.54 to 99.00 mg L-1) and 0.21 m for Z(SD) (ranging from 0.15 to 1.2 m) was observed when compared with in situ measurements (n = 77). The mean SPM trend from 90 different S2A/S2B MSI acquisition dates from 2017 to 2021 indicated that SPM concentration in the lagoon is closely related to wind velocity. Matching fish landing trends with SPM concentrations was also observed, which may open new opportunities to manage inland water bodies using remote-sensing observations.

TI  - Is Grace Amazing or Old Wine in a New Bottle? Psychometric Development of the Perceptions and Experiences of Grace Scale (PEGS)
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGION AND SPIRITUALITY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Grace "an act of showing kindness, generosity, or mercy to someone who is undeserving and potentially incapable of returning the kindness shown," (Bufford et al., 2017, p. 2) is an underexplored construct in the psychology of religion/spirituality (R/S). A new measure of grace, the Perceptions and Experiences of Grace Scale (PEGS), was developed across three studies (N = 1,244) that explored its psychometric properties in a series of online assessments. Exploratory factor analysis identified a six-factor solution that comprised unique factors of grace: God's Grace, Grace to Self, Grace Received from Works, Unconditional Grace to Others, Conditional Grace to Others, and Conditional Grace from Parents. This model was subsequently supported by confirmatory factor analysis. Based on an emerging pattern of unconditional and conditional perceptions of grace, a second-order CFA was estimated to measure Unconditional Grace and Conditional Grace. This model fit the data well. The PEGS was assessed for test-retest reliability over a period of three to 5 months and construct validation methods produced significant paths between factors of the PEGS and specifically targeted constructs of religion, spirituality, worldview, positive psychology, health and well-being, and social desirability. The PEGS represents a psychometrically acceptable, multifactorial assessment of grace. Results of test-retest reliability raise the possibility that Grace Received from Works and Conditional Grace to Others represent state-based constructs. The PEGS is a new, multidimensional measure of grace that was developed and tested among people of diverse R/S beliefs and is applicable for R/S, relational, health, and well-being research.

TI  - DARCLOS: a cloud shadow detection algorithm for TROPOMI
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud shadows are observed by the TROPOMI satellite instrument as a result of its high spatial resolution compared to its predecessor instruments. These shadows contaminate TROPOMI's air quality measurements, because shadows are generally not taken into account in the models that are used for aerosol and trace gas retrievals. If the shadows are to be removed from the data, or if shadows are to be studied, an automatic detection of the shadow pixels is needed. We present the Detection AlgoRithm for CLOud Shadows (DARCLOS) for TROPOMI, which is the first cloud shadow detection algorithm for a spaceborne spectrometer. DARCLOS raises potential cloud shadow flags (PCSFs), actual cloud shadow flags (ACSFs), and spectral cloud shadow flags (SCSFs). The PCSFs indicate the TROPOMI ground pixels that are potentially affected by cloud shadows based on a geometric consideration with safety margins. The ACSFs are a refinement of the PCSFs using spectral reflectance information of the PCSF pixels and identify the TROPOMI ground pixels that are confidently affected by cloud shadows. Because we find indications of the wavelength dependence of cloud shadow extents in the UV, the SCSF is a wavelength-dependent alternative for the ACSF at the wavelengths of TROPOMI's air quality retrievals. We validate the PCSF and ACSF with true-colour images made by the VIIRS instrument on board Suomi NPP orbiting in close proximity to TROPOMI on board Sentinel-5P. We find that the cloud evolution during the overpass time difference between TROPOMI and VIIRS complicates this validation strategy, implicating that an alternative cloud shadow detection approach using co-located VIIRS observations could be problematic. We conclude that the PCSF can be used to exclude cloud shadow contamination from TROPOMI data, while the ACSF and SCSF can be used to select pixels for the scientific analysis of cloud shadow effects.

TI  - PANTHEISM, PANENTHEISM, AND ECOSOPHY: GETTING BACK TO SPINOZA?
T2  - ZYGON
M3  - Article
AB  - Many authors in the field of Environmental Philosophy have claimed to be inspired by Spinoza's monism, which has traditionally been considered a form of pantheism because nature and God coincide. This idea has deep normative implications, as some environmental ethicists claim that wounding nature is the same as wounding God, which implies a resacralization of nature. In particular, we will focus on Arne N AE ss's Ecosophy (or Deep Ecology) to offer a current relevant example of the pantheist (or panentheist) worldview. However, a new demarcation distinguishes pantheism from panentheism; in the latter, nature and God belong together but do not fully coincide, as in pantheism. Nevertheless, whether Spinoza is a panentheist, pantheist, or neither has yet to be fully determined, as well as whether his doctrine serves as a proper foundation for an ecology that attempts the aforementioned resacralization of nature. This article attempts to clarify these issues.

AB  - This paper compiles the data associated with a research article published in STOTEN [1] . The data set represents figures, tables, and images illustrating the temporal and spatial distribution of land use and flood dynamics from 20 0 0 to 2020 in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD). The MODIS imageries were freely accessed online via the NASA web site [2] and processed to land use and flood maps based on the algorithms by Sakamoto et al. [3 , 4] . The MODIS products show a high validation with statistical data and radar satellites [1] . The datasets of flood map and land use, therefore, are available to scientists, engineers, and policy-makers in agricultural management associated with flood management in the VMD. They could be used for policy settings, household livelihood assessment as well as other economic analyses for the VMD region due to the change of land use and flooding dynamics.

TI  - What caused the increase of tropical cyclones in the western North Pacific during the period of 2011-2020?
T2  - CLIMATE DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on satellite data after 1979, we find that the tropical cyclone (TC) variations in the Western North Pacific (WNP) can be divided into three-periods: a high-frequency period from 1979 to 1997 (P1), a low-frequency period from 1998 to 2010 (P2), and a high-frequency period from 2011 to 2020 (P3). Previous studies have focused on WNP TC activity during P1 and P2. Here we use observational data to study the WNP TC variation and its possible mechanisms during P3. Compared with P2, more TCs during P3 are due to the large-scale atmospheric favorable conditions of vertical velocity, relative vorticity and relative humidity. Warm sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies are found during P3 and migrate from east to west, which is also favorable for TC genesis. The correlation between the WNP TC frequency and SST shows a significant positive correlation around the equator and a significant negative correlation around 36 degrees N, which is similar to the warm phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). The correlation coefficient between the PDO and TC frequency is 0.71, above the 95% confidence level. The results indicate that the increase of the WNP TC frequency during 2011-2020 is associated with the PDO and warm SST anomalies.

TI  - Structural controls on coseismic rupture revealed by the 2020 <i>M</i><sub>w</sub> 6.0 Jiashi earthquake (Kepingtag belt, SW Tian Shan, China)
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Kepingtag (Kalpin) fold-and-thrust belt of the southern Chinese Tian Shan is characterized by active shortening and intense seismic activity. Geological cross-sections and seismic reflection profiles suggest thin-skinned, northward-dipping thrust sheets detached in an Upper Cambrian decollement. The 2020 January 19 M-w 6.0 Jiashi earthquake provides an opportunity to investigate how coseismic deformation is accommodated in this structural setting. Coseismic surface deformation resolved with Sentinel-1 Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) is centred on the back limb of the frontal Kepingtag anticline. Elastic dislocation modelling suggests that the causative fault is located at similar to 7 km depth and dips similar to 7 degrees northward, consistent with the inferred position of the decollement. Our calibrated relocation of the main shock hypocentre is consistent with eastward, unilateral rupture of this fault. The narrow slip pattern (length similar to 37 km but width only similar to 9 km) implies that there is a strong structural or lithological control on the rupture extent, with updip slip propagation possibly halted by an abrupt change in dip angle where the Kepingtag thrust is inferred to branch off the decollement. A depth discrepancy between main shock slip constrained by InSAR and teleseismic waveform modelling (similar to 7 km) and well-relocated aftershocks (similar to 10-20 km) may suggest that faults within sediments above the decollement exhibit velocity-strengthening friction.

TI  - Indices enhance biological soil crust mapping in sandy and desert lands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Biological soil crusts (BSCs) covering drylands worldwide are an important functional vegetation unit and play an important role in the carbon and nitrogen cycling of dryland ecosystems. However, there is a lack of accurate data on the spatial distribution and change of BSCs. Here, two indices were developed to enhance BSC mapping, including the sandy land ratio crust index (SRCI) for sandy land with moss-dominated BSCs and the desert ratio crust index (DRCI) for desert with lichen-dominated BSCs. The SRCI combines the near infrared band in which moss-dominated BSCs and other surface components have significant spectral differences, and red edge bands in which such differences can be enhanced. Another index, the DRCI, highlights different spectral characteristics of lichen-dominated BSCs, gravel and sand in the shortwave infrared and red-edge bands. A random forest (RF) machine learning framework was developed to map the large-scale BSC distribution with 10 m resolution using Sentinel 2 satellite data. The results show that the BSC area in the Mu Us Sandy Land and Gurbantunggut Desert of China covers 10,647 km2 and 14,036 km2, accounting for 5.7% and 29.4% of the total area, respectively, indicating that BSC is one of the dominant land cover types in the Gurbantunggut Desert. Validations and comparisons demonstrate that the overall accuracy of BSC detection is 90% and 94% with kappa coefficients of 0.80 and 0.86 in sandy land and desert, respectively, and the proposed SRCI and DRCI increase the overall mapping accuracy by 6% for sandy land and desert compared to the non-index scheme. Therefore, indices can enhance the BSC mapping accuracy for sandy land and desert. Moreover, this work provides basic data for exploring the ecological effects of BSCs in arid areas.

TI  - Multitemporal mass change analysis of Greenland Ice Sheet using variational mode decomposition
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) is the largest ice body in the Northern Hemisphere. Quantifying the spatiotemporal characteristics of its mass change is crucial for understanding global climate change. Many studies have been focused on the long-term ice mass change and acceleration, but a more detailed analysis of multitemporal signals, including annual, interannual and transient variations, is still imperative to study the periodic ice mass change. Here, we comprehensively characterize the multitemporal mass changes of the entire GrIS and subregions using a variational mode decomposition method, applied to Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment satellite data, surface mass balance model output, climate parameters and GPS observations. We found that both the interannual and transient mass variations of the southern subregions have larger amplitudes associated with pronounced precipitations, indicating that the southern mass change patterns are more vulnerable to short-term climate variability. We also found that the reported rapid mass loss in 2010, 2012, 2016 and 2019 should be attributed to the interannual signals that result from low precipitations, significant runoff and evapotranspiration. The largest interannual mass variation was discovered in 2019 (-235 Gt), but due to the combined effect of interannual loss (-147 Gt) and transient attenuation (-380 Gt), the greatest mass loss (-527 Gt) was observed at the end of 2012. Our study emphasizes the importance of multitemporal signals in characterizing the spatiotemporal GrIS mass change and exploring the coupling effect between ice mass change and climate conditions.

AB  - Surface run-off is very important factor for water harvesting projects which is one the effective solutions in reducing the water shortage, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. The objective of this study is to evaluate the run-off potential at the outlets of 40 selected basins within Nineveh governorate, Iraq, based on the morphometric analysis using remote sensing and geographic information systems. In order to achieve this objective, the morphometric parameters adopted were extracted based on ALOS PALSAR DEM with high resolution 12.5 m and using the traditional formulas and ArcMap, the calculated parameters were weighed on a scale of (1-40), then, the factor named as compound factor for each basin were calculated, finally, the 40 basins were categorized into five ranks of run-off potential based on their compound factor namely: (very high potential) were assigned for 7 out of 40 basins that have very high compound factor, (high potential) were assigned for 10 basins that have the next high compound factor, (moderate potential) were assigned for 9 basins, (low potential) were assigned for 10 basins and (very low potential) were assigned for 4 basins that have lowest values of compound factor. Finally, the results obtained using the adopted methodologies can be useful for the decision makers that interested in the rainwater harvesting within the study area, also the methodologies used can be generalized to comprise all the basins throughout Iraq for developing the rainwater harvesting projects.

T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Wadi Sa'al-Wadi Zaghara area, southern Sinai, Egypt isa key geologic region within the framework of the Arabian-Nubian Shield (ANS). It almost documents the whole tectono-thermal evolution history of the Pan-African orogeny; hence it records the latest stages of Rodinia breakup (Late Mesoproterozoic) till the penultimate regional deformation event (D3) that impacted the northern tip of the ANS in the Late Neoproterozoic, i.e., before the Najd fault system. Since the metamorphosed volcano-sedimentary rock units in both Wadi Sa'al and Wadi Zaghara exhibit considerable differences in their geological evolution, they were dealt with as two distinct metamorphic belts. They cover a wide spectrum of basement rock varieties, which developed over a long period of time, from Late Mesoproterozoic (Wadi Sa'al metamor-phosed volcano-sedimentary rocks) till Late Neoproterozoic Ediacaran period (post-collision granites). The different rock units of the study area were discriminated based on various image processing tech-niques such as Decorrelation Stretch (DS) Band Ratio (BR) and Principal Component (PC) of Sentinel-2, Landsat-8 and ASTER datasets. Remote sensing data analyses with the aid of petrography, previously pub-lished data and field verification enabled us to produce a new enhanced geological map of the study area. Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) digital elevation and enhanced Sentinel-2, Sobel directional fil-ter images were successfully used for automatic lineaments extraction in the study area.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple SummaryImplementing intraoperative assessment of sentinel lymph nodes by one-step nucleic acid amplification in early breast cancer can reduce the surgical burden to the patient and the costs to the health system. However, only limited data are available in terms of long-term disease-free survival and overall survival. Therefore, this study aims to compare disease-free survival and overall survival between one-step nucleic acid amplification, frozen section, and definitive histology. These results could impact the healthcare community, adding further proof to the body of evidence supporting the broader adoption of this innovative technology that enables a safe reduction in patient surgical burden and healthcare costs. BackgroundThe one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) system is a novel molecular technique, which consents to quick intraoperative detection of sentinel lymph node metastases by the amplification of cytokeratin 19 mRNA. Our study aims to evaluate the OSNA method in comparison with frozen section (FS) and definitive histological examination of the sentinel lymph node biopsy among early breast cancer patients considering disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). MethodsIn this study, we included all women who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for breast cancers classified as TNM stage I and II in our center between January 2005 and January 2017, and the follow-up was collected up to January 2019. We divided patients among three groups based on SLNB evaluation: definitive histological examination, intra-operative FS, or OSNA. ResultsWe included 2412 SLNBs: 727 by definitive histological examination, 697 by FS, and 988 by OSNA. Isolated tumor cells were found in 2.32% of cases, micrometastasis in 9.12%, and macrometastases in 13.64%. Surgical procedure duration was significantly shorter in OSNA than in FS (42.1 minutes +/- 5.1 vs. 70.1 minutes +/- 10.5, p <0.05). No significant differences have been observed among the three groups regarding OS, DSF, cumulative local, or distant metastases. In particular 5-year DFS was 96.38% in definitive histology (95% C.I. 95.02-97.75%), 96.37% in FS (95% C.I. 94.98-97.78%), and 96.51% in OSNA group (95% C.I. 95.32-97.72%). ConclusionsNo difference in OS and DFS was found comparing OSNA, FS, and definitive histology. Furthermore, reduced operative time was found in the OSNA group.

TI  - Stratification at the health district level for targeting malaria control interventions in Mali
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Malaria is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Mali. Between 2017 and 2020, the number of cases increased in the country, with 2,884,827 confirmed cases and 1454 reported deaths in 2020. We performed a malaria risk stratification at the health district level in Mali with a view to proposing targeted control interventions. Data on confirmed malaria cases were obtained from the District Health Information Software 2, data on malaria prevalence and mortality in children aged 6-59 months from the 2018 Demographic and Health Survey, entomological data from Malian research institutions working on malaria in the sentinel sites of the National Malaria Control Program (NMCP), and environmental data from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. A stratification of malaria risk was performed. Targeted malaria control interventions were selected based on spatial heterogeneity of malaria incidence, malaria prevalence in children, vector resistance distribution, health facility usage, child mortality, and seasonality of transmission. These interventions were discussed with the NMCP and the different funding partners. In 2017-2019, median incidence across the 75 health districts was 129.34 cases per 1000 person-years (standard deviation = 86.48). Risk stratification identified 12 health districts in very low transmission areas, 19 in low transmission areas, 20 in moderate transmission areas, and 24 in high transmission areas. Low health facility usage and increased vector resistance were observed in high transmission areas. Eight intervention combinations were selected for implementation. Our work provides an updated risk stratification using advanced statistical methods to inform the targeting of malaria control interventions in Mali. This stratification can serve as a template for continuous malaria risk stratifications in Mali and other countries.

TI  - Estimating soil moisture content under grassland with hyperspectral data using radiative transfer modelling and machine learning
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring of soil moisture content (SMC) at very high spatial resolution (< 10 m) using unmanned aerial systems (UAS) is of high interest for precision agriculture and the validation of large scale SMC products. Data -driven approaches are the most common method to retrieve SMC with UAS-borne data at water limited sites over non-disturbed agricultural crops. A major disadvantage of data-driven algorithms is the limited transferability in space and time and the need of a high number of ground reference samples. Physically-based approaches are less dependent on the amount of samples and are transferable in space and time. This study explores the potential of (1) a hybrid method targeting the soil brightness factor of the PROSAIL model using a variational heteroscedastic Gaussian Processes regression (VHGPR) algorithm, and (2) a data-driven method employing VHGPR for the retrieval of SMC over three grassland sites based on UAS-borne VIS-NIR (399-1001 nm) hyperspectral data. The sites were managed by mowing (Fendt), grazing (Grosses Bruch) and irrigation (Marquardt). With these distinct local pre-conditions we aimed to identify factors that favor and limit the retrieval of SMC. The hybrid approach presented encouraging results in Marquardt (RMSE = 1.5 Vol_%, R-2 = 0.2). At the permanent grassland sites (Fendt, Grosses Bruch) the thatch layer jeopardized the application of the hybrid model. We identified the complex canopy structure of grassland as the main factor impacting the hybrid SMC retrieval. The data-driven approach showed high accuracy for Fendt (R-2 = 0.84, RMSE = 8.66) and Marquardt (R-2 = 0.4, RMSE = 10.52). All data-driven models build on the LAI-SMC relationship. However, this relationship was hampered by mowing (Fendt), leading to a lack of transferability in time. The alteration of plant traits by grazing prevents finding a relationship with SMC in Grosses Bruch. In Marquardt, we identified the timelag between changes in SMC and plant response as the main reason of decrease in model accuracy. Yet, the model performance is accurate in undisturbed and water-limited areas (Marquardt). The analysis points to challenges that need to be tackled in future research and opens the discussion for the development of robust models to retrieve high resolution SMC from UAS-borne remote sensing observations.

TI  - Fire, climate and biotic interactions shape diversity patterns along an Afrotropical elevation gradient
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim Untangling multiple drivers influencing biodiversity along elevation gradients is necessary for predicting the consequences of climate change on mountain communities. We examine the direct and indirect effects of macroclimate, edaphic conditions, fire frequency and putative biotic interactions on species richness and abundance of co-occurring primary producers on Mount Cameroon. Location Mount Cameroon, Cameroon. Taxon vascular plants, bryophytes and lichens, and soil microbial phototrophs. Methods We combine ground-level survey of multi-taxa diversity, soil nutrient stoichiometry, continuous climate monitoring using dataloggers and remote sensing data, for 115 plots sampled along a 2200-4000 m elevation gradient. We used GAMs to assess elevational patterns in ecosystem properties and SEMs to determine their direct and indirect effects on species richness and abundance. Results Vascular plant diversity peaked at mid-elevation and emerged from the combined effects of intermediate levels of energy, total above-ground standing biomass, fire frequency, guild abundances and edaphic conditions. Bryophyte-lichen diversity increased monotonically towards high elevation with decreasing temperature and increasing nutrient scarcity, while the diversity of soil phototrophs peaked at both lower elevation fire-prone Afromontane and cold higher elevation Afroalpine zones. The role of macroclimate was indirect and scale dependent. Higher temperatures increased plant richness mainly indirectly via enhanced fire frequency, while soil N:P ratio had direct positive effect on plant richness. Precipitation decreased plant richness indirectly via decreased fire frequency. Fires also increased plant and bryophyte-lichen cover. Positive bryophyte-lichen and vascular plants associations strengthened in the Afroalpine zone. Main conclusions We demonstrate the role of disturbance/fire and biotic interactions in mitigating macroclimate effects and in controlling variation in community diversity along elevation gradients. While the macroclimate is often a strong predictor of ecological patterns along elevation gradients, our study illustrates that attributing these patterns exclusively to climate can lead to an incorrect assessment of the impact of climate change on biodiversity.

TI  - Development of a syndromic surveillance system for Irish dairy cattle using milk recording data
T2  - PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the last decade and a half, emerging vector-borne diseases have become a substantial threat to cattle across Europe. To mitigate the impact of the emergence of new diseases, outbreaks must be detected early. However, the clinical signs associated with many diseases may be nonspecific. Furthermore, there is often a delay in the development of new diagnostic tests for novel pathogens which limits the ability to detect emerging disease in the initial stages. Syndromic Surveillance has been proposed as an additional surveillance method that could augment traditional methods by detecting aberrations in non-specific disease indicators. The aim of this study was to develop a syndromic surveillance system for Irish dairy herds based on routinely collected milk recording and meteorological data. We sought to determine whether the system would have detected the 2012 Schmallenberg virus (SBV) incursion into Ireland earlier than conventional surveillance methods. Using 7,743,138 milk recordings from 730,724 cows in 7037 herds between 2007 and 2012, linear mixed-effects models were developed to predict milk yield and alarms generated with temporally clustered deviations from predicted values. Additionally, hotspot spatial analyses were conducted at corresponding time points. Using a range of thresholds, our model generated alarms throughout September 2012, between 4 and 6 weeks prior to the first laboratory confirmation of SBV in Ireland. This system for monitoring milk yield represents both a potentially useful tool for early detection of disease, and a valuable foundation for developing similar tools using other metrics.

TI  - Enhanced release, export, and transport of diffuse nutrients from litter in forested watersheds with climate warming
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Variations in litter decomposition and nutrient migration are constraints to accurately estimate watershed diffuse forest pollution under the combined effects of topographic heterogeneity and climate change. In this study, remote sensing data, decomposition and leaching experiments, and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) were used to quantify the release, export, and transport characteristics of diffuse nutrients from forest litter under two climate scenarios (the current climate condition [S1] and the future warming and drying climate condition [S2]), and the impacts on aquatic environment were identified. The annual litter decomposition was 27.80 x 10(6) t in S2, which was 1.39 times that of S1. Additionally, the annual litter nutrient release in S2 (C, N, and P was 8.65 x 10(6), 3.31 x 10(5), and 1.57 x 10(4) t, respectively) also increased by 31.16%-45.62% compared with that of S1. The spatial patterns of nutrient export showed that the annual exports of C, N, and Pin S1 were 109.77, 46.85, and 0.43 kg/ha, respectively. The annual nutrient export in S2 increased by 1.44 times, and S2 also had higher values of nutrient transport. In addition, variation trends of temperature and precipitation increased significantly with increasing altitude, which promoted differences in nutrient transport between S1 and S2 in the high-altitude areas. The response analysis of the diffuse nutrient in surface water also indicated that forest nutrient discharge load were critical factors affecting the aquatic environmental quality. This study indicated that climate warming accelerated litter decomposition and made litter a potential source of diffuse forest pollution, and watershed discharge load varied intensively with the terrestrial conditions. The combination of experiments and modeling can improve the accuracy of diffuse forest pollution simulation and provide valuable information for formulating watershed climate change adaptation strategies.

TI  - Mothering in the streets: Familial adaptation strategies of street-identified Black American mothers
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARRIAGE AND FAMILY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Using components of the Family Adjustment and Adaptation Response Model, Critical Race Feminism, and Sites of Resilience, this study explored how street-identified Black American mothers engage in street life, while juggling the pressures of childrearing, family, and home life within a distressed, urban Black community. Background Street-identified Black American mothers are vilified for their intersecting identities of being Black women who are experiencing poverty, and who may also be involved in illegal activity. Black mothers are disproportionately represented in the criminal legal system, but existing research has inadequately examined how street-identified Black mothers "do" family in the confines of structural violence. Method We addressed this gap by analyzing interview data with 39 street-identified Black American mothers ages 18 to 54. Data were collected using street participatory action research. Results We identified a typology of three adaptive mothering strategies employed by street-identified Black women as they respond to and cope with violent structural conditions shaping their mothering: constrained mothering, racialized mothering, and aspirational mothering. Conclusions Findings suggested that these strategies were developed in response to an overarching carceral apparatus, of which these mothers were tasked with avoiding when possible and confronting when necessary. Their mothering strategies were shaped by a collective, Black American cultural identity and worldview, and the mothers possessed a unique way of perceiving the world as criminalized subjects with disproportionate proximity to the punitive state.

TI  - Inverse modeling of the 2021 spring super dust storms in East Asia
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Last spring, super dust storms reappeared in East Asia after being absent for one and a half decades. The event caused enormous losses in both Mongolia and China. Accurate simulation of such super sandstorms is valuable for the quantification of health damage, aviation risks, and profound impacts on the Earth system, but also to reveal the climatic driving force and the process of desertification. However, accurate simulation of dust life cycles is challenging, mainly due to imperfect knowledge of emissions. In this study, the emissions that lead to the 2021 spring dust storms are estimated through assimilation of MODIS AOD and ground-based PM1() concentration data simultaneously. With this, the dust concentrations during these super storms could be reproduced and validated with concentration observations. The multi-observation assimilation is also compared against emission inversion that assimilates AOD or PAU) concentration measurements alone, and the added values are analyzed. The emission inversion results reveal that wind-blown dust emissions originated from both China and Mongolia during spring 2021. Specifically, 19.9 x 10(6) and 37.5 x 10(6) t of particles were released in the Chinese and Mongolian Gobi, respectively, during these severe dust events. By source apportionment it was revealed that the Mongolian Gobi poses more severe threats to the densely populated regions of the Fenwei Plain (FWP) and the North China Plain (NCP) located in northern China than does the Chinese Gobi. It was estimated that 63 % of the dust deposited in FWP was due to transnational transport from Mongolia. For NCP, the long-distance transport dust from Mongolia contributes about 69 % to the dust deposition.

TI  - Which model to choose? Performance comparison of statistical and machine learning models in predicting PM<sub>2.5</sub> from high-resolution satellite aerosol optical depth
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The mathematical solution to estimate surface fine particulate matter (PM2.5) from columnar aerosol optical depth (AOD) includes complex variables and involves a bunch of assumptions. Hence, researchers tend to use training-based models to predict PM2.5 from AOD. Here, we integrated regulatory composite PM2.5 measurements, high-resolution satellite AOD, reanalysis meteorological parameters, and a few other auxiliary parameters to train ten different regression models. The performance of these (seven statistical and three machine learning) models was evaluated and inter-compared to identify the best performing model. The accuracies of the model predicted PM2.5 were quantified based on the coefficient of determination (R-2), mean absolute bias (MAB), normalized root mean square error (NRMSE), and other relevant regression coefficients. The model's performance on unseen data was investigated in terms of 10-fold cross-validation (CV) and Leave-one station-out CV (LOOCV). For this exercise, we considered the case of NCT-Delhi due to: (i) the availability of dense regulatory PM2.5 measurements, (ii) the possibility of understanding the model performance over a large range of PM2.5 (the daily mean PM2.5 values ranged between - 4 and 492 mu g m(-3) during the study period), and (iii) the scope of better understanding the influence of extreme meteorological conditions (e.g. the ambient surface temperature varies between -5 and 40 degrees C during a calendar year) on the AOD-PM2.5 relationship. All the models were trained using data collected for the year 2019 (a non-COVID year). Among models under investigation, Machine Learning (ML) models performed better with R-2, MAB, and NRMSE values for the CV exercises ranging between 0.88 and 0.93, 14.1 and 18.2 mu g m(-3), and 0.18 and 0.23, respectively. The generalizability of the results obtained in this study was discussed.

TI  - Developing and evaluating the feasibility of a new spatiotemporal fusion framework to improve remote sensing reflectance and dynamic LAI monitoring
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-sensor fusion provides an effective way for applications requiring remote sensing data with high spatiotemporal resolution. Especially for agricultural areas with complex planting structures and rapid changes in crop phenology, more detailed and dense time-series remote sensing data are necessary. The Sentinel-2 Multispectral Imager (S2-MSI) sensor with high spatial resolution (10-60 m) and temporal resolution (5-10 days) plays a key role in spatiotemporal fusion. But the inconsistent spatial resolution of the various bands hinders its potential application at 10 m resolution, and the multiple available fine images it provides are not fully utilized for spatiotemporal fusion. It is worth exploring how to maximize the spatial and temporal resolution of S2-MSI images to help improve the effect of spatiotemporal fusion and the dynamic monitoring of rapid crop growth. In this research, a new spatiotemporal fusion (STF) framework is developed to fuse the S2-MSI image (10 m) enhanced by Super-Resolution for multispectral Multiresolution Estimation (SupReME) algorithm and MODIS image (460 m) with a large spatial ratio (46). The proposed fusion method in the new STF framework combines the existing STF methods with Consistent Adjustment of the Climatology to Actual Observations (CACAO) algorithm, abbreviated as CA-STF. The accuracy of the fused reflectance and its capability for dynamic LAI monitoring were tested in Daman Superstation of Heihe watershed. The results indicate that: (1) the new STF framework is competent to fuse multi-source images with a ratio of 46 and outperforms the existing STF methods for both near-real-time and post-growth applications; (2) the proposed CA-STF method improves the fusion accuracy and spatial details even if only two 52-MSI images are available, especially for post-growth applications; (3) the vegetation indices (VIs) calculated from the fused images by the new STF framework provide a better correlation with LAINet measurements and improve dynamic LAI monitoring in accuracy and spatial details. This study proposes a framework to maximize the spatial and temporal resolution of S2-MSI images for spatiotemporal fusion. The synthetic daily time-series images with a high resolution of 10 m will have great potential for monitoring the dynamic changes of the land surface.

AB  - We present a procedure to detect landslide events by analyzing in-sequence data acquired from regional broadband seismic networks and spaceborne radar imagery. The combined used of these techniques is meant to exploit their complementary elements and mitigate their limitations when used singularly. To test the method, we consider a series of six slope failures associated to the Piz Cengalo rock avalanche that recently occurred in the Swiss Alps, a region where we can benefit from high spatial density and quality of seismic data, as well as from the high spatial and temporal resolution of the European Space Agency (ESA) Copernicus Sentinel-1 radar satellites. The operational implementation of the proposed approach, in combination with the future increase in availability of seismic and satellite data, can offer a new and efficient solution to build and/or expand landslide catalogues based on quantitative measurements and, thus, help in hazard assessments and the definition of early warning systems at regional scales.

TI  - Impact of anthropogenic activities on urban heat islands in major cities of El-Minya Governorate, Egypt
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban heat islands (UHIs) represent one of the significant factors in regard to environmental and human health. UHIs are significantly changeable, responding to the land use type and the dominant anthropogenic activities. In this research, UHIs in El-Minya cities were identified based on Land Surface Temperature (LST) measurements. Thermal bands of Landsat imagery were processed to produce LST in the cities of El-Minya governorate in 2001, 2011, and 2021. In addition, the spectral indices; Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), and the Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) were retrieved from the processing of multispectral Landsat imagery to assess different Land-cover units in the study area and to detect their correlation with LST/UHIs. Analysis of data indicated that LST variations are corresponding with different land-cover types. It was found that NDVI and NDWI have a strong negative influence on LST (R =-0.7 and-0.8 for both indices, respectively), while NDBI has a significant positive correlation (R = 0.85). Furthermore, the highest LST was detected at the cities of El-Minya, New-El-Minya, and Malawi, consequently. These regions have the greatest potential for UHIs formation among other El-Minya governorate cities. The year 2021 recorded the highest average LST with a value of 34.1 ? where the largest UHI area was observed in New-El-Minya (2.74Km2) in 2001, and (2.6 Km(2)) in 2021, as well as (1.12Km(2)) in El Minya in 2011. It can be concluded that increasing LST and UHIs at different districts of El-Minya arise from urbanization and industrialization processes.

TI  - Identifying associations between management practices and antimicrobial resistances of sentinel bacteria recovered from bulk tank milk on dairy farms
T2  - PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - There is increasing emphasis on the need to reduce antimicrobial use (AMU) on dairy farms to reduce the emergence of resistant bacteria which could compromise animal health and impact human medicine. In addition to AMU, the role of farm management is an area of growing interest and represents an alternative route for possible interventions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of farm management practices and AMU on resistances of sentinel bacteria in bulk milk. Dairy farms from two, geographically separate locations within the British Isles were recruited as part of two study groups. Farm management data from study group 1 (n = 125) and study group 2 (n = 16) were collected by means of a face-to-face questionnaire with farmers carried out during farm visits. For study group 2, additional data on AMU was collated from veterinary medicine sales records. Sentinel bacterial species (Enterococcus spp. and E. coli), which have been reported to be of value in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) studies, were isolated from bulk tank milk to monitor antimicrobial susceptibilities by means of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). MIC data for both groups was used to generate an overall "score" for each farm. For both groups, this overall farm mean MIC was used as the outcome variable to evaluate the impact of farm management and AMU. This was achieved through use of elastic net modelling, a regularised regression method which also featured a bootstrapping procedure to produce robust models. Inference of models was based on covariate stabilities and bootstrapped P-values to identify farm management and AMU practices that have significant effects on MICs of sentinel bacteria. Practices which were found to be of importance with respect to Enterococcus spp. included management of slurry, external entry of livestock to the dairy herd, use of bedding materials and conditioners, cubicle cleaning routines and antibiotic practices, including use of beta-lactams and fluoroquinolones. Practices deemed to be of importance for E. coli MICs included cubicle and bedding management practices, teat preparation routines at milking and the milking procedure itself. We conclude that a variety of routine farm management practices are associated with MICs of sentinel bacteria in bulk milk. Amendment of these practices offers additional possible routes of intervention, alongside alterations to AMU, to mitigate the emergence and dissemination of AMR on dairy farms.

TI  - Historical reconstruction of shoreline evolution at the Nam Dinh Coast, Vietnam
T2  - COASTAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Hai Hau, located in northern Vietnam, has suffered from severe coastal erosion with a retreat rate reaching 20 m/yr in recent years. Based on a systematic review of the literature, the shoreline recession trend along the Hai Hau is associated with the decline of water and sediment discharged from the So River, assumed to be active after a great flood in 1787, resulting in channel bifurcation and abandonment of the former channel. A historical analysis of the shoreline evolution of approximately a thousand years (the year 1000 - present) was conducted along this scenario using a modified one-line model. The simulated shorelines agreed well with the results of carbon-14 dating analysis, the historical reference points and shoreline positions extracted from the old maps, and the recently measured shoreline change derived from Landsat imagery. The present study demonstrates that the erosion at the Hai Hau has been ongoing from the end of the 18th century rather than the beginning of the 20th century, as proposed by some previous works. We regard the combined effects of the decrease in river sediment load, and other processes (subsidence and sea level rise (SLR)) are the major causes of long-term erosion on Hai Hau Coast.

TI  - Assessing the utility of Sentinel-2 MSI in mapping an encroaching <i>Serephium plumosum</i> in South African rangeland
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Grassland has a rich biodiversity that provides critical ecosystem services such as water supply and flow regulation, carbon storage and erosion control. In South Africa, grassland is a source of readily available grazing for both livestock and wildlife for farmers. Despite the relative importance of grassland, it faces many challenges that include unsustainable land use practices (overgrazing), bush encroachment and invasive alien plants (IAPs). Serephium plumosum (S. plumosum) is an encroacher shrub that has been declared through legislation as problematic in some parts of South Africa. This aggressive encroacher shrub has endangered the existence of palatable grassland of about 11 million hectares in South Africa. This research investigated the utility of the freely available Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery and two classifier approaches, random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM), in mapping S. plumosum at Telperion and Ezemvelo nature reserves in South Africa. S. plumosum and other land cover classes were successfully mapped using spectral reflectance with the overall accuracy of 97.42% and 95.48% for RF and SVM, respectively. Grassland was found to be the most common land cover class representing about 41%. S. plumosum covered 13% of the study area and more significantly represented a 24% encroachment of grassland. Having successfully mapped S. plumosum through Sentinel-2 MSI, this provides for a viable method of mapping this problematic shrub which will be beneficial to both private farmers and environmentalists. Future research could focus on mapping and understanding the historical distribution of this aggressive shrub and modelling of future invasions.

TI  - Interrogating the Impassable: A Case Series and Literature Review of Unilateral SPECT-CT Groin Visualization in Men With Penile Cancer
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Penile squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a rare malignancy, which is known to invade local inguinal lymph nodes prior to progressing to the pelvis. Dynamic sentinel lymph node biopsy (DSLNB) is a standard for the minimally invasive assessment of lymphadenopathy in patients with subclinical groin metastasis. Hybrid Tc-99m Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT-CT) has been shown to increase the accuracy of identifying first draining "sentinel" nodes (SN). Unilateral inguinal visualization on SPECT-CT is a rare presentation, which may increase the likelihood of a false negative SN biopsy. Retrospective analysis from three-penile cancer uro-oncologists in Melbourne, Australia identified 78 groins undergoing DSLNB for intermediate/high risk primary disease. Unilateral SPECT-CT results were observed in four patients suggesting a functional pattern of lymph diversion. Analysis confirmed malignancy (n = 2), sarcoidosis (n = 1), and evidence of local inflammation in SPECT-CT negative groins. Findings re-iterate the role of SPECT-CT a pre-operative adjunct. Experienced multimodal groin assessment using palpation, SPECT-CT, lymphoscintigraphy, and blue dye tracking remains paramount. Unilateral SN on pre-operative SPECT-CT in men with intermediate/high-risk penile SCC should elicit a higher degree of clinical suspicion. We recommend a low threshold for recommending radical inguinal lymph node dissection (ILND) for groins refractory to minimally invasive assessment.

TI  - A Multi-Method Approach to Flood Mapping: Reconstructing Inundation Changes in the Cambodian Upper Mekong Delta
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - As in many tropical deltas globally, annual floods shape the livelihoods of the largely rural population in the Cambodian Mekong delta. Agricultural cycles are keyed to the flood arrival, peak, and recession, and fish populations depend on inundated floodplains for their regeneration. However, as factors like climate change and hydropower infrastructure development are altering the Mekong's hydrology, the inundation dynamics of its deltaic floodplains are shifting as well. Several studies have assessed the general changes of river discharge and flood extent on a basin-or delta-wide scale. Yet the sustainable development of this region is relying on dynamics at more local and specific scales, which have not been addressed so far. This paper presents a methodology to track the evolution of hydrological regimes and associated inundations in tropical deltas such as the upper Mekong delta in Cambodia, where it is applied over the past 30 years. Data scarcity and heterogeneity of the environment in this region necessitated the use of combined approaches. We established a link between water levels measured in situ and flood maps derived from optical and radar satellite images (Sentinel-1 and -2).The robustness of the link was assessed using Sentinel, Landsat imagery and the TanDEM-X (12 m) elevation model. This water level-flood link (WAFL) was then used to reconstruct a daily time series of inundation extents reaching back to the beginning of hydrological measurements in 1991 (30 years). On this basis, changes in the incidence, duration, and spatial distribution of floods were analysed. The results indicated that WAFL can be used to reconstruct inundation maps with an overall robustness of 87% in comparison to historical inundation maps derived from remote sensing imagery. Comparisons of WAFLderived flood extents with Landsat images further underscored the significant role of local infrastructure, sedimentation dynamics, and land cover to explain changes in inundation dynamics. WAFL-based analyses revealed that inundation durations have decreased by an average of 19 days when comparing the periods before and after 2008, which was identified as a break point in the hydrological time series. Furthermore, a drastic decrease in inundation the annual frequency with which individual pixels are flooded can be detected during the first half of the traditional flood season, with an average of-21% in early August, negatively impacting water-based livelihoods, from agriculture to fisheries.

TI  - Madagascar's fire regimes challenge global assumptions about landscape degradation
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Narratives of landscape degradation are often linked to unsustainable fire use by local communities. Madagascar is a case in point: the island is considered globally exceptional, with its remarkable endemic biodiversity viewed as threatened by unsustainable anthropogenic fire. Yet, fire regimes on Madagascar have not been empirically characterised or globally contextualised. Here, we contribute a comparative approach to determining relationships between regional fire regimes and global patterns and trends, applied to Madagascar using MODIS remote sensing data (2003-2019). Rather than a global exception, we show that Madagascar's fire regimes are similar to 88% of tropical burned area with shared climate and vegetation characteristics, and can be considered a microcosm of most tropical fire regimes. From 2003-2019, landscape-scale fire declined across tropical grassy biomes (17%-44% excluding Madagascar), and on Madagascar at a relatively fast rate (36%-46%). Thus, high tree loss anomalies on the island (1.25-4.77x the tropical average) were not explained by any general expansion of landscape-scale fire in grassy biomes. Rather, tree loss anomalies centred in forests, and could not be explained by landscape-scale fire escaping from savannas into forests. Unexpectedly, the highest tree loss anomalies on Madagascar (4.77x) occurred in environments without landscape-scale fire, where the role of small-scale fires (<21 h [0.21 km(2)]) is unknown. While landscape-scale fire declined across tropical grassy biomes, trends in tropical forests reflected important differences among regions, indicating a need to better understand regional variation in the anthropogenic drivers of forest loss and fire risk. Our new understanding of Madagascar's fire regimes offers two lessons with global implications: first, landscape-scale fire is declining across tropical grassy biomes and does not explain high tree loss anomalies on Madagascar. Second, landscape-scale fire is not uniformly associated with tropical forest loss, indicating a need for socio-ecological context in framing new narratives of fire and ecosystem degradation.

TI  - Application of land snail <i>Helix lucorum</i> for evaluation of genotoxicity of soil pollution
T2  - MUTATION RESEARCH-GENETIC TOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL MUTAGENESIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Application of native species as sentinels allows environmental scientists to determine real genotoxic impact of environmental pollutants. The present study aims at investigating the DNA damage in the land snail Helix lucorum as a biomarker of soil pollution. For this reason, the genotoxic impact of contaminated soil on H. lucorum, collected from different polluted areas, was investigated using the comet assay in haemocytes and digestive gland cells. An increase in DNA damage was found in the snails sampled from polluted sites compared with the reference one. Strong correlations between DNA damage in haemocytes and digestive gland cells with the level of contamination indicate pollution-induced genotoxic effects in both tissues. At the same time, the digestive gland was more sensitive towards pollutants compared with haemolymph. A direct relationship between concentrations of Cu, As and Mo in soil and the number of damaged cells for haemolymph and digestive gland tissue was found. However, the data obtained reflect the total genotoxicity of all pollutants in the studied areas. Significant correlations between the DNA damage measured by the comet assay and metal contents in soil indicate that it is a suitable biomarker in ecotoxicological studies. Our results indicate the effectiveness of H. lucorum in biomonitoring of environmental pollution.

TI  - Monitoring Urbanization Induced Surface Urban Cool Island Formation in a South Asian Megacity: A Case Study of Bengaluru, India (1989-2019)
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Many world cities have been going through thermal state intensification induced by the uncertain growth of impervious land. To address this challenge, one of the megacities of South Asia, Bengaluru (India), facing intense urbanization transformation, has been taken up for detailed investigations. Three decadal (1989-2019) patterns and magnitude of natural coverage and its influence on the thermal state are studied in this research for assisting urban planners in adopting mitigation measures to achieve sustainable development in the megacity. The main aim of this research is to monitor the surface urban cool island (SUCI) in Bengaluru city, one of the booming megacities in India, using Landsat data from 1989 to 2019. This study further focused on the analysis of land surface temperature (LST), bare surface (BS), impervious surface (IS), and vegetation surface (VS). The SUCI intensity (SUCII) is examined through the LST difference based on the classified categories of land use/land cover (LU/LC) using urban-rural grid zones. In addition, we have proposed a modified approach in the form of ISBS fraction ratio (ISBS-FR) to cater to the state of urbanization. Furthermore, the relationship between LST and ISBS-FR and the magnitude of the ISBS-FR is also analyzed. The rural zone is assumed based on <10% of the recorded fraction of IS (FIS) along the zones in the urban-rural gradient (URG). It is observed that SUCII hiked by 1.92 degrees C in 1989, 4.61 degrees C in 2004, and 2.66 degrees C in 2019 between demarcated urban and rural zones along URG. Furthermore, the results indicate a high expansion of impervious space in the city from 1989 to 2019. The alteration in the city landscape mostly occurs due to impervious development, causing the intensification of SUCI. The mean LST (MLST) has a negative relationship with the fraction of VS (FVS) and a positive relationship with the fraction of BS (FBS). In addition, the ISBS-FR shows intense enlargement. The findings of the present study will add to the existing knowledge base and will serve as a road map for urban and landscape planning for environmental enrichment and sustainability of the megacity of Bengaluru.

TI  - Intracellular Lipid Accumulation Drives the Differentiation of Decidual Polymorphonuclear Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells via Arachidonic Acid Metabolism
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Decidual polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs) are essential to immune tolerance during pregnancy. A reduction in the number of these cells is associated with unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss (URPL). In our previous study, we reported that PMN-MDSCs are a group of mature neutrophils that are activated by the decidua microenvironment. In the present study, we show that the decidua microenvironment induces substantial lipid accumulation in neutrophils during their differentiation to PMN-MDSCs. Lower levels of lipid accumulation are detected in PMN-MDSCs from URPL patients, and the amount of lipid in the PMN-MDSCs is positively correlated with the proportion of PMN-MDSCs. Next, we demonstrate that decidua-derived IL6 with the presence of arachidonic acid upregulates fatty acid-binding protein 5 (FABP5) via the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Fy -60ABP5 then continuously stimulates intracellular lipid accumulation. Increased intracellular lipid accumulation mediates arachidonic acid metabolism, a pathway that is significantly activated by the induction of the decidua microenvironment, to stimulate the synthesis of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and finally induce the differentiation of PMN-MDSCs. To summarize, decidua-derived IL6 facilitates the differentiation of PMN-MDSCs from neutrophils via the pSTAT3/FABP5/PGE2 pathway. Defects in the process may result in impaired differentiation and dysfunction of PMN-MDSCs in URPL. These findings enhance our understanding of the physiological mechanisms of immune tolerance in pregnancy and provide therapeutic options for URPL.

TI  - Effects of urbanization on spatial-temporal changes of cultivated land in Bohai Rim region
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Studying the internal relationship between urbanization process and cultivated land change can reveal the differential law of different urbanization processes and effectively protect cultivated land resources. Using the land-use change analysis method, this paper analyzed the quantity and quality change of cultivated land during the process of urbanization in the Bohai Rim region from 1990 to 2020 and explored its driving mechanism. The results show that the urbanization level in the Bohai Rim region increases by 31.06%, and 120 km(2) farmland will be occupied for every 1% increase in urbanization level. The level of urbanization is higher in Beijing and Tianjin, medium in Liaoning and Shandong, and lower in Hebei. The area of cultivated land decreased year by year, and the decrease in dry land was the largest, followed by paddy land. Hebei, Shandong, and Liaoning have a high contribution rate to the reduction in cultivated land around the Bohai Sea. Population urbanization, spatial urbanization, and other factors have a significant impact on the study area, while economic urbanization and life urbanization show different laws. It is suggested that the development of urbanization can be promoted in a timely and appropriate manner, and the harmonious development of urbanization can be promoted by optimizing the layout of land use and avoiding excessive occupation of cultivated land at the expense of food security and ecological environment.

M3  - Article
AB  - complete spatial coverage and strong relationships with Ta (e.g., elevation and land surface temperature). Therefore, Ta can be mapped using in situ Ta and satellite data. However, this method may have a large bias when estimating the extreme Ta. In this study, the error prediction and correction (EPC) method, incorporating Cubist machine learning algorithm, was proposed to improve the estimation of extreme Ta. The accuracy of the EPC method was compared with that of the widely used method in previous studies in east China from 2003 to 2012. The mean absolute errors (MAEs) of the estimated daily Ta using the EPC method ranged from 0.75-1.01 degrees C, which were 0.57-0.96 degrees C lower than that of the method in the literature. The biases of the estimated Ta obtained using the two methods were close to zero. However, the biases can be as high as 7.10 degrees C when Ta is extremely low and as low as -3.09 degrees C when Ta is extremely high. Compared with the method in the literature, the EPC method can reduce the MAE by 1.41 degrees C, root mean square error by 1.49 degrees C, and bias by 1.61 degrees C of the estimated extreme Ta. Additionally, the EPC method produced satisfactory accuracy (MAEs <0.9 degrees C) of the estimated heat and cold wave magnitudes. Finally, a 1 km resolution daily Ta map in east China from 2003 to 2012 was developed, which will be useful data in multiple research fields.

TI  - A simple water clarity-turbidity index for the Great Lakes
T2  - JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - There are a multitude of satellite-derived water clarity and turbidity indicators to support the decision making of environmental managers and policy makers. However, water quality dynamic ranges addressed by these indicators can differ significantly, subjecting non-expert users to potential pitfalls. Here we propose a satellite water clarity-turbidity index (CTI) as a simplified way to capture major changes in water clarity/turbidity across all water types in the Great Lakes. The CTI is defined to merge key information from three prerequisite variables derived from Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) measurements, namely, the Secchi disk depth, the particulate backscattering coefficient, and the nephelometric turbidity, which are suitable for clear, intermediate, and turbid waters, respectively. Application to the Great Lakes shows that with one parameter, the CTI can illustrate major spatial and temporal patterns that are not entirely visible with each of the three original indicators alone. Using the CTI, we identified significant decrease in water turbidity in Lakes Michigan and Huron from 2000 to 2005, during which daily variability of CTI in August initially spiked and then gradually decreased most likely owing to diminishing whiting events. The CTI is a convenient and holistic assessment tool for water quality management. (c) 2022 International Association for Great Lakes Research. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Effects of input data sources on species distribution model predictions across species with different distributional ranges
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim A major source of uncertainty in the application of species distribution models (SDMs) is related to input data quality. Citizen-collected species occurrence data are often used for fitting SDMs when data from standardized and expert-supported surveys are unavailable. Macroclimate variables are much more commonly used as predictors in SDMs than other sources coming from remote sensing data. Here, we assess the effects of using different data sources (in both response and predictor variables) on SDM performance across a wide range of species with contrasting distributional ranges. Location Iberian Peninsula. Taxon Birds. Methods A SDM ensemble-forecasting approach was implemented using bird data from two different data sources: the eBird project and Atlases. We fitted SDMs with three predictor types: macroclimate, remotely sensed ecosystem functional attributes (EFAs) and their combination. Species were grouped in four range size classes. We assessed the uncertainty of model predictions by different evaluation metrics. Generalized linear mixed-effects models tested the effect on model performance of input data source across distributional range sizes while accounting for different accuracy metrics. Pairwise comparisons between range projections were used to assess their spatial similarity. Results Data source, size class, predictor and accuracy metric showed significant effects on SDM performance. eBird-based models outperformed those built with Atlas data for less widespread species. Climate predictors yielded models with the best performance, especially when combined with EFAs. However, the predictor contribution was consistent across bird datasets, being mostly driven by the species range. Main Conclusions Our models demonstrated the usefulness and complementarity of different input data sources when modelling species distribution across different distributional ranges. These findings highlight the need to integrate different data sources to improve the model predictions at regional scale. Our framework also underlines that model uncertainty should be examined more exhaustively at early stages of the modelling process.

TI  - At the feet of storytellers: Implications for practicing early relational health conversations
T2  - INFANT MENTAL HEALTH JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - A family- and culturally-centered approach to conversations about early relational health (ERH) can open up opportunities for universal family engagement. The appraisal of family-baby relational health is more trustworthy and useful when there is attunement to family voice and facilitator bias. Early Relational Health Conversations (ERH-C) is a model for ERH promotion and intervention. This model has eight components: preparing and entering the ERH-C space, accessing strength and knowledge in a healing-centered space, pausing and co-creating, storytelling, witnessing, mutual reflection, affirming, and claiming their relationship narrative, and mutual insight. It is a paradigm shift in working with African American families and possibly other historically marginalized families who are also impacted by structural racism. The eight components are explained, and examples are given from the perspective of an Africentric worldview The importance of cultural humility, attuning to and honoring family culture is emphasized. Insights for implementation in primary care and other settings are provided. Healing-centered engagement practices embedded in ERH-C have the potential to move ERH work into the social justice arena. The ERH-C is a family reflection model. Ideas for future directions for ERH-C are discussed.

TI  - A kia ora, a wave and a smile: an urban marae-led response to COVID-19, a case study in manaakitanga
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background When COVID-19 emerged, there were well-founded fears that Maori (indigenous peoples of Aotearoa (New Zealand)) would be disproportionately affected, both in terms of morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 itself and through the impact of lock-down measures. A key way in which Kokiri (a Maori health provider) responded was through the establishment of a pataka kai (foodbank) that also provided a gateway to assess need and deliver other support services to whanau (in this case, client). Maori values were integral to this approach, with manaakitanga (kindness or providing care for others) at the heart of Kokiri's actions. We sought to identify how Kokiri operated under the mantle of manaakitanga, during Aotearoa's 2020 nationwide COVID-19 lockdown and to assess the impact of their contributions on Maori whanau. Methods We used qualitative methods underpinned by Maori research methodology. Twenty-six whanau interviews and two focus groups were held, one with eight kaimahi (workers) and the other with seven rangatahi (youth) kaimahi. Data was gathered between June and October 2020 (soon after the 2020 lockdown restrictions were lifted), thematically analysed and interpreted using a Maori worldview. Results Three key themes were identified that aligned to the values framework that forms the practice model that Kokiri kaimahi work within. Kaitiakitanga, whanau and manaakitanga are also long-standing Maori world values. We identified that kaitiakitanga (protecting) and manaakitanga (with kindness) - with whanau at the centre of all decisions and service delivery - worked as a protective mechanism to provide much needed support within the community Kokiri serves. Conclusions Maori health providers are well placed to respond effectively in a public-health crisis when resourced appropriately and trusted to deliver. We propose a number of recommendations based on the insights generated from the researchers, kaimahi, and whanau. These are that: Maori be included in pandemic planning and decision-making, Maori-led initiatives and organisations be valued and adequately resourced, and strong communities with strong networks be built during non-crisis times.

TI  - Monitoring the Impact of Rapid Urbanization on Land Surface Temperature and Assessment of Surface Urban Heat Island Using Landsat in Megacity (Lahore) of Pakistan
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study focused on rapid urbanization due to the change in the existing landforms which has caused substantial adverse impacts on Urban Thermal Environment. In the present study, we have acquired the Landsat data (TM and OLI) for the years 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020 to observe the land use changes (vegetation cover, built up land, barren land, and water) in Lahore using the supervised image classification method. Later, the impact of urbanization has been examined with Land Surface Temperature (LST) and eventually the Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI) has been calculated. Accuracy of the classified images revealed an overall accuracy (Kappa co-efficient) of 95.3% (0.929%), 92.05% (0.870%), 89.7% (0.891%), and 85.8% (0.915%) for the years 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020, respectively. It was found that vegetation cover decreased from 60.5% in 1990 to 47.7% in 2020 at the cost of urbanization. The overall built-up land increased by 23.52% from 1990 to 2020. Urbanization has influenced the LST, and it was examined that maximum LST consistently increased with increase in built-up land. The difference between urban and rural buffer reveals that SUHI has also been increasing over the years. SUHI has been raised from 1.72 C in 1990 to 2.41 C in 2020, and about 0.69 C relative change has been observed. It has also been observed that the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and LST have an inverse relationship. The research outcomes of this study are useful for urban climatologists, urban planners, architects, and policymakers to devise climate resilient policies, structure, and decisions to balance the urban green spaces for a healthy urban environment.

TI  - SyntEO: Synthetic dataset generation for earth observation and deep learning - Demonstrated for offshore wind farm detection
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the emergence of deep learning in the last years, new opportunities arose in Earth observation research. Nevertheless, they also brought with them new challenges. The data-hungry training processes of deep learning models demand large, resource expensive, annotated datasets and partly replaced knowledge-driven approaches so that model behaviour and the final prediction process became a black box. The proposed SyntEO approach enables Earth observation researchers to automatically generate large deep learning ready datasets by merging existing and procedural data. SyntEO does this by including expert knowledge in the data generation process in a highly structured manner to control the automatic image and label generation by employing an ontology. In this way, fully controllable experiment environments are set up, which support insights in the model training on the synthetic datasets. Thus, SyntEO makes the learning process approachable, which is an important cornerstone for explainable machine learning. We demonstrate the SyntEO approach by predicting offshore wind farms in Sentinel-1 images on two of the worlds largest offshore wind energy production sites. The largest generated dataset has 90,000 training examples. A basic convolutional neural network for object detection, that is only trained on this synthetic data, confidently detects offshore wind farms by minimising false detections in challenging environments. In addition, four sequential datasets are generated, demonstrating how the SyntEO approach can precisely define the dataset structure and influence the training process. SyntEO is thus a hybrid approach that creates an interface between expert knowledge and data-driven image analysis.

T2  - CAMBRIDGE ARCHAEOLOGICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Here I evaluate Andean concepts understood from the Quechua and Aymara languages to test their applicability to Moche archaeology-a region where the languages once spoken are now extinct. By focusing on geographical features common to the highlands and the coast (mountains and rivers) and archaeological evidence, I look at broad patterns of Moche material culture and consider how these relate to canal-fed irrigation systems, ceramic spatial patterning and fractaline socio-political organization documented in the colonial-era Chicama Valley. I then present a case study from Licapa II in the Chicama Valley to show that the physical components of the site's layout and the spatial patterns of artifact distribution relate to temporal and socio-political divisions that have their roots in long-standing ideas in Andean thought. Overall, this study shows that through careful evaluation some Quechua and Aymara concepts, namely tinku-or two parts coming together to make a whole-is relevant to the Moche worldview. This concept is manifest through canals uniting and dividing physical space, both sociopolitically and temporally. Liquids running through the canals ensure the well-being and energetic flow of Moche society.

TI  - Towards a global seasonal and permanent reference water product from Sentinel-1/2 data for improved flood mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based flood mapping has become an important part of disaster response. In order to accurately distinguish flood inundation from normally present conditions, up-to-date, high-resolution information on the seasonal water cover is crucial. This information is usually neglected in disaster management, which may result in a non-reliable representation of the flood extent, mainly in regions with highly dynamic hydrological conditions. In this study, we present a fully automated method to generate a global reference water product specifically designed for the use in global flood mapping applications based on high resolution Earth Observation data. The proposed methodology combines existing processing pipelines for flood detection based on Sentinel-1/ 2 data and aggregates permanent as well as seasonal water masks over an adjustable reference time period. The water masks are primarily based on the analysis of Sentinel-2 data and are complemented by Sentinel-1-based information in optical data scarce regions. First results are demonstrated in five selected study areas (Australia, Germany, India, Mozambique, and Sudan), distributed across different climate zones and are systematically compared with external products. Further, the proposed product is exemplary applied to three real flood events in order to evaluate the impact of the used reference water mask on the derived flood extent. Results show, that it is possible to generate a consistent reference water product at 10-20 m spatial resolution, that is more suitable for the use in rapid disaster response than previous masks. The proposed multi-sensor approach is capable of producing reasonable results, even if only few or no information from optical data is available. Further it becomes clear, that the consideration of seasonality of water bodies, especially in regions with highly dynamic hydrological and climatic conditions, reduces potential over-estimation of the inundation extent and gives a more reliable picture on flood affected areas.

TI  - Assessing representation of remote sensing derived forest structure and land cover across a network of protected areas
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Protected areas (PA) are an effective means of conserving biodiversity and protecting suites of valuable ecosystem services. Currently, many nations and international governments use proportional area protected as a critical metric for assessing progress towards biodiversity conservation. However, the areal and other common metrics do not assess the effectiveness of PA networks, nor do they assess how representative PA are of the ecosystems they aim to protect. Topography, stand structure, and land cover are all key drivers of biodiversity within forest environments, and are well-suited as indicators to assess the representation of PA. Here, we examine the PA network in British Columbia, Canada, through drivers derived from freely-available data and remote sensing products across the provincial biogeoclimatic ecosystem classification system. We examine biases in the PA network by elevation, forest disturbances, and forest structural attributes, including height, cover, and biomass by comparing a random sample of protected and unprotected pixels. Results indicate that PA are commonly biased towards high-elevation and alpine land covers, and that forest structural attributes of the park network are often significantly different in protected versus unprotected areas (426 out of 496 forest structural attributes found to be different; p < 0.01). Analysis of forest structural attributes suggests that establishing additional PA could ensure representation of various forest structure regimes across British Columbia's ecosystems. We conclude that these approaches using free and open remote sensing data are highly transferable and can be accomplished using consistent datasets to assess PA representations globally.

TI  - Meandering rivers' morphological changes analysis and prediction - a case study of Barak river, Assam
T2  - H2OPEN JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Morphological studies are vital for water resources management, riverbank development, and flood mitigation. In this study, the sinuosity index and bank erosion were used to detect and quantify morphological changes using Landsat data (1990-2020) in the Barak river, India. The morphological changes were investigated in protected areas to analyze the effectiveness of existing protective structures on bank migration, which helps formulate better riverbank restoration plans. Using monthly discharge data from two stream gauge stations, the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) models were developed. The extensive sediment transportation in the region necessitates studying both the river flow and morphological changes. The developed SARIMA model was used to predict river discharges up to 2025, being trained with data from 2006 to 2015. The validation of the model (2016-2018) shows that the mean absolute percentage error for discharge at two gauging stations is 29.78 and 23.52%, respectively. The analysis shows that the sinuosity index and bank erosion were inversely proportional. The SARIMA model showed that the future monthly discharge in the case study could be substantially higher than the observed series and affect river erosion simultaneously. This approach applies to many other meandering river management and identifies future morphological changes.

TI  - Sentinel-2 Cloud Mask Classification Using Deep Learning Method
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AERONAUTICAL AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission operated by the European Space Agency (ESA) provides comprehensive and continuous multi-spectral observations of all Earth's land surface since mid-2015. Clouds and cloud shadows significantly decrease the usability of optical satellite data especially in agricultural applications; therefore, an accurate and reliable cloud mask is mandatory for effective Earth Observation (EO) optical data exploitation. During the last years, image segmentation techniques have developed rapidly with the exploitation of neural networks capabilities. In this perspective, the KappaMask processor using U-Net architecture was developed with the ability to generate a classification mask over northern latitudes into the following classes: clear, cloud shadow, semi-transparent cloud (thin clouds), and cloud, invalid. For training, a Sentinel-2 dataset covering Northern European terrestrial area was labeled. KappaMask provides a 10 m classification mask for Sentinel-2 Level- 2A (L2A) and Level-1C (L1C) products. The total dice coefficient on the test dataset, which was not seen by the model at any stage, was 80% for KappaMask L2A and 76% for KappaMask L1C for 27 clear, cloud shadow, semi-transparent, cloud classes. Comparison with rule-based cloud mask 28 methods was then performed on the same test dataset, where Sen2Cor reached 59% dice coefficient 29 for clear, cloud shadow, semi-transparent, cloud classes, Fmask 61% for clear, cloud shadow, cloud 30 classes, and Maja 51% for clear and cloud classes. The closest machine learning open-source cloud classification mask, S2cloudless, has 63% dice coefficient providing only cloud and clear classes, while KappaMask L2A with a more complex classification schema outperformed S2cloudless by 17%.

TI  - Improving discrimination between clouds and optically thick aerosol plumes in geostationary satellite data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud masking is a key initial step in the retrieval of geophysical properties from satellite data. Despite decades of research, problems still exist of over- or underdetection of clouds. High aerosol loadings, in particular from dust storms or fires, are often classified as clouds, and vice versa. In this paper, we present a cloud mask created using machine learning for the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) aboard Himawari-8. In order to train the algorithm, a parallax-corrected collocated data set was created from AHI and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) lidar data. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) were trained on the collocated data to identify clouds in AHI scenes. The resulting neural network (NN) cloud masks are validated and compared to cloud masks produced by the Japanese Meteorological Association (JMA) and the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) for a number of different solar and viewing geometries, surface types and air masses. Here, five case studies covering a range of challenging scenarios for cloud masks are also presented to demonstrate the performance of the masking algorithm. The NN mask shows a lower false positive rate (FPR) for an equivalent true positive rate (TPR) across all categories, with FPRs of 0.160 and 0.259 for the NN and JMA masks, respectively, and 0.363 and 0.506 for the NN and BoM masks, respectively, at equivalent TPR values. This indicates the NN mask accurately identifies 1.13 and 1.29 times as many non-cloud pixels for the equivalent hit rate when compared to the JMA and BoM masks, respectively. The NN mask was shown to be particularly effective in distinguishing thick aerosol plumes from cloud, most likely due to the inclusion of the 0.47 and 0.51 mu m bands. The NN cloud mask shows an improvement over current operational cloud masks in most scenarios, and it is suggested that improvements to current operational cloud masks could be made by including the 0.47 and 0.51 mu m bands. The collocated data are made available to facilitate future research.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variability of pelagic<i> Sargassum</i> landings on the northern Mexican Caribbean
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The massive influx of pelagic Sargassum (sargasso) has produced environmental, socio-economic, and human health-related problems in several Atlantic countries in the last decade. Predicting sargasso landings to areas of interest is necessary to implement management actions. To date, quantitative assessments of beach-cast volumes are scarce, making it challenging to test prediction models based on remote sensing measurements and environmental variables. In this study, we analyze the variability in sargasso beach-cast accumulation in the northern Mexican Caribbean coast in 2018 and 2019 and its relationship with: (1) wind direction and speed, (2) sea surface temperature, and (3) sargasso biomass measured with MODIS in the southwestern Caribbean Sea and the Mexican Caribbean exclusive economic zone. We use data on the monthly volume of sargasso removed from the beach by seven hotels over a 40 km section of shoreline. The mean monthly volume per kilometer of shoreline was higher in 2018 (1852 m3), but that of 2019 was also significant (1773 m3). Landing patterns were variable, with the peak months differing among sites within years and years within sites. High-volume stranding lasted seven months in 2018 and five in 2019. In both years, high beaching occurred during the summer when the wind direction was between 90 degrees and 180 degrees with wind speeds of 4-8 m s- 1. The mean volume in the record-breaking month of 2019 (May = 6565 m3 km-1) was more significant than the highest of 2018 (June = 3816 m3 km-1). MODIS data and landing volumes showed a similar seasonal pattern, but maximum satellite signals occurred at different months than those with maximum beaching. We found a significant (p < 0.05) but low correlation (Kendall tau <0.3) between the volume of sargasso washing ashore and in situ sea surface temperature (SST), and no meaningful relationship between SST measured by MODIS and (1) sargasso abundance measured by MODIS and (2) sargasso landing volumes. The information reported in this study can help to test forecasting models and is valuable for sargasso management and valorization.

TI  - A data-driven approach using the remotely sensed soil moisture product to identify water-demand in agricultural regions
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Effective agricultural water management requires accurate and timely identification of crop water stress at the farm scale for irrigation advisories or to allocate the optimal amount of water for irrigation. Various drought indices are being utilized to map the water-stressed locations/farms in agricultural regions. Most of these existing drought indices provide some degree of characterization of water stress but do not adequately provide spatially resolved high resolution (farm-scale) information for decision-making about irrigation advisories or water allocation. These existing drought indices need modeling and climatology information, hence making them data-intensive and complex to compute. Therefore, a reliable, simple, and computationally easy method without modeling to characterize the water stress at high-resolution is essential for the operational mapping of water-stressed farms in agricultural regions. The proposed new approach facilitates improved and quick decision-making without compromising much of the skills imparted by the established drought indices. This study aims to formulate a water-demand index (WDI) based on a parameter independent data-driven approach using readily available remote sensing observations and weather data. We hypothesize that the WDI for an agricultural domain can be characterized by soil moisture, vegetative growth (NDVI), and heat unit (growing degree day, GDD). To this end, we used remote sensing-based soil moisture and NDVI and modeled ambient temperature datasets to generate weekly WDI maps at 1 km. The proposed methodology is verified over a few intensively irrigated agricultural-dominated areas with different climatic conditions. Our results suggest that the proposed approach characterizes water-stressed fields through WDI maps with good spatial representativeness. Overall, this study provides a framework to generate weekly WDI maps quickly with readily available measurements. These water-demand maps will help water resource managers to reduce dependence on established drought indices and prioritize the specific regions/fields with high water demand for optimum water allocations to improve crop health and ultimately maximize water-use efficiency.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Analysis and Modeling of Sea Ice Growth Rate in Nella Fjord, Antarctica: Based on Observations During the 36th Chinese National Antarctic Research Expedition in 2020
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Obtaining field sea ice data is crucial for the validation and improvement of satellite data and numerical models. During the 36th Chinese National Antarctic Research Expedition, seven field observations covering the whole area were conducted in Nella Fjord, and large amounts of in situ sea ice and snow thickness data were acquired. Then, the influences of snow cover, topography, and air temperature on the sea ice growth rate were examined. Based on the relationship between the sea ice growth rate and air temperature, an empirical model of sea ice thickness was developed. The results show that sea ice started to freeze in early March, and the peak growth rate was reached in mid-June, with a mean growth rate of 0.62 cm/d. Between mid-June and mid-October, the mean growth rate was 0.36-0.4 cm/d; between mid-October and mid-November, the mean growth rate decreased to 0.15 cm/d. After mid-November, ice growth stopped, and the ice thickness decreased. The growth rate and thickness of sea ice near the shore were generally greater than those closer to the center of the fjord, with differences of 0.25 cm/d in mean growth rate and 7.16 cm in mean thickness. Because of the large exchanges of heat between the atmosphere and the ocean, the sea ice thickness increased rapidly during the early stage of freeze-up. When the air temperature was between -12 and -15 degrees C, the ice growth rate was between 0.36 and 0.4 cm/d. However, when the ice thickness reached 0.5 m, the sea ice growth rate became less sensitive to air temperature. In addition, we found that the proposed model has high simulation accuracy for the growth rate of sea ice. Based on the model, we estimated that the growth rates become zero at an air temperature of approximately -4 degrees C. Our study highlights the inverse relationship between the sea ice growth rate and the snow thickness and the fact that the sea ice thickness is mainly affected by air temperature.

TI  - Regional scale analysis of land cover dynamics in Kerala over last two decades through MODIS data and statistical techniques
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES AND SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of climate change and the effect of rapid urbanisation in a region can be best identified by detecting land use and land cover changes. The present research attempts to statistically evaluate the land cover changes in the state of Kerala over two decades (2001-2019), using land cover derived by the supervised classification of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) datasets. Land cover classification, based on the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP), differentiated nine land cover types in the region such as forests (F), shrublands/scrublands (SL), savannas (S), croplands (CL), grasslands (GL), urban and built-up lands (UBL), cropland/natural vegetation mosaics (CLNVM), water body (WB) and other types (OT). Among the land cover types, savannas cover more than 41% of the total area, followed by forests (20%) and cropland/natural vegetation mosaics (14%). During the analysis period, forests, cropland/natural vegetation mosaics and built-up lands showed increases in their area coverage. Furthermore, the decadal (D1 and D2) analysis of land cover dynamics reveals that maximum spatial variation in area coverage of individual land cover occurred in the second decade, i.e. D2 (2011-2019). Accurate examination of the distribution of land cover types indicates the elevation dependant gradational land cover pattern in the study area. Trend statistics of land cover assessed through Mann-Kendall and linear regression analysis also showed similar results with a statistically significant increase in the area covered by forests, shrublands, urban and built-up lands and cropland/natural vegetation mosaics. In contrast, savannas and grasslands showed a significant decreasing trend. Together, the results indicate an increasing pattern of urbanisation and the development of cropland/natural vegetation mosaics, irrespective of elevation and land cover types point towards the degradation and fragmentation of strong and healthy vegetation cover in the region. Furthermore, the present research finding will help researchers and policy makers to concentrate on areas that showed maximum changes in land cover to derive accurate and sustainable environmental protection and development plans.

TI  - Transforming Perspectives Through Virtual Exchange: A US-Egypt Partnership Part 1
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - With more classrooms within higher education mobilizing strategies for internationalization, collaborative online international learning (COIL), also referred to as virtual exchange, is an effective approach at offering intercultural competence through experiential learning. This strategy provides students who face barriers to international travel the opportunity to engage with students from other countries in meaningful ways, while enhancing and reinforcing course content. Grounded in the transformative learning theory, this study evaluates the effectiveness of a virtual exchange that was implemented within an undergraduate global public health course. The virtual exchange connected students from the University of Florida (within the US) with medical students in a microbiology course at Ain Shams University in Cairo, Egypt. Using adapted reflection prompts, we assessed the students' knowledge and learning before, during, and after the virtual exchange. This was coupled with a final paper to capture how personal backgrounds and experiences may contribute to their perception of the virtual exchange, as well as if they felt their global perspective had changed or shifted during the experience. Using directed content analysis for each of the measurements, two researchers coded the data independently to then present agreed upon salient themes to the larger group. Of the 28 randomly sampled students who participated in the virtual exchange, seven major themes emerged from the data: Connectedness; Openness; Acquisition of Knowledge and Skills; Communication; Cultural Identity; Anticipation of Options for New Roles, Relationships, and Actions; and Absence of Change. Through this evaluation it was clear there was a variance of different perspectives with many sampled students having diverse lived experiences that influenced their worldview prior to the virtual exchange. Despite course-related barriers, students acknowledged several facilitating factors that improved their intercultural competence and knowledge of course content. The integration of a virtual exchange within the classroom, with careful design and implementation, can provide a unique experience for students and an inclusive approach to learning.

TI  - Assessing evapotranspiration observed from ECOSTRESS using flux measurements in agroecosystems
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop water use (also know as evapotranspiraton, ET) monitoring is vital for agricultural management under the threat of water scarcity and global warming, as well as the pressure of increasing food demand. The ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) has provided valuable high resolution ET estimates since its launch in 2018. Yet, evaluation of its capability in monitoring ET in the agricultural field is lacking, as well as the intercomparison of the two ECOSTRESS ET products calculated through different algorithms (PT-JPL vs. DisALEXI). This study focused on the agroecosystems and compared the ECOSTRESS ET to eddy covariance observations at 15 cropland flux sites in North America from July 2018 to December 2020. It is found that PT-JPL captured the diurnal pattern but tended to overestimate instantaneous ET in the morning. Besides, intercomparison of the magnitude, seasonal pattern and the dependency on crop phenology of ET from PT-JPL and DisALEXI revealed the higher fidelity of DisALEXI. The site-specific validations and visual comparisons with MODIS ET retrievals demonstrated the capability of PT-JPL and DisALEXI in identifying crop types and agricultural management practices to some extent. The heterogeneity of ET values in the small-scale agroecosystems highlights the importance of accurate representation of local conditions in the ET model.

TI  - Spatio-temporal evolution and driving factors of carbon storage in the Western Sichuan Plateau
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The carbon sequestration function of the ecosystem is one of the most important functions of ecosystem service, and it of great significance to study the spatio-temporal differentiation of carbon storage for promoting regional sustainable development. Ecosystems on the Western Sichuan Plateau are highly variable, but its spatio-temporal differentiation and driving factors are not yet clear. In this study, on the basis of land use monitoring data, meteorological and demographic data interpreted from Landsat remote sensing image, and through GIS analysis tools, the carbon storage module of InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs) model was used to estimate carbon storage and geodetector was used to detect the driving factors of carbon storage spatial differentiation. The results show that: (1) The carbon storage increased to 1.2455 x 10(10) t from 1.2438 x 10(10) t in the past 20 years, the ecosystem developed in a healthy way overall. (2) Carbon storage show High-High and Low-Low aggregation characteristics, but the area decreased by 1481.81 km(2) and 311.11 km(2) respectively, and the spatial cluster effect gradually weakened. (3) HAI is the leading factor causing the spatio-temporal differentiation of regional carbon storage, followed by temperature and NDVI; the interaction between factors significantly enhances the spatial differentiation of carbon storage, indicating that the change of carbon storage is the result of the joint action of natural and socioeconomic factors. The results of the study provide some theoretical basis for the development of differentiated ecological regulation models and strategies, and help to promote high-quality regional development.

TI  - Application and assessment of a downscaled GPM dataset in the simulation of snowmelt runoff in alpine mountainous areas
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Study region: the Jingou River basin (located in central Xinjiang, China). Study focus: Estimating snowmelt runoff in alpine areas lacking monitoring stations is essential for water resource management. The newly released global precipitation measurement (GPM) data provide a high-precision precipitation input data source for snowmelt runoff simulations in such areas. However, the resolution (10 km x 10 km) is still insufficient for small and medium watersheds, which reduces the application efficiency of the GPM dataset in runoff simulations. Therefore, the geographic weighted regression model (GWR) is used to downscale the GPM dataset and drive the snowmelt runoff model (SRM) in this study. New hydrological insights for the region: The results show that the average R-2 values of daily runoff simulated by observed precipitation data and the downscaled GPM dataset (1 km x 1 km) are 0.869 and 0.847, respectively, and the average Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) values are 0.795 and 0.715, respectively. The accuracy of the runoff data simulated by the downscaled GPM dataset is 2.5% lower than that simulated based on the observed data, and good results are obtained. This study shows that the downscaled GPM dataset can be regarded as an effective alternative product in areas lacking observed data. The GPM dataset has good application prospects as substitute data in mountainous areas, and the GPM dataset resolves the precipitation data scarcity in high-elevation mountainous areas without stations and provides a rare data source for modeling.

TI  - Spatiotemporal characterization of agricultural drought in the Sahel region using a composite drought index
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - A composite drought index (CDI) was developed for seasonal drought monitoring at 1 km2 resolution over the West African Sahel (WAS). The CDI was derived from remote sensing data, mainly, the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) from the Terra/MODIS satellite. The weights of these input variables were estimated using a combined entropy method and weighted Euclidian distance. The CHIRPS resulted with the highest weight (mean = 0.74) followed by the NDVI (mean = 0.243) and the LST (mean = 0.016). The CDI was found to be well correlated with the standardized precipitation index (SPI) and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI)-computed from station data. However, the CDI showed a better sensitivity for drought detection following a comparison of drought classes. The suitability of the CDI for agricultural drought monitoring was validated by its good correlation with crop production data, namely maize, millet and sorghum with a Pearson r in the range of 0.29-0.56, 0.40-0.81 and 0.57-0.71, respectively. Finally, a drought database was generated for the WAS, enabling the extraction of drought characteristics at a given location using its geographic coordinates.

TI  - Detecting and Assessing the Spatio-Temporal Land Use Land Cover Changes of Bahrain Island During 1986-2020 Using Remote Sensing and GIS
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Kingdom of Bahrain has experienced accelerated development growth since the 1980s. These rapid land demands increased the pressure on the country area to rebuild urban centers and cities surrounding the coast. The purpose of this research is to detect and investigate changes in land use and land cover (LULC), which is one of the most critical aspects of planning and managing the use of land as a natural resource. The massive growth in land demand, particularly in small-area countries like Bahrain, forces decision-makers to re-plan the main island areas (Bahrain, Muharraq, Sitra, and Nabih Saleh). The study focuses on mapping the LULC changes detection over 1986-2020. It employs an integrated approach of remote sensing and GIS (Geographic Information System) to analyze and evaluate the changes in the LULC area in the main islands using multi-temporal and multispectral Landsat satellite imagery acquired in 1986, 1994, 2000, 2005, 2013, and 2020. In addition, high-resolution satellite images of different dates IKONOS 2000, GeoEye1 2011, 2013, Worldview3 2019, ASTER 2012, 2013, and multiresolution seamless image database-MrSID 1994, 1998 were used to enhance the LULC classification. Furthermore, different ancillary data were utilized to adjust the decision of LULC classes. The images were supervised using Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) algorithms to generate the seven LULC maps. The seven-raster classification maps revealed overall accuracies exceeding 85%, and overall Kappa statistics range between 87 and 95%. The results indicate that the increment in the built-up area was dominant over the last 3 decades.

AB  - This article presents the comparative analysis of classification techniques to assign land use and land cover classes from different strategies (pixel-based, object-based, rule-based, distance-based, and neural-based) with a Sentinel-2A satellite image for 2016. The study area is the Sana'a city of Yemen which covers about 18,796.88 km(2) land area. This research aims to present the fundamentals of supervised machine learning approaches, including their limitations and strengths and experimentation for twelve classifiers. The outcome of experimentation showed that the Random Forest could be a good choice as a classifier for object-based strategy. In contrast, DTC and SVM were efficient in rule-based and pixel-based strategies. Results also showed that the highest accuracy was with object-based strategy, followed by rule-based and then pixel-based and distance-based strategies.

TI  - Estimation of Atmospheric PM<sub>10</sub> Concentration in China Using an Interpretable Deep Learning Model and Top-of-the-Atmosphere Reflectance Data From China's New Generation Geostationary Meteorological Satellite, FY-4A
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid urbanization in China and the long-range transport dust (LRTD) from arid and semi-arid areas has resulted in an increase of PM10 concentration. In this study, an interpretable deep learning model [deep forest (DF)] with FY-4A top-of-the-atmosphere reflectance (TOAR) data were used to obtain the hourly PM10 in China. The optimal hourly average R-2 of 10-fold cross validation can achieve 0.85 (13:00 Beijing time); The R-2 (RMSE, mu g/m(3)) of the daily, monthly, and annual averages were 0.82 (24.16), 0.97 (6.53), and 0.99 (2.30), respectively. Using TOAR data, the DF model performed better than other machine learning models. The feature importance of the TOAR-PM10 model showed that TOAR and meteorological elements both contributed significantly to the model. In spring, the PM10 in northern China was greater than that in southern China, which may be related to the LRTD. Excluding the dust weather periods, the areas with high PM10 values in China were mainly in cities and their suburbs, where were correlated with human activities. During a dust weather process, LRTD increased PM10 in northern China by 80.4%. During a mixture haze and dust weather process, the PM10 increased by 130.2% in northern China, of which LRTD led to an increase of 73.7%. The sources (from the Taklimakan Desert in China) and transmission paths of these two LRTD processes were similar. The contribution of LRTD to PM10 was related to dust intensity and meteorological conditions. The results showed that LRTD and local pollution to PM10 was both important in haze periods.

TI  - Cooling island effect of urban lakes in hot waves under foehn and climate change
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The central region of Vietnam has a tropical monsoon climate but often undergoes heat waves due to uncontrolled urbanization, foehn winds, and climate change. Water bodies are considered effective candidates for heat mitigation in cities through the water cooling island (WCI) effect. Quantifying the WCI capacity of water areas and related factors is necessary for sites with advantages of surface water. The current attempt used the WCI effect range (L-max), temperature drop amplitude (Delta T-max), and temperature gradient (Gtemp) to investigate the cooling effect of 20 lakes in the Thanh Noi region, Hue City. Data derived from high-resolution Google Earth, Landsat-8 Satellite Imagery Data, and ground truth. The results show that the average water temperature of the 20 studied lakes was about 36.61 degrees C, lower than the average temperature in the area with an urban heat island (UHI) of about 2.82 degrees C. The mean L-max was 150 m, Delta T-max was 1.52 degrees C, and Gtemp was 10.16 degrees C /km or 0.01 degrees C/m. Climate characteristics and human impacts had reduced the ability of the lakes to create WCI during the period when the lake water level was low. The factors that influenced the WCI significantly were the landscape shape index (LSI), the proportion of green (PG), and the percentage of impervious surfaces (PI). Most lakes with relatively simple LSI, high PG, and low PI obtained high WCI, suggesting that structural and landscape characteristics played a critical role in urban cooling.

TI  - Multi-decadal land cover change analysis over Sundarbans Mangrove Forest of Bangladesh: A GIS and remote sensing based approach
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Both natural processes and anthropogenic actions alter land use and land cover but the impact of anthropogenic actions has dramatically increased since the last century in many regions of the world. This study attempts to investigate the land cover change of the Sundarbans and surrounding areas of Bangladesh in the last forty years by analyzing Landsat images. Sundarbans, having the richest and exceptional biodiversity, is the largest remaining tract of mangrove forest on earth facing multidimensional threats of degradation. Time series Landsat satellite images collected for five years are 1980 (MSS), 1990 (TM), 2000 (TM), 2010 (TM) and 2020 (OLI). By analyzing, comparing and visualizing the classified images using ArcMap 10.5 software the historical trend of land cover change of the study area is exhibited. The result revealed that a large amount of non-vegetated areas located outside of Sundarbans mangrove forest converted into water bodies due to shrimp cultivation. During this long time, the Sundarbans mangrove forest area remained unchanged except for little change occurred by soil erosion along the river bank and coastline. Kappa coefficient revealed the accuracy of the land cover map with a coefficient value of 0.88, 0.92, 0.90, 0.93 and 0.92 for 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020 images respectively. This research will support policymakers and the forest department to improve management policy. Also, influence researchers to conduct case-specific micro-scale research in the region.

AB  - Early prediction of crop yield before harvest is essential in agriculture for taking various policy decisions related to crop production to ensure food availability. Traditional approaches are based on expensive survey data that are not scalable, and results are usually available after harvest only. Techniques based on climatic indices and soil information are expensive to collect and not available for all locations. Remote sensing data archives are available free of cost and can be used with historical crop yield data for building forecasting systems. Until recently, techniques based on crop simulation models and machine learning approaches used derived indices from remote sensing satellites, discarding many spectral bands that carry prominent information. Recent studies have used deep learning models with feature engineered remote sensing data. This study used multiple feature engineering techniques to reduce the input imagery dimension and proposed an ensemble model based on LSTM and Convolutional LSTM to predict soybean and rice yield. Results show that the proposed model shows comparable performance to existing approaches with fewer parameters.Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Mathematical modelling of the mosquito<i> Aedes</i><i> polynesiensis</i> in a heterogeneous environment
T2  - MATHEMATICAL BIOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The mosquito Aedes polynesiensis inhabits Pacific islands and territories and transmits arboviruses and parasites. In the context of rapid environmental change, understanding the effects of environmental heterogeneity on mosquitoes is crucial.Methods: First, empirical field data and remote sensing data were combined to model spatial heterogeneity in the environmental suitability for Ae. polynesiensis. Second, a model of mosquito population dynamics was applied to predict mosquito distributions over a heterogeneous landscape assuming different dispersal behaviours. Motu Tautau, French Polynesia, was used as a case study of the utility of this methodological approach. Ae. polynesiensis use land crab Cardisoma carnifex burrows for oviposition in French Polynesia; environmental suitability was therefore quantified using C. carnifex burrow density.Results: Micro-regions with large Ae. polynesiensis populations facilitated by high C. carnifex burrow density were accurately captured by our methodology. Preferential dispersal towards oviposition sites promoted larger population sizes than non-preferential dispersal but did not offer greater resilience to environmental change. Reduced environmental suitability for Ae. polynesiensis resulted in spatially non-linear effects upon the mosquito distribution.Conclusions: Environmental change has complex spatial effects upon mosquito populations. Mosquito control strategies must carefully balance spatial effects with net effects.

TI  - Implementing night light data as auxiliary variable of small area estimation
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Along with the growing popularity of the small area estimation method, the need to utilize good auxiliary variables also increases. Remote sensing data, such as night light imagery, offers advantages such as time-cost efficiency and global coverage but is easily accessible. This research aims to implement night light intensity as an auxiliary variable for the EBLUP model to estimate per capita consumption expenditure at West Java in 2018. This research employs three scenarios of auxiliary variables usage in EBLUP model construction: official data, night light intensity, and the combination between both data. The results show that night light intensity is an efficient auxiliary variable for estimating per capita consumption expenditure. Furthermore, the EBLUP model with a combination of official data and night light as auxiliary variables gives the best accuracy with coefficient of variation (CV) as evaluation.

TI  - Impact of land use and climate change on forest reserves in Ghana
T2  - AFRICAN GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Using supervised classified Landsat 7 images ETM - 2000 and 2010 and Landsat 8 images - 2020, this study examines the various Land Use Land Cover Changes (LULCC) in the Bosomkese forest reserve in Ghana. The study recorded significant changes in all the various forest covers driven predominately by illegal logging, bushfires, illegal farming, and agricultural expansion projects within the reserve. These results suggest that there is a need for stringent punishment for culprits involved in forest illegalities, capacity-building interventions and participatory forest management by the Forestry Commission, environmental management institutions, and forest fringe communities to protect the forest reserve.

M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Gender service utilisation according to ethnicity is largely under-researched. The present research looked at demographics and service user-engagement according to ethnicity of young people accessing a gender service for children.Method: A total of 2063 (M = 14.19 years, SD = 2.59, assigned male = 556, 1495 assigned female = 1495, no-specification=12) referrals were included in the analysis. Self-defined ethnicity in financial years (FY) 2016-2017, 2018-2019, and referrer-defined ethnicity in FY 2020-2021 were compared between years, to the national UK-population, and child and adolescent mental health service (CAMHS) averages. Numbers of offered, attended and non-attended appointments were compared across the White and the ethnic minority population (EMP).Results: Across years 93.35% young people identified as White (higher than the CAMHS and national population averages); 6.65% as EMP. Service utilisation was similar in FY 2016-2017. In FY 2018-2019, the EMP subgroup was offered and attended more appointments compared to the White subgroup, 'did not attended' average was similar.Conclusions: The majority of young people self-identified with a White ethnic-background. Service engagement was comparable between the EMP and White ethnicity subgroups in 2016-2017, while the EMP group was offered and attended more appointments in 2018-2019. Due to the low EMP group numbers, findings need to be interpreted with caution.

TI  - Wastewater based epidemiology as a silent sentinel of the trend of SARS-CoV-2 circulation in the community in central Argentina
T2  - WATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring wastewater for the traces of viruses allows effective surveillance of entire communities, including symptomatic and asymptomatic infected individuals, providing information on whether a specific pathogen is circulating in a population. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, 261 wastewater samples from six communities of the province of C acute accent ordoba, Argentina were analyzed. From mid-May 2020 to the end of August 2021, raw sewage samples were collected from the central network pipe that enters into the Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTP) in C acute accent ordoba city and five communities in the Punilla Valley. SARS-CoV-2 was concentrated by using the polyethylene glycol-6000 precipitation method. Viral genomes were extracted from concentrated samples, and N-and E-SARS-CoV-2 genes were detected by using real time RT-PCR. Wastewater samples that resulted positive for SARS-CoV-2 genome detection were subjected to viral variants of concern (VOCs) identification by real time RT-PCR. Overall, just by using the identification of the N gene or E gene, the rates of viral genome detection were 43.4% (86/198) and 51.5% (102/198) respectively, and by using both methodologies (positivity criterion: detection of N and / or E gene), the detection rate was 71.2% (141/198). Thereby, the optimal strategy to study the SARS-CoV-2 genome in wastewater would be the use of the combined detection of both genes. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 variants in wastewater reflected their circulation in the community, showing no VOCs detection in the first COVID-19 wave and their co-circulation with Gamma, Alpha and Delta VOCs during 2021. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 Wastewater Based Epidemiology (WBE) described the introduction, permanence and/or the co-circulation of viral variants in the community. In geographical areas with a stable population, SARS-CoV-2 WBE could be used as an early warning sign of new COVID-19 cases, whereas in localities with a low number of inhabitants and high tourist influx, WBE may only be useful to reflect the circulation of the virus in the community. Overall, the monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater can become a silent sentinel of the trend of viral circulation in the community, providing supplementary information for clinical surveillance to support public health measures.

TI  - DELAY OF GERMINATION I (<i>DOG I</i>) regulates dormancy in dimorphic seeds of <i>Xanthium strumarium</i>
T2  - FUNCTIONAL PLANT BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Seed dormancy ensures plant survival but many mechanisms remain unclear. A high-throughput RNA-seq analysis investigated the mechanisms involved in the establishment of dormancy in dimorphic seeds of Xanthium strumarium (L.) developing in one single burr. Results showed that DOGI, the main dormancy gene in Arabidopsis thaliana L., was over-represented in the dormant seed leading to the formation of two seeds with different cell wall properties. Less expression of DME/EMB1649, UBP26, EMF2, MOM, SNL2, and AGO4 in the non-dormant seed was observed, which function in the chromatin remodelling of dormancy-associated genes through DNA methylation. However, higher levels of ATXR7/SDG2S, ELF6, and JMJI6/PKDM7D in the non-dormant seed that act at the level of histone demethylation and activate germination were found. Dramatically lower expression in the splicing factors SUA, PWI, and FY in non-dormant seed may indicate that variation in RNA splicing for ABA sensitivity and transcriptional elongation control of DOGI is of importance for inducing seed dormancy. Seed size and germination may be influenced by respiratory factors, and alterations in ABA content and auxin distribution and responses. TOR (a serine/threonine-protein kinase) is likely at the centre of a regulatory hub controlling seed metabolism, maturation, and germination. Over-representation of the respiration-associated genes (ACO3, PEPC3, and D2HGDH) was detected in non-dormant seed, suggesting differential energy supplies in the two seeds. Degradation of ABA biosynthesis and/or proper auxin signalling in the large seed may control germinability, and suppression of endoreduplication in the small seed may be a mechanism for cell differentiation and cell size determination.

TI  - A sentinel-2-based triangular vegetation index for chlorophyll content estimation
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of chlorophyll content is important for diagnosing the physiological and phenological status of vegetation. Establishing the relationship between vegetation indices (VIs) and leaf chlorophyll content using remote sensing is crucial for large-scale earth observation. However, existing VIs for estimating chlorophyll content generally suffer from the saturation effect or depend on specific scenarios, resulting in insufficient estimation accuracy. Based on the physical mechanism of light-vegetation interaction, this study innovatively proposes the absorption triangle and reflectance triangle in the spectral space to construct the chlorophyll sensitive Sentinel-2 Triangular Vegetation Index (STVI). The STVI uses the Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument (MSI) bands to improve the accuracy of chlorophyll content retrieval by enhancing the relationship with the chlorophyll content and mitigating the saturation effect. Simulated data, measured data, and open data sets were used to test the accuracy and stability of the STVI and 11 classical VIs for retrieving the chlorophyll content using different spectral data types, different winter wheat growth stages, and different vegetation coverages. The results showed that the STVI was more sensitive to the chlorophyll content than the classical VIs and provided the best goodness-of-fit in multiple scenarios. The STVI represents a powerful tool for large-extent chlorophyll content retrieval and a novel approach for scientific research in related fields.

TI  - Evaluation of Temporal and Spatial Changes in Ecological Environmental Quality on Jianghan Plain From 1990 to 2021
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Located in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, Jianghan Plain is an important part of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River Plain, and together with Dongting Lake Plain, it is known as the Two-Lake Plain. It is a well-developed agricultural area and is an important source of grain in China, as well as one of the major cotton-producing areas, and aquaculture is also an important local industry. With the rapid development of urbanization in China, the impact of human activities on the ecological environment of Jianghan Plain has become increasingly obvious in recent years, and how to timely and objectively assess spatial and temporal changes in ecological environmental quality is of great practical significance for the sustainable development of the region and the construction of an ecological civilization. The Google Earth Engine platform was used to optimize the reconstruction of Landsat TM/OLI images of Jianghan Plain from 1990 to 2021, coupled with four indicators of the natural ecological environment such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, WET, Normalized Difference Soil Index, and Land Surface Temperature to construct the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) and evaluate the spatial and temporal changes in ecological environmental quality on Jianghan Plain. The results showed that the mean RSEI values in 1990, 1998, 2006, 2014, and 2021 were 0.667, 0.636, 0.599, 0.621, and 0.648, respectively, indicating that the overall ecological environmental quality of Jianghan Plain showed a decreasing trend from 1990 to 2006 and an increasing trend from 2006 to 2021. Degradation was most serious from 1990 to 1998, accounting for 44.86% of the total area, and improvement was most obvious from 2006 to 2014, accounting for 26.64% of the total area. Moran's I values from 1990 to 2021 were 0.531, 0.529, 0.525, 0.540, and 0.545, respectively, indicating that the spatial distribution of ecological environmental quality was positively correlated. The local spatial clustering of the RSEI local indicators of spatial association showed that H-H clustering areas on Jianghan Plain were mainly distributed in the northern and western regions, and L-L clustering areas were mainly distributed in the densely populated eastern regions with frequent human activities. The results can provide a theoretical basis for ecological environmental protection and improvement on Jianghan Plain.

TI  - George Orwell, objectivity, and the reality behind illusions
T2  - PERCEPTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Illusions are commonly defined as departures of our percepts from the veridical representation of objective, common-sense reality. However, it has been claimed recently that this definition lacks validity, for example, on the grounds that external reality cannot possibly be represented truly by our sensory systems, and indeed may even be a fiction. Here, I first demonstrate how novelist George Orwell warned that such denials of objective reality are dangerous mistakes, in that they can lead to the suppression and even the atrophy of independent thought and critical evaluation. Second, anti-realists assume their opponents hold a fully reductionist metaphysics, in which fundamental physics describes the only ground truth, thereby placing it beyond direct human sensory observation. In contrast, I point to a more recent and commonly used alternative, non-reductive metaphysics. This ascribes real existence to many levels of dynamic systems of information, emerging progressively from the subatomic to the biological, psychological, social, and ecological. Within such a worldview the notion of objective reality is valid, it comes in part within the range of our senses, and thus a definition of illusions as kinds of deviations from veridical perception becomes possible again.

TI  - Upper Midwest tribal natural resource managers' perspectives on chronic wasting disease outreach, surveillance, and management
T2  - CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Management strategies for chronic wasting disease (CWD) across tribal lands have varied in response to changing dynamics of CWD risk. As CWD continues to spread across the United States, concerns associated with the disease are increasing. We interviewed 19 natural resource managers representing Anishinaabe and Dakota tribes in Minnesota, Michigan, and Wisconsin with goals of understanding needs and opportunities for CWD engagement, surveillance, and outreach on tribal lands; the implementation of natural resources policy and management across tribal nations; and opportunities for tribal partnership-development to control CWD. Qualitative data analyses of interview responses revealed substantial variation in the number of tribal hunters, hunter regulation, and huntable tribal lands across our study area. Proximity of tribal lands in relation to CWD detections impacted tribal agency management strategies for CWD. Our results indicate a desire for CWD outreach and surveillance, mutually beneficial collaborations, and a need for incorporating cultural knowledge into CWD management strategies. We conclude that tribal CWD management and surveillance plans will be enhanced through strategic and thoughtful CWD outreach methods. Moreover, partnerships must recognize tribal sovereignty and respectfully integrate tribal values, knowledge, and worldview.

TI  - Mass fire behavior created by extensive tree mortality and high tree density not predicted by operational fire behavior models in the southern Sierra Nevada
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Large, severe wildfires continue to burn in frequent-fire adapted forests but the mechanisms that contribute to them and their predictability are important questions. Using a combination of ground based and remotely sensed data we analyzed the behavior and patterns of the 2020 Creek Fire where drought and bark beetles had previously created substantial levels of tree mortality in the southern Sierra Nevada. We found that dead biomass and live tree densities were the most important variables predicting fire severity; high severity fire encompassed 41% of the area and the largest high severity patch (19,592 ha) comprised 13% of total area burned. Areas with the highest amounts of dead biomass and live tree densities were also positively related to high severity fire patch size indicating that larger, more homogenous conditions of this forest characteristic resulted in adverse, landscape-scale fire effects. The first two days of the Creek Fire were abnormally hot and dry but weather during the days of the greatest fire growth was largely within the normal range of variation for that time of year with one day with lower windspeeds. From September 5 to 8th the fire burned almost 50% of its entire area and fire intensity patterns inferred from remotely sensed brightness-temperature data were typical except on September 6th when heat increased towards the interior of the fire. Not only was the greatest heat concentrated away from the fire perimeter, but a significant amount of heat was still being generated within the fire perimeter from the previous day. This is a classic pattern for a mass fire and the high amount of dead biomass created from the drought and bark beetles along with high live tree densities were critical factors in developing mass fire behavior. Operational fire behavior models were not able to predict this behavior largely because they do not include postfrontal combustion and fire-atmosphere interactions. An important question regarding this mass fire is if the tree mortality event that preceded it could have been avoided or reduced or was it within the natural range of variation for these forests? We found that the mortality episode was outside of historical analogs and was exacerbated by past management decisions. The Creek Fire shows us how vulnerable of our current frequent-fire forest conditions are to suffering high tree mortality and offering fuel conditions capable of generating mass fires from which future forest recovery is questionable because of type conversion and probable reoccurring high severity fire.

TI  - Summer marine heatwaves in the South China Sea: Trend, variability and possible causes
T2  - ADVANCES IN CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine heatwaves (MHWs) have been frequently observed worldwide, causing devastating impacts on marine organisms and ecosystems, but the trend of MHWs is still unclear in the South China Sea (SCS). Here, the long-term trend and inter-annual variability of the summer SCS MHW events are investigated based on the high-resolution daily satellite data. The results revealed remarkable increases in the duration, intensity, coverage, and severity during 1982-2019, indicating that the SCS MHW events have become more frequent, intense, extensive, and serious. The probability ratio of SCS MHW events is four times during the 2010s of that during the 1980s. The increasing trend can be largely attributed to the long-term increase in the mean SCS temperature. The inter-annual variability of the SCS MHWs is linked closely to the El Nino and Southern Oscillation, with more/less MHW events occurring during the following summer after the El Nino/La Nina events. A diagnosis of synoptic-scale heat budget suggests that the extreme SCS warming can be explained by the combined effects of positive surface heat flux largely due to the enhanced shortwave radiation and convergence of oceanic advection in association with an anomalous upper-ocean anticyclone. The effect of surface heat flux seems to be predominant over the large spatial coverage, whereas oceanic heat transport is also important in some specific regions. The large-scale anticyclonic circulation anomalies over the northwestern Pacific accompanying the westward-extending western Pacific subtropical high during the El Nino decay summers play an essential role in the building-up and persistence of the extreme warming, which has important implications for the prediction of the SCS MHWs.

TI  - Diagnosis of an extremely rare case of malignant adenomyoepithelioma in pleomorphic adenoma: A case report
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF CLINICAL CASES
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND Pleomorphic adenoma (PA) is the most common type of salivary gland tumor, and its common sites are parotid gland, sinus, nasal septum and cleft palate. PA is an uncommon benign type of tumor occurring in the breast, and there are few reports of cases in Asia. CASE SUMMARY An 84-year-old woman found a mass in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast > 1 year ago. The patient underwent a right breast lumpectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy. The pathological diagnosis was PA in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast, and the malignant component was malignant adenomyoepithelioma. The postoperative course was uneventful, and no chemotherapy was administered. At 18 mo of follow-up, the patient is alive and well, with no evidence of recurrent disease. CONCLUSION Patients with breast PA should first undergo extended excision of breast masses followed by pathological examination. If malignancy is confirmed or the surgical margin is positive, modified radical mastectomy should be performed.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variability/stability analysis of NO<sub>2</sub>, CO, and land surface temperature (LST) during COVID-19 lockdown in Amman city, Jordan
T2  - GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The massive lockdown of human socioeconomic activities and vehicle movements due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 has resulted in an unprecedented reduction in pollutant gases such as Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) and Carbon Monoxide (CO) as well as Land Surface Temperature (LST) in Amman as well as all countries around the globe. In this study, the spatial and temporal variability/stability of NO2, CO, and LST throughout the lockdown period over Amman city have been analyzed. The NO2 and CO column density values were acquired from Sentinel-5p while the LST data were obtained from MODIS satellite during the lockdown period from 20 March to 24 April in 2019, 2020, and 2021. The statistical analysis showed an overall reduction in NO2 in 2020 by around 27% and 48% compared to 2019 and 2021, respectively. However, an increase of 7% in 2021 compared to 2019 was observed because almost all anthropogenic activities were allowed during the daytime. The temporal persistence showed almost constant NO2 values in 2020 over the study area throughout the lockdown period. In addition, a slight decrease in CO (around 1%) was recorded in 2020 and 2021 compared to the same period in 2019. Restrictions on human activities resulted in an evident drop in LST in 2020 by around 13% and 18% less than the 5-year average and 2021 respectively. The study concludes that due to the restrictions imposed on industrial activities and automobile movements in Amman city, an unprecedented reduction in NO2, CO, and LST was recorded.

TI  - Development of Adaptive Time-Weighted Dynamic Time Warping for Time Series Vegetation Classification Using Satellite Images in Solapur District
T2  - COMPUTER JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The global seasonal change and continued rapid growth have maximized the need to assess the urban dwellers' depend on vegetation for their lives, and also in the urban ecosystem resources. The conventional outcomes devoted to cropland mapping, with the help of high-quality remote sensing data's. This paper is to investigate and develop a new methodology that pertains to time series analysis for classifying the type of vegetation in a farm area of Ujani Dam located in Solapur District, Maharastra. The proposed model develops a novel adaptive time-weighted dynamic time warping (ATWDTW) for the time series analysis using the satellite images. The gathered satellite images from the farm are processed initially and subjected to analysis by ATWDTW. The TWDTW concept is optimally tuned by the new hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm termed moth flame-based bird swarm optimization (MF-BSA) for enhancing the classification performance. Regarding the false omission rate of the proposed MF-BSA-ATWDTW model attains 5.56% and 29.9% lower than SVM and K-means respectively. From the analysis, it is possible to get a deep insight into the vegetation to be done in each year, and the comparative analysis proves that the proposed model is further adaptable for experimental use in relating and explaining environmental and ecological time-series information.

TI  - Leveraging OpenStreetMap and Multimodal Remote Sensing Data with Joint Deep Learning for Wastewater Treatment Plants Detection
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Humans rely on clean water for their health, well-being, and various socio-economic activities. During the past few years, the COVID-19 pandemic has been a constant reminder of about the importance of hygiene and sanitation for public health. The most common approach to securing clean water supplies for this purpose is via wastewater treatment. To date, an effective method of detecting wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) accurately and automatically via remote sensing is unavailable. In this paper, we provide a solution to this task by proposing a novel joint deep learning (JDL) method that consists of a fine-tuned object detection network and a multi-task residual attention network (RAN). By leveraging OpenStreetMap (OSM) and multimodal remote sensing (RS) data, our JDL method is able to simultaneously tackle two different tasks: land use land cover (LULC) and WWTP classification. Moreover, JDL exploits the complementary effects between these tasks for a performance gain. We train JDL using 4,187 WWTP features and 4,200 LULC samples and validate the performance of the proposed method over a selected area around Stuttgart with 723 WWTP features and 1,200 LULC samples to generate an LULC classification map and a WWTP detection map. Extensive experiments conducted with different comparative methods demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our JDL method in automatic WWTP detection in comparison with single-modality/single-task or traditional survey methods. Moreover, lessons learned pave the way for future works to simultaneously and effectively address multiple large-scale mapping tasks (e.g., both mapping LULC and detecting WWTP) from multimodal RS data via deep learning.

TI  - Remote sensing of column-integrated chlorophyll a in a large deep-water reservoir
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate assessment of total algal biomass in large deep-water reservoirs is challenging because the characteristics of thermodynamic stratification in such reservoirs differ noticeably from those of other types of inland waters. To address this challenge, we proposed a novel remote sensing model to derive column-integrated chlorophyll a (CIC), a better indicator than water surface chlorophyll a concentration (Csurf), for evaluating total algal biomass. The proposed algorithm was utilized to construct the patterns of spatiotemporal change in CIC in the Xin'anjiang Reservoir (the largest freshwater human-made reservoir in East China, located in Zhejiang Province) based on 97 cloud-free Sentinel-2 satellite images from 2016 to 2020. The results showed that the best index for developing the CIC remote sensing model was the average chlorophyll a concentration within the euphotic layer, which could be derived from Csurf and euphotic depth. The proposed model demonstrated good performance in deriving CIC in the Xin'anjiang Reservoir from Sentinel-2 images (yielding a mean absolute percent error of 20.7% and a root mean square error of 16.3 mg/m2). The values of the five-year averaged CIC and total algal biomass within the reservoir were 62.38 mg/m2 and 22.31 t, respectively. The CIC in the Xin'anjiang Reservoir displayed noticeable spatial variation, with the highest CIC appearing in the riverine zone and the lowest CIC appearing in the lacustrine zone. Clear seasonal variation in CIC was observed, with CIC exhibiting the order summer > autumn > spring > winter. Although the model was developed for a specific reservoir, we believe that this research can serve as a case study that illustrates the benefits of using CIC for assessing spatiotemporal variation in phytoplankton.

TI  - A novel hybrid approach to flood susceptibility assessment based on machine learning and land use change. Case study: a river watershed in Vietnam
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to develop a comprehensive approach including an analysis of the relationships between flood susceptibility and land-use change, based on the relevance vector machine (RVM) and coyote optimization algorithm (COA) models, applied to Gianh River watershed, Quang Binh province, Central Vietnam. Standard statistical indices, e.g. area under the curve (AUC), were used to assess the model performance. Comparative analyses emphasize that the COA successfully improves the performance of the RVM model (AUC = 0.99) and is also better than the reference models such as support vector machine (AUC = 0.98), gradient boosting machine (AUC = 0.97), random forest (AUC = 0.99), extra trees regressor (AUC = 0.98), and AdaBoost (AUC = 0.96). The improved model, when used in conjunction with land use maps, is able to show that urbanization has increased in flood-susceptible areas. The results highlight that urbanization has increased in the low and very low flood susceptibility areas by 110% between 2005 and 2020, while in the high and very high areas it has increased by 30 to 40%, despite urban and demographic growth.

TI  - Climatology and Trends in Aerosol Optical Properties over Different Emission Regions in India
T2  - PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Climatological variations and trends in aerosol parameters were studied over six different regions identified as different source regions of aerosol emissions over India. Analysis was carried out on monthly mean satellite data for total aerosol optical depth (AOD), black carbon AOD (BC-AOD), single-scattering albedo (SSA) and angstrom ngstrom exponent (ANG), in addition to NCEP reanalysis data for air temperature and relative humidity, for two decades (2000-2019) over the six different Indian regions. Through analysis of seasonal and annual climatology, it was found that region R3 (Indo-Gangetic Plain) was the most aerosol-laden area, as evidenced by a high value of BC-AOD and AOD. A high mean value of ANG indicated an increase in natural aerosol emissions over region R1 (Northeast India). Single-scattering albedo was highest in region R4 (South India). The aerosol changes over all regions showed a lower enhancing trend in total AOD and BC-AOD in the second decade (2010-2019) as compared with the first decade (2000-2009), which was attributed to the improvements in vehicle technology and use of more refined fuels in the domestic sector. The decreasing trend in angstrom ngstrom exponent and AOD indicates that the anthropogenic aerosol loading decreased in the second decade relative to the first decade.

TI  - Assessment of Sentinel-2A images for estimating rosemary land cover through an object-based image analysis approach
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rosemary is a medicinal plant widely used in the food and pharmaceutical industry. In Morocco, rosemary harvesting generates significant benefits for the local economy. Even though, decision makers are short of accurate information about its geographical distribution area. The aim of this study is to delineate the rosemary shrubs in the Oriental region in Morocco in order to provide guidance for the sustainable use of these natural resources. We therefore used the freely available images of Sentinel-2A for binary classification (rosemary shrubs and the other lands) through an object-based image-analysis approach. The random forest classifier was deployed and trained with different object features likewise spectral values and vegetation indices. As a result, the distribution area of rosemary is 240,747 ha, which represents 18% of the studied area. Besides, an encouraging overall accuracy of 94.24% was attained; the user's accuracy for the class of "rosemary" and "Others" is 93.3% and 95.0%, respectively; meanwhile, the producer's accuracy for "rosemary" and "Others" is 93.72% and 94.65%.

TI  - Spatial and temporal variation of air pollutant emissions from forest fires in China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Warm and dry climate conditions favor the occurrence of forest fires. Forest burning leads to the discharge of large amounts of particles and trace gases that play an important role in air quality degradation and have impact on human health. To date, most studies on China's forest fire emissions have concentrated in certain regions, also with a relatively coarse temporal resolution. In this study, we used the INteractive Fire and Emission algoRithm for Natural envirOnments (INFERNO), as well as high-resolution land cover data to compile a forest fire emission inventory for China in 2020. The variations of forest combustion emissions were then analyzed at the provincial and seasonal level. The results show that forest fires were concentrated in southern China and northeastern China, which are in agreement with MODIS observations. Total CO2, CO, CH4, NOx, SO2, PM2.5, OC, and BC emissions were estimated to be 3.06 x 10(4), 1.87 x 10(3), 96.92, 34.95, 13.84, 208, 116.03, and 9.95 Gg, respectively. Provinces with higher emissions were found in Yunnan, Guangdong, Hunan, and Sichuan. Peak emission from forest fire occurred in spring and winter, mainly from January to April, during which contributed 70% of the total forest fire contaminants emissions. The algorithm used in this study can be easily coupled in the meteorological model and air quality model to estimate the occurrence of fire and calculate pollutant emission online. This study updated emissions information that may support future research and policy development on greenhouse gas reduction and air pollution control.

TI  - Single-Cell Immune Mapping of Melanoma Sentinel Lymph Nodes Reveals an Actionable Immunotolerant Microenvironment
T2  - CLINICAL CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Improving our understanding of the immunologic response to cancer cells within the sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) of primary tumors is expected to identify new approaches to stimulate clinically meaningful cancer immunity.Experimental Design: We used mass cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF), flow cytometry, and T-cell receptor immunosequencing to conduct simultaneous single-cell analyses of immune cells in the SLNs of patients with melanoma.Results: We found increased effector-memory alpha beta T cells, TCR clonality, and gamma delta T cells selectively in the melanoma-bearing SLNs relative to non-melanoma-bearing SLNs, consistent with possible activation of an antitumor immune response. However, we also observed a markedly immunotolerant environment in the melanoma-bearing SLNs indicated by reduced and impaired NK cells and increased levels of CD8(+)CD57(+)PD-1(+) cells, which are known to display low melanoma killing capabilities. Other changes observed in melanoma-bearing SLNs when compared with non- melanoma-bearing SLNs include (i) reduced CD8(+)CD69(+) T cell/T regulatory cell ratio, (ii) high PD-1 expression on CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, and (iii) high CTLA-4 expression on gamma delta T cells.Conclusions: Our data suggest that these immunologic changes compromise antimelanoma immunity and contribute to a high relapse rate. We propose the development of clinical trials to test the neo-adjuvant administration of anti-PD-1 antibodies prior to SLN resection in patients with stage III melanoma.

TI  - Analysis of aerosol cloud interactions with a consistent signal of meteorology and other influencing parameters
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying the impact of aerosols on cloud micro/macro physical properties and estimating the signature of Aerosol Cloud Interactions (ACI) is one of the challenging tasks in atmospheric sciences. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ERA-5 reanalysis data are employed to systematically study the ACI over the monsoon region in Pakistan. Based on the monsoon occurrence and rainfall intensity, the whole region is divided into three sub-regions labeled as highly intensive (R1), moderately intensive (R2) and weak (R3) monsoon region. The results indicate that the monthly mean Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) peaks in the summer monsoon months (Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep). The well-known Twomey effect whereby the Cloud Droplet Radius (CDR) decreases with increasing AOD holds only over R3; the opposite effects (Anti-Twomey effect) are found over R1 and R2, all passing the test of statistical significance (p < 0.05). The multi-year AOD is found to be positively correlated with Cloud Liquid Water Path (CLWP) and Cloud Optical Depth (COD) over R1 and R2, suggesting that thicker clouds containing more water droplets are formed in polluted atmosphere. Over R3, decreases in CLWP and COD are found with increasing AOD only when AOD is less than~0.325. The analysis of ACI over R1 and R2 during the winter months shows similar but stronger responses of CDR, CLWP and COD to the variation in AOD. The weaker responses during the summer monsoon season may attributed to the occurrence of high level cloud and unstable atmospheric condition. Further investigation of the influences of Relative Humidity and pressure vertical velocity on the CDR-AOD relationships shows that although the magnitude of the CDR-AOD correlations change with meteorological conditions, the sign of correlations remain unchanged with meteorological conditions.

TI  - Using computational-intelligence algorithms and remote sensing data to optimize the locations of check dams to control sediment and runoff in Kandolus watershed, Mazandaran, Iran
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Construction of check dams is one of the important measures in controlling soil erosion and sediment entering the reservoirs of dams. These structures, which provide water reduction and sedimentation by modifying the slope of the canal, play a significant role in preventing the transfer of sediment and pollutants to dam reservoirs, and water bodies. The most challenging task, however, is to identify suitable sites for check dams. In the present study, four machine learning algorithms (namely K-nearest neighbour (KNN), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), extremely randomized tree (ERT), and random forest (RF)) and high-resolution remote sensing data were used to find the optimal locations of check dams in the Kandolus watershed in Mazandaran Province (Iran). Sixteen topographical, hydrological, and geomorphic factors were used as inputs in the abovementioned machine learning approaches to identify appropriate locations of check dams. The models were evaluated using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) statistical analyses. The results showed that the RF, ERT, XGB, and KNN models could accurately identify the suitable locations of check dams with the area under curve (AUC) values of 0.93, 0.92, 0.83, and 0.82, respectively. According to the AUC values, RF had the highest accuracy to identify the suitable locations for check dams. This study demonstrate that the utilized artificial intelligence methods and remote sensing data can help land-use planners and water resource managers identify optimal locations of check dams to more efficiency control floods, reduce erosion and land degradation, and enhance groundwater recharge.

TI  - Excretion time courses of lambda-cyhalothrin metabolites in the urine of strawberry farmworkers and effect of coexposure with captan
T2  - ARCHIVES OF TOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - There are limited literature data on the impact of coexposure on the toxicokinetics of pesticides in agricultural workers. Using the largely employed pyrethroid lambda-cyhalothrin (LCT) and fungicide captan as sentinel pesticides, we compared individual temporal profiles of biomarkers of exposure to LCT in strawberry field workers following an application episode of LCT alone or in coexposure with captan. Participants provided all urine voided over a 3-day period after an application of a pesticide formulation containing LCT alone (E1) or LCT mixed with captan (E2), and in some cases following re-entry in treated field (E3). Pyrethroid metabolites were measured in all urine samples, in particular 3-(2-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoroprop-1-en-1-yl)-2,2-dimethyl-cyclopropanecarboxylic acid (CFMP), 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA), and 4-hydroxy-3-phenoxy-benzoic acid (4-OH3PBA). There were no obvious differences in individual concentration-time profiles and cumulative excretion of metabolites (CFMP, 3-PBA, 4-OH3BPA) after exposure to LCT alone or in combination with captan. For most workers and exposure scenarios, CFMP was the main metabolite excreted, but time courses of CFMP in urine did not always follow that of 3-PBA and 4-OH3BPA. Given that the latter metabolites are common to other pyrethroids, this suggests that some workers were coexposed to pyrethroids other than LCT. For several workers and exposure scenarios E1 and E2, values of CFMP increased in the hours following spraying. However, for many pesticide operators, other peaks of CFMP were observed at later times, indicating that tasks other than spraying of LCT-containing formulations contributed to this increased exposure. These tasks were mainly handling/cleaning of equipment used for spraying (tractor or sprayer) or work/inspection in LCT-treated field according to questionnaire responses. Overall, this study provided novel excretion time course data for LCT metabolites valuable for interpretation of biomonitoring data in workers, but also showed that coexposure was not a major determinant of variability in exposure biomarker levels. Our analysis also pointed out the importance of measuring specific metabolites.

TI  - Sentinel surveillance of substance-related self-harm in Canadian emergency departments, 2011-19
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Self-harm is a public health concern that can result in serious injury or death. This study provides an overview of emergency department (ED) visits for patients presenting with substance-related self-harm. Methods Cases of self-harm in the electronic Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program (eCHIRPP) database were extracted (April 2011 to September 2019; N = 15,682), using various search strategies to identify substance-related self-harm cases for patients 10 years and older. Cases involving alcohol, cannabis, illicit drugs, or medications (or any combinations of these) were included. Additional variables, including age and sex, location and the severity of injury (hospital admission) were examined. Proportionate injury ratios (PIR) were used to compare emergency department outcomes of self-harm and unintentional injuries involving substance use. Time trends were quantified using Joinpoint regression. For cases requiring hospital admission, text fields were analyzed for contextual factors. Results A total of 9470 substance-related self-harm cases were reported (28.1% of all intentional injury cases), representing 820.0 records per 100,000 eCHIRPP records. While age patterns for both sexes were similar, the number of cases for females was significantly higher among 15-19 year olds. Over half (55%) of cases that identified substance type involved medications, followed by multi-type substance use (19.8%). In the ED, there were proportionally more treatments, observations, and admissions presenting with substance-related self-harm compared to substance-related unintentional injury cases. Among those aged 20+ years, a statistically significant increasing trend of 15.9% per year was observed, while among those aged 10-19 years a significant annual percent change of 16.9% was noted (2011 to 2019). Text field analysis demonstrated suicide attempt or ideation was a reoccurring theme among all age groups. Poor mental health status or conflict with family or an intimate partner were reported stressors, depending on age group. Additional self-harming injuries, such as cutting, were reported among all age groups. Conclusion Our study found that hospital admission for substance-related self-harm was highest for patients aged 15-19 years, especially females, and that they were more likely to use medications. The statistically significant increasing trend of cases found between 2011 and 2019 is notable. Patients showed multiple types of adversities, demonstrating the complexity of this issue.

TI  - Remote sensing of phenology: Towards the comprehensive indicators of plant community dynamics from species to regional scales
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Remote sensing of vegetation phenology has long been used to characterize ecosystem functions and responses to climate at spatial and temporal scales unfeasible to field surveys. However, the potential of remote sensing to elucidate mechanistic drivers of phenology and the underlying plant community processes at such scales remains under-discussed. This review synthesizes possibilities to advance this knowledge using multi-temporal remote sensing and discusses remaining challenges and progress in instruments and analytical tools. Recent evidence indicates that, besides documenting vegetation seasonality and responses to climate, remote sensing of phenology can help meet emerging needs for indicators of plant diversity, vegetation structure and ecosystem change. Responses of phenological metrics to stressors over large, heterogeneous regions may provide clues on ecological resilience manifested in asynchronies, recovery of vegetation cycles and stable microrefugia. At the same time, important barriers persist in relation to choosing among phenological estimation methods and paradigms, characterizing phenological events beyond changes in photosynthetically active biomass, and mechanistic interpretation of phenological patterns. Synthesis. Increasing temporal frequency of products, opportunities for multi-sensor data fusion, and advances in historically less available hyperspectral, active microwave and lidar instruments promise to help navigate these barriers and enable more comprehensive assessments of seasonality. Progress in customizable local platforms such as unoccupied aerial vehicles and phenocams may further enrich ground-level understanding of phenology and validate satellite-based assessments. However, remote sensing analyses alone are insufficient for mechanistic interpretation of phenology, which can be challenged by artefacts in remote sensing data and sensitivity of estimated metrics to landscape structure and spatial resolution of the inputs. Robust and informative phenological assessments call for rigorous collaborations with field ecological studies, strategic selection of ancillary environmental and geographic data, and wider adoption of causal inference approaches to address these needs and support novel explorations in plant ecology.

TI  - Crop type detection using an object-based classification method and multi-temporal Landsat satellite images
T2  - PADDY AND WATER ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop type detection is of great importance in water resource allocation and planning mostly in arid and semi-arid regions of Iran. Landsat-OLI 16-day inter-annual images are invaluable sources obviating crop monitoring into issues of crop types detection, crop yield prediction, and crop pattern studies. Although many classification methods such as decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), and maximum likelihood (ML) were implied for crop type mapping, recent researches often use an object-based classification approach. In this study, an object-based image analysis (OBIA) classifier based on rule-based decision tree (RBDT) and object-based nearest neighbor (OBNN) used to delineate five common crop types (includes Wheat and Barley together in one class, rice, multiple crop (MC), Alfalfa and Spring crops) in Isfahan city and nearby areas. The classification was applied in five scenarios using different vegetation indexes including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), green normalized difference vegetation index GNDVI and their combination. All scenarios property and accuracy assessed both with by class separation distance matrix and confusion matrix. The overall accuracy of classification with using only one vegetation index was lower than other scenarios. It was the lowest for GNDVI rating 37% whereas combination of Indexes resulted better accuracy. In final map with combination of NDVI, GNDVI and NDWI, overall accuracy and kappa achieved to 88% and 0/83 successively. Comparing individual accuracy of different crops showed that MC crops with 66% has the lowest accuracy and Wheat-Barely crops with 94.8% individual accuracy has the Maximum accuracy. Other crop types accuracy alters between 66 and 94.8%.

TI  - Determination of the human impact on the drop in NO<sub>2</sub> air pollution due to total COVID-19 lockdown using Human-Influenced Air Pollution Decrease Index (HIAPDI)*
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the relationship between territorial human influence and decreases in NO2 air pollution during a total COVID-19 lockdown in Metropolitan France. NO2 data from the confinement period and the Human Influence Index (HII) were implemented to address the problem. The relative change in tropospheric NO2 was calculated using Sentinel-5P (TROPOMI) satellite data. Hotspot-Coldspot analysis was performed to examine the change in NO2. Moreover, the novel Human-Influenced Air Pollution Decrease Index (HIAPDI) was developed. Weather bias was investigated by implementing homogeneity analysis with chi 2 test. The correlations between variables were tested with the statistical T-test. Likewise, remote observations were validated with data from in-situ monitoring stations. The study showed a strong correlation between the NO2 decrease during April 2020 under confinement measures and HII. The greater the anthropogenic influence, the greater the reduction of NO2 in the regions (R2 = 0.62). The new HIAPDI evidenced the degree of anthropogenic impact on NO2 change. HIAPDI was found to be a reliable measure to determine the correlation between human influence and change in air pollution (R2 = 0.93). It is concluded that the anthropogenic influence is a determining factor in the phenomenon of near-surface NO2 reduction. The implementation of HIAPDI is recommended in the analysis of other polluting gases.

TI  - Detection of Management Practices and Cropping Phases in Wild Lowbush Blueberry Fields Using Multispectral UAV Data
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference red-edge index Received 16 August 2021 (NDRE) are vegetation indices commonly used in agriculture to provide information on crop's Accepted 19 April 2022 growth and health. Here, we investigated the sensitivity of both indices to management practices in lowbush blueberry fields. Images of the experimental plots were collected with a multispectral camera installed on an unmanned aerial vehicle. Both NDVI and NDRE values were significantly higher in fertilized plots than in controls (0.88 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.79 +/- 0.03 for NDVI, and 0.37 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.33 +/- 0.01 for NDRE) due to fertilization effect on vegetative growth. The increase was higher under mineral than organic fertilization during the two first phases of the cropping system (by similar to 0.3 and similar to 0.2 for NDVI and NDRE, respectively). NDRE was not affected by thermal pruning and fungicide application but was negatively correlated with Septoria infection level. NDVI was more strongly correlated with stem length than NDRE, but unlike NDRE, NDVI was not impacted by the development of reproductive shoots during the harvest phases. Overall, the results indicate that although both index values are correlated, their sensitivity to changes in canopy characteristics differs depending on the cropping phase. Further research must be conducted to relate these indices to blueberry's nutrient status.

TI  - Evaluation of dry and wet spell events over West Africa using CORDEX-CORE regional climate models
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the capability of regional climate models (RCMs) in simulating four extreme precipitation indices on an annual and monthly scale over West Africa during the period 1997-2014. Three global climate models (GCMs; HadGEM2-ES, NorESM1 and MPI-ESM) were dynamically downscaled using three high resolution (0.22 degrees) regional climate models (RCMs; RegCM4, REM02015 and CCLM5-0-15). These simulations were from the Coordinated Output for Regional Evaluations within the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment framework (CORDEX-CORE) publicly available through the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) web portals. The capabilities of the RCMs in the representation of maximum consecutive wet day (CWD), maximum consecutive dry days (CDD), number of dry days (NDD), and number of wet days (NWD) were compared with observation/satellites datasets obtained from the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP), Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and Tropical Applications of Meteorology using SATellite data and ground-based observations (TAMSAT). The reference datasets showed similar spatial pattern and magnitude of analyzed precipitation extremes but models exhibit different pronounced discrepancies relative to them. All RCMs consistently captured the spatial patterns of the indices but with some pronounced biases along the Guinean coast and northern parts of Niger. There exists little or no biases in the representation of annual cycle along the Guinea and Sahel for all the indices based on each of the RCMs ensemble, with the exception of RegCM4 which has a more pronounced bias in CWD. Statistical evaluation of the performance of the models over the entire West Africa with respect to the 4 indices revealed that REM02015 models and its ensemble have overall lowest root mean square error followed by the choice of MPI-ESM GCM downscaled with either of the RCMs. REMO-HAD was found to have the best performance in the representation of consecutive dry days and number of wet days with RMSE values of 25.74 and 18.91 respectively. REMO-MPI has superior performance in the estimation of consecutive wet days and number of dry days with RMSE values of 5.38 and 20.51 respectively. Generally, REMO RCMs ensemble was found to be the best ensemble in all indices except consecutive dry days where REG4 ensembles had better performance. Operational use of these 3 RCMs are recommended with compensation for over-and underestimations.

TI  - Comparison of two open-source digital elevation models for 1D hydrodynamic flow analysis: a case of Ozat River basin, Gujarat, India
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ozat River originates from the Gir forest in the Junagadh district, and the river mouth is near Navi Bandar in the Porbandar district. Before meeting the Arabian sea, the river splits into two portions; one flows towards Ghed region, while the other flows straight towards Pata village; before the separation, water is scattered throughout the low-lying terrain, which is frequent. This research aims to compare the open-source digital elevation model (DEM) for 1D hydrodynamic flow analysis, river stage analysis along the reaches from inflow to river mouths, and the calibration of Manning roughness value. This study boosts researcher's capability to work with open-source DEM. Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) 30 m and Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) 30 m DEMs carried with Hydrologic Engineering Centre River Analysis System for 1-Dimensional hydrodynamic analysis. For the comparative study of DEMs, there are two criteria emphasized (1) Water Surface Elevation (WSE) and (2) Cross-Section Inundation. Specific places are set for WSE changes, and all reach is considered for the cross-section inundation study. Regression analysis was employed to calculate root mean square error (RMSE) for water surface elevation changes and coefficient of determination (R-2) for the cross-section inundation study. The result shows RMSE values are 0.34 and 1.31 for water surface elevation changes, R-2 values are 0.81 and 0.59 for an inundation of cross sections, respectively, for SRTM and ALOS. It shows that the lower value of RMSE and a better R-2 value of SRTM DEM made a close agreement with an observed data set. Most split stretches seem inundated on both river bank sides, according to the one-dimensional model. Ground survey and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle photographs have enhanced a support system for decision-makers.

TI  - Experimental research on cryogenic cutting performance of Ni-based superalloy GH4169
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ni-based superalloy GH4169 is widely demanded in the aerospace industry because of its excellent properties. However, the cutting of GH4169 at normal temperature has many challenges, such as tool wear, machining accuracy, and production efficiency. Cryogenic cutting has been an advanced method in assisting material removal machining. This paper focused on the cryogenic cutting performance of GH4169 at different initial temperatures, namely, 20 degrees C, -30 degrees C, -80 degrees C, and -130 degrees C. Firstly, the cryogenic mechanical properties of GH4169 were obtained by the Hopkinson pressure bar test at speed of 12 m/s and 18 m/s. The obtained data was used to analyze the cryogenic cutting performance of GH4169 at evaluated temperatures. The single factor milling experiments of GH4169 were carried out at room temperature and evaluated cryogenic levels, and the cutting performance in terms of cutting chips, cutting forces, and tool wear was investigated. The results showed that cryogenic cooling at -130 degrees C could increase the shear yield strength of the GH4169 by around 19.80% and the length of the cutting chip decreased monotonically by 53.45% compared with the length at room temperature. However, the cutting forces were not monotonically decreased. The cutting forces increased with the decrease of temperature when the initial temperature varied from 20 to -80 degrees C. However, when the initial temperature further dropped to -130 degrees C, the cutting forces were reduced by 30.60% for Fx, 24.02% for Fy, and 16.15% for Fz, respectively. Similarly, tool wear at the rake face and flank face is the most severe at -80 degrees C and the least at -130 degrees C. The average wear bandwidth at room temperature is 92.06 mu m and decreases to 83.358 mu m at -130 degrees C, which is reduced by 9.45%.

TI  - An Integrated Framework for Mapping Nationwide Daily Temperature in China
T2  - ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Air temperature (T-a) is an essential parameter for science research and engineering practice. While the traditional site-based approach is only able to obtain observations in limited and discrete locations, satellite remote sensing is promising to retrieve some environmental variables with spatially continuous coverage. Nowadays, land surface temperature (T-s) measurements can be obtained from some satellite sensors (e.g., MODIS), further enabling us to estimate T-a in view of the relationship between T-a and T-s. In this article, we proposed a two-phase integrated framework to estimate daily mean T-a nationwide. In the first phase, multivariate linear regression models were fitted between site-based observations of daily mean air temperature (Ta-mean) and MODIS land surface temperature products (including Terra day: TMOD-day, Terra night: TMOD-night, Aqua day: TMYD-day, and Aqua night: TMYD-night) conditional on some covariates of environmental factors. The fitted models were then used to predict Ta-mean from those covariates at unobserved locations. The predicted Ta-mean were looked on as stochastic variables, and their distributions were also obtained. In the second phase, Bayesian maximum entropy (BME) methods were used to produce spatially continuous maps of Ta-mean taking the meteorological station observations as hard data and the predicted Ta-mean in the first phase as soft data. It is shown that the proposed approach is promising to improve the interpolation accuracy significantly, comprehensively considering the prior knowledge and the context of space variability and correlation, which will enable it to compile spatially continuous air temperature products with higher accuracy.

Through close textual analysis of Hannah Gadsby's Nanette (2018), I argue refractive comedy alters the message, affective nature, and form of stand-up comedy through a rejection of the dominant worldview and subsequent centering of marginalized standpoints. This essay examines Gadsby's refraction in a broader discourse of industrial and cultural, gendered, and racial gatekeeping. I examine how refractive comedy, additionally, has inspired critical conversation on comedy's role in relation to shared and collective trauma, as seen in Bo Burnham's Inside (2021).

AB  - Introduction: The pro-inflammatory immune response underlies severe cases of COVID-19. Antigens of the Duffy blood group systems are receptors for pro-inflammation chemokines. The ACKR1 c.-67T>C gene variation silences the expression of Duffy antigens on erythrocytes and individuals presenting this variant in homozygosity have impaired inflammatory response control. Our aim was to evaluate the association between the ACKR1 c.-67T>C and the severity of COVID-19. Methods: This was a retrospective single-center case-control study, enrolling 164 participants who were divided into four groups: 1) Death: COVID-19 patients who died during hospitalization; 2) Hospital Discharge: COVID-19 patients who were discharged for home after hospitalizations; 3) Convalescent Plasma Donors: COVID-19 patients who were not hospitalized, and; 4) Controls: patients with diagnosis other than COVID-19. Patients were genotyped for the ACKR1 c.-67T>C (FY*02 N.01 allele) and the frequency of individuals presenting the altered allele was compared between the groups. Results: The groups significantly differed in terms of the percentage of patients presenting at least one FY*02N.01 allele: 36.8% (Death group), 37% (Hospital Discharge group), 16.1% (Convalescent Plasma group) and 16.2% (Control group) (p = 0.027). The self-declared race (p < 0.001) and the occurrence of in hospital death (p = 0.058) were independently associated with the presence of the FY*02N.01 allele. Hypertension (p < 0.001), age (p < 0.001) and the presence of at least one FY*02N.01 allele (p = 0.009) were independently associated with the need for hospitalization. Conclusion: There is a suggestive association between the presence of the FY*02N.01 and the severity of COVID-19. This may be a mechanism underlying the worse prognosis for Afro descendants infected with SARS-CoV-2.

TI  - Pattern of cervical lymph node metastases in squamous cell carcinoma of the upper oral cavity - How to manage the neck
T2  - ORAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) arising from the upper oral cavity is rare compared to other localizations. While cervical lymph node metastasis (CLNM) can be predicted to some extent, the probability of occult CLNM remains high. The aim of this study is to determine risk factors affecting clinical decision making.Materials and methods: A retrospective analysis of patients surgically treated between 2012 and 2017 for OSCC of the upper oral cavity was performed.Results: A total of 66 patients were included. Of these, 25 patients (37.9%) presented with CLNM after histopathological examination (pN+/cN0: 10/44 (22.7%); pN+/cN+: 15/22 (68.2%)). Lymph vessel infiltration (p = 0.03) and grade of differentiation (p = 0.03) were associated with an increased probability for CLNM. Patients with positive nodal disease at the time of primary surgery showed higher tumor depth of invasion (DOI) than patients without CLNM (mean 10.3 mm +/- 6.9 versus mean 6.1 mm +/- 4.9; p = 0.02). The optimal DOI cutoff value for the prediction of CLNM was 4.5 mm. The OS was significantly higher in patients with a tumor DOI <= 4.5 mm (p = 0.01).Conclusion: Elective neck dissection should be preferably performed for OSCC of the upper oral cavity. For earlystage and clinically node-negative patients, sentinel-lymph node biopsy can be an alternative, especially in patients with a DOI <= 4.5 mm. Since this group had no occult CLNM below this DOI cutoff value, watch and wait might be an alternative for selected patients.

TI  - Influences of different environmental covariates on county-scale soil type identification using remote sensing images
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The scientific selection of environmental covariates is an important factor that affects the accuracy of digital soil mapping (DSM).An investigation of the influences of different environmental covariates on soil type identification is vital to understand soil development and predictive soil mapping. In this study, the soil groups in the typical plain and hilly areas of the Jiaodong Peninsula in China were taken as the objects of investigation. Based on five environmental characteristics and remotely sensed indexes (texture, terrain, biology, major spectral components and moisture), 21 covariates sourced from Landsat 8 remote sensing images and a digital elevation map were utilized for the predictive mapping of soils. The identification accuracies of the soil groups were acquired through maximum likelihood classification, and the relevant environmental factors that are important for soil mapping and the influence of different environmental covariates on soil mapping were explored. The results show that texture features had the greatest influence on DSM, followed by terrain, major spectral components, moisture and biological factors. The single environmental covariate with the greatest impact on DSM was the texture entropy parameter. For areas containing plain and hilly landforms, the entropy, elevation, slope, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), third principal component (PC3) and normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) indicators compose the optimal covariate combination for soil identification. Clarifying the impacts of different environmental covariates on DSM can improve the soil classification applicability and accuracy. The environmental covariates discussed in this study would be useful in similar environmental areas and would provide a reference for DSM.

TI  - Declassified intelligence satellite imagery as a tool to reconstruct past landforms and surface processes: The submerged riverscape of the Tigris River below the Mosul Dam Lake, Iraq
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Located along the Tigris River in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, the Mosul Dam Reservoir is the second biggest dam of the Near East and represents an important water storage for local human activities. The dam was built between 1981 and 1988 north of the village of Eski Mosul, submerging the course of the Tigris River for c. 100 km. The analysis of historical images derived from declassified Corona satellite imagery acquired between December 1967 and August 1968 reveals the pristine pattern of the Tigris River, including the seasonal changes of its riverbed, shifting across the hydrological year from meandering to anastomosing patterns. Geomorphological mapping based on Corona images allowed us to estimate the seasonal modification of fluvial elements such as the floodplain and point, middle and longitudinal bars. The comparison with Landsat data collected since the 1990s showed the first phases of the basin filling and the control on the present-day aspect of the lake inherited from the setting of the Tigris channel belt and, more in general, the litho-structural control over the evolution of the local hydrographic network; we also document the influence of the original Tigris River course on its recent insertion into the lake. Our work allowed reconstruction of the ancient fluvial landscape below the Mosul Dam Lake and the evolution of its riverscape controlled by litho-structural factors and seasonal variations of the river discharge. Finally, this contribution highlights the relevance of declassified intelligence satellite imagery in interpreting natural geomorphic processes and landforms, today altered by human agency.

TI  - Recognizing Ecosocialization in Childhood Memories
T2  - EDUCATIONAL STUDIES-AESA
M3  - Article
AB  - Western modernity has shaped people's thought patterns and value hierarchies, relegating humans to the position of supremacy. This anthropocentric worldview has disconnected humans from the rest of nature and eventually led to the social and ecological catastrophe. This paper shows that collective memory work can help us recognize how we are always socialized within and by human communities and also already ecosocialized within and by the rest of nature. The motivation to use the ecosocialization framework to analyze childhood memories comes from our wish to problematize the anthropocentric view of life further and resituate childhood and growing up beyond exclusively social and human contexts. We draw on the memories collected in the Re-Connect / Re-Collect: Crossing the Divides through Memories of Cold War Childhoods project (2019-2021). We "think with theory" to reveal traces of ecosocialization present in childhood memories. On this basis, we suggest that including multisensory awareness practices in memory workshops to recognize our bodily belonging-as participants create their memory stories bringing into focus relations with more-than-humans-could potentialize collective biography as a form of transformative ecosocial education.

TI  - Investigation of riprap stability of a dam: risk assessment by InSAR method and rock mechanical test
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - Riprap resistance is a widely used solution for protecting earth dams from erosion but riprap can be displaced on the dam surface. This study examines the stability of riprap in the Taleqan Dam, Iran using rock mechanical tests and InSAR technology. Uplift of dam stairs and erosion of the riprap material have been observed during field work at the study site, and samples have been gathered from three rock categories. The purpose of this study is to explore the factors influencing the deformation of the Taleqan Dam. The InSAR method has been employed for monitoring surface deformation and the Los Angeles ASTM C test was used to establish the cause of dam deformation. InSAR analysis was carried out using Sentinel-1A images from 2014 to 2019. The results revealed subsidence at an average rate of 4 mm/yr over that period. The results of Los Angeles ASTM C indicated that the Andesite riprap was more easily eroded, has a relatively low durability and specific weight, and low resistance erosion. Therefore it is unsuitable for use as a protection layer for the crest and lower sectors of the riprap. It can also be concluded that the inadequate durability of certain rock materials may potentially cause weathering, depression, reduced thickness and displacement of the riprap.

TI  - Natural biological control of<i> Bagrada hilaris</i> by egg predators and parasitoids in north-central California
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - Bagrada bug, Bagrada hilaris Burmeister (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), is an invasive stink bug from Asia that has become a major pest of cruciferous crops (Brassicaceae) in California. Conventional insecticides are currently the most effective means for controlling this pest. In organic production, options are limited and generally ineffective. As part of an effort to develop a biological control program for bagrada bug, we documented attack rates by resident parasitoids and predators on sentinel bagrada bug eggs throughout north-central California, including the Salinas Valley, which is the largest cruciferous crop growing region in the US. A total of 51 sites were sampled over three years. Sentinel eggs were placed on the ground, where bagrada bug lays most of its eggs, and in foliage, where all other known stinkbug species deposit their eggs and resident egg parasitoids are most likely to search. Predation rates exceeded 20% per day on some sample dates (averaging 7.2, 7.4 and 6.3% per day in 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively) and were generally higher on the ground than in the foliage, although temporal patterns were inconsistent and predation levels varied among the sampled regions. Burying eggs in sand did not consistently reduce predation rates, indicating that bagrada bug's habit of burying its eggs provides only partial protection from predators. Of the 25,387 eggs deployed over the three years of this study that were not predated or missing (out of the 35,673 total eggs that were deployed), only 47 (0.19%) were parasitized. Gryon aetherium Talamas (Scelionidae), a biological control agent for bagrada bug that is currently undergoing testing, was found at one site. Only five of the parasitized sentinel eggs were on the ground, suggesting that few resident parasitoids in north-central California attack bagrada bug eggs, particularly on the ground. These results show that a parasitoid that co-evolved with bagrada bug in its native range is necessary to provide successful biological control of bagrada bug in California.

TI  - Self-determined immortality: Testing the role of autonomy in promoting perceptions of symbolic immortality and well-being
T2  - MOTIVATION AND EMOTION
M3  - Article
AB  - This pre-registered work was designed to replicate and extend previous research finding that autonomy is associated with greater extent of belief in symbolic immortality (feeling that some aspect of an individual will endure and/or be remembered long after death). Study 1 (n = 1185) replicated this prior work, finding that self-reported autonomy predicted extent of belief in symbolic immortality, which mediated the relationship between autonomy and meaning in life. Study 2 (n = 117) provided an experimental extension of Study 1, finding that reading about an individual with an autonomous (vs. controlled) life increased perceptions of that individual's symbolic immortality, which mediated the relationship between reading about the autonomous life and perceptions of the individual's satisfaction with life. Study 3 (n = 175) replicated the results of Study 2 and also showed that the extent to which people viewed the target individual as feeling autonomous predicted perceptions of that individual's symbolic immortality even after controlling for perceived self-esteem.

TI  - Kara and Barents sea ice thickness estimation based on CryoSat-2 radar altimeter and Sentinel-1 dual-polarized synthetic aperture radar
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a method to combine CryoSat-2 (CS2) radar altimeter and Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data to obtain sea ice thickness (SIT) estimates for the Barents and Kara seas. From the viewpoint of tactical navigation, along-track altimeter SIT estimates are sparse, and the goal of our study is to develop a method to interpolate altimeter SIT measurements between CS2 ground tracks. The SIT estimation method developed here is based on the interpolation of CS2 SIT utilizing SAR segmentation and segmentwise SAR texture features. The SIT results are compared to SIT data derived from the AARI ice charts; to ORAS5, PIOMAS and TOPAZ4 ocean-sea ice data assimilation system reanalyses; to combined CS2 and Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) radiometer weekly SIT (CS2SMOS SIT) charts; and to the daily MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer) SIT chart. We studied two approaches: CS2 directly interpolated to SAR segments and CS2 SIT interpolated to SAR segments with mapping of the CS2 SIT distributions to correspond to SIT distribution of the PIOMAS ice model. Our approaches yield larger spatial coverage and better accuracy compared to SIT estimates based on either CS2 or SAR data alone. The agreement with modelled SIT is better than with the CS2SMOS SIT. The average differences when compared to ice models and the AARI ice chart SIT were typically tens of centimetres, and there was a significant positive bias when compared to the AARI SIT (on average 27 cm) and a similar bias (24 cm) when compared to the CS2SMOS SIT. Our results are directly applicable to the future CRISTAL mission and Copernicus programme SAR missions.

TI  - Mapping land-use intensity of grasslands in Germany with machine learning and Sentinel-2 time series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on grassland land-use intensity (LUI) is crucial for understanding trends and dynamics in biodi-versity, ecosystem functioning, earth system science and environmental monitoring. LUI is a major driver for numerous environmental processes and indicators, such as primary production, nitrogen deposition and resil-ience to climate extremes. However, large extent, high resolution data on grassland LUI is rare. New satellite generations, such as Copernicus Sentinel-2, enable a spatially comprehensive detection of the mainly subtle changes induced by land-use intensification by their fine spatial and temporal resolution. We developed a methodology quantifying key parameters of grassland LUI such as grazing intensity, mowing frequency and fertiliser application across Germany using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) on Sentinel-2 satellite data with 20 m x 20 m spatial resolution. Subsequently, these land-use components were used to calculate a continuous LUI index. Predictions of LUI and its components were validated using comprehensive in situ grassland management data. A feature contribution analysis using Shapley values substantiates the applicability of the methodology by revealing a high relevance of springtime satellite observations and spectral bands related to vegetation health and structure. We achieved an overall classification accuracy of up to 66% for grazing in-tensity, 68% for mowing, 85% for fertilisation and an r2 of 0.82 for subsequently depicting LUI. We evaluated the methodology's robustness with a spatial 3-fold cross-validation by training and predicting on geographically distinctly separated regions. Spatial transferability was assessed by delineating the models' area of applicability. The presented methodology enables a high resolution, large extent mapping of land-use intensity of grasslands.

TI  - Continuous woody vegetation biomass estimation based on temporal modeling of Landsat data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical data records have been widely used for monitoring forest aboveground biomass (AGB) dynamics given their freely available long-term archives and high temporal and spatial resolution. However, most of the methods utilized only the spatial information of reflectance (e.g. annual mean reflectance) to estimate AGB, lack of consideration for dynamic characteristics of reflectance. These methods are susceptible to reflectance saturation and temporal noise and may cause uncertainties in their estimation. In this study, we exploited dynamic time-series information of reflectance to enhance the accuracy and robustness of AGB estimation. More specifically, we utilized the continuous change detection and classification (CCDC) algorithm for temporal modeling of Landsat reflectance, followed by estimation of forest AGB with a random forest (RF) algorithm using the temporal information extracted by the CCDC model as input. The AGB estimation method was developed using in situ AGB measurements in Australia (10304 plots, range: [0.05, 936] tons/ha, mean: 153 tons/ha) and Landsat 5/7/8 data. Plot-scale results show that the overall reflectance derived by the CCDC model outperformed the annual mean reflectance when used in RF to estimate AGB because the overall reflectance is more robust to noisy or missing data. Introducing the CCDC model parameters into the RF model further improved estimation accuracy. The use of overall reflectance plus temporal parameters in AGB estimation increased R-2 to 0.60 and reduced RMSE to 72.9 tons/ha, compared to using annual mean reflectance (R-2 of 0.45 and RMSE of 85.7 tons/ha). This improvement may be attributed to CCDC model better capturing temporal changes in reflectance as the solar angle changes between seasons. Those changes relate to forest canopy coverage, width, and height, which are linked to AGB. Regional analysis for a 19,000-km(2) area in Western Australia showed that this approach could characterize different types of forest AGB change over a 30 years period (1990-2019), including both gradual and sudden AGB losses and gains from, e.g., forest disturbance and management activities. This AGB estimation method has the potential to mitigate noisy or missing data and could be applied to large-scale forest biomass monitoring using the rich Landsat data archive.

TI  - Evaluation of the Indications for Sentinel Node Biopsy in Early-Stage Melanoma with the Advent of Adjuvant Systemic Therapy: An International, Multicenter Study
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Patients presenting with early-stage melanoma (AJCC pT1b-pT2a) reportedly have a relatively low risk of a positive SNB (similar to 5-10%). Those patients are usually found to have low-volume metastatic disease after SNB, typically reclassified to AJCC stage IIIA, with an excellent prognosis of similar to 90% 5-year survival. Currently, adjuvant systemic therapy is not routinely recommended for most patients with AJCC stage IIIA melanoma. The purpose was to assess the SN-positivity rate in early-stage melanoma and to identify primary tumor characteristics associated with high-risk nodal disease eligible for adjuvant systemic therapyMethods. An international, multicenter retrospective cohort study from 7 large-volume cancer centers identified 3,610 patients with early primary cutaneous melanomas 0.8-2.0 mm in Breslow thickness (pT1b-pT2a; AJCC 8th edition). Patient demographics, primary tumor characteristics, and SNB status/details were analyzed.Results. The overall SNB-positivity rate was 11.4% (412/3610). Virtually all SNB-positive patients (409/412; 99.3%) were reclassified to AJCC stage IIIA. Multivariate analysis identified age, T-stage, mitotic rate, primary site and subtype, and lymphovascular invasion as independent predictors of sentinel node status. A mitotic rate of >1/mm(2) was associated with a significantly increased SN-positivity rate and was the only significant independent predictor of high-risk SNB metastases (>1 mm maximum diameter).Conclusions. The new treatment paradigm brings into question the role of SNB for patients with early-stage melanoma. The results of this large international cohort study suggest that a reevaluation of the indications for SNB for some patients with early-stage melanoma is required.

TI  - Pre-OPerative accelerated radiotherapy for early stage breast cancer patients (POPART): A feasibility study
T2  - RADIOTHERAPY AND ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Pre-operative 5-fraction breast radiotherapy followed by immediate breast-sparing surgery and sentinel node procedure was feasible in 14 patients with 15 clinical early-stage breast cancers. However wound problems occurred frequently and was documented in 5 of the 14 patients: 2 patients with a mastitis needing antibiotics, 2 patients developed a fistula with exudate needing antibiotics and local disinfection and 1 patient developed a fistula needing surgical reintervention. Other acute and late iatrogenic events were rather limited. Two patients had a pathological lymph node involvement, which underlines the importance to perform the sentinel node procedure before pre-operative radiotherapy. (c) 2022 The Authors.

TI  - High-resolution mapping of losses and gains of Earth's tidal wetlands
T2  - SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal wetlands are expected to respond dynamically to global environmental change, but the extent to which wetland losses have been offset by gains remains poorly understood. We developed a global analysis of satellite data to simultaneously monitor change in three highly interconnected intertidal ecosystem types-tidal flats, tidal marshes, and mangroves-from 1999 to 2019. Globally, 13,700 square kilometers of tidal wetlands have been lost, but these have been substantially offset by gains of 9700 km(2), leading to a net change of -4000 km(2) over two decades. We found that 27% of these losses and gains were associated with direct human activities such as conversion to agriculture and restoration of lost wetlands. All other changes were attributed to indirect drivers, including the effects of coastal processes and climate change.

TI  - Demystifying LandTrendr and CCDC temporal segmentation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Improved access to remotely sensed imagery and time series algorithms in combination with increased availability of cloud computing resources and platforms such as Google Earth Engine have significantly expanded the community of users processing and analyzing time series of satellite observations. Though individual time series analysis methods and their applications tend to be well-documented, comparisons of different approaches are beneficial to new users faced with the choice of different algorithms and parameterizations. We review two temporal segmentation approaches that have become increasingly prevalent in land cover mapping and monitoring: LandTrendr (Landsat-based detection of Trends in Disturbance and Recovery) and CCDC (Continuous Change Detection and Classification). We examine differences in the way these approaches use the temporal and spectral domains and compare model specifications and outputs. This review highlights previous work and applications, current limitations, ongoing challenges, and opportunities for future integration and comparison of methods and map products, and is expected to benefit both user and developer communities.

TI  - Multisensor approach to land use and land cover mapping in Brazilian Amazon
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing has an important role in the Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) mapping process worldwide. Combining spaceborne optical and microwave data is essential for accurate classification in areas with frequent cloud cover, such as tropical regions. In this study, we investigate the possible improvements, when SAR data is incorporated into the classification process along with optical data. We used MSI/Sentinel-2 and SAR/Sentinel-1 to provide LULC mapping in the Roraima State, Brazil, in 2019. This State is located in a tropical area, where the cloud cover is frequent over the year. Cloud cover becomes substantial, especially during the May-August period when crops are grown. Twenty-nine scenarios involving a combination of optical-and SAR-based features, as well as times of data acquisition, were considered in this study. Our results showed that optical or SAR data used individually are not enough to provide accurate LULC mapping. The best results in terms of overall accuracy (OA) were achieved using metrics of multi-temporal surface reflectance and vegetation index (VI) for optical imagery, and values of backscatter coefficient in different polarizations and their ratios yielding an OA of 86.41 +/- 1.74%. Analysis of three periods of data (January to April, May to August, and September to December) used for classification allowed us to identify the optimal period for distinguishing specific classes. When comparing our LULC map with a LULC product derived within the MapBiomas project we observed that our method per -formed better to map annual and perennial crops and water classes. Our methodology provides a more accurate LULC for the Roraima State, and the proposed technique can be applied to benefit other regions that are affected by persistent cloud cover.

TI  - An approach to fill in missing data from satellite imagery using data-intensive computing and DINEOF
T2  - PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes an approach to fill in missing data from satellite images using data-intensive computing platforms. The proposed approach merges satellite imagery from diverse sources to reduce the impact of the holes in images that result from acquisition conditions: occlusion, the satellite trajectory, sunlight, among others. The amount of computation effort derived from the use of large high-resolution images is addressed by data-intensive computing techniques that assume an underlying cluster architecture. As a start, satellite data from the region of study are automatically downloaded; then, data from different sensors are corrected and merged to obtain an orthomosaic; finally, the orthomosaic is split into user-defined segments to fill in missing data, and filled segments are assembled to produce an orthomosaic with a reduced amount of missing data. As a proof of concept, the proposed data-intensive approach was implemented to study the concentration of chlorophyll at the Mexican oceans by merging data from MODIS-TERRA, MODIS-AQUA, VIIRS-SNPP, and VIIRS-JPSS-1 sensors. The results revealed that the proposed approach produces results that are similar to state-of-the-art approaches to estimate chlorophyll concentration but avoid memory overflow with large images. Visual and statistical comparison of the resulting images revealed that the proposed approach provides a more accurate estimation of chlorophyll concentration when compared to the mean of pixels method alone.

TI  - Mechanisms of homonym transformations: on Catholic variants of Stalinist discourse in Poland
T2  - SEMIOTICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite its anti-religious character, totalitarian discourse, in the years 1949-1956 filling the entire space of Polish official culture, had its Catholic segment. Within this segment, there occurred a transformation of the religious net of concepts into semantic units of totalitarian language, a transformation of Catholic worldview narratives into Stalinist ones. This text aims to describe the semiotic mechanisms of such transformation. The relations between the initial semiosphere of language and the sub-semiosphere of its totalitarian variant are described. Presented here is a proposal for a theoretical description of the transformation of signs and texts of natural language into totalitarian ones, and an analysis of its possible strategies: renomination of signs, resemantization of texts, and incorporation of signs and texts from foreign semiotic fields. The material analyzed here comes mainly from the weekly magazine Dzis i Jutro and from other parts of the discursive field of Polish Catholic journalism, which tended towards the official discourse, including periodicals of the circles of Catholic priests ready to institutionally cooperate with the communist authorities.

TI  - Noninvasive assessment of gut function using transcriptional recording sentinel cells
T2  - SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Transcriptional recording by CRISPR spacer acquisition from RNA endows engineered Escherichia coli with synthetic memory, which through Record-seq reveals transcriptome-scale records. Microbial sentinels that traverse the gastrointestinal tract capture a wide range of genes and pathways that describe interactions with the host, including quantitative shifts in the molecular environment that result from alterations in the host diet, induced inflammation, and microbiome complexity. We demonstrate multiplexed recording using barcoded CRISPR arrays, enabling the reconstruction of transcriptional histories of isogenic bacterial strains in vivo. Record-seq therefore provides a scalable, noninvasive platform for interrogating intestinal and microbial physiology throughout the length of the intestine without manipulations to host physiology and can determine how single microbial genetic differences alter the way in which the microbe adapts to the host intestinal environment.

TI  - Coastline detection in satellite imagery: A deep learning approach on new benchmark data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed and up-to-date coastline morphology data underpins our understanding of coastline change over time. The development of an automated and scalable coastline extraction methodology from satellite imagery is currently limited by the low availability of open, globally distributed and diverse labelled data with which to develop and benchmark techniques. Therefore, in this study we present the Sentinel-2 Water Edges Dataset (SWED), a new and bespoke labelled image dataset for the development and bench-marking of techniques for the automated extraction of coastline morphology data from Sentinel-2 images. Composed of 16 labelled training Sentinel-2 scenes, and 98 test label-image pairs, SWED is globally distributed and contains examples of many different coastline types and natural and anthropogenic coastline features. To provide a baseline of model performance against SWED we train and test four convolutional neural network models, based on the U-Net model architecture. Models are optimised using Categorical Cross-entropy Loss, Sorensen-Dice Loss and two novel loss functions we present for the focusing of model training attention to the boundary between land and water. Through a hybrid quantitative and qualitative model assessment process we demonstrate that the model trained using our novel Sobel-edge loss function has greater sensitivity to fine-scale, narrow coastline features whilst possessing near top quantitative performance demonstrated by Categorical Cross-entropy. The SWED dataset is published openly for use by the remote sensing and machine learning communities, whilst the Sobel-edge loss is available for use in machine learning applications where sensitivity to boundary features is important.

TI  - Surface Environmental Evolution Monitoring in Coal Mining Subsidence Area Based on Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The exploitation of mineral resources is crucial for cost-effective construction but has also led to severe damage to the ecological environment in mining areas. Therefore, it is particularly important to effectively monitor surface environmental problems in the mining subsidence area caused by the exploitation of mineral resources. Herein, the Huinong coal mining subsidence area, Shizuishan city, Ningxia, China, was taken as the study area. The remote sensing image features of various environmental elements were investigated through field investigations, the measured spectra, and image spectrum contrast analysis. On this basis, an object-oriented random forest classification method was used to classify images from different time phases and sources in coal mining subsidence areas. Next, the man-machine interactive interpretation was confirmed by referring to the pre-classification results. By overlaying the interpretation result map and analyzing the land-use class changes, the spatial-temporal evolution monitoring of the surface environment in the coal mining subsidence area from 1979 to 2018 was carried out. The results show that the surface environment in the coal mining subsidence area has undergone significant changes over the past 40 years, among which-from 1979 to 2003-the environment of the coal mining area was severely damaged by the intensive mining activities. The area of cultivated land and vegetation coverage decreased sharply, while the area of other land-use classes, such as coal heaps, water bodies, and coal gangue, exhibited a trend of rapid growth. From 2003 to 2018, after more than 10 years of mine geological environment renovation and management, the surface environment of the coal mining subsidence area greatly improved, among which the vegetation coverage has shown the fastest growth rate, while the area of coal gangue, badlands, and other land-use classes have significantly reduced. The hidden dangers of geological disasters have been drastically mitigated. In addition, the residential area continued to decrease in the early stages and then rebounded to a certain extent, indicating that urbanization was carried out at the same time as the ecological environment began to improve. The surface environment before and after the renovation is consistent with the results from remote sensing monitoring.

TI  - Near-real-time monitoring of land disturbance with harmonized Landsats 7-8 and Sentinel-2 data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land disturbance can increase carbon emissions, cause detrimental environmental impacts, and threaten human life and property. Monitoring land disturbance in near-real-time is essential to mitigate their negative effects and prevent future losses. However, rapid and timely monitoring of land disturbance at a high spatial resolution is in its infancy. Here, we developed an algorithm for Near-Real-Time MOnitoring of laNd dIsturbance based on Time series of harmOnized Reflectance (NRT-MONITOR) from Landsats 7-8 and Sentinel-2 data at 30-m spatial resolution. It incorporates an online recursive algorithm called Forgetting Factor to improve efficiency in the determination of land disturbance to get fast detection based on the harmonized data. This algorithm is developed and validated by using 1200 samples created from the harmonized Landsats 7-8 and Sentinel-2 time series from 2015 to 2019 within the conterminous United States (CONUS). An overall accuracy of 70% has been achieved for monitoring a variety of land disturbance types. NRT-MONITOR improves the processing efficiency (11.5 times faster) compared to the COLD algorithm (Zhu et al., 2020). The mean time lag of NRT-MONITOR, defined as the delta days of confirming a land disturbance after its occurrence, is only 35 days, which is achieved by using the harmonized Landsats 7-8 and Sentinel-2 observations and reduced number of clear observations (from six to four) needed to confirm a land disturbance. Finally, NRT-MONITOR can be integrated into an alerting system to provide potential land disturbance probability maps that are updated every three days.

T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study uses interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) techniques to identify and track earthquake-induced landslides as well as lands prone to landslides, by detecting deformations in areas struck by earthquakes. The pilot study area investigates the Mila region in Algeria, which suffered significant landslides and structural damage (earthquake: M-w 5, 7 August 2020). DInSAR analysis shows normal interferograms with small fringes. The coherence change detection (CCD) and DInSAR analysis were able to identify many landslides and ground deformations also confirmed by Sentinel-2 optical images and field inspection. The most important displacement (2.5 m), located in the Kherba neighborhood, caused severe damage to dwellings. It is worth notice that CCD and DInSAR are very useful since they were also able to identify ground cracks surrounding a large zone (3.94 km(2) area) in Grarem City, whereas the Sentinel-2 optical images could not detect them. Although displacement time-series analysis of 224 interferograms (April 2015 to September 2020) performed using LiCSBAS did not detect any pre-event geotechnical precursors, the post-event analysis shows a 110 mm yr(-1) subsidence velocity in the back hillside of Kherba.

T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic microdebris (particles of < 5 mm) are a worldwide concern because they can affect the community structure of the aquatic ecosystems, organisms, and even food webs. For the biomonitoring of synthetic microdebris (especially microplastics, MPs), mainly benthic invertebrates are used, but crabs have been less studied in the literature. We studied the synthetic microdebris contamination in water, sediments, and three representative intertidal crabs (Neohelice granulata, Cyrtograpsus angulatus and Leptuca uruguayensis) with different lifestyles from the Bahia Blanca estuary, Argentina. The results obtained show the presence of cotton-polyamide (PA), polyethylene (PE), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) in surface waters. In sediments, we identified cellulose modified (CE), polyester (PES), polyethylene (PE), and alkyd resin, while in crabs, cotton-PA and CE were the predominant ones. The MPs abundance ranged from 8 to 68 items L-1 in surface water, from 971 to 2840 items Kg(-1) in sediments, and from 0 to 2.58 items g-1 ww for the three species of crabs. Besides, paint sheets ranged from 0 to 17 in the total samples, with Cr, Mo, Ti, Pb,

TI  - A global long-term (1981-2019) daily land surface radiation budget product from AVHRR satellite data using a residual convolutional neural network
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - The surface radiation budget, also known as all-wave net radiation (R-n), is a key parameter for various land surface processes including hydrological, ecological, agricultural, and biogeochemical processes. Satellite data can be effectively used to estimate R-n, but existing satellite products have coarse spatial resolutions and limited temporal coverage. In this study, a point-surface matching estimation (PSME) method is proposed to estimate surface R-n using a residual convolutional neural network (RCNN) integrating spatially adjacent information to improve the accuracy of retrievals. A global high-resolution (0.05 degrees), long-term (1981-2019), and daily mean R-n product was subsequently generated from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data. Specifically, the RCNN was employed to establish a nonlinear relationship between globally distributed ground measurements from 522 sites and AVHRR top-of-atmosphere (TOA) observations. Extended triplet collocation (ETC) technology was applied to address the spatial-scale mismatch issue resulting from the low spatial support of ground measurements within the AVHRR footprint by selecting reliable sites for model training. The overall independent validation results show that the generated AVHRR Rn product is highly accurate, with R-2, root-mean-square error (RMSE), and bias of 0.84, 26.77 W m(-2) (31.54 %), and 1.16 W m(-2) (1.37 %), respectively. Inter-comparisons with three other R-n products, i.e., the 5 km Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS); the 1 degrees Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES); and the 0.5 degrees x 0.625 degrees Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2), illustrate that our AVHRR R-n retrievals have the best accuracy under most of the considered surface and atmospheric conditions, especially thick-cloud or hazy conditions. However, the performance of the model needs to be further improved for the snow/ice cover surface. The spatiotemporal analyses of these four R-n datasets indicate that the AVHRR R-n product reasonably replicates the spatial pattern and temporal evolution trends of R-n observations. The long-term record (1981-2019) of the AVHRR R-n product shows its value in climate change studies.

TI  - Exploration of urbanization characteristics and their effect on the urban thermal environment in Chengdu, China
T2  - BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - As rapid urbanization has drastically and widely altered the Earth's surface, urbanization has become an important contributor to changes in land surface temperature (LST) and the urban thermal environment, which has increasingly become a focus of urban ecologists and environmentalists. The present study used one of the fastest-growing cities in Southwest China, Chengdu city, as an example to explore the urbanization pattern and its effects on surface urban heat islands (SUHIs). To analyze the temporal and spatial characteristics of urban expansion, land use or land cover (LULC) images were classified using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier from Landsat images in 2004-2018, with an overall accuracy of 0.94 and kappa coefficient of 0.90. According to the spatiotemporal LULC changes, Chengdu city expanded at a rapid pace from 80.43 km2/a to 210.50 km2/a in 2004-2018, with an increasing reliance on vegetation area conversion. Spatially imbalanced expansion also occurred. The gravity center moved toward the southeast overall, and peripheral circle districts were the main force of Chengdu's urban expansion compared to the slow-expanding core districts. An allometric model was used to analyze the urbanization pattern, and the results indicated that expansion in Chengdu city was far in excess of its corresponding population growth. The SUHI effect in Chengdu mostly deteriorated over time, and SUHI deterioration closely correlated with the urban expansion area rate and expansion intensity. Therefore, excess urbanization at the expense of vegetation decrease damages the urban ecological environment and accelerates SUHI effects, which threaten habitat health and living comfort.

TI  - Advances in Seismo-LAI anomalies detection within Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays, satellite data is an appropriate and undeniable source for studying earthquake precursors due to their diversity, wide coverage, being up to date and low cost. Time series analysis of satellite data plays an important role in the process of detecting seismic anomalies in earthquake warning systems. But in order to reduce uncertainty during the seismic anomalies detection, it is necessary the use a variety of satellite data, although it leads to increase of data size and processing time. This paper aims to explain the role of Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform in considerable progress of seismo-Lithospheric Atmospheric Ionospheric (LAI) anomalies detection in earthquake early warning systems. Among the different studied earthquakes, for example two recent powerful earthquakes in Japan (13 February and 20 March 2021) have been discussed. Deduced time series of three precursors (i.e. Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT), Chlorophyll and Ozone) from GEE platform were investigated using Median method and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to detect potentially seismo-LAI anomalies. Our satisfactory results show that with the addition of other various satellite data and also known predictors intelligent algorithms such as deep learning to GEE platform, we will see a significant leap forward in studies of earthquake precursors.

TI  - Significant reduction of carbon stocks and changes of ecosystem service valuation of Indian Sundarban
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sundarban mangrove or tidal influenced natural ecosystem is extremely productive and providing multiple goods and services to millions of people. In the last few decades, the quality and quantity of mangrove ecosystem are being deteriorated. The main objectives of this current research are (i) to investigate the ecosystem service values (ESVs) using a time series satellite data (1975, 2000 and 2020) and different unit values (ii) to analyze the dynamic pattern of carbon sequestration through InVEST model and (iii) determination of ESVs change hotspots by Getis-Ord Gi* method. Here, mangrove forest has the highest ecosystem service value and highest carbon sinker. The total loss of ESVs was estimated 3310.79 million USD during last 45 years in Sundarban Biosphere Reserve (SBR) due to high natural and anthropogenic adversities. InVEST model also revealed that the total static carbon storage over the study area was 48.87, 46.65 and 43.33 Tg for the year 1975, 2000 and 2020 respectively. Total 6313944 mg/6.31Tg loss of carbon has been observed in the case of mangrove forest during the overall study period (1975-2020). So, illegal human encroachment should be strictly (through law and regulations) restricted within Sundarban mangrove ecosystem for the benefits of people.

TI  - A ultrasound-based radiomic approach to predict the nodal status in clinically negative breast cancer patients
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In breast cancer patients, an accurate detection of the axillary lymph node metastasis status is essential for reducing distant metastasis occurrence probabilities. In case of patients resulted negative at both clinical and instrumental examination, the nodal status is commonly evaluated performing the sentinel lymph-node biopsy, that is a time-consuming and expensive intraoperative procedure for the sentinel lymph-node (SLN) status assessment. The aim of this study was to predict the nodal status of 142 clinically negative breast cancer patients by means of both clinical and radiomic features extracted from primary breast tumor ultrasound images acquired at diagnosis. First, different regions of interest (ROIs) were segmented and a radiomic analysis was performed on each ROI. Then, clinical and radiomic features were evaluated separately developing two different machine learning models based on an SVM classifier. Finally, their predictive power was estimated jointly implementing a soft voting technique. The experimental results showed that the model obtained by combining clinical and radiomic features provided the best performances, achieving an AUC value of 88.6%, an accuracy of 82.1%, a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 78.2%. The proposed model represents a promising non-invasive procedure for the SLN status prediction in clinically negative patients.

TI  - Tropical wetlands and land use changes: The case of oil palm in neotropical riverine floodplains
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil palm plantations are expanding in Latin America due to the global demand for food and biofuels, and much of this expansion has occurred at expense of important tropical ecosystems. Nevertheless, there is limited knowledge about effects on aquatic ecosystems near to oil palm-dominated landscapes. In this study, we used Landsat 7 ETM+, Landsat 8 OLI imagery and high-resolution images in Google Earth to map the current extent of oil palm plantations and determined prior land use land cover (LULC) in the Usumacinta River Basin as a case-study site. In addition, we assess the proximity of the crop with aquatic ecosystems distributed in the Usumacinta floodplains and their potential effects. Based on our findings, the most significant change was characterized by the expansion of oil palm crop areas mainly at expenses of regional rainforest and previously intervened lands (e.g. secondary vegetation and agriculture). Although aquatic ecosystem class (e.g. rivers, lagoons and channels) decreased in surface around 3% during the study period (2001-2017), the change was not due to the expansion of oil palm lands. However, we find that more than 50% of oil palm cultivations are near (between 500 and 3000 m) to aquatic ecosystems and this could have significant environmental impacts on sediment and water quality. Oil palm crops tend to spatially concentrate in the Upper Usumacinta ecoregion (Guatemala), which is recognized as an area of important fish endemism. We argue that the basic information generated in this study is essential to have better land use decision-making in a region that is relative newcomer to oil palm boom.

TI  - Improving long-term impervious surface percentage mapping in mountainous areas based on multi-source remote sensing data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Complex terrain and a lack of reference data pose challenges to long-term impervious surface percentage (ISP) mapping in mountainous areas. In this paper, a long-term ISP inversion method based on multi-source data collected in mountainous areas is developed. First, the impervious surfaces in 2019 were extracted by combining the Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1, and terrain data to obtain the ISP reference data. Then, invariant sample sets for 1990, 2000, and 2010 were constructed based on the publicly available land cover products and reference data. Finally, regression models were designed to invert the long-term ISP. The results show that the fusion of multi-source data can improve the classification accuracy in mountainous areas, and the sample construction method can ensure the efficiency and objectivity of the inversion. The root mean square error values of the inversion results are 7.84%-13.34%. This method provides decision-making support for urban planning and a theoretical basis for environmental protection.

TI  - Measurement of <i>in-vivo</i> spectral reflectance of bottom types: Implications for remote sensing of shallow waters
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Field spectroscopy data serve as a standard for the inter-comparisons, calibration and validation of remote sensing data. It also greatly assists in the detection, characterization and mapping of the earth features from the satellite imagery. Strategies and methods for field-based spectro-radiometric measurements are well-established for land and deep ocean applications, however, there are certain challenges and limitations with respect to the shallow water coastal ecosystems. This paper focuses on the background theory, concepts, and measurement techniques of in-vivo sensing of benthic reflectance in shallow water environment. We investigated various measurement methods, influences of water column, air-water interface, sources of errors (introduced by experimental and environmental factors), and the correction methods that are involved in the determination of benthic substrate reflectance. Special emphasis is provided using in-vivo measurements made in the estuarine and shelf regions, illustrating the benthic substrate reflectance at various platforms, i.e., within the water column, above the water surface, at the top-of-atmosphere, in the air, and in a controlled (laboratory) environment. As part of the correction procedure, a new water column correction method is theoretically formulated and examined for varying water optical properties and water depth. A new step correction method is also developed (based on the additive approach) to correct the spectral reflectance measured by a full range spectroradiometer (350-2500 nm) that is in-built with two or more detectors. This study will have direct implications for improving the data quality of field-based spectro-radiometric measurements that are essential for shallow water remote sensing applications.(c) 2022 COSPAR.

TI  - Ecomorphological variation of the <i>Triatoma guasayana</i> wing shape in semi-arid Chaco region
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Triatoma guasayana (Hemiptera, Reduviidae), considered a secondary vector of Chagas disease, invades rural dwellings through flight dispersal during the warm season in semi-arid Chaco of Argentina. The objective of this study was to define and compare morphometrics features in the relative body size and wing shape of T. guasayana related to temperature and rainfall between spring, summer and end of summer. A total of 188 adults were collected in rural communities in the northwest of the province of C & PRIME;ordoba (central Argentina). Relative body size [body length (mm) / wing length (mm)] and 11 landmarks on the right wing were recorded. The temperature ( C) and precipitation (mm) data were extracted from the MODIS sensor and Terra Climate dataset, respectively. Correlations between climatic variables and morphological variation were analyzed using Partial Least Square (PLS). Males at the end of summer were smaller than those at spring or summer (F = 4.48; df = 2; p = 0.01), whereas females were similar in relative body size at all seasons (F = 0.76; df = 2; p = 0.47). The PLS in males showed a correlation between wing shape and temperature (r = 0.48; p = 0.03) and precipitation (r = 0.50; p = 0.02) while in females only the temperature was the correlation significant (r = 0.35; p = 0.03). Triatoma guasayana has elongated and thin wings in spring that become short and wide at the end of summer. The morphotype of early summer could allow sustained long-duration flights, while the morphotype of end of summer would be related to short flights, correlated with the dispersive behavior of the species. The results in this study suggest that wing morphology of T. guasayana has phenotypic plasticity, and that temperature and rainfall could be considered modulator factors during the developmental stage.

TI  - High-resolution (1 km) satellite rainfall estimation from SM2RAIN applied to Sentinel-1: Po River basin as a case study
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of satellite sensors to infer rainfall measurements has become a widely used practice in recent years, but their spatial resolution usually exceeds 10 km, due to technological limitations. This poses an important constraint on its use for applications such as water resource management, index insurance evaluation or hydrological models, which require more and more detailed information. In this work, the algorithm SM2RAIN (Soil Moisture to Rain) for rainfall estimation is applied to two soil moisture products over the Po River basin: a high-resolution soil moisture product derived from Sentinel-1, named S1-RT1, characterized by 1 km spatial resolution (500 m spacing), and a 25 (12.5 km spacing) product derived from ASCAT, resampled to the same grid as S1-RT1. In order to overcome the need for calibration and to allow for its global application, a parameterized version of SM2RAIN algorithm was adopted along with the standard one. The capabilities in estimating rainfall of each obtained product were then compared, to assess both the parameterized SM2RAIN performances and the added value of Sentinel-1 high spatial resolution. The results show that good estimates of rainfall are obtainable from Sentinel-1 when considering aggregation time steps greater than 1 d, since the low temporal resolution of this sensor (from 1.5 to 4 d over Europe) prevents its application for infer daily rainfall. On average, the ASCAT-derived rainfall product performs better than S1-RT1, even if the performances are equally good when 30 d accumulated rainfall is considered (resulting in a mean Pearson correlation for the parameterized SM2RAIN product of 0.74 and 0.73, respectively). Notwithstanding this, the products obtained from Sentinel-1 outperform those from ASCAT in specific areas, like in valleys inside mountain regions and most of the plains, confirming the added value of the high-spatial-resolution information in obtaining spatially detailed rainfall. Finally, the performances of the parameterized products are similar to those obtained with the calibrated SM2RAIN algorithm, confirming the reliability of the parameterized algorithm for rainfall estimation in this area and fostering the possibility to apply SM2RAIN worldwide, even without the availability of a rainfall benchmark product.

TI  - Improving precipitable water vapor estimations of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) using metaheuristic algorithms
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Extracting Total Precipitable Water Vapor (TPW) and its variations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data on a local scale is challenging. Meta-heuristic algorithms have a high ability to solve complex engineering problems of hydrology and climatic studies. Hence, the present study extracts TPW values using meta-heuristic algorithms for MODIS surface reflectance data. In this regard, radiosonde observations of six stations in the western part of Iran during 2019 and 2020 were used as the ground truth data for training algorithms and evaluating the results. The results were also validated with Global Positioning System (GPS) TPW data of Tehran-Mehrabad station. Moreover, MODIS surface reflectance (MOD021) and cloud mask (MOD35) products were prepared to distinguish cloudy days from non-cloudy, along with MODIS TPW (MOD05) for corresponding dates. Meta heuristic algorithms, including Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Harmony Search (HS), Invasive Weed Optimization (IWO), Gray Wolf Optimization (GWO), and Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA), were applied to improve the performance of MOD05 algorithm. The results showed the proper performance of all the selected algorithms. Nevertheless, the GOA algorithm acquired the best result. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and R values obtained from comparing GOA results with radiosonde data were 2.96 mm and 0.82. Those values for comparing GOA results with GPS data were 2.94 mm and 0.83, respectively. However, MODIS TPW, RMSE, and R showed 6.53 mm and 0.69, respectively, compared to radiosonde data and 6.55 mm and 0.68 compared to GPS data. Overall, the results proved the proper performance of the used meta-heuristic algorithms in extracting TPW from MODIS measurements on a local scale. (C) 2022 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V.

T2  - ACS BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE & ENGINEERING
M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Lymph node mapping for tumor micrometastasis is of great significance for the prevention, prognosis, and treatment of cancer. Currently, the traditional clinical detection methods (computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or positron emission tomography/computed tomography) in clinical lymph node mapping still have some inherent disadvantages, which have prompted the development of various fluorescent probes for lymph node mapping. However, the conventional fluorescent probes such as indocyanine green or methylene blue in lymph node mapping are still accompanied by several problems such as impaired surgical field vision due to dye staining or less accumulation and shorter retention time in the lymph node. In a recent achievement, newly designed nanoparticles are prepared with novel properties that could be attractive for lymph node mapping. In this review, we will provide details on the progress of various nanoparticles for lymph node mapping and emphasize other multivariant properties in different nanoparticles, including strong tumor-targeting affinity and specificity, self-luminescence, and even with the function to kill metastatic cancer cells.

TI  - Urban growth and heat islands: A case study in micro-territories for urban sustainability
T2  - URBAN ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization contributes to the development of phenomena such as climate variability, especially in tropical countries, which negatively impact ecosystems and humans, factors that influence urban sustainability. Additionally, the increase of building construction prevents the flow of wind streams contributing to the retention of pollutants and hot air masses, causing events such as urban heat islands (UHI). This study aimed to analyze from the micro-territorial level, the influence of urban growth on the UHI phenomenon over the last two decades (2000-2020) in the locality of Kennedy, in Bogota, Colombia. For this purpose, environmental and socio-economic factors were evaluated. For the former, Landsat satellite images and spectral indices were used to evaluate the spatial-temporal variation in the quantity and quality of vegetation, bodies of water, urbanized areas, impervious surfaces, as well as to calculate the land surface temperature and its distribution in the study area. With regard to the socio-economic factors, the variables considered for analysis were population density and energy consumption. Lastly, a principal component analysis was carried out to identify possible associations between the variables and to identify the contribution of each micro-territory to the UHI phenomenon in the study area. The spatio-temporal variations reveal a growing trend over time, especially in impermeable areas where several economic activities, vehicular traffic, and population density converge, which require certain actions to be prioritized in territorial planning and the addition of public green spaces in urban zones.

TI  - Drivers of productivity on the Agulhas Bank and the importance for marine ecosystems
T2  - DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Agulhas Bank, an area of broad continental shelf extending 250 km offshore of South Africa, sustains rich and productive fisheries. However, its primary production is driven by a complex mosaic of biophysical mech-anisms, highly variable in time and space. The key drivers include a system of multiple costal upwellings, complex shelf currents and an interaction with the powerful Agulhas current. The patterns of spatial and tem-poral variability of primary production on the Agulhas Bank are critical for the spawning and survival of early life stages of many commercially important species exploited along the coastline of South Africa. In particular, the ???chokka??? squid fishery is an important source of revenue for the Eastern Cape coastal region in South Africa, with low catch years causing socioeconomic hardship. After spawning on the Eastern Agulhas Bank, the squid paralarvae are thought to be transported west to the Central Agulhas Bank (CAB). This region is associated with a cool, productive, but rather intermittent, oceanic feature known as the ???cold ridge??? (CR). If and when it occurs, this feature could provide a sufficient amount of concentrated (relative to the background values) food for the paralarvae to survive during its passive or near-passive stage. To date, a long-term analysis of CR variability and the mechanisms associated with this has not been conducted. Here, we used a high-resolution biogeochemical ocean model (NEMO-MEDUSA) to investigate the drivers of the productivity on the Agulhas Bank, specifically in the vicinity of the CR. Evidence of the CR is found from November to April and variability in its strength and spatial extent is comparable to that observed in remote sensing data. Interannual variability in productivity on the CAB is correlated to wind stress and zonal currents with the most productive events associated with anomalous easterly winds and enhanced westward flow on the Bank. These events coincide with the existence of an intense CR, important for overall productivity on the Bank, which may impact the recruitment of chokka squid and other fish species. From this simulation, we observe a season of low productivity in 2012 which may potentially relate to the infamous low catch in 2013 which caused economic hardship in the area.

M3  - Article
AB  - The Digital Terrain Model (DTM) is an important dataset for various applications such as hydrology, environmental sciences, urban planning, etc. Majority of the satellite-based medium resolution (30 m - 90 m) Digital Surface Model (DSM) products are freely available and widely used around the world. The generation of a DTM from these products is a tedious process. In this paper, a simple algorithm is developed to classify the ground and non-ground pixels in the DSM. The algorithm is tested on ALOS - World 3 D 30 m (AW3D30) DSM for small patches in the cities of Chennai, Mumbai and Cairo. Based on general assumption of the minimum elevation difference that exists between the ground and non-ground objects a slope threshold is used to initially classify the DSM. The elevations of the classified pixels are then used iteratively to assign counter values to the pixels. These counter values are finally used to classify the data and the ground pixels are interpolated using Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) technique to generate the DTM. The proposed algorithm is quantitatively assessed and has a Type I error of 2.33%, Type II error of 1.67%, Total error of 2% and Kappa coefficient value of 96%. Additionally, R-2 and RMSE values of 0.9589 and +/- 0.429 m were observed when compared against a reference DTM.

TI  - Dust storm detection of a convolutional neural network and a physical algorithm based on FY-4A satellite data
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantitative identification of a dust storm weather is key to forecasting and early warning of dust storm disasters. However, traditional visibility ground-based measurements cannot be extended to regional observations. Remote sensing of dust storms is associated with large uncertainties in dust thresholds. For accurate quantification of the dust storm region, this study proposes a dust storm mask algorithm to identify dust storm in the Tarim Basin. The dust storm mask includes two algorithms to identify the dust storm outbreak and the spatial extent by using the Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (AGRI) on board the FY-4A satellite. A deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) is employed for the dust storm mask, and the AGRI bands 1-3, 5-6, and 11-13 are used as model parameters. A physical algorithm (PA) is adopted to construct a dust storm mask using three physical dust indices: the Normalized Difference Dust Index (NDDI(2.25 mu m-0.47 mu m)/( 2.25 mu m+0.47 mu m)), the Dust Ratio Index (DRI( 7.10 mu m/3.75 mu m)), and the Brightness Temperature Difference (BTD(3.75 mu m-13.50 mu m)). The results show that the CNN algorithm has a higher classification accuracy on dust storm detection compared to the PA. This advantage suggests that the CNN can effectively monitor large-scale dust storms. The dust storm identification results were compared and analyzed with the AGRI true color, Aerosol Optical Depth products, and Ultra Violet Aerosol Index products. (C) 2022 COSPAR.

TI  - Learning-Based Methods for Detection and Monitoring of Shallow Flood-Affected Areas: Impact of Shallow-Flood Spreading on Vegetation Density
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to investigate the impacts of shallow flood spreading on vegetation density using a time-series collection of Landsat images spanning 2012-2020. To do this, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Classification and Regression tree (CART) and Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Network (DL-CNN) algorithms were employed for flood-affected areas mapping and monitoring. The models were trained by using 214, 235, 230, and 219 ground truth data for years 2012, 2014, 2017 and 2020 respectively. Our accuracy assessment via the area under curve (AUC) method reveals that the DL-CNN outperforms the SVM, the RF and the CART models for detecting and mapping shallow-flood-affected areas. The findings of this study further revealed significant changes in the NDVI values within a period before and after flood occurrence. While the mean values of the NDVI were estimated 0.232, 0.221, 0.213, and 0.232 for years 2012, 2014, 2017, and 2020, respectively, prior to flood spreading, these values increased up to 0.464, 0.476, 0.355 and 0.444, respectively following flood occurrence. Furthermore, physical-chemical soil properties (e.g., clay, EC, Na, and MgHCO3), have grown considerably in the study region following the flood spreading.

TI  - Analysis and prediction of uniaxial compressive strength of icy lunar regolith under extreme temperature
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Water ice exists in the permanently shadowed region (PSR) of the moon. It can become a vital survival material for the lunar base and provide fuel for the moon to make the moon a relay station for deep space exploration. For in-situ sampling and detection of lunar water ice, the design of sampling equipment has to consider the mechanical properties of the icy lunar regolith (ILR) to be broken during the drilling process. According to the mineral and chemical composition of the soil in the PSR, basalt rocks and anorthosite rocks are selected as two basic raw materials to simulate lunar soil. Multiple sets of ILR simulated samples are prepared with different raw material ratios (five kinds), water content (5-25 wt%), dry density (bulk density, excluding water, 1.45-1.97 g/cm(3)), and temperature (-240 to-10 degrees C). Uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) tests are carried out on these samples. A comprehensive mapping model between the UCS and the above four factors is constructed using multiple nonlinear regression methods. Based on the existing remote sensing data, the relationships or hypotheses of the subsurface dry density, temperature, and water content with depth are given. Furthermore, the UCS and drillability grade of ILR are predicted to change with depth. The results show that the ratio of raw materials has far less influence on the UCS than the other three factors. When the sample temperature is lower than-180 degrees C, the degree of influence of temperature changes on the UCS is significantly reduced. The UCS of the sample increases nonlinearly with the increase of dry density. The samples have an extreme strength value in the saturated water content state. This study provides a standard for the design of the equipment for drilling detection of water ice and lays a foundation for presetting operating procedures of the drilling tool. (C) 2022 COSPAR.

TI  - Combined UV and IR ozone profile retrieval from TROPOMI and CrIS measurements
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Vertical ozone profiles from combined spectral measurements in the ultraviolet and infrared spectral range were retrieved by using data from the TROPO-spheric Monitoring Instrument on the Sentinel-5 Precursor (TROPOMI/S5P) and the Cross-track Infrared Sounder on the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (CrIS/SuomiNPP), which are flying in loose formation 3 min apart in the same orbit. A previous study of ozone profiles retrieved exclusively from TROPOMI UV spectra showed that the vertical resolution in the troposphere is clearly limited (Mettig et al., 2021). The vertical resolution and the vertical extent of the ozone profiles is improved by combining both wavelength ranges compared to retrievals limited to UV or IR spectral data only. The combined retrieval particularly improves the accuracy of the retrieved tropospheric ozone and to a lesser degree stratospheric ozone up to 30 km. An increase in the degrees of freedom (DOF) by 1 DOF was found in the UV + IR retrieval compared to the UV-only retrieval. Compared to previous publications, which investigated combinations of UV and IR observations from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument and Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (OMI and TES) and Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment version 2 and Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (GOME-2 and IASI) pairs, the degree of freedom is lower, which is attributed to the reduced spectral resolution of CrIS compared to TES or IASI. Tropospheric lidar and ozonesondes were used to validate the ozone profiles and tropospheric ozone content (TOC). In their comparison with tropospheric lidars, both ozone profiles and TOCs show smaller biases for the retrieved data from the combined UV + IR observation than from the UV observations alone. For the ozone profiles below 10 km, the mean differences are around +/- 10 % and the mean TOC varies around +/- 3 DU. We show that TOCs from the combined retrieval agree better with ozonesonde results at northern latitudes than the UV-only and IR-only retrievals and also have lower scatter. In the tropics, the IRonly retrieval shows the best agrement with TOCs derived from ozonesondes. While in general the TOCs show good agreement with ozonesonde data, the profiles have a positive bias of around 30 % between 10 and 15 km. The reason is probably a positive stratospheric bias from the IR retrieval. The comparison of the UV + IR and UV ozone profiles up to 30 km with the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) demonstrates the improvement of the UV + IR profile in the stratosphere above 18 km. In comparison to the UV-only approach the retrieval shows improvements of up to 10 % depending on latitude but can also show worse results in some regions and latitudes.

TI  - COST-G gravity field models for precise orbit determination of Low Earth Orbiting Satellites
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate time-variable Earth's gravity field information is important for precise orbit determination (POD) of low Earth orbiters (LEO). In particular the POD of altimeter satellites benefits from accurate modelling of the time-variable gravity field. The Combination Service for Time-variable Gravity Fields (COST-G) provides monthly gravity fields based on a combination of GRACE/GRACE-FO derived monthly gravity field solutions from different analysis centers. These monthly solutions are available with a latency of 2- 3 months. The monthly GRACE-FO gravity fields from June 2018 to June 2021 serve as base for a fitted signal model (FSM) of time-variable gravity that enables a few months prediction and therefore application in operational LEO POD. The combined monthly solutions themselves, as well as several variants of the FSM are used for GPS-based POD of Copernicus Sentinel-2 and -3 satellites flying at altitudes of 786 km and 814,5 km, respectively. The orbit results show a significant improvement when using both, the COST-G monthly and the new COST-G FSM gravity field models compared to results using existing long-term static gravity field models, including seasonal and trend estimates, as well. RMS values of the GPS carrier phase residuals are reduced up to 20%, orbit overlaps between 30-50%. Orbit validations performed by Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) also show that SLR residuals are reduced by about 10%. The COST-G FSMs show a similar performance as the monthly gravity fields. The LEO POD in particular benefits from the more realistic mass trend estimates in river basins with strong non-periodic inter-annual variations compared to the predicted trends of outdated long-term gravity fields. The FSM thus complements the monthly gravity fields as a new COST-G product. It is foreseen to update the COST-G FSM quarterly. (C) 2022 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Recent mass-balance changes of Agua Negra glacier (30°S) in the Desert Andes of Argentina
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Desert Andes contain >4500 ice masses, but only a handful are currently being monitored. We present the mass changes of the small mountain glacier Agua Negra (1 km(2)) and of the rest of glaciers in the Jachal river basin. Remote-sensing data show Agua Negra glacier lost 23% of its area during 1959-2019. Glaciological measurements during 2014-2021 indicate an average annual mass balance of -0.52 m w.e. a(-1), with mean winter and summer balances of 0.80 and -1.33 m w.e. a(-1), respectively. The Equilibrium Line Altitude (ELA) is estimated to be 5100 +/- 100 m a.s.l., which corresponds to an Accumulation Area Ratio (AAR) of 0.28 +/- 0.21. Geodetic data from SRTM X and Pleiades show a doubling of the loss rate from -0.32 +/- 0.03 m w.e. a(-1) in 2000-2013, to -0.66 +/- 0.06 m w.e. a(-1) in 2013-2019. Comparatively, the ice losses for the entire Jachal river basin (25 500 km(2)) derived from ASTER show less negative values, -0.11 +/- 16 m w.e. a(-1) for 2000-2012 and -0.23 +/- 14 m w.e. a(-1) for 2012-2018. The regional warming trend since 1979 and a recent decline in snow accumulation are probably driving the observed glacier mass balance.

TI  - Investigation of the Vegetation Coverage Dynamics and its Relation to Atmospheric Patterns in Kabul River Basin in Afghanistan
T2  - PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The variations in vegetation coverage (defined as the area with Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) > 0.2) and atmospheric patterns occurring during various vegetation seasons in the Kabul River Basin (KRB) in Afghanistan during 2001-2019 were analyzed. The analysis was done based on the NDVI, land surface temperature (LST), precipitation images from the remote sensing data, and geopotential height and temperature at 500 hPa from the retrospective datasets. The results revealed that the vegetation dynamics in KRB are impacted by both precipitation and LST. In the winter season, the LST has a more substantial role in shaping the vegetation dynamics than precipitation, while it is on contrary during the summer season. Cluster analysis showed that the four atmospheric patterns (e.g., Sub-Tropical High Pressure (STHP), Western European ridge-the Eastern Mediterranean and the Black Sea trough, Caspian Sea ridge (CSR), and the Mediterranean Sea trough-Central to Eastern Iran trough) can be identified and connected with the periods with the highest and the lowest vegetation coverage (VC) anomalies in the study area. The CSR and the Mediterranean Sea trough-the Central to Eastern Iran trough are the patterns responsible for the most positive VC anomalies. At the same time, the STHP and Western Europe ridge-the Eastern Mediterranean and the Black Sea trough are responsible for the most negative VC anomalies. As the atmospheric patterns have a significant role in shaping the vegetation status, a quick alert system to prevent agricultural areas from water or temperature stresses can be developed based on observations of them.

TI  - Shoreline change assessment of Indus delta using GIS-DSAS and satellite data
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Indus River Delta, Pakistan, is under continual threat of coastal erosion due to natural and anthropogenic activities. The variations in the shoreline position have significantly degraded agricultural lands, increased tidal floodplain areas, and subsequently affected the livelihood of the coastal communities under changing climatic scenarios. The present study was conducted to quantify the Indus delta shoreline variations using satellite data and the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS 4.3) integrated with ArcGIS software. The statistical parameters End Point Rate (EPR) and Linear regression rate (LRR) were used for estimation of the shoreline change rate, while Net Shoreline Movement (NSM) was used to estimate the net change in the shoreline from 1972 to 2017. The analysis of results revealed that the erosion of the shoreline was dominant over the accretion, which ranged between 1 to 160 m/year with a net erosion rate of 18.87 +/- 2.22 m/year. The net shoreline erosion rate was higher, i.e., 30.12 +/- 3.13 m/year on the left bank side of the river Indus, compared to that of on the right bank side, i.e., 6.34 +/- 2.85 m/year. The net landward shift in the shoreline of the delta from 1972 to 2017 was 860 +/- 92 m. The DSAS software integrated with ArcGIS could successfully be used for shoreline change analysis for similar river deltaic areas of the World. The study recommends the employment of mitigation measures for the protection of the shoreline of the Indus delta. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The SINODAR-ONE trial is a prospective noninferiority multicenter randomized study aimed at assessing the role of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in patients undergoing either breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy for T1-2 breast cancer (BC) and presenting one or two macrometastatic sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). The endpoints were to evaluate whether SLN biopsy (SLNB) only was associated with worsening of the prognosis compared with ALND in terms of overall survival (OS) and relapse. Methods Patients were randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to either removal of >= 10 axillary level I/II non-SLNs followed by adjuvant therapy (standard arm) or no further axillary treatment (experimental arm). Results The trial started in April 2015 and ceased in April 2020, involving 889 patients. Median follow-up was 34.0 months. There were eight deaths (ALND, 4; SNLB only, 4), with 5-year cumulative mortality of 5.8% and 2.1% in the standard and experimental arm, respectively (p = 0.984). There were 26 recurrences (ALND 11; SNLB only, 15), with 5-year cumulative incidence of recurrence of 6.9% and 3.3% in the standard and experimental arm, respectively (p = 0.444). Only one axillary lymph node recurrence was observed in each arm. The 5-year OS rates were 98.9% and 98.8%, in the ALND and SNLB-only arm, respectively (p = 0.936). Conclusions The 3-year survival and relapse rates of T1-2 BC patients with one or two macrometastatic SLNs treated with SLNB only, and adjuvant therapy, were not inferior to those of patients treated with ALND. These results do not support the use of routine ALND.

TI  - Fluorogenic and Mitochondria-Localizable Probe Enables Selective Labeling and Imaging of Nitroreductase
T2  - ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Nitroreductase (NTR), one of the flavin-dependent enzymes and an upregulated enzyme under tumor hypoxia, has been studied for decades. Many fluorescent probes were developed to detect NTR activity; however, these probes tend to diffuse away from their reaction site (NTR) inevitably, leading to inappropriate sample fixation, lower accuracy of NTR localization, and weaker signal-to-noise ratio. Herein, we present the design, synthesis, in vitro evaluation, and biological applications of an NTR-activatable fluorogenic and labeling probe FY. By integrating with quinone methide (QM) proximity-based protein labeling, the additional fluoromethyl group on FY serves as a potential origin of QM. Compared with conventional fluorescent probes, this new NTR probe not only offers mitochondrial localizable and fluorogenic response but also achieves permanent retention on the site of activation with an enhanced spatial resolution to improve the detection sensitivity even after cell fixation. We believe our work could offer an expandable synthetic approach to develop these permanent labeling and imaging fluorescence probes for deciphering complex biological events.

TI  - Monitoring the Wetland of the Yellow River Delta by Combining GF-3 Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar and Sentinel-2A Multispectral Data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands in estuary deltas functionally protect biodiversity, store water, and regulate ecological balance. However, wetland monitoring accuracy is low when using only synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images or optical images. This study proposes a novel method for extracting ground objects in a wetland using principal component analysis (PCA) and random forest (RF) classification, which combines the features of fully polarimetric SAR images and optical images. Firstly, polarization decomposition features and texture features were extracted based on polarimetric SAR data, and spectral features were extracted based on optical data. Secondly, the optical image was registered to SAR image. Then PCA was performed on the nine polarimetric features of the SAR images and the four spectral features of the optical images to obtain the first two principal components of each. After combining these components, a RF classification algorithm was used to extract the objects. The objects in the Yellow River Delta wetland were successfully extracted using our proposed method with Gaofen-3 fully polarimetric SAR data and Sentinel-2A optical data acquired in November 2018. The overall accuracy of the proposed method was 86.18%, and the Kappa coefficient was 0.84. This was an improvement of 18.96% and 0.22, respectively, over the GF-3 polarimetric features classification, and 11.02% and 0.13, respectively, over the Sentinel-2A spectral features classification. Compared with the results of the support vector machine, maximum likelihood, and minimum distance classification algorithms, the overall accuracy of the RF classification based on joint features was 2.03, 5.69, and 23.36% higher, respectively, and the Kappa coefficient was 0.03, 0.07, and 0.27 higher, respectively. Therefore, this novel method can increase the accuracy of the extraction of objects in a wetland, providing a reliable technical means for wetland monitoring.

TI  - Minimally invasive evaluation of the clinically negative inguinal node in penile cancer: Dynamic sentinel node biopsy
T2  - UROLOGIC ONCOLOGY-SEMINARS AND ORIGINAL INVESTIGATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The presence of lymph node metastasis is the most important prognostic factor in penile cancer (PeCa). Due to limited sensitivity of currently available imaging modalities, invasive staging approaches remain indispensable for adequate nodal staging. As an alternative to radical inguinal lymphadenectomy and with the aim to reduce morbidity, staging strategies such as modified lymphadenectomy and dynamic sentinel node biopsy ( DSNB) have been introduced. Over the years, DSNB evolved into a safe and reliable staging technique when performed in high volume centers. Recent enhancements of the procedure such as Single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) and the introduction of hybrid tracers have improved pre- and intraoperative sentinel node (SN) visualization. Other technologies such as superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles could have a potential future role to further refine DSNB. Future efforts should be aimed at optimizing diagnostic accuracy whilst minimizing perioperative morbidity. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Meta-Analysis of the Diagnostic Value of Tracer Staining Technology Based on Nanocarbon Suspension in Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy of Breast Cancer
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. To evaluate the diagnostic value of the nanometer carbon suspension tracer staining technique in sentinel lymph node biopsy of breast cancer is the objective of this study. Methods. The PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library (Central), and Web of Science (SCI Expanded), and Chinese databases (CNKI, VIP, Wan Fang, and CBM) were systematically searched for studies on the diagnostic value of nanocarbon suspension in sentinel lymph node biopsy of breast cancer. Two reviewers independently assessed the methodological quality of each study using the QUADAS-2 tool. The extracted valid data were calculated using Meta-Disc1.4 software and tested for heterogeneity. STATA14.0 software was selected for sensitivity analysis of the included studies, and publication bias was assessed using Deeks' forest plot asymmetry test. Results. A total of 10 studies were obtained. The pooled data were as follows: sensitivity, 0.92 (0.88~0.95); specificity, 0.99 (0.98~1.00); positive likelihood ratio, 69.24 (30.34~158.02); negative likelihood ratio, 0.09 (0.06~0.13); and the combined diagnostic odds ratio, 747.40 (285.77~1954.76), AUC=0.9881. Nanocarbon suspension tracers have an accuracy rate of 98.81% in the diagnosis of sentinel lymph nodes in breast cancer. Conclusion. Tracer staining technology based on nanocarbon suspension can accurately assess the status of lymph nodes in sentinel lymph node biopsy of breast cancer and has good stability and operability, which is worthy of clinical promotion.

TI  - Mapping irrigated, rainfed and paddy croplands from time-series Sentinel-2 images by integrating pixel-based classification and image segmentation on Google Earth Engine
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate distribution of irrigated, rainfed and paddy croplands is essential for food production and agricultural management. High spatial resolution land cover datasets rarely have detailed information about irrigated or rainfed croplands, while cropland datasets labelled with crop watering methods face challenges with coarse temporal and spatial resolution. This study proposed a semi-automatic detailed croplands mapping framework by integrating pixel-based classification and image segmentation. First, high-quality Sentinel-2 images were selected and mosaicked to time-series image dataset using Google Earth Engine platform. Second, pixel-based random forest classification and the Simple Non-Iterative Clustering image segmentation were integrated by optimal rules for generating 10-m resolution Detailed Croplands Map (DCM-2020). The DCM-2020 was assessed by using validation samples, and the overall accuracy of the map was 88.6% with kappa coefficient of 0.83. Compared with the existing cropland datasets, DCM-2020 shows much finer details, and croplands area is closer to official statistics.

TI  - Laboratory construction and curation scheme for returned samples of the chang'e-5 mission
T2  - GEOSCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The analysis of samples returned from a planetary body is important to understand the origin, composition, evolution, and interactions with space or atmospheric weathering of the planet. In particular, pristine rocks, which are not affected by weathering, can be collected during sampling work. The analysis of samples will significantly promote the calibration, verification, and interpretation of remote sensing data and will improve the knowledge of interior materials using geophysical measurements. The Chang'e-5 lander, the first Chinese science project involving the return of lunar samples, launched on November 24, 2020 and drilled a core sample that is almost 1 m long, and acquired less than 2 kg during this mission. Because of the preciousness of the returned samples, the CLESEC (China Lunar Exploration and Space Engineering Center) is planning to construct at least two laboratories, determine regulations for preserving samples from the Moon and other planets in future missions and develop non-damaging and/or minimally damaging technologies to analyze the returned samples. The CLESEC also announced standardized technologies and documentary regulations for preservation, measurement, and sharing schemes with scientists around the world. Based on the Apollo experiences, we have established detailed requirements and standardized conditions for constructing laboratories and curation with the aid of advanced technologies. We also discuss six potential demands for future sampling missions. Finally, we developed high-level criteria for future returning sample missions and relative curations that are beneficial to Chang'e-5 research and as well as preparation for other extraterrestrial samples in the near future.

TI  - Natural and anthropogenic forces on suspended sediment dynamics in Asian estuaries
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change and anthropogenic activities are affecting the hydrological conditions of rivers and may have altered nutrient and suspended sediments released into coastal seas. However, testing this hypothesis is difficult, confounded by the lack of observational data and the unavailability of globally accepted suspended sediment concentration (SSC) algorithms. Here, we analyzed the trends in SSC (2000-2020) at the mouths of 10 major Asian rivers using 10 available satellite-SSC algorithms. We identified spatially distinct trends, with SSC decreasing at the mouths of the Yellow, Pearl, and Indus rivers, and increasing trends at the mouths of the Narmada and Ganges-Brahmaputra rivers, while there were no significant trends at the mouths of the remaining rivers. River discharge, dams, and land use changes in basins individually did not suffice, but reproduced the observed SSC trends when used together. Our results imply that anthropogenic activities threaten the marine ecosystem more than climate forcing on Asian coasts.

TI  - High-resolution soil organic carbon mapping at the field scale in Southern Belgium (Wallonia)
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate soil organic carbon content estimation is critical as a proxy for carbon sequestration, and as one of the indicators for soil health. Here, we collected 497 soil samples during 2015 and 2019, as well as five environmental covariates (organic carbon (OC) input from the crops, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), elevation, clay content and precipitation) at a resolution of 30 m. We then aggregated these to represent agricultural fields and compiled a soil organic carbon (SOC) content map for the agricultural soils of Wallonia using Gradient Boosting Machine. We calculated OC input from both main crops and cover crops for each individual field. As the cover crops do not occur in the agricultural census, we identified cover crops based on long time series of NDVI values obtained from the Google Earth Engine platform. The quality of the SOC predictions was assessed by validation data and we obtained an R2 of 0.77. The Empirical Mode Decomposition indicated that OC input and NDVI were the dominant factors at field scale, whereas the remaining covariates determined the distribution of SOC at the scale of the entire Walloon region. The SOC map showed an overall northwest to southeast trend i.e. an increase in SOC contents up to the Ourthe river followed by a decrease further to the South. The map shows both regional trends in SOC and effects of differences in land use and/or management (including crop rotation and frequency of cover crops) between individual fields. The field-scale map can be used as a benchmark and reference to farmers and agencies in maintaining SOC contents at an appropriate level and optimizing decisions for sustainable land use.

TI  - Comparing geostationary and polar-orbiting satellite sensor estimates of Fire Radiative Power (FRP) during the Black Summer Fires (2019-2020) in south-eastern Australia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Background. We compared estimates of Fire Radiative Power (FRP) from sensors onboard geostationary Himawari-8 (BRIGHT_AHI) and polar-orbiting TERRA/AQUA (MOD14/MYD14) satellites during the 2019/2020 Black Summer Fires in South-Eastern Australia. Aim/methods. Analysis was performed on a pixel, bioregion, and wildfire event basis to assess the utility of the new BRIGHT_AHI FRP product. Key results. Results show a high agreement between the products (r = 0.74, P < 0.01) on a pixel level, with BRIGHT_AHI generally underestimating FRP compared to MOD14/MYD14. Regional spatiotemporal trends were captured in more detail by BRIGHT_AHI due to its higher temporal resolution, with MOD14/MYD14 systematically underestimating the total and sub-diurnal FRP values. Nevertheless, both datasets captured similar fire ignition and spread patterns for the study region. On the event level, the correlation between the datasets was moderate (r = 0.49, r = 0.67), when considering different temporal constraints for hotspot matching. Conclusions. The results of this study indicate that BRIGHT_AHI approximates the well-established MOD14/MYD14 product during concurrent observations, while revealing additional temporal information for FRP trends.

TI  - Analyzing the effectiveness of the ?Malki Practice? for conserving the Dang forest in Gujarat, India along with improving the socio-economic standards of the land holders
T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
M3  - Article
AB  - Looking to the present environmental crisis and the global trend of alarming deforestation, it is very important to study various forest management strategies to understand their effectiveness and advantages along with the bottlenecks and limitations. It is indeed very important to conserve the forests but the economic sustainability of the people directly linked with the forests cannot be ignored. Due to very limited availability of the socioeconomic data of the people directly dependent on forests (especially in the developing countries) and the lack of an inter-disciplinary approach interfacing the socio-economic data with the scientifically estimated forest area and its green cover density, not many studies could comprehensively bring out the effectiveness of a particular forest management approach. The present study is one of the first few studies which connects these two independent datasets and fetches the usefulness of the 'Malki Practice' driven forest management approach in the Dang forest of Gujarat, India. It uses the remotely sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to estimate the green cover density in the Dang forest, a statistical approach for assessing the type of trend in the NDVI (increasing / decreasing at different significance levels) and the socio-economic data generated by the state Forest Department regarding the earnings made through the sale of logs and the house-hold surveys. The 'environmental success' of the Malki Practice can be seen from the fact that 74% of the Dang forest witnessed an increasing trend in the green cover density which backs the fact that around one million plantations would have been done in the forest in-lieu of the 200,000 trees which were cut during 1994-2019 while the 'economic success' of the Malki Practice can be attributed to the fact that 19,936 land holders earned 39.4 million US Dollars through the sale of logs. Juxtaposing the 'environmental success' with the 'economic success' it can be inferred that the 'Malki Practice' of forest conservation adopted in the state of Gujarat, India is worth considering for being drawn upon or replicated in other parts of the world.

TI  - The diagnostic accuracy of intraoperative frozen section biopsy for diagnosis of sentinel lymph node metastasis in breast cancer patients: a meta-analysis
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Sentinel lymph node (SLN) sampling is important for evaluating the nodal stage of breast cancer when the axillary nodes are clinically free of metastasis. The intraoperative frozen section (IFS) of SLN is used for lymph node assessment. This meta-analysis aims to provide evidence about the diagnostic accuracy and the applicability of IFS of SLN in breast cancer patients. Data were collected by searching PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus, and Web of Science electronic databases for trials matching our eligibility criteria. The statistical analysis included the sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, and pooled studies' diagnostic odds ratio outcomes. The analyses were conducted using the Open Meta-analyst software. This meta-analysis pooled the results of 110 studies. The overall sensitivity of IFS for SLN metastasis was 74.7%; 95% CI [72.0, 77.2], P < 0.001. It was 31.4% 95% CI [25.2, 38.3], P < 0.001 for the micro-metastasis, and 90.2%; 95% CI [86.5, 93.0], P < 0.001 for the macro-metastasis. The overall specificity was 99.4%; 95% CI [99.2, 99.6], P < 0.001. The overall positive likelihood ratio was 121.4; 95% CI [87.9, 167.6], P < 0.001, and the overall negative likelihood ratio was 0.226; 95% CI [0.186, 0.274], P < 0.001. The overall diagnostic odds ratio of IFS for diagnosing SLN metastasis was 569.5; 95% CI [404.2, 802.4], P < 0.001. The intraoperative frozen section of SLN has good sensitivity for diagnosing breast cancer macro-metastasis. However, the sensitivity is low for micro-metastasis. The specificity is very satisfactory.

TI  - A spatio-temporal analysis of baboon damage using Sentinel-2 imagery and Extreme Gradient Boosting
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of remote sensing for forest health monitoring has increased in popularity over the years, improving quality, spatial and spectral resolutions. However, revisit times of satellites is too slow for real-time detection. The need exists for high resolution monitoring, to quantify biotic damage, which is more difficult to detect due to the diversity of severity. Sentinel-2 MSI data, with 10 - 60 m spatial resolution and 443 - 2190 nm spectral range was used. Through strategical bands and derived vegetation indices, an accuracy of 89,34% with a Kappa of 0.85 using XGboost, was achieved. The study found: (1) Sentinel-2 identified baboon damage with high accuracy, with field measured data (2) different damage severities could be distinguished. SAVI and SIPI were most influential variables, due to good discrimination of structural variations in the canopy. The method provides an accurate and repeatable framework for rapid damage mapping at a sub-compartment scale.

TI  - Increasing signs of forest fragmentation in the Cross River National Park in Nigeria: Underlying drivers and need for sustainable responses
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Protected areas are expectedly intact habitats for biodiversity and key for ecosystem conservation. However, where inadequately protected, human-induced forest fragmentation can degrade them and reduce their functioning. Therefore, monitoring forests in protected areas is essential to ascertain their protection. This paper assesses forest fragmentation in the Cross River National Park, a biodiversity hotspot in the tropical rainforest of Nigeria. Forest fragmentation was analyzed using the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response framework. Fragmentation analysis of the State used class-level pattern metrics on Landsat and Sentinel images from the years 2000, 2015 and 2020. Forest fragmentation has reduced total forest area, decreased average size of forest patches, increased the number of forest patches and amount of edge. Only the isolation of forest patches has not yet reached a measurable intensity. However, spatio-temporal forest fragmentation over the years 2000, 2015 and 2020 indicates a rising trend, especially between 2015 and 2020. The Drivers, Pressures, Impacts and Responses were investigated through a systematic literature review. Many studies show that the main proximate Drivers of forest fragmentation are agricultural activities mainly by the local communities, demand for forest resources by the growing population, and by external actors through illegal logging and infrastructure building, which have increased. However, wider literature highlight issues of disproportionately blaming local resource users, and the need to examine the neglect of justice, rights and local values, and their implications for sustainable protected areas. Reported Impacts include hindered migration of the endangered Cross River gorilla and impaired ecosystem services like water cycling, carbon sequestration and disease regulation. Responses have generally excluded the local communities, have failed or are yet to become effective. There is thus a need to identify, together with the involved actors, why measures have failed and to implement more sustainable options to reduce fragmentation in the park while addressing local users' needs.

TI  - A dataset of winter wheat aboveground biomass in China during 2007-2015 based on data assimilation
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - As a key variable to characterize the process of crop growth, the aboveground biomass (AGB) plays an important role in crop management and production. Process-based models and remote sensing are two important scientific methods for crop AGB estimation. In this study, we combined observations from agricultural meteorological stations and county-level yield statistics to calibrate a process-based crop growth model for winter wheat. After that, we assimilated a reprocessed temporal-spatial filtered MODIS Leaf Area Index product into the model to derive the 1 km daily AGB dataset of the main winter wheat producing areas in China from 2007 to 2015. The validation using ground measurements also suggests the derived AGB dataset agrees well with the filed observations, i.e., the R-2 is above 0.9, and the root mean square error (RMSE) reaches 1,377 kg center dot ha(-1). Compared to county-level statistics during 2007-2015, the ranges of R-2, RMSE, and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) are 0.73+/-0.89, 953+/-1,503 kg center dot ha(-1), and 8%+/-12%, respectively. We believe our dataset can be helpful for relevant studies on regional agricultural production management and yield estimation.

TI  - Detecting abrupt change in land cover in the eastern Hindu Kush region using Landsat time series (1988-2020)
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover change in the semi-arid environment of the eastern Hindu Kush region is driven by anthropogenic activities and environmental change impacts. Natural hazards, such as floods presumably influenced by climatic change, cause abrupt change of land cover. So far, little research has been conducted to investigate the spatiotemporal aspects of this abrupt change in the valleys. In order to explore the abrupt change in land cover and floods as its possible drivers in the eastern Hindu Kush, a semi-arid mountain region characterized by complex terrain, vegetation variation, and precipitation seasonality, we analyzed long-term Landsat image time series from 1988 to 2020 using Breaks For Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST). Overall, BFAST effectively detected abrupt change by using Landsat-derived Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI). The results of our study indicate that approximately 95% of the study area experienced at least one abrupt change during 1988-2020. The years 1991, 1995, 1998, 2007, and 2016 were detected as the peak years, with the peaks occurring in different seasons. The annual trend of abrupt change is decreasing for the study area. The seasonality of abrupt change at the catchment level shows an increasing trend in the spring season for the southern catchments of Panjkora and Swat. The spatial distribution patterns show that abrupt change is primarily concentrated in the floodplains indicating that flooding is the primary driver of the land cover change in the region. We also demonstrated the accurate detection of past flood events (2015) based on the two case examples of Ayun, Rumbur, and Kalash valleys. The detection of the flood events was verified by fieldwork and historical high-resolution Google Earth imagery. Finally, our study provides an example of applying Landsat time series in a dry mountain region to detect abrupt changes in land cover and analyze impact of natural hazards such as floods.

TI  - United States Military Fatalities During Operation Inherent Resolve and Operation Freedom's Sentinel
T2  - MILITARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Military operations provide a unified action and strategic approach to achieve national goals and objectives. Mortality reviews from military operations can guide injury prevention and casualty care efforts. Methods A retrospective study was conducted on all U.S. military fatalities from Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR) in Iraq (2014-2021) and Operation Freedom's Sentinel (OFS) in Afghanistan (2015-2021). Data were obtained from autopsy reports and other existing records. Fatalities were evaluated for population characteristics; manner, cause, and location of death; and underlying atherosclerosis. Non-suicide trauma fatalities were also evaluated for injury severity, mechanism of death, injury survivability, death preventability, and opportunities for improvement. Results Of 213 U.S. military fatalities (median age, 29 years; male, 93.0%; prehospital, 89.2%), 49.8% were from OIR, and 50.2% were from OFS. More OIR fatalities were Reserve and National Guard forces (OIR 22.6%; OFS 5.6%), conventional forces (OIR 82.1%; OFS 65.4%), and support personnel (OIR 61.3%; OFS 33.6%). More OIR fatalities also resulted from disease and non-battle injury (OIR 83.0%; OFS 28.0%). The leading cause of death was injury (OIR 81.1%; OFS 98.1%). Manner of death differed as more homicides (OIR 18.9%; OFS 72.9%) were seen in OFS, and more deaths from natural causes (OIR 18.9%; OFS 1.9%) and suicides (OIR 29.2%; OFS 6.5%) were seen in OIR. The prevalence of underlying atherosclerosis was 14.2% in OIR and 18.7% in OFS. Of 146 non-suicide trauma fatalities, most multiple/blunt force injury deaths (62.2%) occurred in OIR, and most blast injury deaths (77.8%) and gunshot wound deaths (76.6%) occurred in OFS. The leading mechanism of death was catastrophic tissue destruction (80.8%). Most fatalities had non-survivable injuries (80.8%) and non-preventable deaths (97.3%). Conclusions Comprehensive mortality reviews should routinely be conducted for all military operation deaths. Understanding death from both injury and disease can guide preemptive and responsive efforts to reduce death among military forces.

TI  - The socio-economic value of scientific publications: The case of Earth Observation satellites
T2  - TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper provides a conceptual framework to estimate the socio-economic benefits of new knowledge generated within research infrastructures from the scientific community's perspective. We use Earth Observation (EO) satellites as a case study. Constructing, operating, and exploiting cutting-edge EO infrastructures is generating a vast amount of knowledge ultimately embodied in scientific publications. Using bibliometric and machine learning techniques, we analyse 1,235 publications in 1998-2018 related to Cosmo Skymed, the EO satellites constellation of the Italian Space Agency. Thanks to these satellites, 2,377 authors from 160 institutions and 68 countries worldwide have contributed to various subjects in several scientific fields. By using the marginal social value method in a cost-benefit analysis perspective, we conservatively estimate the value of such publications, including their marginal cost and value of citations. This original and straightforward approach can be used to estimate the socio-economic value of scientific publications produced within any research infrastructure, including universities, in any field of study.

TI  - Differential dendritic immune cell responses to infection with various serotypes of <i>Shigella</i>
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Dendritic cells (DC) are key regulators of immune response with the ability to affect both the innate and adaptive immune responses and are abundant in the gut mucosa. The severity of shigellosis varies with the serotype involved with S. dysenteriae producing the severest infections with complications and S. sonnei being at the other end of spectrum usually causing mild self-limiting diarrhea. While Shigella are known to induce the apoptosis of mature DCs, there is no information on cytokine milieu of DCs incubated with different serotypes of Shigella.Methods: Monocyte derived dendritic cells (MoDCs) were developed from healthy human PBMC after 8 days of culture. DCs were infected with different Shigella serotypes. After 24 h post infection, relative expression of cytokines IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-alpha, IL-12p70, IL-17, IL-22 and IL-23 was studied by Real Time PCR and cytometric bead arrays (CBA).Results: We found that different serotypes of Shigella significantly stimulated production of IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IL-23, INF-gamma and TNF-alpha compared to uninfected DCs and there were significant differences among these serotypes. At transcriptional level, highest levels of expression of IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-17, IL-22 and IL-23 were observed in S. dysenteriae infected DCs. Significant serotypic differences were noted between S. dysenteriae & S. flexneri and between S. dysenteriae & S. sonnei.Conclusions: DCs are critical sentinel cells that relay microbial presence either directly or indirectly to naive T cells. In this study we found that S. dysenteriae caused maximum expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Similarly, S. dysenteriae also caused highest expression of IL-17A and IL-22A. It was the only serotype, which increased IL-23. These findings could explain more severity of SD as compared to SF and SS.

TI  - Etiology of meningitis among adults in three quaternary hospitals in Mozambique, 2016-2017: The role of HIV
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundMeningitis remains an important cause of morbi-mortality in adults in sub-Saharan Africa. Data on the etiological investigation of meningitis in adults in Mozambique is limited and most studies were conducted in southern Mozambique. Identification of the etiology of meningitis in adults are crucial to guide prevention and treatments strategies. In this study, we determine the burden of fungal and bacterial meningitis among adults at the three largest hospitals in Mozambique.MethodWe performed analysis of data from the routine sentinel surveillance system for meningitis in Mozambique from January 2016 to December 2017. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were collected from eligible adults (>= 18 years old) who met World Health Organization (WHO) case definition criteria for Meningitis. All samples were tested by cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) lateral flow assay (LFA), culture and triplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay and all patients were tested for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) using the national algorithm for HIV testing.ResultsRetrospective analysis of 1501 CSF samples from adults clinically suspected of meningitis revealed that 10.5% (158/1501) were positive for bacterial and fungal meningitis. Of these 158 confirmed cases, the proportion of Cryptococcal meningitis and pneumococcal meningitis was38.6% (95% CI: 31.0% to 46.7%) and 36.7% (95% CI: 29.2% to 44.7%), respectively. The other bacterial agents of meningitis identified include Neisseria meningitidis (8.9%; 14/158), Escherichia coli (6.3%; 10/158), Haemophilus influenzae (5.1%; 8/158) and S. aureus (4.4%; 7/158), which represent (24.7%; 39/158) of the total confirmed cases.ConclusionAltogether, our findings show a high burden of Cryptococcal meningitis among adults in Mozambique, especially in people living with HIV, followed by pneumococcal meningitis. Our findings suggest that rollout of CrAg Lateral Flow Assay in the health system in Mozambique for early detection of cryptococcus neoformans is necessary to improve overall patient care.

TI  - Effects of biochar addition on the fate of ciprofloxacin and its associated antibiotic tolerance in an activated sludge microbiome
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the effects of adding biochar (BC) on the fate of ciprofloxacin (CIP) and its related antibiotic tolerance (AT) in activated sludge. Three activated sludge reactors were established with different types of BC, derived from apple, pear, and mulberry tree, respectively, and one reactor with no BC. All reactors were exposed to an environmentally relevant level of CIP that acted as a definitive selective pressure significantly promoting AT to four representative antibiotics (CIP, ampicillin, tetracycline, and polymyxin B) by up to two orders of magnitude. While CIP removal was negligible in the reactor without BC, the BC-dosed reactors effectively removed CIP (70-95% removals) through primarily adsorption by BC and biodegradation/biosorption by biomass. The AT in the BC-added reactors was suppressed by 10-99%, compared to that without BC. The BC addition played a key role in sequestering CIP, thereby decreasing the selective pressure that enabled the proactive prevention of AT increase. 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis showed that the BC addition alleviated the CIP-mediated toxicity to community diversity and organisms related to phosphorous removal. Machine learning modeling with random forest and support vector models using AS microbiome data collectively pinpointed Achromobacter selected by CIP and strongly associated with the AT increase in activated sludge. The identification of Achromobacter as an important AT bacteria revealed by the machine learning modeling with multiple models was also validated with a linear Pearson's correlation analysis. Overall, our study highlighted Achromobacter as a potential useful sentinel for monitoring AT occurring in the environment and suggested BC as a promising additive in wastewater treatment to improve micropollutant removal, mitigate potential AT propagation, and maintain community diversity against toxic antibiotic loadings.

TI  - Applying multidate Sentinel-2 data for forest-type classification in complex broadleaf forest stands
T2  - FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Biodiversity assessment and forest management require accurate tree species maps, which can be provided by remote sensing. Whereas the application of high-spatial resolution remote sensing data is constrained by high costs, Sentinel-2 (S2) satellites provide free imagery with appropriate spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions for mapping of various forest traits across larger spatial scales. Here we assessed the potential of multidate S2 as well as a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) in classifying tree species across a highly structured and heterogeneous broadleaf forest ecosystem in the Hyrcanian zone of northern Iran. We applied multidate S2 and DEM data as input to a variable selection using random forests algorithm for feature reduction. Ten forest types were classified using random forest algorithm and to evaluate the results we computed area-adjusted confusion matrices. Classifications based on single-date S2 data reached overall accuracies of 67-74 per cent, whereas results for multidate S2 images increased the accuracy by similar to 28 per cent. Joint use of DEM data along with multidate S2 images showed improvement of overall accuracy by similar to 3 per cent. In addition, we studied the effect of topographic correction of S2 data on classification performance. The results imply that applying topographically corrected imagery had no significant effect on the classification accuracy. Our results demonstrate the high potential of freely available multisource remotely sensed data for broadleaf tree species classification across complex broad-leaved forest landscapes.

TI  - Multispectral Remote Sensing Data Analysis Based on KNNLC Algorithm and Multimedia Image
T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to combine multimedia imagery and multispectral remote sensing data to analyze information, preprocessing becomes a necessary part of it. It is found that the KNN algorithm is one of the classic algorithms of data mining. As one of the most important branches in the field of data analysis, it is widely used in many fields such as classification, regression, missing value filling, and machine learning. As a lazy algorithm, this method requires no prior statistical knowledge and no additional data to train description rules and is easy to implement. However, the algorithm inevitably has many problems, such as how to determine the appropriate K value, the unsatisfactory effect of data processing for some special distributions, and the unacceptable computational complexity of high-dimensional data. In order to solve these shortcomings, the researchers proposed the KNNLC algorithm. Then, taking the classification experiment as an example, through the comparison of the experimental results on different data sets, it is proved that the average level of the classification performance of the KNNLC algorithm is better than the classic KNN classification algorithm. The KNNLC algorithm shows better performance in most cases, with an accuracy rate of 2 to 5 percentage points higher. An improved algorithm is proposed for the nearest neighbor selection strategy of the traditional KNN algorithm. First, in theory, combined with the theory of sparse coding and locally constrained linear coding, the classical KNN algorithm is improved, and the KNNLC algorithm is proposed. The comparison of the experimental results on the data set proves that the average level of the KNNLC algorithm is better than the classical KNN classification algorithm in terms of classification performance.

TI  - Assessing spatiotemporal variations of AOD in Japan based on Himawari-8 L3 V31 aerosol products: Validations and applications
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The next-generation geostationary meteorological Himawari-8 satellite has a high temporal resolution of 10 min and thus provides a huge advantage for monitoring aerosol optical depths (AOD) in real-time. The newly released Himawari-8 Level 3 Version 31 aerosol products include the ??ngstro??m exponent (AE) and three categories of AOD of AOD_L2_Mean, AOD_Pure, and AOD_Merged on an hourly basis. In this study, we evaluated the accuracy of these aerosol products in Japan where with low AOD using the Aerosol robotic network (AERONET), SKYNET, and moderate resolution image spectroradiometer (MODIS) AODs. The results showed that the AOD_L2_Mean had the lowest correlation coefficients and the highest RMSE with the available AODs (AERONET: R:0.558, RMSE:0.230; SKYNET: R:0.674, RMSE:0.246; MODIS: R:0.525, RMSE:0.195) while the other two had similar performances. The result also indicated that although the AOD_Pure and AOD_Merged showed good agreements with the ground observations in terms of time series, they were, unfortunately, overestimated in most cases. In comparison, the AOD_L2_Mean values were nevertheless frequently overestimated. On an hourly basis, the AOD_Merged product had the best performance. Furthermore, the spatiotemporal analysis revealed that the AOD_Merged has traced the spatial and temporal variations well in Japan, with higher loadings in spring and summer and lower values in winter. In addition, the mean AOD loading across years was high in the Seto Inland Sea in Japan. The evaluation offered in this study can contribute to understanding the error sources on retrieving AHI AOD and the spatiotemporal variations of AOD in Japan, which have frequently been ignored in current assessment studies.

T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Due to the limitations of single-source data, joint classification using multisource remote sensing data has received increasing attention. However, existing methods still have certain shortcomings when faced with feature extraction from single-source data and feature fusion between multisource data. In this article, a method based on multiscale interactive information extraction (MIFNet) for hyperspectral and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image classification is proposed. First, a multiscale interactive information extraction (MIIE) block is designed to extract meaningful multiscale information. Compared with traditional multiscale models, it can not only obtain richer scale information but also reduce the model parameters and lower the network complexity. Furthermore, a global dependence fusion module (GDFM) is developed to fuse features from multisource data, which implements cross attention between multisource data from a global perspective and captures long-range dependence. Extensive experiments on the three datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method and the necessity of each module for accuracy improvement.

TI  - Dimensionality Reduction and Extraction of Engineering Remote Sensing Data Based on Building Information Modeling and Geographical Information System
T2  - SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING
M3  - Article
AB  - The high dimensionality of the modern remote sensing data of construction land makes it complicated to extract image data. This paper proposes a dimensionality reduction and extraction strategy for the remote sensing data of construction land, with the aid of building information modeling (BIM) and geographical information system (GIS). Firstly, the BIM was employed to reduce the size of the remote sensing data of construction land and to obtain the information of each element. Next, the remote sensing data of construction land were parsed, and the key BIM elements were extracted through semantic filtering. In addition, the remote sensing data were converted into a triangulated irregular network (TIN), which can be processed by the geographical information system (GIS). In the end, random projection was utilized to reduce the dimensionality and compress the remote sensing data, and realize the data extraction. Experimental results show that our approach can compress and extract the information from construction land images in the remote sensing data with a high accuracy.

T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to monitor and map the oil spills which occurred from 2019 to 2021 along the northeastern portion of the Nile Delta using Sentinel-1 (SAR) and Sentinel-2 (MSI) data. The examination of VV polarized SAR-C images displayed the presence of the oil spills as dark spots of different sizes. These images were processed using the oil spills detection model in SNAP Toolbox. The oceanographic parameters that may influence the dispersal of oil spills were mapped using GIS technique. This study identified 29 oil spills during the study period in the research area. The largest spill was detected on February 23, 2019, and covered an area of about 10.5 km(2). The band ratios and decorrelation stretch methods of available Sentinel-2 data confirmed the results of SAR-C data. The accuracy assessment of spills was achieved using Parallelepiped supervised classification model. The results demonstrated that the overall accuracy (OA) and Kappa coefficient (KC) for seawater, land, and oil spills classes were between 86% and 98% and 0.73% and 0.97%, respectively. The sensitivity zone of oil spills was higher in winter than in summer. This study proved the efficiency of VV polarized data of Sentinel-1 sensor for detection and mapping of oil spills. Several management strategies are needed in the offshore zone of the Nile Delta to limit oil pollution effects on the marine environment.

TI  - Psychological Impact of Type of Breast Cancer Surgery: A National Cohort Study
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The present study assessed the impact of different types of breast surgery on rates of psychological disorders in breast cancer patients. Methods This nationwide cohort study, based on Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service claims data, included 26,259 breast patients who underwent surgery from June 1, 2017, to December 31, 2018. Associations between the incidence of psychological disorders and variables were evaluated by time dependent Cox regression analyses. Results Of the 26,259 patients, 9394 (35.8%) underwent total mastectomy (TM) and 16,865 (64.2%) underwent partial mastectomy (PM); of the former, 4056 (43.2%) underwent breast reconstruction surgery (RS). A total of 4685 patients (17.84%) were newly diagnosed with psychological disorders after surgery. Multivariable analysis showed that axillary lymph node dissection was significantly associated with increased rates of overall psychological disorders (p < 0.0001), depression (p = 0.0462), anxiety (p < 0.0001) and insomnia (p < 0.0001). The rates of overall psychological disorders (p = 0.0002) and insomnia (p = 0.01) were significantly lower in patients who underwent TM than PM. RS tended to associated with reduced rates of overall psychological disorders in patients who underwent TM. Subgroup analysis showed that, compared with PM, RS after TM significantly associated with a reduced incidence of overall psychological disorders and insomnia in younger patients (< 50 years) and those who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy. Conclusion In contrast to general belief, rates of overall psychological disorders and insomnia were lower in patients who underwent TM than PM. Moreover, RS after TM confers psychological benefit in younger patients with early stage breast cancer compared with PM.

TI  - Spectral index-based time series analysis of canopy resistance and resilience in a watershed under intermittent weather changes
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the long-term impact of intermittent weather events on diverse forest and plant communities at the canopy level has become a key issue in sustainability science. Unlike a single event, intermittent weather events may exert more physiological and biological pressure on terrestrial vegetative surfaces. The amalgamation of spectral index-based satellite remote sensing information to assess intermittent weather changes in canopy dynamics may help identify phenological shifts of biota in response to external and consecutive disturbances. We conducted this study to assess such impacts of alternating weather changes on grassland, agricultural, deciduous forested, and evergreen forested land uses via remote sensing and to compare the resilience and resistance of canopy under intermittent weather changes in a subtropical watershed. The research findings indicate that deciduous forested and evergreen forested land showed a strong correlation between canopy-level biophysical and biochemical properties driven by land surface temperature. The variation of energy driven by land surface temperature changes the sensitivity levels of resilience in forest land uses, affecting the gross primary productivity.

TI  - Impacts of morphological change on coastal landscape dynamics in Monpura Island in the northern Bay of Bengal, Bangladesh
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal morphological change and landscape dynamics have been creating a new window for taking immediate sustainable management strategies for coastal resources management. The dynamic nature of coastal morphological response includes erosion/accretion of landmass, development of an island by sedimentation, movement of the island, and change in geometry and shape. The objectives of the study illustrate morphological change, driver, and mechanism of morphological change, and the effects of morphological change on coastal landscape dynamics. The study also explores spatiotemporal landscape dynamics effects on coastal ecosystem services and livelihood pattern of the coastal community. The novelty of the present research is that how morphological change influence in response to landscape dynamics and its ecosystem services by exploring historical data including shoreline change, century scale erosion and accretion, stability of the islands since 1776 to 2021. In this study, historical maps (i.e., Rennell's map in 1776 and Tassin map in 1840), Topographic Survey map (1943) and remotely sensed digital image (i.e., Landsat TM in 1990, 2000 and 2010, and Landsat OLI in 2021) have been used to quantify coastal geomorphological change and landscape dynamics through RS and GIS tools and techniques. The finding of the study showed remarkable change occurred in geomorphology of the Monpura Island over the period of 245 years. The spatial coverage of the island has been declined dramatically, which is quantified -2905 ha from 1776 to 2021. In the century scale from 1840 to 1943, erosion is observed higher than accretion, and the statistics showing that 8963.40 ha eroded along the east flank of Island. In the northern flank of the Island, Net Shoreline Movement (NSM) and the rate of shoreline movement which expressed by EPR showed highest and flowed by -4 km and -126.55 m/y toward landmass. During the epoch 1990-2021, because of morphological change and anthropogenic interventions, the crop land of the Island has been significantly declined by -38%, while the rivers and settlement spatial coverage have been increased by -768% and -153%, with an annual rate of change -25% and -5% respectively. These outcomes and prepared maps of the current research will be supportive for the local inhabitant, coastal morphologist, and environmental resources management manager, national and international policy advisor, government and nonmovement stakeholder, researcher to observe coastal morpho-dynamics including shoreline dynamics, coastal erosion and accretion and its impacts on landscape and ecosystem services.

TI  - A high-tech, low-cost, Internet of Things surfboard fin for coastal citizen science, outreach, and education
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal populations and hazards are escalating simultaneously, leading to an increased importance of coastal ocean observations. Many well-established observational techniques are expensive, require complex technical training, and offer little to no public engagement. Smartfin, an oceanographic sensor-equipped surfboard fin and citizen science program, was designed to alleviate these issues. Smartfins are typically used by surfers and paddlers in surf zone and nearshore regions where they can help fill gaps between other observational assets. Smartfin user groups can provide data-rich time-series in confined regions. Smartfin comprises temperature, motion, and wet/dry sensing, GPS location, and cellular data transmission capabilities for the near-real-time monitoring of coastal physics and environmental parameters. Smartfin's temperature sensor has an accuracy of 0.05 degrees C relative to a calibrated Sea-Bird temperature sensor. Data products for quantifying ocean physics from the motion sensor and additional sensors for water quality monitoring are in development. Over 300 Smartfins have been distributed around the world and have been in use for up to five years. The technology has been proven to be a useful scientific research tool in the coastal ocean-especially for observing spatiotemporal variability, validating remotely sensed data, and characterizing surface water depth profiles when combined with other tools-and the project has yielded promising results in terms of formal and informal education and community engagement in coastal health issues with broad international reach. In this article, we describe the technology, the citizen science project design, and the results in terms of natural and social science analyses. We also discuss progress toward our outreach, education, and scientific goals.

TI  - Susceptibility & defense of satellite image-trained convolutional networks to backdoor attacks
T2  - INFORMATION SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - With growing opportunities and incentives to disrupt critical space infrastructure systems, cybersecurity of data pipelines associated with satellite images is becoming an increasingly important task. Combined with this threat is a growing body of literature focused on data poisoning and backdoor attacks on deep learning models tailored toward image recognition. To date, there is no work exploring backdoor attacks on deep learning models trained on satellite data. In this study, we evaluate the susceptibility of convolutional networks trained on satellite images to a common trigger-based backdoor attack. We first insert the attack into models trained on two satellite datasets and assess the susceptibility of each model to the attack. We then explore the capability of two state-of-the-art countermeasure tech-niques based on neuron activity to detect and repair the damage inflicted by the attack. Our results show significant and highly varied attack susceptibility ranging from 0 to 100% with strong dependence on the combination of classes targeted and features common in satellite images. Existing defense strategies are shown to be generally ineffective for this style of attack on satellite data. Finally, we introduce a diagnostic approach for the detection of poi-soning vulnerability in satellite image-based deep learning approaches.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Benefits of Increasing Greenness on All-Cause Mortality in the Largest Metropolitan Areas of the United States Within the Past Two Decades
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Across the United States, cities are creating sustainability and climate action plans (CAPs) that call to increase local vegetation. These greening initiatives have the potential to not only benefit the environment but also human health. In epidemiologic literature, greenness has a protective effect on mortality through various direct and indirect pathways. We aimed to assess how an increase in greenness could decrease mortality in the largest urban areas in the United States. We conducted a nationwide quantitative health impact assessment to estimate the predicted reduction in mortality associated with an increase in greenness across two decades (2000, 2010, and 2019). Using a recently published exposure-response function, Landsat 30 m 16-day satellite imagery from April to September, and publicly available county-level mortality data from the CDC, we calculated the age-adjusted reduction in all-cause mortality for those 65 years and older within 35 of the most populated metropolitan areas. We estimated that between 34,000 and 38,000 all-cause deaths could have been reduced in 2000, 2010, and 2019 with a local increase in green vegetation by 0.1 unit across the most populated metropolitan areas. We found that overall greenness increased across time with a 2.86% increase from 2000 to 2010 to 11.11% from 2010 to 2019. These results can be used to support CAPs by providing a quantitative assessment to the impact local greening initiatives can have on mortality. Urban planners and local governments can use these findings to calculate the co-benefits of local CAPs through a public health lens and support policy development.

TI  - Automatic Mapping and Monitoring of Marine Water Quality Parameters in Hong Kong Using Sentinel-2 Image Time-Series and Google Earth Engine Cloud Computing
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuous monitoring of coastal water qualities is critical for water resource management and marine ecosystem sustainability. While remote sensing data such as Sentinel-2 satellite imagery routinely provide high-resolution observations for time-series analysis, the cloud-based Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform supports simple image retrieval and large-scale processing. Using coastal waters of Hong Kong as the study area, this study utilized GEE to (i) query and pre-process all Sentinel-2 observations that coincided with in situ measurements; (ii) extract the spectra to develop empirical models for water quality parameters using artificial neural networks; and (iii) visualize the results using spatial distribution maps, time-series charts and an online application. The modeling workflow was applied to 22 water quality parameters and the results suggested the potential to predict the levels of several nutrients and inorganic constituents. In-depth analyses were conducted for chlorophyll-a, suspended solids and turbidity which produced high correlations between the predicted and observed values when validated with an independent dataset. The selected input variables followed spectral characteristics of the optical constituents. The results were considered more robust compared to previous works in the same region due to the automatic extraction of all available images and larger number of observations from different years and months. Besides visualizing long-term spatial and temporal variabilities through distribution maps and time-series charts, potential anomalies in the monitoring period including algal bloom could also be captured using the models developed from historical data. An online application was created to allow novice users to explore and analyze water quality trends with a simple web interface. The integrated use of remotely-sensed images, in situ measurements and cloud computing can offer new opportunities for implementing effective monitoring programs and understanding water quality dynamics. Although the obtained levels of accuracies were below the desired standard, the end-to-end cloud computing workflow demonstrated in this study should be further investigated considering the cost and computational efficiency for timely information delivery.

TI  - ACR Appropriateness Criteria® Imaging of the Axilla
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This publication reviews the current evidence supporting the imaging approach of the axilla in various scenarios with broad differential diagnosis ranging from inflammatory to malignant etiologies. Controversies on the management of axillary adenopathy results in disagreement on the appropriate axillary imaging tests. Ultrasound is often the appropriate initial imaging test in several clinical scenarios. Clinical information (such as age, physical examinations, risk factors) and concurrent complete breast evaluation with mammogram, tomosynthesis, or MRI impact the type of initial imaging test for the axilla. Several impactful clinical trials demonstrated that selected patient's population can received sentinel lymph node biopsy instead of axillary lymph node dissection with similar overall survival, and axillary lymph node dissection is a safe alternative as the nodal staging procedure for clinically node negative patients or even for some node positive patients with limited nodal tumor burden. This approach is not universally accepted, which adversely affect the type of imaging tests considered appropriate for axilla. This document is focused on the initial imaging of the axilla in various scenarios, with the understanding that concurrent or subsequent additional tests may also be performed for the breast. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

TI  - A physical knowledge-based machine learning method for near-real-time dust aerosol properties retrieval from the Himawari-8 satellite data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring dust aerosol properties is critical for the studies of radiative transfer budget, climate change, and air quality. Aerosol optical thickness (AOT) and effective radius (Reff) are two main parameters describing the optical and microphysical properties of airborne dust aerosol. Satellite remote sensing provides an opportunity for estimating the two parameters in spatial coverage and continuously. To take the merits of machine learning algorithms and also utilize the physical knowledge discovered in the conventional retrieval algorithms, a physical-based machine learning method was proposed and applied on the Himawari-8 geostationary satellite for robust retrieval of dust aerosol properties. The main concepts of this study comprise i) constructing the model input data by extracting highly informative features from the Himawari observations according to physical knowledge and ii) exploiting the utility of six state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms in dust aerosol retrieval. The algorithms include artificial neural network (ANN), extreme boost gradient tree (XGBoost), extra tree (ET), random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), and kernel Ridge regression (Ridge). The groundtruth AOT and Reff data from AERONET stations were supplied as output labels. The cross-validation technique was adopted for model training and the results show that the ANN model is superior to the other machine learning models for both AOT and Reff estimation, which exhibits the lowest mean absolute error (MAE = 0.0292 and 0.0981) and the highest correlation coefficient (r = 0.98 and 0.84). When validated on an independent dataset, the ANN model achieved the lowest MAE (0.0334 and 0.1487), and the highest r (0.94 and 0.63). More importantly, when compared against representative physical-based algorithms, the developed ANN model still retains the best performance. Furthermore, the ANN model shows an overall better performance than other machine learning models and also the JAXA Himawari-8 Level-2 AOT product, with examples exhibited in three dust storm events and for continuous monitoring of one of the dust storm events. Additionally, feature importance analysis implies that the important features of dust aerosol identified by the ANN model are consistent with that in physical model-based algorithms. In summary, this study shows great potential for generating near-real

TI  - Morphological adjustments of the lower Orba River (NW Italy) since the mid-nineteenth century
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A multi-temporal and multi-scale analysis based on historical data collection and review, maps and aerial photograph interpretation, field observations, topographic surveys, and GIS investigations was performed to (i) examine the morphological evolution of lower Orba River since the mid-nineteenth century, (ii) identify its controlling factors, and (iii) correctly interpret ongoing hydrogeomorphic conditions under a river management perspective. The riverbed experienced overall slight and non-homogeneous morphological adjustments, along with some horizontal displacements, up to the early twentieth century (Phase 0). Subsequently, two phases of channel degradation were identified. The first, from the 1920s to the 1950s (Phase 1), is characterized by slight narrowing (12.3%), the beginning of incision, and rare and little lateral migration. The second, between the 1950s and the years around 2010 (Phase 2), displays significant channel incision (mostly from the 1950s to the 1970s, from 0-1 m to 4-5 m), weak narrowing (21.0%), and only minor horizontal displacements. Over the last decade (Phase 3), widespread slight channel widening (3.4%, up to 25.7% at the reach scale) associated with the absence of a generalized bed-level variation trend was observed. The study reach has exhibited a single-thread or transitional channel since the mid-nineteenth century. Channel incision was mainly caused by extensive in-channel sediment extractions primarily carried out between the 1950s and the early 1980s at the reach and catchment scales. The long-term presence of widespread channelization works was recognized as the main reason why overall little riverbed planform adjustments occurred during the whole period investigated. The most recent dynamics were triggered by floods and were interpreted as the river response to human-induced alterations. The riverbed changes that occurred during the twentieth century match the channel adjustments commonly experienced by Italian single-thread and transitional channels as a response to various types of human disturbances. However, the detected morpho-evolutionary phases of the Orba River are only partially in agreement with those reported in the literature for other Italian rivers affected by similar anthropogenic pressures, as some differences exist in timing and magnitude of prevalent channel adjustments. An overall slight potential for channel recovery, priorities for rehabilitation, and the main objectives for the next-decades management were identified. This research provides insights into the medium- and short-term morphological evolution of Italian rivers, and its outcomes represent an essential piece to drive river management towards sustainable and effective river restoration and risk mitigation measures framed within a larger, multidisciplinary, and objective-based context. A wide spectrum of both consolidated and newly developed GIS-based planform metrics was considered to assess the channel morphological evolution in detail, providing an operative reference framework for future investigations.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mining is the most important economic activity in Raniganj coalfield area of West Bengal, India. At the same time, it has an immense number of negative impacts upon natural and social environment. Sonepur-Bazari mine is one of the biggest open cast coal mines of Eastern Coalfield Limited, which has started its journey from 1995. The present study focuses on the land use land cover change (2008-2018) in and around the Sonepur-Bazari and its surrounding area with the help of satellite imagery. Landsat images of 2008, 2014 and 2018 have been used to find out the changes. Different land use classes have been identified by applying visual interpretation method. The study also employed analytical hierarchy process (AHP) coupled with GIS to understand the intensity of risk of the surrounding villages. By the use of participatory rural appraisal approach (PRA), social impact of mining activities has been analysed. The study reveals that the expansion of the mine causes several changes in the surrounding area. Crop land has been affected the most by decreasing the area of 7.73 km(2) from 2008 to 2018. The loss of traditional economic activities has been increased due to reduction in the crop land area. Hence, in post-displacement period agriculture shifted in fifth position from first, out of seven major economic activities in the study area. The analysis of AHP highlights that 51.70% of the total area is under the high risk zone.

AB  - The surgical approach to different pathologies, not only oncological, has evolved. As Veronesi's group has coined very graphically, we are moving from "maximum tolerable treatments to minimum effective treatments" and this journey cannot be carried out in any other way than through a multidisciplinary and multimodality approach. Multidisciplinary, because collaboration between surgeons, oncologists, radiologists, nuclear physicians, pathologists, and all those involved in patient follow-up is necessary, and multimodality, because we must move towards precision surgery tailored to each patient in which, on the part of Nuclear Medicine, hybrid imaging (SPECT/CT and PET/CT), bimodal tracers, the use of new allies such as ultrasound or our own adaptation to robotic surgery have a great deal to say. A wide range of possibilities is built on the solid foundation of preoperative scintigraphy, which makes it possible to identify the target tissues and whose knowledge prior to surgery allows the necessary surgical approach to be considered for each patient.

The aim of this study is to compare the ultrasound (US) guided thoracic paravertebral block (TPV) versus intraoperative pectoral nerve block (PECS) with a low volume local anaesthetic for postoperative analgesia after breast cancer surgery. A total of 41 patients underwent mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy or modified radical mastectomy were included in this randomized controlled, single-blinded trial. The patients were divided into two groups as PECS and TPV blocks. In the PECS group, 10 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine was administered to the fascial plane by the surgeon. In the TPV group, 25 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine at T3 level was administered by the anaesthetist under US-guidance. Visual analogue scale (VAS) scores and additional analgesic requirements were recorded at postoperative 0, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h. Results In the TPV group, mean VAS score (VAS0) was significantly lower (p < 0.001). In other time periods, there was no significant difference between the groups. Conclusions It was observed that intraoperative PECS block was as effective as TPV in providing postoperative analgesia and additional analgesic requirements were similar. This result suggests PECS block may be a good alternative to TPV.

TI  - Satellite Analyses Unravel the Multi-Decadal Impact of Dam Management on Tropical Floodplain Vegetation
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - An assessment of river regulation impact on floodplain vegetation is crucial to developing a modern watershed management approach in the Neotropics aimed at mitigating alterations of the floodplain environment. Floodplain forest monitoring requires high-resolution mapping, as vegetation dynamics are in the narrow area at the interface between terrestrial and aquatic systems. The existing satellite images that afford land observations have limitations due to coarse resolution or gaps in data caused by the extreme cloudiness of tropical regions. This study provides a new framework for high-resolution mapping and monitoring of a large-scale tropical forest in the aquatic-terrestrial zone of an Amazon basin. The main aim is to assess the vegetation status and the environmental degradation in a highly altered fluvial setting. To achieve the goal, a remote sensing processing chain, which couples hydrologic and vegetation data, was developed. A map of high-resolution traditional vegetation indices and their non-linear generalization was derived from the high-resolution gap-free reflectance data obtained by combining Landsat and MODIS data, through the HISTARFM algorithm. Subsequently, hydrological modification within these areas was assessed by using a global water surface dataset. In addition, the impact of river regulation on riverine forest carbon cycling was assessed through the analysis of interannual variability of the gross primary production of floodplain vegetation. The framework was applied to analyze the last 2 decades of changes in the floodplain forest of Uatum a ~ river (central Amazon basin), downstream of the Balbina hydropower dam built in 1987. The analysis showed the presence of vegetation degradation in areas of increased hydrologic stress and upland forest encroachment in areas no longer inundated. The dam continues to have effects on vegetation even 30 years after its construction. The ongoing profound reshuffling of the floodplain forest, and the impact on the carbon storage capacity of the floodplain forest suggest that the situation is far from a new environmental equilibrium. The proposed high-resolution approach allows for a detailed mapping of riparian vegetation alterations, helping to develop a more careful management of the watershed through a better understanding of the human footprint on floodplain forests.

TI  - The Six Dimensions of Value Associated to the use of Copernicus Sentinel Data: Key Findings From the Sentinel Benefits Study
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The role of Earth Observation (EO) data from satellites in supporting informed decision-making and more efficient operational processes is becoming increasingly recognized. However, analysing the value that this generates remains a challenge. Often, top-down cost-benefit analyses are used to justify budgets but with very broad-based, macro-economic assumptions. The approach discussed in this paper is bottom-up building on the use of a single product or service arising from the use of data coming from one or more of the Copernicus Sentinel satellites. This allows a much finer, detailed understanding of how the data is being used and hence contributing to informed decision making. A case-based, value-chain methodology has been applied through which the impact on society can be analysed. Whilst early cases focused on economic value i.e., monetized benefits, later ones recognise that often the benefits may be wider than this. For instance, organisations can benefit through an increased reputation, or societal values such as quality of life can be felt. Consequently, a set of non-monetary dimensions have been defined which provide a new framework for the analysis. The six dimensions are described in the paper and have been tested on a significant number of recent cases. The paper describes the updated methodology and the results obtained through its application.

TI  - Steps Toward Modelling the Past and Future North Sea Ecosystem With a Focus on Light Climate
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - With ongoing manmade climate change, it is important to understand its impact on regional ecosystems. Furthermore, it is known that the North Sea light climate is subject to ongoing change. The combined effects of climate change and coastal darkening are investigated in this work. We used a three-dimensional ecosystem model, forced with data from a climate model, to project three plausible biogeochemical states for the years 2050-2054, following three representative concentration and shared socioeconomic pathways (RCP2.6-SSP1, RCP4.5-SSP2 and RCP8.5-SSP5). We also performed a historic experiment for the years 1950-1954 and 2000-2004 for comparison. Our results suggest significant reductions of phytoplankton biomass as a consequence of sinking nutrient levels for all future scenarios. Additionally, a modelling study was carried out, in which we raised background SPM levels by 40% to reflect potential changes in the future. This revealed that for RCP2.6-SSP1, the ecosystem is more sensitive to changes in the light climate than for the other scenarios, due to higher nutrient availability.

TI  - The concept of universality and the universality of concepts: a comment
T2  - HISTORY OF EUROPEAN IDEAS
M3  - Article
AB  - This concluding article draws together some of the connecting strands between the preceding four articles, seeking to outline a number of fundamental issues common to them all and ultimately the legal concept of universality in general. I argue that there is a fundamental Eurocentrism present that has a number of implications, ranging from the hierarchical worldview and its ingrained evolutionary basis to the notion of communities beyond the nation state which would in the guise of benevolence impose and dictate both law and values with an universal reach and finally, an idea that legal concepts were in an by themselves universal. What these had in common was that they were based on an understanding of humanity as universal, a certain concept of concept as universal and, finally, resorting to a very particular concept of universal rights. However, despite the manifold claims of universality, the practical application and interpretation of these rights was exceedingly limited to a certain group and a certain time and a place.

TI  - Understanding the Slow Motion of the Wangjiashan Landslide in the Baihetan Reservoir Area (China) from Space-Borne Radar Observations
T2  - ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The analysis of landslide evolution using archived optical remote-sensing images is common, but it is often limited by the acquisition frequency, cloud cover, and resolution. With the development of space-borne radar observation technology, small baseline subset interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technology provides a new technical approach for detecting landslide deformation before disasters. The Sentinel-1A SAR datasets (20170219-20210330) were used to study the time-series deformation characteristics of the Wangjiashan landslide in the Baihetan Reservoir area before its impoundment. The time-series results show that the Wangjiashan landslide was in an initial deformation state in the prior four years, and the deformation first occurred in the middle part and then expanded to the landslide toe and crown retrogressive movement characteristics. Combined with an analysis of field deformation signs, these findings suggest that the upper landslide mass formed a local sliding surface, which caused serious deformation of the road. An analysis of historical rainfall data revealed that the Wangjiashan landslide is sensitive to rainfall, and the deformation is not only significantly correlated with cumulative rainfall but also influenced by concentrated heavy rainfall. The research in this study provides a basis for the monitoring, early warning, and risk management of the Wangjiashan landslide during the impoundment period. This work also provides a useful reference for investigations using space-borne SAR Earth observations in geological disaster prevention and control.

TI  - A two-step deep learning framework for mapping gapless all-weather land surface temperature using thermal infrared and passive microwave data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Blending data from thermal infrared (TIR) and passive microwave (PMW) measurements is a promising solution for generating the all-weather land surface temperature (LST). However, owing to swath gaps in PMW data and the resolution inconsistence between TIR and PWM data, spatial details are often incomplete or considerable losses are generated in the all-weather LST using traditional methods. This study was conducted to develop a two-step deep learning framework (TDLF) for mapping gapless all-weather LST over the China's landmass using MODIS and AMSR-E LST data. In the TDLF, a multi-temporal feature connected convolutional neural network bidirectional reconstruction model was developed to obtain the spatially complete AMSR-E LST. A multi-scale multi-temporal feature connected generative adversarial network model was then designed to blend spatially complete AMSR-E LST and cloudy-sky MODIS LST, and generate gapless all-weather LST data. Gapless allweather LST data were evaluated using six in-situ LST data from the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and the Heihe River Basin (HRB). The root mean squared errors (RMSEs) of the gapless all-weather LST were 1.71-2.0 K with determination coefficients (R-2) of 0.94-0.98 under clear conditions, and RMSEs of 3.41-3.87 K and R-2 of 0.88-0.94 were obtained under cloudy conditions. Compared to the existing PMW-based all-weather LSTs, the validation accuracy and image quality (such as spatial detail) of the generated gapless all-weather LSTs were superior. The TDLF does not require the use of any additional data and can potentially be implemented with other satellite TIR and PWM sensors to produce long-term, gapless, all-weather MODIS LST records on a global scale. Such a capability is beneficial for generating further gapless all-weather soil moisture and evapotranspiration datasets that can all be applied in global climate change research.

TI  - A phenology-based vegetation index classification (PVC) algorithm for coastal salt marshes using Landsat 8 images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal salt marshes, as a globally significant intertidal ecosystem, are highly productive but extremely fragile and unstable. Mapping coastal salt marshes accurately is the basis of assessing global climate change, biological invasion, and coastal erosion. Using Landsat 8 images, this paper integrated the advantages of pixel- and phenology-based algorithms and vegetation indices in vegetation classification. An enhanced phenology-based vegetation index classification (PVC) algorithm is proposed to obtain the spatial distribution and community composition of coastal salt marshes in Bohai Sea of China accurately and quickly. The results showed that (1) the coastal redness vegetation index (CRVI) can be used to extract Suaeda spp. effectively, and the phenology-based vegetation indices (PVIs) dataset can alleviate the spatial variability of phenology in coastal salt marshes; (2) the crucial phenological periods for identifying coastal salt marshes are May, October, and November, and the optimal PVIs are consistent with the phenological characteristics of salt marshes; (3) during the year 2018-2019, the overall accuracy (OA) of the PVC algorithm in Yancheng coast of Jiangsu Province and Bohai Sea coast reached 80.49 % and 90.8 % respectively. A total of 14,763.39 ha of salt marshes were found in the coastal area of Bohai Sea, and Shandong Province had the most abundant types of salt marshes and the largest area; (4) the classification model based on the PVC algorithm is stable and scalable in 2016-2017 and 2020-2021, with the OA of 89.19% and 86.67% respectively. These results demonstrate the value of the PVC algorithm in vegetation classification, and this study can provide a referable semi-automatic vegetation classification method for other coastal areas.

TI  - Estimating 1 km gridded daily air temperature using a spatially varying coefficient model with sign preservation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Near-surface air temperature (Ta) is one of the key variables in a variety of studies such as hydrological modeling, assessment of heat waves, and energy modeling. Among existing methods, statistical algorithms are suitable for integrating auxiliary spatial data with station-based Ta data to produce gridded Ta over large areas. However, existing statistical algorithms (e.g., Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR)) cannot always correctly capture and preserve relationships between Ta and explanatory variables, which may increase un-certainties of relevant applications based on the estimated Ta with abnormal spatial patterns. This issue is mainly caused by the lack of enough observations due to the limited spatial coverage of weather stations, leading to abnormal relationships between Ta and explanatory variables. In order to address this issue, in this study, we introduced a new method named the Spatially Varying Coefficient Models with Sign Preservation (SVCM-SP) to estimate gridded Ta using gridded land surface temperature (LST) and elevation as explanatory variables with presetting positive and negative signs for coefficients, respectively. Using this method, first, we calculated the preset parameters of the bivariate spline surface. Second, we used the input data at weather stations and con-strained least squares regression to obtain the coefficient surface for both the explanatory variables (i.e., elevation and LST) and the intercept. Third, we calculated the gridded Ta using the 1 km gridded LST and elevation data, and the estimated spatially varying coefficient surfaces. We evaluated the model performance for estimating 1 km gridded daily maximum and minimum Ta (i.e., Tmax and Tmin) data in mainland China from 2003 to 2016 using 10-fold cross-validation and compared its performance with the GWR model. The average root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) based on the SVCM-SP are 1.75 C and 1.22 C for Tmax, and 1.82 C and 1.30 C for Tmin, respectively. The SVCM-SP method showed better performance than the GWR in terms of accuracy, computing efficiency, and has more interpretable coefficients for explanatory variables to get more realistic spatial pattern of gridded Ta. More important, the sign preservation of the SVCM-SP method can mitigate the issue of abnormal relationships between Ta and explanatory variables in the traditional methods such as GWR, and therefore will contribute to future studies in developing better gridded air temperature or relevant data products.

TI  - A phase-decomposition-based polarimetric coherence optimization method
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The interference between different scattering components in distributed scatterer (DS) makes it difficult to estimate the phase from DS. Recently, some methods based on eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) are proposed to separate scatterer components from DS, such as component extraction and selection SAR (CAESAR) and phasedecomposition-based persistent scatterer (PS) InSAR (PD-PSInSAR). Meanwhile, many polarimetric radar satellites launched in recent years provide abundant polarization data, which promotes the research of polarimetric coherence optimization (PCO). The capability of PCO to improve the amount and quality of PSs has been verified. In this paper, a phase-decomposition-based polarimetric coherence optimization (PD-PCO) is proposed to explore the potential of PCO to improve the phase quality of DS. Firstly, the contribution of the first principal component on a coherence matrix is obtained by searching for the optimum projection vector. Then, the new scattering coefficient is generated by combining the polarimetric scattering vector and the projection vector. Finally, the interferometric phase of dominant scattering mechanism component is separated from the phase component by EVD. Twenty-eight dual-pol Sentinel-1A SAR images have been adopted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Phase derivative variation and coherence of the proposed method has been compared with other algorithms. The result shows that the quality of phase estimated by the PD-PCO is superior to the CAESAR, PD-PSInSAR, and the mean coherence polarimetric optimization based on equivalent scattering mechanism (ESM-R). The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm successfully improves the phase quality of DSCs.

TI  - Deep Active Learning Framework for Lymph Node Metastasis Prediction in Medical Support System
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing the extent of cancer spread by histopathological analysis of sentinel axillary lymph nodes is an important part of breast cancer staging. With the maturity and prevalence of deep learning technology, building auxiliary medical systems can help to relieve the burden of pathologists and increase the diagnostic precision and accuracy during this process. However, such histopathological images have complex patterns that are difficult for ordinary people to understand and require professional medical practitioners to annotate. This increases the cost of constructing such medical systems. To reduce the cost of annotating and improve the performance of the model as much as possible, in other words, using as few labeled samples as possible to obtain a greater performance improvement, we propose a deep learning framework with a three-stage query strategy and novel model update strategy. The framework first trains an auto-encoder with all the samples to obtain a global representation in a low-dimensional space. In the query stage, the unlabeled samples are first selected according to uncertainty, and then, coreset-based methods are employed to reduce sample redundancy. Finally, distribution differences between labeled samples and unlabeled samples are evaluated and samples that can quickly eliminate the distribution differences are selected. This method achieves faster iterative efficiency than the uncertainty strategies, representative strategies, or hybrid strategies on the lymph node slice dataset and other commonly used datasets. It reaches the performance of training with all data, but only uses 50% of the labeled. During the model update process, we randomly freeze some weights and only train the task model on new labeled samples with a smaller learning rate. Compared with fine-tuning task model on new samples, large-scale performance degradation is avoided. Compared with the retraining strategy or the replay strategy, it reduces the training cost of updating the task model by 79.87% and 90.07%, respectively.

TI  - Franciscana dolphins, <i>Pontoporia blainvillei</i>, as environmental sentinels of the world's largest mining disaster: Temporal trends for organohalogen compounds and their consequences for an endangered population
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - On November 5th, 2015, the Funda & SIM;o dam collapsed in Minas Gerais, southeastern Brazil, releasing millions of cubic meters of mud containing mining residue into the Doce River. Two weeks later, the mud arrived to the marine environment, triggering changes in franciscana dolphin habitat, Pontoporia blainvillei, from Franciscana Management Area Ia. This is an isolated population of the most endangered cetacean species in the South Atlantic Ocean. Organohalogen compounds (OHCs) may pose a threat to this endangered population because of their endocrine disrupting properties. Hence, this study sought to determine if there were differences in the bioaccumulation profile of OHC (PCBs, DDTs, Mirex, HCB, HCHs, PBDEs, PBEB, HBBZ and MeO-BDEs) in franciscana dolphins before and after dam collapse and to build a temporal trend. Blubber of 33 stranded individuals was collected in Espirito Santo state for organohalogen assessment between 2003 and 2019. Differences were found between franciscana dolphins collected prior to and after the disaster. Additionally, significant temporal trends for organochlorine pesticides and natural and anthropogenic organobromine were detected. The increase in pesticide concentrations after 2015 is suggestive of their reavailability in the environment. The decline in organobromine over time could be due to their debromination in the marine environment and alterations in the composition of their natural producers. PCBs remained stable during the period of the study. Our findings show an increase in endocrine disruptor concentrations, which is of great concern for this endangered population.

AB  - The study was carried out at the Gedeo zone aiming to investigate the vulnerability of agrobiodiversity and agroforestry settings to climate change in the district. Thus, the study was focused on evaluating crop diversity under different crop management practices and its distribution at the household level among different wealth classes and land use land cover change impact on agrobiodiversity and agroecosystems areas. Therefore, crop survey both from the home garden and crop field, the last 30 years' data from five meteorological stations located in the district and the past 30 years' Landsat satellite images at a 10-year interval within the same season was used. A total of 65 crop plant species with eleven major use categories have been recorded in the studied home gardens and crop fields. The crop plant species collected from both the home garden and crop field account for 57% and 38%, while the rest 5% were from the adjacent field. The land use and land cover map of the study area indicate that the largest part of the study area (108548.01 hectares) was covered by agroforestry, whereas the smallest portion of the district, about 975.15, 6457.41 and 12501.27 hectares of the area, was covered by bare land, cropland, and grassland, respectively. The remaining 20537.73 hectares (13.8%) of the district were covered with settlements. Crop species diversity is higher almost in the entire study site. However, crop species compositions were significantly variable among these study sites. The climatic data results indicated a reduction in average rainfall pattern in most of the stations and an increase in temperature within the employed time range.

TI  - Top-of-atmosphere hyper and multispectral signatures of submerged plastic litter with changing water clarity and depth
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The exploitation of satellite remote sensing is expected to be a critical asset in monitoring floating and submerged plastic litter in all aquatic environments. However, robust retrieval algorithms still havel to be developed based on a full understanding of light interaction with plastic litter and the other optically active constituents of the atmosphere-water system. To this end, we performed laboratory-based hyperspectral reflectance measurements of submerged macroplastics under varying water clarity conditions (clear - 0 mg/L, moderate - 75 mg/L, very turbid - 321.3 mg/L) and submersion depths. This comprehensive optical dataset was used (i) to relate the plastic-related signal to submersion depth and turbidity parameters, and (ii) to investigate the top-of-atmosphere signal through full radiative transfer calculations. Simulated TOA radiation was used to explore the nominal pixel and spectral requirements based on WorldView-3, Sentinel-2, and Sentinel-3 missions with very high to moderate geo-spatial resolutions. Results showed that plastics remained detectable when submerged in the top similar to 1 m of the water column regardless of water clarity conditions. At TOA, uncertainties attached to atmospheric correction were shown to be reasonable and acceptable for plastic detection purposes in the infrared part of the spectrum (> 700 nm). The impact of aerosols on the TOA signal was found to be complex as (i) over large plastic patches. The aerosols produced little impact on satellite observations mostly due to adjacency effects and (ii) optical signature from isolated/small extent plastic patches was critically altered suggesting the atmospheric transmittance should be accurately corrected for in plastic detection algorithms. The sensitivity analyses also revealed that the narrow band widths of Sentinel-3 did not improve detection performance compared to the WorldView-3 coarser band widths. It is proposed that high spatial resolution wavebands such as the pan-chromatic could be advantageously explored for submerged plastic monitoring applications.

TI  - Distribution pattern and pathologic analysis of metastatic sentinel and non-sentinel lymph nodes in lymphatic basin dissection for clinical T2/T3 oral cancer with clinical N0 status
T2  - AURIS NASUS LARYNX
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The localization pattern of metastatic sentinel lymph node (SN) and non-SNs and pathologic analysis of metastatic lymph nodes in SN lymphatic basin dissection (SLBD) were investigated in patients with cT2/T3cN0 oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).Methods: This prospective multicenter trial involved 10 institutions nationwide in Japan. A total of 57 patients were enrolled. The lateral neck was divided into 5 lymphatic basins. The lymphatic basin containing SNs was defined as the SN lymphatic basin. All patients underwent SLBD with backup selective neck dissection (I-III) combined with primary tumor removal. When SNs were found outside of levels I-III, including in the contralateral neck, SLBD was performed by removing the compartments containing SNs separately. SN metastasis was classified as isolated tumor cells (ITCs), micrometastasis, or macrometastasis. ITCs are defined as a lesion no larger than 0.2 mm in largest dimension and are classified as pN0. Results: SN metastasis was observed in 22 cases. All metastatic lymph nodes, including false negative cases, were detected in the SN lymphatic basin. Isolated tumor cells in the SNs did not affect prognosis, whereas micrometastasis tended to have poor prognosis.After adjusting for other risk factors, a positive SN remained a significant predictor of poor 5-year overall survival in pT2-4 OSCC.Conclusion: SLBD for intraoperative SN biopsy is a sufficient therapeutic procedure and is valuable for determining pathologic nodal stage in OSCC. SN positivity was demonstrated to be an independent predictor of poor prognosis in patients with pT2-4 disease undergoing SLBD with backup selective neck dissection (I-III).

TI  - Shame and Guilt in EMS: A Qualitative Analysis of Culture and Attitudes in Prehospital Emergency Care
T2  - PREHOSPITAL EMERGENCY CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Study Objectives The shame reaction is a highly negative emotional reaction shown to have long-term deleterious effects on the mental health of clinicians. Prior studies have focused on in-hospital personnel, but very little is known about what drives shame reactions in emergency medical services (EMS), a field with very high rates of post-traumatic stress disorder, burnout, anxiety, and depression. The objective of this study was to describe emotions, processes, and resilience associated with self-identified adverse events in the work of prehospital clinicians. Methods We conducted a qualitative study using a modified critical incident technique. Participants were recruited from two EMS agencies in North Carolina: one urban and one rural. They provided an open-ended, written reflection in which they were asked to self-identify particular events in their EMS careers that felt emotionally difficult. In-person or video in-depth interviews about these events were then conducted in a semi-structured fashion using an iterative interview guide. The codebook was developed through a mix of inductive and deductive analysis strategies and discussed within the research team and a content expert for validation. Interviews were transcribed and data were analyzed following a thematic content analysis approach for types of cases identified as emotionally difficult, common emotional responses and coping mechanisms, and the lingering effects of these experiences on study subjects. Results Eight interviews were conducted with EMS personnel: five from an urban agency and three from a rural agency. Participants commonly identified complex medical cases as being emotionally difficult, which led to the most robust shame reactions. Shame reactions were more common when EMS clinicians committed self-perceived errors in patient care, whereas guilt reactions were more common when patient outcomes seemed "inevitable" despite any intervention. Common themes related to coping mechanisms included both personal mechanisms, which tended to be less successful compared to interpersonal mechanisms, particularly when emotions were shared with colleagues. This reflected a perceived culture change within EMS in which sharing emotions with colleagues was seen as a departure from the "old school" where emotions tended to be kept to oneself. Feelings of inadequacy, low self-worth, and being "not good enough" were frequently identified as lingering emotions after difficult cases that were hard to move on from, corresponding to longstanding shame in these clinicians. Recovery and resilience varied but tended to be positively associated with a culture in which sharing with colleagues was encouraged, along with personal introspection on root causes for the sentinel event. Conclusion EMS clinicians often identify complex patient cases as those leading to emotions such as shame and guilt, with shame reactions being more common when a perceived error was committed. Coping mechanisms were varied, but individuals often relied on their coworkers in a sharing environment to adequately process their negative feelings, which was seen as a departure from past practices in EMS personnel. Our hope is that future studies will be able to use these findings to identify targets for intervention on negative mental health outcomes in EMS personnel.

TI  - Sentinel Node Biopsy for Endometrial Cancer by Retroperitoneal Transvaginal Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery: A Preliminary Study
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The primary objective was to determine the intraoperative and postoperative surgical complications of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) by retroperitoneal transvaginal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (vNOTES). The secondary objective was to assess the feasibility of this surgical technique. Methods: This was a descriptive study realized in a non-university hospital in Switzerland. Seven patients with endometrial cancer or endometrial complex atypical hyperplasia underwent surgical staging with SLNB by retroperitoneal vNOTES using an indocyanine green-based near-infrared fluorescence imaging technique (October 2021-February 2022). Results: The median operative time was 113 (81-211) minutes. The median estimated blood loss was 20 (20-400) mL. The overall bilateral detection rate was 100% (7/7). Upon histopathological examination, 5 patients presented an endometrial adenocarcinoma, and we found endometrial complex atypical hyperplasia in 2 cases. We successfully completed all procedures without significant intraoperative complications, but 1 case required conversion to conventional laparoscopy. The median postoperative stay was 2 (2-4) days, and we observed no postoperative complications during this period. We observed 1 case of postoperative deep vein thrombosis and an asymptomatic vaginal vault hematoma in the same patient. Conclusions: Our preliminary study suggests that retroperitoneal vNOTES could be a feasible, safe, and valuable approach to perform SLNB in endometrial cancer. However, strong evidence of its feasibility, the effective benefits, and the long-term oncological outcomes is needed before expanding the use of vNOTES in endometrial cancer outside study settings.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to construct artificial intelligence (AI) training datasets based on multi-resolution remote sensing and analyze the results through learning algorithms in an attempt to apply machine learning efficiently to (quasi) real-time changing landcover data. Multi-resolution datasets of landcover at 0.51- and 10-m resolution were constructed from aerial and satellite images obtained from the Sentinel-2 mission. Aerial image data (a total of 49,700 data sets) and satellite image data (300 data sets) were constructed to achieve 50,000 multi-resolution datasets. In addition, raw data were compiled as metadata in JavaScript Objection Notation format for use as reference material. To minimize data errors, a two-step verification process was performed consisting of data refinement and data annotation to improve the quality of the machine learning datasets. SegNet, U-Net, and DeeplabV3+ algorithms were applied to the datasets; the results showed accuracy levels of 71.5%, 77.8%, and 76.3% for aerial image datasets and 88.4%, 91.4%, and 85.8% for satellite image datasets, respectively. Of the landcover categories, the forest category had the highest accuracy. The landcover datasets for AI training constructed in this study provide a helpful reference in the field of landcover classification and change detection using AI. Specifically, the datasets for AI training are applicable to large-scale landcover studies, including those targeting the entirety of Korea.

TI  - Inclusivity via ontological accountability
T2  - CONSERVATION LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Conservation and environmental policies are increasingly criticized for marginalizing peoples, entities and practices. Typically overlooked, yet critical in their potential for marginalization and exclusion, are the assumptions that underlie a policy's classifications, categorizations and descriptions of reality. These ontological assumptions come to define which interventions are appropriate, or even possible, and for whom. We seek to illuminate the importance of ontology to policy-making and implementation processes. We do so via an ontological analysis of selected elements of an international policy, the Convention on Biological Diversity, to show how language, logic, rights and responsibilities expressed and inferred within the policy could marginalize different entities and practices. The analysis demonstrates how a policy represents reality and thereby intervenes in the world, with consequences for alternative ontologies, peoples, and knowledges. To support ontological accountability, we offer a three-stage conceptual framework to: deconstruct the language used in describing reality; make sense of how language and logic entangle rights and responsibilities; and enable transformation by becoming accountable to diverse practices of reality. Enabling the coexistence and practice of multiple ontologies is not easy or simple, but it is fundamental for transforming to inclusive policy-making, implementation, and self-determination.

TI  - Vegetation loss and recovery analysis from the 2015 Gorkha earthquake (7.8 Mw) triggered landslides
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2015 Gorkha earthquake (7.8 Mw) triggered thousands of landslides in the highlands of central Nepal, causing widespread vegetation damage. After the earthquake, several attempts were made by the government to recover damaged vegetation; however, the efficacy of artificial restoration (from public finance) vs. self ecological restoration is unknown. We analyze the vegetation recovery process of the areas impacted by the 2015 Gorkha earthquake landslides with a dual-lens: (1) remote sensing and (2) public finance and policy. Using remote sensing, Vegetation Recovery Rate (VRR) is estimated from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from Landsat imagery between 2015 and 2021. Then public finance data is analyzed to compare the efficacy of vegetation recovery from the artificial vs. self-ecological restoration. The study examines fourteen severely impacted districts from the Gorkha earthquake in 2015. Out of 24,826 landslides triggered by the earthquake, ~95% of vegetation damage was caused by 13,670 large landslides (with area > 0.09 ha). A total of 8651.58 ha of vegetation was lost due to landslides induced by the 2015 Gorkha earthquake. About 4442 ha (51%) of such lost vegetation has been restored so far. Only 9.5% of this restored vegetation was due to artificial restoration, while the remaining 90.5% was by self-ecological restoration process in protected areas. Furthermore, VRR analysis showed that at least nine years are required to restore vegetation cover to the pre-earthquake level (R-2 = 0.91). The government had invested 3.73 million USD in this duration for artificial restoration. Our findings suggest that strict protection promotes self-ecological restoration, an effective tract for vegetation recovery, over artificial interventions. Findings provide insights for plausible decision-making in restoring lost vegetation due to earthquake-triggered landslides.

TI  - The sensitivities of ozone and PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations to the satellite-derived leaf area index over East Asia and its neighboring seas in the WRF-CMAQ modeling system
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation plays an important role as both a sink of air pollutants via dry deposition and a source of biogenic VOC (BVOC) emissions which often provide the precursors of air pollutants. To identify the vegetation-driven offset between the deposition and formation of air pollutants, this study examines the responses of ozone and PM2.5 concentrations to changes in the leaf area index (LAI) over East Asia and its neighboring seas, using up-to-date satellite-derived LAI and green vegetation fraction (GVF) products. Two LAI scenarios that examine (1) table-prescribed LAI and GVF from 1992 to 1993 AVHRR and 2001 MODIS products and (2) reprocessed 2019 MODIS LAI and 2019 VIIRS GVF products were used in WRF-CMAQ modeling to simulate ozone and PM2.5 concentrations for June 2019. The use of up-to-date LAI and GVF products resulted in monthly mean LAI differences ranging from-56.20% to 96.81% over the study domain. The increase in LAI resulted in the differences in hourly mean ozone and PM2.5 concentrations over inland areas ranging from 0.27 ppbV to -7.17 ppbV and 0.89 mu g/m(3) to-2.65 mu g/m(3), and the differences of those over the adjacent sea surface ranging from 0.69 ppbV to -2.86 ppbV and 3.41 mu g/m3 to-7.47 mu g/m(3). The decreases in inland ozone and PM2.5 concentrations were mainly the results of dry deposition accelerated by increases in LAI, which outweighed the ozone and PM2.5 formations via BVOC-driven chemistry. Some inland regions showed further decreases in PM2.5 concentrations due to reduced reactions of PM2.5 precursors with hydroxyl radicals depleted by BVOCs. The reductions in sea surface ozone and PM2.5 concentrations were accompanied by the reductions in those in upwind inland regions, which led to less ozone and PM2.5 inflows. The results suggest the importance of the selective use of vegetation parameters for air quality modeling.

TI  - Facile construction of highly luminescent and biocompatible gold nanoclusters by shell rigidification for two-photon pH-edited cytoplasmic and <i>in vivo</i> imaging
T2  - NANOSCALE
M3  - Article
AB  - Gold nanoclusters (AuNCs), as a novel fluorescent material, have been extensively explored and developed for bioimaging because of their attractive advantages such as ultrasmall size, low toxicity and exceptional two-photon excitation properties. However, it still remains a challenge to produce water-soluble, biocompatible and ultrabright AuNCs. Herein, we report on a novel one-pot synthesis of highly luminescent and biocompatible AuNCs by using polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), a water-soluble polymer, to rigidify the primary stabilizing layer (shell) that is composed of 6-aza-2-thiothymine (ATT) ligands bound to the particle. Such shell-rigidification resulted in a significant enhancement of the fluorescence efficiency, reaching a quantum yield of 39% under the best conditions, about 35-fold increase from the intrinsically weak fluorescence of the AuNCs stabilized by only ATT. The fluorescence enhancement mechanism was systematically characterized, and the results indicate that PVP coating rigidifies the ATT ligand shell through steric hindrance and reduces the nonradiative relaxation of the excited states. The biocompatible PVP-AuNCs were further examined for two-photon cellular and sentinel lymph node (SLN) bioimaging, and we observed pH-dependent cytoplasmic images and intense green fluorescence in SLN and lymphatic vessels.

TI  - A systematic review of axillary nodal irradiation for the management of the axilla in patients with early-stage breast cancer
T2  - SURGICAL ONCOLOGY-OXFORD
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Given numerous publications and clinical trials regarding axillary management in breast cancer, we sought to summarize this complex literature to help clarify this field for clinicians. This systematic review focuses on the role of irradiation of the axillary nodes (locoregional nodal irradiation [LRNI]) in the management of the axilla in patients with early-stage breast cancer in various clinical settings.Methods: We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE databases, the Cochrane library, the proceedings of the ASCO, the ASTRO, the ESMO, the ESTRO, and the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (2016-2019) meetings. The quality of the studies was assessed with design-specific tools. The study was registered in PROSPERO. Results: We included one systematic review, one individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis, and five randomized controlled trials (RCTs). After axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), LRNI resulted in small benefits in breast cancer specific mortality, locoregional recurrence, and distant metastases-free survival but not overall survival. After a positive sentinel node biopsy (SLNB), LRNI may provide equivalent locoregional control and disease-free survival (DFS) compared to ALND with a lower risk of lymphedema. No randomized data is available for the neoadjuvant setting. Conclusions: The summary of the role of radiation, is relevant to radiation oncologists for choosing the correct cohort of patient requiring LRNI and to surgeons making clinical decisions regarding the timing and type of breast reconstruction offered to patients.

TI  - SAR Satellite Imagery Reveals the Impact of the Covid-19 Crisis on Ship Frequentation in the French Mediterranean Waters
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Covid-19 pandemic is the latest example in a growing number of health, social, economic, and environmental crises humanity is facing. The multiple consequences of this pandemic crisis required strong responses from governments, including strict lockdowns. Yet, the impact of lockdowns on coastal ecosystems and maritime activities is still challenging to quantify over large spatial scales in comparison to the pre-Covid period. In this study, we used an object detection algorithm on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images acquired by the two Sentinel-1 satellites to assess the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on the presence of boats before, during and after lockdown periods in the French Mediterranean Exclusive Economic Zone. During the French most severe lockdown period (March - May 2020), we observed that ship frequentation remained at the same level from March to July 2020, instead of rising towards the summer peak like in previous years. Then, ship frequentation increased rapidly to a normal level in August 2020 when restrictions were lifted. By comparing morning and evening (7:00 am and 7:00 pm) ship frequentation during this period to pre-Covid years, we observed contrasting patterns. On the one hand, morning detections were particularly high, while on the other hand evening detections were significantly lower and less concentrated in coastal touristic waters than in previous years. Overall, we found a 9% decrease in ship frequentation between the year 2020 and the 2017-2019 period, with a maximum of 43% drop in June 2020 due to the lockdown. So, the Covid -19 crisis induced only a very short-term reduction in maritime activities but did not markedly reduce the annual ship frequentation in the French Mediterranean waters. The satellite imagery approach is an alternative method that improves our understanding of the pandemic impacts at an unprecedented spatiotemporal scale and resolution.

TI  - Spatiotemporal analysis of land use land cover and future simulation for agricultural sustainability in a sub-tropical region of India
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial distribution of rice cultivated area and its future projections are indispensable for providing food security, irrigation water management, greenhouse gas emission, ecosystem, and environmental protection. Accurate simulation of future rice cultivation is challenging in the context of climate change involving spatial modeling. This study introduced a hydrological data-based prediction approach integrating cellular automata-Markov chain model with multi-criteria decision analysis. Three decadal transitions of different land use land cover (LULC) in an agricultural intensified canal irrigated area were analyzed using Random Forest algorithm. The Landsat satellite imageries were classified with an overall accuracy of more than 90%. The results revealed that the area under water sources, plantation, and fallow land decreased by 53.1%, 33.9%, and 63.6%, respectively, while habitation and Boro rice cultivated area increased significantly by 1243.3% and 211%, respectively, during 1988-2018. The kappa coefficient (0.86), allocation disagreement (10.9%), and quantity disagreement (1.16%) revealed good agreement between the predicted and classified LULC map of 2018. The probable distribution of the LULC map in 2028 and 2038 indicated 54.5% and 59.3% of the command area under Boro rice cultivation as a dominant land cover, respectively. Further, the predicted LULC map anticipated that Boro rice cultivation was likely to expand at the expense of plantation and fallow land which may lead to massive water scarcity in the near future. The proposed approach covered up the limitations of spatial modeling on agricultural growth trends by integrating significant driving factors with quantitative and spatiotemporal aspects of LULC transition. These findings will provide a baseline map for sustainable policy reformation and contemplation on the repercussions that local LULC transition has on global environmental change.

TI  - Influence of the sentinel node outcome analysed by one-step nucleic acid amplification on the risk for postmastectomy radiation therapy and the scheduling of immediate breast reconstruction
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background In patients with cT1-T3N0 breast cancer, postmastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT) is considered a contraindication for immediate breast reconstruction (IBR) due to a high risk of complications. The sentinel node biopsy (SNB) is an important determinant for PMRT. In this study, we evaluated the impact of SNB outcome on the planning of IBR after mastectomy. Methods Data of patients undergoing mastectomy and SNB in Zuyderland Medical Centre between 2016 and 2019 were retrospectively analysed. Perioperative factors influencing the planning of IBR and SNB results assessed by the intraoperative one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) were registered. Results Of 397 patients, 169 opted for IBR. One hundred and seven IBRs were performed: 101 tissue expanders, 5 deep inferior epigastric perforator flaps and 1 latissimus dorsi flap. Eighteen patients (18/107) had macrometastases in the SNB, in six of them IBR was cancelled due to the indication for PMRT (33%). In the other 12 patients IBR was executed as planned. A delayed reconstruction was performed in 59 patients. Conclusion In breast cancer patients undergoing mastectomy with macrometastases in the SNB, IBR was postponed in 33% due to risk on PMRT. To predict this risk, we advise to acknowledge the SNB outcome by using OSNA before proceeding to IBR.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Variation of Economic Drivers of Urban Heat Island Effect in Yangtze River Delta
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - It is not deep enough that the theoretical and empirical analysis of economic drivers on the urban heat island (UHI) effect have been researched. Consequently, the study of economic drivers of the UHI effect is not only conducive to the governance of the UHI problem but also conducive to deepening the study of related issues in the economic field. The Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region of China has developed economic status and the special geography of estuaries and coasts. Therefore, 26 central cities in the YRD region are selected as research samples, and the period from 2003 to 2017 is taken as the observation period. The Spatio-temporal variability of UHI intensity caused by industrialization and urbanization is analyzed by using MODIS land surface temperature (LST) data and related yearbook data. The conclusions are as follows:(1) The UHI intensity of cities in the YRD region is significant and fluctuates to a certain extent. (2) Empirical analysis shows that the agglomeration of single economic factors in the process of industrialization and urbanization does correlate with the UHI intensity in the YRD region, but the correlation may show a downward trend due to the influence of exogenous factors suc0h as physical geography. (3) In terms of economic drivers, the combination of multiple factors can produce a greater UHI intensity. The model of their impacts on UHI intensity is increasingly-changed, which is from a model of Fixed Asset Investment and the Motor Vehicle Population as dominant factors to a model of multiple overlapping economic factors, and the latter has a greater impact.

TI  - How does industrial agglomeration affect urban land use efficiency? A spatial analysis of Chinese cities
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - While urbanization promotes both economic development and job opportunities, it also exerts enormous pressures on the urban land resource. Increasing urban land use efficiency (ULUE) is important towards achieving the sustainable development of China. This paper theoretically analyzes the impact of industrial agglomeration on ULUE and its spillover effects. Furthermore, the influence of industrial agglomeration is empirically studied by a spatial panel model based on Landsat-TM/ETM remote sensing image data and socioeconomic data of Chinese cities at prefecture-level and above for 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015. The following results were obtained: First, from the perspective of the underlying theoretical mechanism, industrial agglomeration can increase ULUE through labor market externalities, technology externalities, and capital externalities; moreover, spillover effects of industrial agglomeration on ULUE of neighboring cities occurred through spatial interaction among local governments and the spatial flow of production factors. Second, ULUE showed strong spatial correlation, and both specialized and diversified agglomerations exerted significant positive spillover effects on ULUE. Third, the direct effects of specialized agglomeration were significantly positive for northeastern, central, and northwestern China; the direct effects of diversified agglomeration were significantly positive for northwestern China; the indirect effects of specialized agglomeration were significantly negative for eastern China and significantly positive for northwestern and southwestern China; the indirect effects of diversified agglomeration were significantly negative for eastern China and significantly positive for northwestern China. Considering these results, China's future industrial development should be based on sub-regional characteristics. More targeted industrial agglomeration policies are therefore needed to improve ULUE and support the economic development of the Chinese society.

TI  - Urban heat island of Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration in China: Multi-time scale characteristics and influencing factors
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Because the scale of the urban agglomeration is much bigger than that of a single city, the urban agglomeration may present different spatio-temporal urban heat island (UHI) patterns from those of a single city. Here in this paper, the multi-time scale UHI characteristics in the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration were investigated on the basis of remote sensing data, and the factors influencing the UHI effect were also analyzed with the meteorological data and the economic statistics. The results showed that the characteristics of temperature distribution in the daytime were more consistent with the basic definition of UHI than those in the nighttime. The monthly characteristics of UHI in the study area showed a regular movement pattern, and August was the most suitable month for the yearly UHI characteristics analyses. The yearly UHI variations coincided with the urbanization processes in the past 20 years. It was also found that in the meteorological factors, only the average temperature and the precipitation in the central region had linear relationships with the UHI areas. While the correlations between the UHI areas and various economic statistics factors were very significant.

TI  - A responsive fluorescent probe for detecting and imaging pyruvate kinase M2 in live cells
T2  - CHEMICAL COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we designed and tested fluorescent probe zy-2 for specific and responsive imaging of pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), which can be excited by 419 nm light. A 17-fold enhancement in the responsive emission upon zy-2's binding to PKM2 was observed, imaging of which was successfully recorded in a time- and concentration-dependent manner in PKM2-positive cells. Thus, we obtained a responsive fluorescent probe for the specific and sensitive detection of PKM2, which is innovative in design and applicable to the detection of cancer cells.

TI  - Duffy blood system and G6PD genetic variants in vivax malaria patients from Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Over a third of the world's population is at risk of Plasmodium vivax-induced malaria. The unique aspect of the parasite's biology and interactions with the human host make it harder to control and eliminate the disease. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and Duffy-negative blood groups are two red blood cell (RBC) variations that can confer protection against malaria. Methods Molecular genotyping of G6PD and Duffy variants was performed in 225 unrelated patients (97 with uncomplicated and 128 with severe vivax malaria) recruited at a Reference Centre for Infectious Diseases in Manaus. G6PD and Duffy variants characterizations were performed using Real Time PCR (qPCR) and PCR-RFLP, respectively. Results The Duffy blood group system showed a phenotypic distribution Fy(a + b-) of 70 (31.1%), Fy(a + b +) 96 (42.7%), Fy(a-b +) 56 (24.9%) and Fy(a-b-) 1 (0.44%.) The genotype FY*A/FY*B was predominant in both uncomplicated (45.3%) and severe malaria (39.2%). Only one Duffy phenotype Fy(a-b) was found and this involved uncomplicated vivax malaria. The G6PD c.202G > A variant was found in 11 (4.88%) females and 18 (8.0%) males, while c.376A > G was found in 20 females (8.88%) and 23 (10.22%) male patients. When combined GATA mutated and c.202G > A and c.376A > G mutated, was observed at a lower frequency in uncomplicated (3.7%) in comparison to severe malaria (37.9%). The phenotype Fy(a-b +) (p = 0.022) with FY*B/FY*B (p = 0.015) genotype correlated with higher parasitaemia. Conclusions A high prevalence of G6PD c202G > A and c.376A > G and Duffy variants is observed in Manaus, an endemic area for vivax malaria. In addition, this study reports for the first time the Duffy null phenotype Fy(a-b-) in the population of the Amazonas state. Moreover, it is understood that the relationship between G6PD and Duffy variants can modify clinical symptoms in malaria caused by P. vivax and this deserves to be further investigated and explored among this population.

TI  - Dealing with difficult choices: a qualitative study of experiences and consequences of moral challenges among disaster healthcare responders
T2  - CONFLICT AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Disasters are chaotic events with healthcare needs that overwhelm available capacities. Disaster healthcare responders must make difficult and swift choices, e.g., regarding who and what to prioritize. Responders dealing with such challenging choices are exposed to moral stress that might develop into moral distress and affect their wellbeing. We aimed to explore how deployed international disaster healthcare responders perceive, manage and are affected by moral challenges. Methods Focus groups discussions were conducted with 12 participants which were Swedish nurses and physicians with international disaster healthcare experience from three agencies. The transcribed discussions were analyzed using content analysis. Results We identified five interlinked themes on what influenced perceptions of moral challenges; and how these challenges were managed and affected responders' wellbeing during and after the response. The themes were: "type of difficult situation", "managing difficult situations", "tools and support", "engagement as a protective factor", and "work environment stressors as a risk factor. Moral challenges were described as inevitable and predominant when working in disaster settings. The responders felt that their wellbeing was negatively affected depending on the type and length of their stay and further; severity, repetitiveness of encounters, and duration of the morally challenging situations. Responders had to be creative and constructive in resolving and finding their own support in such situations, as formal support was often either lacking or not considered appropriate. Conclusion The participating disaster healthcare responders were self-taught to cope with both moral challenges and moral distress. We found that the difficult experiences also had perceived positive effects such as personal and professional growth and a changed worldview, although at a personal cost. Support considered useful was foremost collegial support, while psychosocial support after deployment was considered useful provided that this person had knowledge of the working conditions and/or similar experiences. Our findings may be used to inform organizations' support structures for responders before, during and after deployment.

T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - namely NIES, ACOS, and Remo Tec (SRFP). These algorithms were compared using GOSAT observation satellite data with reference data obtained from TCCON during the period 2009-2021. According to statistical evaluation, the SRFP and NIES algorithms achieved the lowest and highest correlation values of the 13 year (2009_2021) average of all sites, respectively. The average bias error values of NIES and ACOS was estimated to be less than that of SRFP approximately 0.5 ppm, while the bias within SRFP was of about 2 ppm. Comparing the RMSE and CRMS error values showed that the highest and lowest error values were related to the SRFP and NIES algorithms respectively, which were 0.37-1.67 and ppm 1.46-7.9. The researchers also compared them with monthly time changes based on ground measurements, and observed a time series of CO2 concentration changes that well matched the trend of gas concentration values at ground stations obtained by NIES algorithm. The results showed that in most cases NIES was an effective algorithm to retrieve carbon dioxide gas concentrations, allowing the researchers to identify the main sources of greenhouse gas emissions in different areas. The clustering result in the study area showed that the continental CO2 columnar concentration has a specific seasonal cycle, with the maximum and minimum values appearing in winter-early spring and spring-late summer, respectively. In conclusion, cluster analysis can classify the surface CO2 column concentration values and determine the spatial distribution pattern of CO2.

TI  - Uncertainty in satellite sea surface temperature with respect to air temperature, dust level, wind speed and solar position
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea surface temperature (SST) plays a significant role in studying climate change and oceanic environmental processes. SST has always been measured with buoys and thermometers in the field and by remote sensing-based techniques. The use of remotely sensed SST is significantly more common for mapping SST in wide areas and at high temporal resolution. Remotely sensed SST, however, may reveal uncertainties due to factors such as water depth and turbidity. This is in addition to the atmospheric effects, such as dust, fog, wind, solar angles, and humidity. Thus, in this work, SST estimation by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is compared with the measured in-situ SST in the Arabian Gulf with respect to the aforementioned atmospheric and oceanic variables. Results show that SST estimation is affected by air temperature, resulting in a higher SST bias in the summer than in winter. Further, the SST estimation is affected by water depth (i.e. bathymetry). As the water depth decreases below 30 m, the SST bias increases due to the sea bottom effect. SST estimates are also influenced by the instantaneous changes in dust levels, particularly when the aerosol optical thickness exceeds 0.3. However, when SST is averaged over each month, this impact is not prominent because the dust events are occurring occasionally, so they do not impact the average. On the other hand, wind speed and solar angles do not contribute to SST residuals , as the bias is caused predominantly by air temperature and shallow water depth. (c) 2022 The Author(s).

TI  - Two dimensional searching paths exhibit fractal distribution that change with food availability (Normalized Difference Infrared Index, NDII)
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring grazing activity and grasslands productivity has a great interest for the understanding of the feedback processes that regulate dynamic and conservation of grasslands. In this study we examined the spatiotemporal patterns of free foraging sheep and cattle (no shepherd) to understand how the two species adapt to the changes in food availability and quality in alpine and subalpine pastures during the summer. We used two vegetation indices derived from Sentinel 2 imagery (S2A) to characterize grassland: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII). We hypothesized that sheep and cattle would show different spatiotemporal displacement patterns, which would also change over time with phenology of pasture. We tested this using movement data of tagged sheep and cattle with satellite GPS collars. Animals are yearly free ranging in the studied alpine and subalpine pastures since June to end of September, when they are moved to the shelters. According with optimal searching strategy we predicted that displacement distribution would approach to a random searching path when the forage is more nutritive and abundant, i.e., when livestock have just arrived to their summer pastures. As the summer advances, animals would change their searching paths to an auto-correlated random walk, because pastures lose nutritional quality and consequently food availability is smaller, also due to animal consumption in the grasslands. Our results confirmed that hypothesis and showed that average NDII, a proxy of both pasture quality and time of green-up in the summer pastures, influenced the spatiotemporal patterns during grazing activity of free ranging livestock. We provided the first demonstration of two dimension searching path exhibiting a fractal distribution that changes with the availability of food and the intrinsic characteristic of the forager species, i.e., diet selection. The use of temporal sequences of foraging animals can be useful as indicator of food availability for free ranging animals that can be included in the data recording of GPS monitored livestock.

TI  - Volcanic unrest at Nevados de Chillan (Southern Andean Volcanic Zone) from January 2019 to November 2020, imaged by DInSAR
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The volcanic complex of Nevados de Chill ' an, located in the Southern Volcanic Zone (SVZ) of the Andes, has been active for the past 640 +/- 20 ka. Its volcanic activity includes dome forming eruptions, explosive events, and lava flows. The most recent eruption cycle started in January 2016. We employ DInSAR time-series from Sentinel-1 data to investigate the unrest episode from January 2019 to November 2020. Two distinct periods of unrest are recognized in the time series. The first period (from January to October 2019) coincides with explosive events, dome growth inside the active crater, and a decrease in seismic activity but does not present a significant deformation. The second period (October 2019 to November 2020) is characterized by a displacement towards the sensor's line-of-sight of 100-120 mm. The observed surface deformation is compatible with an inflation source approximately 1.5 km south-southwest of the present active vent, at 5.5 +/- 0.5 km depth from the surface, and with a volume change of 0.044 +/- 0.014 km3. The most likely explanation for the observed inflation of Nevados de Chillan is the intrusion of magma in a reservoir feeding the current eruption cycle.

TI  - Shoreline delineation service: using an earth observation data cube and sentinel 2 images for coastal monitoring
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal management has a critical role in estimating the coastal environmental and socio-economic dynamics, providing various vital regional and local services. Remote sensing earth observations are essential for detecting and monitoring shorelines. UAVs combined with satellite remote sensing address the shoreline delineation problems to detect the shoreline and identify the shoreline zones. The paper presents a shoreline delineation service utilizing UAV and Sentinel 2 images within a Data Cube environment for monitoring coastal areas. The BandRatio, McFeeters, MNDWI1, and MNDWI2 algorithms have been implemented in the service to analyze the accuracy of each algorithm by comparing satellite and UAV-derived shorelines. As a case study, the Lake Sevan shoreline delineation, as one of the most incredible freshwater lakes in Eurasia, has been studied using the service. MNDWI2 algorithm showed the best accuracy for Lake Sevan shoreline delineation.

TI  - Comparative efficacy of BG-Sentinel 2 and CDC-like mosquito traps for monitoring potential malaria vectors in Europe
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Different trapping devices and attractants are used in the mosquito surveillance programs currently running in Europe. Most of these devices target vector species belonging to the genera Culex or Aedes, and no studies have yet evaluated the effectiveness of different trapping devices for the specific targeting of Anopheles mosquito species, which are potential vectors of malaria in Europe. This study aims to fill this gap in knowledge by comparing the performance of trapping methods that are commonly used in European mosquito surveillance programs for Culex and Aedes for the specific collection of adults of species of the Anopheles maculipennis complex.Methods: The following combinations of traps and attractants were used: (i) BG-Sentinel 2 (BG trap) baited with a BG-Lure cartridge (BG+ lure), (ii) BG trap baited with a BG-Lure cartridge and CO2 (BG+ lure +CO2), (iii) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-like trap (CDC trap) baited with CO2 (CDC+ CO2), (iv) CDC trap used with light and baited with BG-Lure and CO2 (CDC light+ lure + CO2). These combinations were compared in the field using a 4 x 4 Latin square study design. The trial was conducted in two sites in northeastern Italy in 2019. Anopheles species were identified morphologically and a sub-sample of An. maculipennis complex specimens were identified to species level by molecular analysis.Results: Forty-eight collections were performed on 12 different trapping days at each site, and a total of 1721 An. maculipennis complex specimens were captured. The molecular analysis of a sub-sample comprising 254 specimens identified both Anopheles messeae/Anopheles daciae (n =103) and Anopheles maculipennis sensu stricto (n = 8) at site 1, while at site 2 only An. messeae/An. daciae (n = 143) was found. The four trapping devices differed with respect to the number of An. messeae/An. daciae captured. More mosquitoes were caught by the BG trap when it was used with additional lures (i.e. BG +/- lure + CO2) than without the attractant, CO2 [ratio(BG+Iure vs BG+Iure+CO2) = 0.206, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.101-0.420, P < 0.0001], while no significant differences were observed between CDC + CO2 and CDC light+ lure + CO2 (P=0.321). The addition of CO2 to BG+ lure increased the ability of this combination to capture An. messeae/An. daciae by a factor of 4.85, and it also trapped more mosquitoes of other, non-target species (Culex pipiens, ratio(BG+lure vs BG+lure+CO2) = 0.119, 95% CI 0.056-0.250, P < 0.0001; Ochlerotatus caspius, ratio(BG+lure vs BG+lure+CO2) = 0.035, 95% CI 0.015-0.080, P < 0.0001).Conclusions: Our results show that both the BG-Sentinel and CDC trap can be used to effectively sample An. messeae/An. daciae, but that the combination of the BG-Sentinel trap with the BG-Lure and CO2 was the most effective means of achieving this. BG+ lure+ CO2 is considered the best combination for the routine monitoring of host-seeking An. maculipennis complex species such as An. messeae/An. daciae. The BG-Sentinel and CDC traps have value as alternative methods to human landing catches and manual aspiration for the standardized monitoring of Anopheles species in Europe.

TI  - A novel fire danger rating model based on time fading precipitation model - A case study of Northeast China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the increase of extreme climate and global warming, forest fires have become more frequent. Therefore, it is important to accurately predict whether fires will occur in forest in the future. Precipitation is an important factor that affects the probability of the occurrence of forest fires in the future. Previous models selected annual average precipitation, monthly average precipitation or drought days as the precipitation value, which the attenuation of precipitation is not considered. In this study, a time fading model is used to calculate the comprehensive precipitation index, which is an exponential weight decay model. The earlier the precipitation time, the smaller the weight. This method can better represent the effect of precipitation in predicting the occurrence of forest fires. Moreover, in this study, discrete fire points are converted into a continuous fire-point density. The structure of the prediction model is more reasonable, which is conducive to obtaining higher precision prediction results. Besides, the SVM regression model was used to construct a forest fire danger rating model. In the same area, considering the comprehensive precipitation index compared with the average precipitation value, the accuracy of the three forest areas in northeastern China in the test set has been improved by about 5%. The accuracy rates of 90.13%, 93.04% and 87.5% can be achieved respectively.

TI  - A method for structural monitoring of multispan bridges using satellite InSAR data with uncertainty quantification and its pre-collapse application to the Albiano-Magra Bridge in Italy
T2  - STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) using satellite data is revealing a promising tool for monitoring long-term deformation phenomena in critical infrastructural systems. Nevertheless, its use in structural engineering is still quite limited and a general understanding of its potential is still missing, especially when dealing with bridge structures for which specific methods of data processing and displacement assessment with error quantification need to be developed, accounting for the type of deformation phenomena and for the orientation of the bridge. In order to partly fill this research gap, this paper proposes a post-processing methodology to derive two-dimensional displacement configurations of multi-span bridges with properly defined error bounds, using both ascending and descending Synthetic Aperture Radar acquisitions. In order to obtain an engineering meaningful estimate of the uncertainties affecting the reconstructed bridge deformations, both random and systematic errors are quantified, accounting for the orientation of the bridge with respect to the Line-Of-Sights of the satellites, the hypothesized deformation plane and the accuracy of InSAR measurements. The proposed procedure has been applied to the illustrative case study of the Albiano-Magra Bridge in Italy, collapsed on 8 April 2020. The results, referred to the monitoring period 2015-2020, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in supporting engineering assessments. In particular, an initially temperature-induced stationary deformation phenomenon has been observed, with all spans moving upwards or downwards during summer and winter. Afterwards, displacements of increasing amplitude for two side spans have been observed during the three years preceding the failure, providing information on the possible cause of collapse.

TI  - CUDA-based parallelization of time-weighted dynamic time warping algorithm for time series analysis of remote sensing data
T2  - COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The time weighted dynamic time warping (TWDTW) algorithm is an important algorithm for the time series analysis of remote sensing images. However, due to the limitation of computational complexity, it is difficult to apply this algorithm to large datasets. Therefore, combined with the characteristics of the TWDTW algorithm. This paper proposes a time weighted dynamic warping time parallel algorithm based on CUDA. First, a GPU many-core stream processor is used to process independent pixel data in parallel, and the cumulative cost matrix is established through a multithreading architecture to reduce the dependence between data. Then, the memory model is optimized to reduce memory access transactions in order to improve the memory access efficiency of the algorithm. Taking the Sentinel-2 remote sensing image as experimental data, the algorithm based on different time series lengths, data scales and thread organizations is experimentally verified, and the execution performance of the algorithm under different conditions is explored and analyzed. The experimental results show that this method can significantly improve the computational efficiency of the algorithm.

TI  - Evaluation of LaSRC aerosol optical depth from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 in Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao greater bay area, China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The aerosol optical depth (AOD) is a key factor to assess atmospheric environment, and accurate monitoring of it is conducive to the research and environmental protection. The Land Surface Reflectance Code (LaSRC) algorithm has been used to retrieve AOD from fine resolution satellite instruments, including the Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2. This study evaluated the AODs against the in situ data (i.e., Aerosol Robotic Network and Sun-Sky Radiometer Observation NETwork measurements). The temporal window and wind speed were jointly applied to determine the spatial window size (i.e., 6 km) centered on the in situ site. And a three-step strategy for calculating the average of satellite retrieved AODs within the spatial window was proposed in this study. As a result, both STEPs 2 and 3 had improvements compared to STEP 1 and the three-step strategy achieved the best performance in terms of the highest coefficient of determination (R2: 0.754) and within expected error (EE: 60.81%), the lowest root mean square error (RMSE: 0.150) and mean absolute error (MAE: 0.113). Then the contemporaneous AOD matchups were used for validation and evaluation of the LaSRC retrieved AODs. The Sentinel-2 AOD retrievals outperformed the Landsat-8 AOD retrievals with lower RMSE (0.138 and 0.173, respectively), lower MAE (0.102 and 0.136, respectively), higher R2 (0.818 and 0.707, respectively) and higher within EE (64.36% and 53.19%, respectively). However, there are 31.91% of Landsat-8 matchups falling below EE and 32.67% of Sentinel-2 collocations falling above EE, which were mainly detected at HKP and HKS sites. And the site-scale validation results revealed that the LaSRC algorithm performed well over inland urban areas, but should be developed further over coastal and water areas in the next generation.

TI  - Response of drainage to tectonics and PS-InSAR derived deformation study in Bilaspur, northwestern Himalaya, India
T2  - GEODESY AND GEODYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The study of drainage patterns in tectonically active regions is conducive to the prediction of regional geomorphology. Subtle subsurface changes can be detected by drainage conditions and manifested in the form of drainage anomalies. The Satluj valley of Bilaspur, which is traversed by numerous faults in northwest Himalayan region, was selected to analyze the effect of active tectonics on drainage evolution. With the Persistent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PS-InSAR) technique, SENTINEL-1A data were used to estimate the active surface deformation between September 2015 and December 2020. The results show that the region between Barasar Thrust (BrT) and Main Central Thrust (MCT) is undergoing deformation of +/- 12 mm/yr. The Stream Power Incision Model (SPIM) was used to predict deformation patterns. To validate the tectonic activity generated by the drainage network, seismic b-values were calculated, indicating the accumulating stresses. This study shows the importance of drainage anomalies in tectonically active areas. When used in close combination with other seismotectonic parameters, drainage anomalies can be effective in delineating tectonically active regions.

TI  - Coupling remote sensing and particle tracking to estimate trajectories in large water bodies
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Propelled by the rapid development of equipment, technology and computational power, the monitoring and simulation of the hydrodynamics in lakes have steadily advanced. In contrast, water quality simulations are more difficult to implement, due to the difficulty in obtaining large-scale, spatially resolved field observations for model validation and the number of interacting processes to be parameterized. Here we demonstrate that remote sensing data can be used to inform Lagrangian particle tracking in a large lake, and vice versa. We used total suspended matter (TSM) as a parameter that can be both estimated from the backscattering in satellite images and modelled in terms of particle abundance. Specifically, we compared TSM concentrations in Lake Geneva deduced from images taken by Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 satellites to those estimated from Delft3D hydrodynamic and particle tracking models. TSM concentrations obtained from both methods were compared over a time span of up to 5 days in several scenario studies, including instantaneous and continuous point sources and large-scale TSM simulations. The results demonstrate that remote sensing images can serve to calibrate and validate particle tracking models with independent observations. The model was able to capture both the position of a TSM cloud arising 5 days after an instantaneous point source release, and the direction of particle transport and TSM plume size resulting from a continuous source. Even when simulating the whole lake domain, model results closely approximated the satellite-derived TSM concentrations along lake transects within 9%. In return, the particle tracking model was able to complete partially impaired satellite images, and fill in a four-day image gaps between satellite revisits. The synergy of remote sensing techniques and particle tracking modelling allows a rapid, continuous and more accurate analysis on solute transport in lakes.

TI  - Estimation of high spatial resolution ground-level ozone concentrations based on Landsat 8 TIR bands with deep forest model
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, China has been facing severe ozone (O-3) pollution, which poses a remarkable threat to human health. Most estimation methods only provide ozone products at a relatively coarse resolution, such as 5 km, but high-resolution ozone data are essential for ozone pollution prevention and control. To this end, we proposed a new framework for estimating ozone concentrations at 300 m resolution in China based on Landsat 8 infrared (IR) bands and meteorological data using a deep forest (DF) model. DF combines the excellent performance of tree integration with the expressive power of hierarchical distributed representations of neural networks. The accuracy and mapping results of DF are considerably better than some widely used machine learning methods (generalized regression neural regression network and random forest). The sample-based cross-validation (CV), station-based CV, time-based CV, and extrapolation validation show that the estimations of DF are in high agreement with the station observations with determination coefficient values of 0.938, 0.926, 0.687, and 0.660, respectively. The proposed method was used to analyze the spatial and temporal ozone variations at fine scales in three typical Chinese cities (Beijing, Wuhan and Guangzhou), where the mean ozone concentrations during the polluted season are consistent with the land use and urban heat island distribution. The rationality of ozone estimates was verified, and the advantages of high-resolution mapping was demonstrated by comparing the monitoring data from municipal controlling stations in Beijing, 10 km ozone products, and satellite images. Our product can represent spatial details and locate local pollution sources, such as temples. The proposed method has important implications for the fine-scale monitoring of ozone pollution.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variation of vegetation heterogeneity in groundwater dependent ecosystems within arid environments
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change, land cover change and the over-abstraction of groundwater threaten the existence of Groundwater-Dependent Ecosystems (GDE), despite these environments being regarded as biodiversity hotspots. The vegetation heterogeneity in GDEs requires routine monitoring in order to conserve and preserve the ecosystem services in these environments. However, in-situ monitoring of vegetation heterogeneity in extensive, or transboundary, groundwater resources remain a challenge. Inherently, the Spectral Variation Hypothesis (SVH) and remotely-sensed data provide a unique way to monitor the response of GDEs to seasonal or intra-annual environmental stressors, which is the key for achieving the national and regional biodiversity targets. This study presents the first attempt at monitoring the intra-annual, spatio-temporal variations in vegetation heterogeneity in the Khakea-Bray Transboundary Aquifer, which is located between Botswana and South Africa, by using the coefficient of variation derived from the Landsat 8 OLI Operational Land Imager (OLI). The coefficient of variation was used to measure spectral heterogeneity, which is a function of environmental heterogeneity. Heterogenous environments are more diverse, compared to homogenous environments, and the vegetation heterogeneity can be inferred from the heterogeneity of a landscape. The coefficient of variation was used to calculate the alpha-and beta measures of vegetation heterogeneity (the Shannon-Weiner Index and the Rao's Q, respectively), whilst the monotonic trends in the spatio-temporal variation (January-December) of vegetation heterogeneity were derived by using the Mann-Kendall non-parametric test. Lastly, to explain the spatio-temporal variations of vegetation heterogeneity, a set of environmental variables were used, along with a machine-learning algorithm (random forest). The vegetation heterogeneity was observed to be relatively high during the wet season and low during the dry season, and these changes were mainly driven by landcover-and climate-related variables. More specifically, significant changes in vegetation heterogeneity were observed around natural water pans, along roads and rivers, as well as in cropping areas. Furthermore, these changes were better predicted by the Rao's Q (MAE = 5.81, RMSE = 6.63 and %RMSE = 42.41), than by the Shannon-Weiner Index (MAE = 30.37, RMSE = 33.25 and %RMSE = 63.94). These observations on the drivers and changes in vegetation heterogeneity provide new insights into the possible effects of future landcover changes and climate variability on GDEs. This information is imperative, considering that these environments are biodiversity hot spots that are capable of supporting many livelihoods. More importantly, this work provides a spatially explicit framework on how GDEs can be monitored to achieve Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Number 15.

This phenomenon is difficult to measure over large and remote areas but can be inferred from changes in the distribution of salt-tolerant vegetation, such as mangroves, observable from satellite imagery. The northern coast of Brazil has the largest continuous mangrove forest in the world and very low human occupation. Even so, saltwater intrusion and changes to the coastline have been reported in this region, with potential consequences for mangrove carbon storage and for local livelihoods, but this has not been quantified due to the remoteness of the area. This study measured changes in mangrove distribution along the Northern Brazil coast in the state of Amapa, covering ca. 15,000 km(2), over the last 38 years using Landsat satellite imagery. We found that mangrove area in this region is highly dynamic, with significant gains and losses occurring over the study period, but with an overall net gain of 157 km(2). Mangroves have been systematically expanding inland and this growth has accelerated close to the shoreline and at the head of tidal channels in the last two decades, indicating rapid and large-scale saltwater intrusion in this region. This phenomenon is likely driven by sea level rise, which also accelerated in this region in recent decades, but anthropogenic impacts such as buffalo grazing may also play an important role.

TI  - The potential of remotely-sensed data to identify suitable sites for the reintroduction of Arabian Oryx (<i>Oryx leucoryx</i>)
T2  - ZOOLOGY IN THE MIDDLE EAST
M3  - Article
AB  - We assessed vegetation cover density and distribution in Eastern Jordanian rangeland reserves (2411 km(2)) using a series of Landsat images (34 year's period) and ground cover survey (2020) to identify proper sites for reintroducing Arabian Oryx (Oryx leucoryx). The natural reserves were Burqu Nature Reserve site-1, and site-2 (Dmetheh), and Al Dahek Nature Reserve. Satellite sensor data from Landsat-8-OLI and Landsat- 5-TM were used to derive Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) between 1986 and 2020 and across growing seasons (March and April). The Dmetheh site had the highest vegetation cover density over the growing season and across years (1986-2020). Scattered shrubs and grasses (NDVI: 0.1-0.2) consistently covered more than 40% (600-700 km(2)) of the Dmetheh reserve, while in the other reserves vegetation cover were inconsistent and covered less than 500 km(2). Considering the Landsat- NDVI results, Dmetheh site was selected for further assessment. Ground survey of Dmetheh site showed that there were 54 palatable species (53% of total plants) and total ground vegetation cover (%) of the site in March was about 22.5%. The relationship between Landsat-NDVI values and ground vegetation cover was significant (R-2=73.3, P<0.001). Overall, remotely-sensed data hold promise for the assessment process of identifying proper sites to reintroduce Arabian Oryx in arid environments.

TI  - Estimating Chemical Oxygen Demand in estuarine urban rivers using unmanned aerial vehicle hyperspectral images
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we combined ground-based hyperspectral data, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) remotely sensed hyperspectral images, and 1D-CNN algorithms to quantitatively characterize and estimate the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) of estuarine urban rivers. The spectral response mechanism of COD is imprecise due to its complex composition; however, we found that hyperspectral remote sensing data could be used for COD monitoring because of the data's rich spectral information. The potential of hyperspectral sensors installed on UAVs to estimate and map the COD of urban rivers has not been thoroughly explored. We used in situ above water hyperspectral data from 498 sites and synchronous water samples in band ratio, SVM, and 1D-CNN algorithms to build retrieval models. We found that the 1D-CNN model performed the best with an R-2 of 0.78 and an RMSE of 5.22 when using the original reflectance data as input. The 1D-CNN model may also have a better ability to identify water samples with abnormally high concentrations. Our results revealed that transferring the ground-based derived 1D-CNN retrieval model for COD to the high-resolution hyperspectral images is a reliable method for determining COD from the images. We concluded that UAV remotely sensed hyperspectral images are valuable for COD concentration monitoring and mapping, critical to urban water quality management decision making.

TI  - What caused the spatial heterogeneity of lake ice phenology changes on the Tibetan Plateau?
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - these lakes has undergone remarkable changes in recent years. We obtained the ice phenology records for 71 lakes for the period of 2001 to 2020 and found overall later trends for both freeze-up and break-up dates. As a result, the changes in ice cover duration showed great spatial heterogeneity. Therefore, we analyzed the causes of lake ice phenology changes from two aspects: climate change and lake properties. The results showed that the changes in air temperature dominated the variations in ice phenology, followed by solar radiation. The weakened wind power in the northeastern part of the plateau was favorable for the delay of break-up end dates and the extension of ice cover durations. Furthermore, by changing the lake size and salinity, water balance changes led to aggravated ice phenology changes for some lakes, while for some other lakes, they moderated or even reversed the changes caused by other climatic factors. In general, the spatial inconsistency of changes in multiple climatic factors (especially differences between the northeastern and southwestern parts) during the 20 years was the main reason for the heterogeneity of lake ice phenology changes on the Tibetan Plateau. This study preliminarily summarized some of the effects of climate change and lake properties on lake ice phenology, and the results are important for understanding the physical mechanism of lake ice phenology changes under climate change.

TI  - Investigating the potential impact of ecological restoration strategies on people-landscape interactions through cultural ecosystem services: A case study of Xilin Gol, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Although cultural ecosystem services (CES) are greatly valued by diverse stakeholders, the full range of CES provided by a landscape is notoriously difficult to estimate. The resulting lack of objective norms for CES may lead to the loss of the multiple non-material factors that contribute to how a landscape is valued and experienced. This is especially true under ecological restoration, which could sharply change how people experience landscapes. Therefore, our aim in this study was to identify and analyze the CES that arise from people's interaction with their landscape, focusing specifically on the influences of different ecological restoration strategies. We carried out semi-structured interviews with the residents of villages in the Xilin Gol League, Inner Mongolia, China. Regarding the implementation of ecological restoration measures, the people living in typical pastoral zones would be most affected by these measures because their main livelihood (animal husbandry) depends strongly on grasslands. Our results demonstrated that human perception of the CES provided by landscapes is affected not only by the factors related to an individual's cultural worldview (e.g., ethnicity, age, education) but also by the utility of landscape features, which are reflected in the individual's landscape dependence (occupation). Our research provides a cultural perspective for aspects of local well-being in addition to ecological and economic targets. Understanding these other aspects is critical for implementing sustainable ecological restoration.

TI  - Nation-wide mapping and classification of ground deformation phenomena through the spatial clustering of P-SBAS InSAR measurements: Italy case study
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rising availability of satellite-based multi-temporal interferometric datasets covering large areas of the Earth surface constitutes a huge asset in the context of operational workflows aimed at improving land risk assessment and management. In order to cost-effectively handle huge amount of data, we design a semi-automatic procedure to quickly identify, map and inventory ground and infrastructures displacements by means of spatial clustering performed over very large-scale Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (DInSAR) datasets. The detected deforming areas are then evaluated against the Line of Sight (LOS) velocity vector decomposition and the accessible ancillary layers for a preliminary classification of the triggering factors. We apply our methodology to the mean ascending and descending deformation maps covering the whole Italian territory resulting from 3294 and 2868 Sentinel-1 (S1) acquisitions respectively, spanning from March 2015 to December 2018 and processed through the Parallel Small BAseline Subset (P-SBAS) technique. By setting a displacement rate threshold of & PLUSMN; 1 cm/year, a total number of 14,638 areas resulting from both geometries are found to suffer from instability phenomena, the origin of which are in turn preliminary sorted in 11 classes split between natural causes and man-made activities. With 2 degrees of confidence, we classified landslide and subsidence events as the main causes of deformation within the Italian territory, constituting respectively 31% and 27% of the total unstable areas, followed by volcanic-related processes (22%). Lastly, we provide a complete overview of the deformation phenomena which have recently occurred on the Italian Peninsula starting from national scale statistical analysis and ending up with local scale investigations according to the deformation patterns visible through the vertical and East-West components of motion.

TI  - Prediction of MODIS land surface temperature using new hybrid models based on spatial interpolation techniques and deep learning models
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) prediction is of great importance for climate change, ecology, environmental and industrial studies. These studies require accurate LST map predictions considering both spatial and temporal dynamics. In this study, multilayer perceptron (MLP), long short-term memory (LSTM) and an integrated machine learning model, namely Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM), were utilized for one step ahead LST prediction. Data were gathered from 1-day (MYD11A1) and 8-day composite (MYD11A2) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors, which have 1-km x 1-km spatial resolution. Considering the inability of MODIS sensors to provide LST data under cloudy conditions, Inverse DISTANCE WEIGHTING (IDW), natural neighbor (NN), and cubic spline (C) methods were used to overcome the missing pixel problem. The proposed methods were tested over the Northern part of Adana province, Turkey, and the performances of the models were quantitatively evaluated through performance measures, namely, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The selected datasets range from 01 January 2017 to 01 November 2020 and from 01 January 2015 to 01 November 2020 for daily LST and 8-day composite LST, respectively. While 60% of the datasets were used as training set, the remaining 40% were used as validation (20%) and test (20%) sets. RMSE maps were generated to evaluate the pixelwise performance of the proposed method. On the other hand, the best average RMSE and MAE for the daily test set were obtained from the combination of ConvLSTM and NN (NN-ConvLSTM) as 3.62 degrees C and 2.85 degrees C, respectively, while they were acquired 3.57 degrees C and 2.69 C-o from the combination of MLP and NN (NN-MLP) for the 8-day composite LST test set. The results revealed that the proposed hybrid models could be used for one step ahead spatiotemporal prediction of LST data.

TI  - Development of a new index for automated mapping of ratoon rice areas using time-series normalized difference vegetation index imagery
T2  - PEDOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Over recent decades, the global demand for food has continued to grow, owing to population growth and the loss of arable land. Rice ratooning offers new opportunities for increasing rice production and has received renewed interest because of the minimal additional labor input required for its adoption. Regular, regional-scale monitoring of the spatial patterns of both traditional and ratoon rice cropping systems provides essential information for agricultural resource management and food security studies. However, the similar phenological characteristics of traditional double rice and ratoon rice cropping systems make it challenging to accurately classify these cropping practices based on satellite observations alone. In this study, we first proposed an improved phenology-based rice cropping area detection algorithm using moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) imagery. A new index, ratoon rice index, was then developed to automatically delineate ratoon rice cropping areas with the aid of a base map of rice in Hubei Province, China. The accuracy assessment using ground truth data showed that our approach could map both traditional and ratoon rice cropping areas with high user accuracy (91.25% and 91.43%, respectively). The MODIS-retrieved rice cropping areas were validated using annual agricultural census data, and coefficient of determination (R-2) values of 0.60 and 0.41 were recorded for traditional and ratoon rice cropping systems, respectively. The total area of ratoon rice was estimated to be 1 283.6 km(2), 5.0% of the total rice cropping area, in Hubei Province in 2016. These demonstrated the feasibility of extracting the spatial patterns of both traditional and ratoon rice cropping systems solely from time-series NDVI and field survey data and strides made in facilitating the timely and routine monitoring of traditional and ratoon rice distribution at subnational level. Given sufficient historical satellite and phenology records, the proposed algorithm had the potential to enhance rice cropping area mapping efforts across a broad temporal scale (e.g., from the 1980s to the present).

TI  - Human-elephant conflict and land cover change in Sri Lanka
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Human-elephant conflict (HEC) is a key environmental issue in number of Asian countries, including Sri Lanka. Incidents of HEC have significantly increased in Sri Lanka between 1991 and 2018, with 1734 human deaths reported in this period (281% increase), 4837 elephant deaths (1172% increase), 1053 human injuries (140% increase) and more than 23,000 property damage reports (1406% increase). In this study we present a Sri Lanka wide analysis to explore the role of land use and land cover change (LULCC) in relation to HEC, using official government data and a land cover change dataset (1993-2018) recently developed by the authors using satellite imagery from the Landsat archive. We investigated rates of HEC over time and compared these to rates of LULCC over the same period. We also present spatial analytics of HEC and LULCC, as well as determining hotspots of HEC and LULCC using a kernel density estimator. Annual HEC incidents were found to broadly increase in line with land use change events (r = 0.43, p < 0.05). Human deaths, elephant deaths, human injuries and property damage hotspots show distinct spatial patterns: human deaths and injuries being more concentrated in the North West, Polonnaruwa and Ampara, wildlife regions; while elephant deaths are spread throughout the HEC region and property damage is high in the Central, Polonnaruwa Anuradhapura, North West, and Southern wildlife regions. We found a strong negative correlation between HEC location and distance to LULCC events. In total, 98% HEC occurred within 1 km of an area that experienced recent LULCC Since 2017, the primary HEC hotspots have shifted to the south and east of the country in concert with LULCC. These countrywide perspectives could help inform HEC mitigation strategies in Sri Lanka and other countries facing similar human-wildlife challenges.

TI  - The politics of vaccine hesitancy in Europe
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Vaccine hesitancy threatens public health. Some evidence suggests that vaccine hesitancy in Europe may be linked with the success of populist parties, but more systematic analysis is needed. Methods We examine the prevalence of individual-level vaccine hesitancy across the European Union (EU) and its association with political orientations. We also analyze whether success of populist parties is linked with vaccine hesitancy and uptake. We draw on individual-level Eurobarometer data from 2019, with a total of 27 524 respondents across the EU. We also rely on national and regional-level populist party vote shares. Finally, for a time-series analysis, we rely on aggregated populist party support as measured in the European Social Survey waves 1-9 (2002-18), and national immunization coverage rates from the WHO from 2002 to 2018. Results While vaccine hesitancy is confined to a minority of the population, this group is large enough to risk herd immunity. Political orientations on a left-right dimension are not strongly linked to vaccine hesitancy. Instead, vaccine hesitancy is associated with anti-elite world views and culturally closed rather than cosmopolitan positions. Conclusions Vaccine hesitancy is not only present in all EU member states but also maps on broader dimensions of cultural conflict. Hesitancy is rooted in a broader worldview, rather than misperceptions about health risks. Pro-vaccine interventions need to consider the underlying worldview, rather than simply targeting misperceptions.

TI  - Contrast-Enhanced Spectral Mammography-Based Prediction of Non-Sentinel Lymph Node Metastasis and Axillary Tumor Burden in Patients With Breast Cancer
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeTo establish and evaluate non-invasive models for estimating the risk of non-sentinel lymph node (NSLN) metastasis and axillary tumor burden among breast cancer patients with 1-2 positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). Materials and MethodsBreast cancer patients with 1-2 positive SLNs who underwent axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) and contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) examination were enrolled between 2018 and 2021. CESM-based radiomics and deep learning features of tumors were extracted. The correlation analysis, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used for further feature selection. Models based on the selected features and clinical risk factors were constructed with multivariate logistic regression. Finally, two radiomics nomograms were proposed for predicting NSLN metastasis and the probability of high axillary tumor burden. ResultsA total of 182 patients [53.13 years +/- 10.03 (standard deviation)] were included. For predicting the NSLN metastasis status, the radiomics nomogram built by 5 selected radiomics features and 3 clinical risk factors including the number of positive SLNs, ratio of positive SLNs, and lymphovascular invasion (LVI), achieved the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.85 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.71-0.99] in the testing set and 0.82 (95% CI: 0.67-0.97) in the temporal validation cohort. For predicting the high axillary tumor burden, the AUC values of the developed radiomics nomogram are 0.82 (95% CI: 0.66-0.97) in the testing set and 0.77 (95% CI: 0.62-0.93) in the temporal validation cohort. DiscussionCESM images contain useful information for predicting NSLN metastasis and axillary tumor burden of breast cancer patients. Radiomics can inspire the potential of CESM images to identify lymph node metastasis and improve predictive performance.

M3  - Article
AB  - Background This research aimed to investigate the tasks performed by Coronavirus Disease 2019(COVID-19) prevention and control management teams at primary healthcare (PHC) facilities during COVID-19 pandemic across the mainland China. Methods An online survey was performed and COVID-19 prevention and control management teams at PHC facilities were invited to participate in this research. The top 7 most important tasks in the three different periods of COVID-19 containment were selected and ranked. Participations of tasks were surveyed. Results A total of 998 valid responses (an effective rate of 99.11%) were collected. The respondents were divided into Group A (<= 5 respondents within each PHC facility, n(1) = 718) and Group B (> 5 respondents within each PHC facility, n(2) = 280). The consensus was selected from top 7 most important tasks including screening at travel centers/intervals and screening at entry centers, at-home/centralized quarantine management, transferring, pre-examination/triage and fever sentinel surveillance clinic/fever clinic. Pre-examination/triage and fever sentinel surveillance clinic/fever clinic works became more significant in the regular prevention and control period. Adjusted analysis found that team members of Group A with a college, undergraduate college and graduate school educational background were less involved in pre-examination/triage works (aOR: 0.28; 95%CI: 0.09-0.86, P = 0.026; aOR: 0.30; 95%CI: 0.10-0.90, P = 0.031; aOR: 0.21; 95%CI: 0.05-0.82, P = 0.024). Those who were over the median age were twice more likely to be engaged in managing fever sentinel surveillance of clinic/fever clinic visitors (aOR: 2.18; 95%CI: 1.16-4.08, P = 0.015). Those being specialized in nursing and other specialties were less likely to participate in fever sentinel surveillance of clinic/fever clinic works (aOR: 0.44; 95%CI: 0.24-0.81, P = 0.009; aOR: 0.30; 95%CI: 0.16-0.58, P < 0.001). Those came from central and western China were less likely to participate in centralized quarantine management (aOR: 0.61; 95%CI: 0.38-0.98, P = 0.042; aOR: 0.64; 95%CI: 0.42-0.97, P = 0.037). Team members came from central and western China were twice less likely to participate in screening at travel centers/intervals (aOR: 1.75; 95%CI: 1.14-2.70, P = 0.011; aOR: 1.63; 95%CI: 1.07-2.48, P = 0.024). Conclusion In mainland China, team members of COVID-19 prevention and control at PHC facilities are mainly responsible for screening, quarantine, transferring and monitoring during the COVID-19 pandemic. Pre-examination/triage and the fever sentinel surveillance clinic/fever clinic were gradually valued. Team members with lower educational background are competent in pre-examination/triage works, but more experienced general practitioners are more likely to be in charge of fever sentinel surveillance clinic/fever clinics work. The necessity of COVID-19 prevention and control management teams to participate in screening at travel centers/intervals is subjected to further discussions.

TI  - Impact of land-use/land-cover and landscape pattern on seasonal in-stream water quality in small watersheds
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in land use land cover (LULC) and landscape pattern in arid areas can considerably impact water quality in small watersheds. Exploring the associations between land use, landscape pattern, and riverine water quality can inform land-use planning for water-quality security. In northwest China's Jing River Watershed (JRW), water samples were collected at 67 points in 2016-2017 and analyzed. Coupled with Sentinel-2 remote-sensing images, this study calculated the Canadian Water Quality Index (CWQI) to assign the water-quality category. The Random Forest classification characterized current LULC patterns and computed landscape metrics in a riparian buffer zone. The stepwise multiple linear regression and redundancy analysis methods investigated the relationships amongst LULC, eight landscape metrics, and eight water-quality parameters. The results indicated high concentrations of total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) in the JRW's middle and lower reaches. For CWQI, lacking evident temporal fluctuations was contrasted by noticeable spatial variations. Intense Human activities have aggravated the deterioration of the water quality of the JRW. LULC-type changes, including Waterbody, Forest-grassland, and Farmland, imposed notable impacts on seasonal water quality. For landscape metrics, patch cohesion index (COHESION) strongly correlated with chemical oxygen demand (COD), mineralization degree (MD), and TN. By contrast, patch density (PD) correlated negatively with TN. Interspersion juxtaposition index (IJI) strongly correlated with biochemical oxygen demand after five days (BOD5). COHESION, PD, and IJI can be critical factors in predicting water-quality changes at the small-watershed scale. Our findings offered a robust scientific basis to refine regional sustainable water development strategy and rational water-resource management.

TI  - High-resolution typhoon precipitation integrations using satellite infrared observations and multisource data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Typhoon-related precipitation over land can result in severe disasters such as floods and landslides, and satellites are a valuable tool for estimating surface precipitation with high spatial-temporal resolutions. Accordingly, this study develops a surface precipitation integration framework to combine high-resolution observations from the radiometers of two geostationary satellites, Fengyun-4A (F4) and Himawari-8 (H8), with high-density rain-gauge observations or IMERG data and atmospheric reanalysis data based on a random forest (RF) algorithm. The RF algorithm integrates cloud and atmospheric features from radiometric observations and reanalysis information, and the intensity and spatial distribution of precipitation can be revealed by high-density rain-gauge or IMERG data. We take three typhoons that made landfall in South China during 2018 as examples. The F4-based and H8-based results using rain-gauge data as the predictand both show excellent results, yielding correlation coefficients (R) of similar to 0.75 and probabilities of detection (POD) of similar to 0.95. In contrast, when IMERG data are used as the predictand, the corresponding R and POD drop to similar to 0.5 and 0.93, respectively, due to the uncertainties related to IMERG retrievals. By carefully choosing the predictor, our RF algorithm successfully integrates the information from satellite observations, surface measurements and atmospheric reanalyses, resulting in precipitation estimates that are highly consistent with actual ground observations. Consequently, our proposed integration framework can recon- struct hourly surface precipitation estimates at high spatial-temporal resolutions for historical typhoon studies.

TI  - Contribution of a constellation of two wide-swath altimetry missions to global ocean analysis and forecasting
T2  - OCEAN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Swath altimetry is likely to revolutionize our ability to monitor and forecast ocean dynamics. To meet the requirements of the EU Copernicus Marine Service, a constellation of two wide-swath altimeters is envisioned for the long-term (post-2030) evolution of the Copernicus Sentinel 3 topography mission. A series of observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs) is carried out to quantify the expected performances. The OSSEs use a state-of-the-art high-resolution (1/12 degrees) global ocean data assimilation system similar to the one used operationally by the Copernicus Marine Service. Flying a constellation of two wide-swath altimeters will provide a major improvement of our capabilities to monitor and forecast the oceans. Compared to the present situation with three nadir altimeters flying simultaneously, the sea surface height (SSH) analysis and 7 d forecast error are globally reduced by about 50 % in the OSSEs. With two wide-swath altimeters, the quality of SSH 7 d forecasts is equivalent to the quality of SSH analysis errors from three nadir altimeters. Our understanding of ocean currents is also greatly improved (30 % improvements at the surface and 50 % at 300 m depth). The resolution capabilities will be drastically improved and will be closer to 100 km wavelength compared to about 250 km today. Flying a constellation of two wide-swath altimeters thus looks to be a very promising solution for the long-term evolution of the Sentinel 3 constellation and the Copernicus Marine Service.

TI  - Satellite observations reveal 13 years of reservoir filling strategies, operating rules, and hydrological alterations in the Upper Mekong River basin
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The current situation in the Lancang-Mekong River basin is emblematic of the issues faced by many transboundary basins around the world: riparian countries prioritize national water-energy policies and provide limited information on how major infrastructures are operated. In turn, such infrastructures and their management become a source of controversy. Here, we turn our attention to the Upper Mekong River, or Lancang, where a system of 11 mainstream dams controls about 55 % of the annual flow to Northern Thailand and Laos. Yet, assessing their actual impact is a challenging task because of the chronic lack of data on reservoir storage and dam release decisions. To overcome this challenge, we focus on the 10 largest reservoirs and leverage satellite observations to infer 13-year time series of monthly storage variations. Specifically, we use area-storage curves (derived from a digital elevation model) and time series of water surface area, which we estimate from Landsat images through a novel algorithm that removes the effects of clouds and other disturbances. We also use satellite radar altimetry water level data (Jason and Sentinel-3) to validate the results obtained from satellite imagery. Our results describe the evolution of the hydropower system and highlight the pivotal role played by Xiaowan and Nuozhadu reservoirs, which make up to similar to 85 % of the total system's storage in the Lancang River basin. We show that these two reservoirs were filled in about 2 years and that their operations were marginally affected by the drought that occurred in the region in 2019-2020. Deciphering these operating strategies will help enrich existing monitoring tools and hydrological models, thereby supporting riparian countries in the design of more cooperative water-energy policies.

TI  - Using Machine Learning for Timely Estimates of Ocean Color Information From Hyperspectral Satellite Measurements in the Presence of Clouds, Aerosols, and Sunglint
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Retrievals of ocean color from space are important for better understanding of the ocean ecosystem but can be limited under conditions such as clouds, aerosols, and sunglint. Many ocean color algorithms use a few selected spectral bands to perform an atmospheric correction and then derive the upwelling radiance from the ocean. The limitations in the atmospheric correction under certain conditions lead to many gaps in daily spatial coverage of ocean color retrievals. To address these limitations, we introduce a new approach that uses machine learning to estimate ocean color from top of atmosphere radiances or reflectance measurements. In this approach, a principal component analysis is used to decompose the hyperspectral measurements into spectral features that describe the scattering and absorption of the atmosphere and the underlying surface. The coefficients of the principal components are then used to train a neural network to predict ocean color properties derived from the MODIS atmospheric correction algorithm. This machine learning approach is independent of a priori information and does not rely on any radiative transfer modeling. We apply the approach to two hyperspectral UV/VIS instruments, the ozone monitoring instrument (OMI) and the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), using measurements from 320-500 nm to show that it can be used to reproduce ocean color properties in less-than-ideal conditions. This machine learning approach complements the current atmospheric correction ocean color retrievals by filling in the gaps resulting from cloud, aerosol, and sunglint contamination. This method can be applied to the future hyperspectral Ocean Color Instrument (OCI), which will be onboard NASA's Plankton, Aerosol Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) ocean color satellite set to launch in 2024.

TI  - SARS-CoV-2 Infection Among Pregnant People at Labor and Delivery and Changes in Infection Rates in the General Population: Lessons Learned From Illinois
T2  - PUBLIC HEALTH REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: The Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) assessed whether increases in the SARS-CoV-2 test positivity rate among pregnant people at labor and delivery (L&D) could signal increases in SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in the general Illinois population earlier than current state metrics. Materials and Methods: Twenty-six birthing hospitals universally testing for SARS-CoV-2 at L&D voluntarily submitted data from June 21, 2020 through January 23, 2021, to IDPH. Hospitals reported the daily number of people who delivered, SARS-CoV-2 tests, and test results as well as symptom status. We compared the test positivity rate at L&D with the test positivity rate of the general population and the number of hospital admissions for COVID-19-like illness by quantifying correlations in trends and identifying a lead time. Results: Of 26 633 reported pregnant people who delivered, 96.8% (n = 25 772) were tested for SARS-CoV-2. The overall test positivity rate was 2.4% (n = 615); 77.7% (n = 478) were asymptomatic. In Chicago, the only region with a sufficient sample size for analysis, the test positivity rate at L&D (peak of 5% on December 7, 2020) was lower and more stable than the test positivity rate of the general population (peak of 14% on November 13, 2020) and lagged hospital admissions for COVID-19-like illness (peak of 118 on November 15, 2020) and the test positivity rate of the general population by about 10 days (Pearson correlation = 0.73 and 0.75, respectively). Practice Implications: Trends in the test positivity rate at L&D did not provide an earlier signal of increases in Illinois's SARS-CoV-2 prevalence than current state metrics did. Nonetheless, the role of universal testing protocols in identifying asymptomatic infection is important for clinical decision making and patient education about infection prevention and control.

TI  - Permafrost, thermal conditions and vegetation patterns since the mid-20<SUP>th</SUP> century: A remote sensing approach applied to Jotunheimen, Norway
T2  - PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY-EARTH AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Northern high-alpine regions are currently experiencing rapid warming, which often results in the degradation of sub-surface permafrost and the upslope advancement of vegetation. The present study combines remotely sensed MODIS Land Surface Temperatures (LSTs) and the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) with observed air temperatures to model the thermal and vegetational dynamics in NE Jotunheimen (Norway) for the period 1957-2019. An altitudinal transect on the north-facing slope of Galdhopiggen was used for ground truthing. Results indicate a substantial warming trend since the late 1950s, accompanied by increased NDVI. The spatial and temporal patterns of observed change were not uniform. Winter surface temperatures increased most rapidly, by 2.4-2.8 degrees C at mid- and low altitudes (600-1500 m a.s.l.). The highest increases in NDVI (by similar to 0.1) were detected during the growing season (April-September) and over the mid-range altitudes (1050-1500 m a.s.l.), that is, above the tree line on Galdhopiggen. We attribute this to increased shrubification at these altitudes. Our results confirm that the surface temperatures near the previously estimated lower altitudinal limit of permafrost (similar to 1450 m a.s.l.) have continued to increase during the past decade, likely facilitating further permafrost degradation. Finally, we demonstrate that mapping remotely sensed mean growing season LSTs below 0 degrees C can be used to identify areas suitable for continuous sub-surface permafrost, and mean June-September LSTs above 7 degrees C can detect areas suitable for tree (Betula pubescens) growth in NE Jotunheimen.

TI  - A retrospective 5-year review of rubella in South Africa prior to the introduction of a rubella-containing vaccine
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - South Africa has yet to introduce a rubella-containing vaccine (RCV) into its Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI). Here we evaluated the incidence of laboratory-confirmed rubella and congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) cases over the years 2015 to 2019, to document the epidemiology of rubella and CRS within South Africa prior to a RCV introduction. This retrospective study evaluated the number of laboratory-confirmed rubella cases reported through the national febrile rash surveillance system. A positive test for rubella immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies was considered a confirmed rubella case. For CRS cases, we reported laboratory-confirmed CRS cases collected from 28 sentinel-sites from all nine provinces of South Africa. From 2015-2019, 19 773 serum samples were tested for rubella IgM antibodies, 6 643 (33.6%) were confirmed rubella cases. Rubella was seasonal, with peaks in spring (September to November). Case numbers were similar between males (n = 3 239; 50.1%) and females (n = 3 232; 49.9%). The highest burden of cases occurred in 2017 (n = 2 526; 38%). The median age was 5 years (IQR: 3-7 years). Importantly, of females with rubella, 5.0% (161 of 3 232) of the cases were among women of reproductive age (15-44 years). A total of 62 CRS cases were reported, the mortality rate was 12.9% (n = 8), and the most common birth defect was congenital heart disease. In conclusion, rubella is endemic in South Africa. Children below the age of 10 years were the most affected, however, rubella was also reported among women of reproductive age. The baseline data represented here provides insight into the burden of rubella and CRS in South Africa prior to the introduction of a RCV, and can enable planning of RCV introduction into the South African EPI.

TI  - Monitoring coastal water flow dynamics using sub-daily high-resolution SkySat satellite and UAV-based imagery
T2  - WATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Sub-daily tracking of dynamic features and events using high spatial resolution satellite imagery has only recently become possible, with advanced observational capabilities now available through tasking of satellite constellations. Here, we provide a first of its kind demonstration of using sub-daily 0.50 m resolution SkySat imagery to track coastal water flows, combining these data with object-based detection and a machine-learning approach to map the extent and concentration of two dye plumes. Coincident high-frequency unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery was also employed for quantitative modeling of dye concentration and evaluation of the sub-daily satellite-based dye tracking. Our results show that sub-daily SkySat imagery can track dye plume extent with low omission (8.73-16.05%) and commission errors (0.32-2.77%) and model dye concentration (coefficient of determination = 0.73; root mean square error = 28.68 ppb) with the assistance of high-frequency UAV data. The results also demonstrate the capabilities of using UAV imagery for scaling between field data and satellite imagery for tracking coastal water flow dynamics. This research has implications for monitoring of water flows and nutrient or pollution exchange, and it also demonstrates the capabilities of higher temporal resolution satellite data for delivering further insights into dynamic processes of coastal systems.

First, we use remote sensing techniques to analyze the changing land use and land cover patterns (LULC) and their relationship with emerging land surface temperature (LST) change, that results in urban heat islands (UHI). Second, we follow up on the emergent results from the remote sensing analysis to draw key links with the existing UHI spatio-temporal variations with existing and future planning pathways. Our findings suggest that rapidly reducing green spaces and increased built-up areas are contributing strongly towards increasing UHI. The overall increase of LST in the city is nearly 2 degrees C in the past 5 years, which calls for more urgent climate adaptive planning and action. Document analysis of the Khulna city master plan demonstrates that several mitigation strategies were initiated through the Khulna Master Plan 2001, yet key implementation barriers continue to persist. We conclude by arguing for a holistic approach to green space planning in the city (through strategic action and institutional planning approaches), coupled with local scaled adaptation and mitigation strategies, that can help the planning process to deal with the challenges associated with UHI increase in urban areas.

TI  - Identification of early abandonment in cropland through radar-based coherence data and application of a Random-Forest model
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY BIOENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of increased pressures on land for food and non-food production, it is relevant to understand better, which land resources have become unused and abandoned and where these lands are. Data on where these lands are and what their extend is are not collected in regular statistics. In this paper, we present an approach to detect signs of abandonment in cropping land using radar coherence data. The methodology was tested in the Spanish regions of Albacete and Soria where agricultural land abandonment is a common process. The results show that land abandonment detection using radar coherence data works well for the region of Albacete in arable lands. The radar-based analysis is a relatively simple method to detect land abandonment in an early to longer term state and can therefore be applied once developed and tested further in other regions to larger areas of the EU where land abandonment is serious and needs monitoring and policy response. The applicability of the method to Soria and Emilia Romagna (Italy) regions shows that there are still challenges to overcome to make the method more widely applicable for detecting land abandonment in other environmental zones of Europe. Lack of reliable training and validation data, like Land Parcel Identification Systems data, in regions is one of the challenges in this respect.

TI  - Exploiting Sentinel-1 data and machine learning-based random forest for collectively mapping rice fields in Taiwan
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice is the most important crop in Taiwan. Monitoring rice-growing areas is thus essential for crop management and food decision-making processes. This research aims to develop an approach for seasonally mapping rice areas from time-series Sentinel-1 data in Taiwan. The data were processed for 2019 and 2020 rice cropping seasons, following three main steps: (1) data pre-processing to construct smooth time-series satellite data, (2) rice area estimation using random forests (RF), and (3) accuracy assessment. The mapping results compared with the government's reference data showed overall accuracy and kappa coefficient higher than 87.7% and 0.76, respectively. The rice area estimates at the county level well agreed with the official statistics, with the root mean square error (RMSE) in percentage smaller than 19.7%. An examination of changes in cropping areas between 2019 and 2020 showed a noticeable reduction of rice areas in 2020, mainly attributed to severe drought conditions.

TI  - The use of indocyanine green as the only tracer for the identification of the sentinel lymph node in breast cancer: safety and feasibility
T2  - GLAND SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is now considered the "gold standard " for axillary staging in the treatment of breast cancer. Most of the lymph node mapping experiences have been performed with a radioisotope (albumin-Tc99m) associated or not with the intraoperative injection of a dye, such as Patent-Blue V. Recent studies have shown how the use of indocyanine green (ICG; a drug used for diagnostic use for many years in other sectors) as a fluorescent tracer, allows to obtain alone detection rate of the sentinel lymph node similar or even better, without the risks related to radioactivity and with better use of resources. Methods: From March 2020 to February 2021, 184 patients with breast cancer cN0, candidate for SLNB were enrolled at the Complex Operative Unit (UOC) of Breast Surgery, Breast Unit of the Hospital of Verona. The ICG was injected into the periareolar site and was used the NOVADAQ SPY Elite system (Stryker (R)) for transcutaneous intraoperative observation of fluorescence. The primary objective of the study is the evaluation of the feasibility of the technique and its sensitivity in the identification of sentinel lymph node; among the secondary endpoints the recognition of predictive factors on the identification (t1-t0) and extraction (t2-t1) times of the sentinel lymph node, and on the number of lymph node uptake pathways. Finally, was analyse the safety of the technique. Results: The sentinel lymph node was detected and removed in 98.3%. The average number of sentinel lymph nodes extracted is 1.527, while the average number of total lymph nodes (TLNs) extracted is 3.375. The sensitivity of the sentinel lymph node detection technique with ICG, turns out to be 100%. Finally, in the literature, lymphatic function decreases with increasing age, reducing the identification rate of the SLN; this is not confirmed in our study. Conclusions: Our study confirms the use of the only ICG tracer for SLNB in cN0 breast cancer, demonstrating that it is a safe, effective and sensitive technique, which also allows to reduce costs, risks and organizational efforts.

TI  - Surgical Training in Gynecologic Oncology:A Sea Change
T2  - JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - AbstractGynecologic oncology (GYN-ONC) has undergone a rapid transition over the last 2 decades. The introduction of minimally invasive surgery, the incorporation of sentinel lymph-node mapping, and the incremental role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy have changed surgical practice significantly in our field while adding new challenges for education of GYN-ONC Fellows. Beyond the challenges of increasingly varied surgical approaches and shifting experiences, gynecologic oncology is changing demographically, with the proportion of female GYN-ONC surgeons steadily increasing. Therefore, in addition to developing new strategies to augment surgical training with simulation and video-based didactics, fellowship training programs should also take concrete steps to support the needs of female surgeons. Creating a supportive training environment will likely increase representation and reduce burnout among surgical trainees in order to maintain a healthy workforce for the future.

T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The first case of COVID-19 was detected in Iran on February 19, 2020. From the beginning of the pandemic, some restrictions have been imposed to reduce the spread of the pandemic, which have led to the reduction or temporary closure of some industrial, construction, and transportation sectors. These sectors are typically some sources of pollutants induced to the atmosphere. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of the restrictions caused by the pandemic, on the concentration of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in the atmosphere of Tehran province. Average daily and monthly NO2 concentrations from the TROPOMI sensor of Sentinel-5P satellite before and after the pandemic (i.e., February 20 to August 19, 2020, and February 20 to August 19, 2019) were used. The results showed that the average NO2 concentration in the mentioned period in 2020 was equal to 168.09 mu mol/m(2), which compared to 2019 (195.11 mu mol/m(2)), had a decrease of 13.85%. Therefore, the imposed restrictions to reduce the prevalence of COVID-19 in Tehran province have an impact on the temporary decrease in NO2 concentration. It is recommended that after the end of the pandemic and the reconstruction of economic and industrial activities, measures will be taken to monitor the urban environmental loads and improve the air quality.

T2  - JAPANESE JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay using cytokeratin 19 mRNA may be an alternative to the conventional pathological lymph node diagnosis of cervical cancer.Objective This preliminary study aimed to assess the detection accuracy of sentinel lymph node metastasis in cervical cancer using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Methods We collected cervical cancer tissues and 70 pelvic lymph node samples from patients with cervical cancer. The quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay was performed to investigate the expression of cytokeratin 19 mRNA in cervical cancer tissues and determine the cutoff value of cytokeratin 19 mRNA between the non-metastatic and metastatic lymph nodes. Results The expression of cytokeratin 19 mRNA in cancer tissues was detected in all (71/71) the tumours, with a median copy number of 7.56 x 10(5)/mu l of RNA by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Sixteen lymph nodes were diagnosed as positive by pathological examination. The median copy numbers of cytokeratin 19 mRNA for positive and negative lymph nodes were 43.3 x 10(4)/mu l and 121.1/mu l, respectively. The expression of cytokeratin 19 mRNA in pathologically positive lymph nodes was higher than that in the negative lymph nodes (P < 0.0001) by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis. Using a receiver operating characteristic plot, the maximum sensitivity (100%) and specificity (94.4%) were obtained when the cutoff value was set at 1169 copies/mu l. Conclusions After setting the cutoff value at 1169 copies/mu l, a quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay using cytokeratin 19 mRNA showed high accuracy in detecting lymph node metastasis in cervical cancer. We believe that the quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay using cytokeratin 19 mRNA may be acceptable for lymph node metastasis detection in patients with cervical cancer.

AB  - Background COVID-19 vaccines approved in the UK are highly effective in general population cohorts, however, data on effectiveness amongst individuals with clinical conditions that place them at increased risk of severe disease are limited.Methods We used GP electronic health record data, sentinel virology swabbing and antibody testing within a cohort of 712 general practices across England to estimate vaccine antibody response and vaccine effectiveness against medically attended COVID-19 amongst individuals in clinical risk groups using cohort and test-negative case control designs.Findings There was no reduction in S-antibody positivity in most clinical risk groups, however reduced S-antibody positivity and response was significant in the immunosuppressed group. Reduced vaccine effectiveness against clinical disease was also noted in the immunosuppressed group; after a second dose, effectiveness was moderate (Pfizer: 59.6%, 95%CI 18.0-80.1%; AstraZeneca 60.0%, 95%CI -63.6-90.2%).Interpretation In most clinical risk groups, immune response to primary vaccination was maintained and high levels of vaccine effectiveness were seen. Reduced antibody response and vaccine effectiveness were seen after 1 dose of vaccine amongst a broad immunosuppressed group, and second dose vaccine effectiveness was moderate. These findings support maximising coverage in immunosuppressed individuals and the policy of prioritisation of this group for third doses.

T2  - Canada communicable disease report = Releve des maladies transmissibles au Canada
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Background: The primary vectors of the agent of Lyme disease in Canada are Ixodes scapularis and Ixodes pacificus ticks. Surveillance for ticks and the pathogens they can transmit can inform local tick-borne disease risk and guide public health interventions. The objective of this article is to characterize passive and active surveillance of the main Lyme disease tick vectors in Canada in 2019 and the tick-borne pathogens they carry.Methods: Passive surveillance data were compiled from the National Microbiology Laboratory Branch and provincial public health data sources. Active surveillance was conducted in selected sentinel sites in all provinces. Descriptive analysis of ticks submitted and infection prevalence of tick-borne pathogens are presented. Seasonal and spatial trends are also described.Results: In passive surveillance, specimens of I. scapularis (n=9,858) were submitted from all provinces except British Columbia and I. pacificus (n=691) were submitted in British Columbia and Alberta. No ticks were submitted from the territories. The seasonal distribution pattern was bimodal for I. scapularis adults, but unimodal for I. pacificus adults. Borrelia burgdorferi was the most prevalent pathogen in I. scapularis (18.8%) and I. pacificus (0.3%). In active surveillance, B. burgdorferi was identified in 26.2% of I. scapularis; Anaplasma phagocytophilum in 3.4% of I. scapularis, and Borrelia miyamotoi and Powassan virus in 0.5% or fewer of I. scapularis. These same tick-borne pathogens were not found in the small number of I. pacificus tested.Conclusion: This surveillance article provides a snapshot of the main Lyme disease vectors in Canada and their associated pathogens, which can be used to monitor emerging risk areas for exposure to tick-borne pathogens.

TI  - Longterm multisource satellite data fusion reveals dynamic expansion of lake water area and storage in a hyperarid basin of China
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes play an important role in global hydrologically and provide substantial water resources in hyperarid regions, and they are becoming even more significant as climate change impacts hydrological processes, especially in these sensitive regions. This study proposes a lake-monitoring framework that uses multisource satellite data to automatically estimate the spatiotemporal variations from 1987 to 2020 of lake area, lake water level, and lake water storage (LWS) in the Qaidam Basin (QB), which is a typical hyperarid basin in northwest China. The global surface water dataset provides long-time-series data for lake areas. Multisource satellite images (Landsat 7, Landsat 8, Sentinel 2) and altimetry data (CryoSat 2, ICESat, ICESat 2, Sentinel 3) are used to build hypsometric curves (the fit to the curve of lake area vs lake water level) to reconstruct lake water level before the 21st century. In contrast with traditional methods, we propose to verify the construction of a hypsometric curve to select a reasonable curve and thereby improve the accuracy of the extrapolation of lake water level. On this basis, we estimated the variation of LWS from 1987 to 2020 and to use products of the gravity recovery and climate experiment and of land surface model simulations to estimate the variation in total LWS in the QB for comparative analysis. The results show that the total LWS in the QB has increased by 82.63% over the past 33 years. Compared with the mean value from 2004 to 2009, the total LWS in 2020 increased by 4.41 km(3), which is equivalent to 12.53%-19.49% of the increase in terrestrial water storage. This ratio cannot be ignored. The analysis of spatiotemporal variations in lakes shows that large shallow lakes are disappearing, leading to ecological deterioration in some areas. Conversely, there is increased water storage in small deep lakes, which may be beneficial for water conservation in hyperarid basins. In conclusion, the proposed automated processing program should facilitate the rapid monitoring of lake dynamics around the world. We emphasize that the variation of lake water storage in hyperarid basins cannot be ignored, which should stimulate more relevant research.

TI  - Preliminary evaluation of all-sky radiance assimilation scheme with POD-3DEnVar method
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - To meet the challenges in satellite data assimilation involving cloud and precipitation processes, an all-sky radiance assimilation scheme (referred to as the 'scheme') that includes hydrometeor analysis is constructed based on the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD)-3DEnVar method. Three key elements of the scheme are: (1) four hydrometeor mixing ratios for cloud-water, cloud-ice, rain, and snow in the control variables of the POD3DEnVar method; (2) an extension of the Community Radiative Transfer Model interface to include hydrometeor profiles; and (3) multiple physical process model forecasts that use multiple microphysical and cumulus parameterization schemes as ensemble samples to estimate the flow-dependent background error covariance of the control variables, including those for hydrometeors. To evaluate the performance of the scheme, single-observation experiments and observation system simulation experiments (OSSEs) were designed for a binary typhoon case. Results for the single observation experiments show that the scheme can accurately assimilate satellite radiance near typhoon centers and produce reasonable increments for the hydrometeor variables. The background error covariances of the hydrometeor variables have reasonable flow-dependent characteristics. Results for the OSSEs have root-mean-square errors for all control variables of the assimilation analysis field with respect to the 'true' field that are lower than those obtained without assimilation. This indicates that the scheme effectively reduces error for all control variables, including those for hydrometeors. Forecasting experiments reveal that these improvements in the assimilation of control variables result in improved forecasts. However, improvements in the hydrometeor variables are of shorter duration than are those of the other control variables. The impact of improvements in the assimilation on typhoon track and intensity are obvious in the forecasting field.

TI  - Assessment of Salinization Through ANN Learned with Remote Sensing and DEM Data in Soils of the Lower Cheliff Plain (Algeria)
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the constraints for the assessment of salinization is the scarcity of reliable methodologies for accurately quantifying and mapping soil salinity expressed in values of electrical conductivity (EC). In this work, we have estimated soil salinity and assessed the role of topography by applying artificial neural networks (ANN). For that, remote sensing data (Landsat-8 OLI), topography data (ASTER GDEM) and soil salinity values (n = 796) were utilized to perform some ANN capable of quantifying soil salinity whose 80% of these data were intended for ANN learning and 20% for results' validation. Soil salinity was estimated through an ANN based on remote sensing data of three bands (B3, B4, B5) with a high reliability (R = 0.89). The established soil salinity map basing those results showed 23.8% of soil was affected by salinization in the last decade, and confirmed the advanced state of land degradation. The application of an ANN allowed to estimate the correlation between soil salinity values and elevation and slope data (R = 0.74). This correlation improved with the addition of bands data in another ANN with R = 0.77.

TI  - How do accuracy and model agreement vary with versioning, scale, and landscape heterogeneity for satellite-derived vegetation maps in sagebrush steppe?
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Maps of the distribution and abundance of dominant plants derived from satellite data are essential for ecological research and management, particularly in the vast semiarid shrub-steppe. Appropriate application of these maps requires an understanding of model accuracy and precision, and how it might vary across space, time, and different vegetation types. For a 113 k Ha burn area, we compared modeled maps of different vegetation cover types created from satellite data to 'benchmark" models based on intensive field sampling (similar to 1500-2000 plots resampled annually for 5 years) for three new satellite-derived models: USDA Rangeland Analysis Platform (RAP), the USGS Rangeland Condition Monitoring Assessment and Projection (RCMAP), and USGS fractional estimate of exotic annual grass cover (USGS-fractional-EAG). We assessed out-of-sample point accuracy and asked if and how accuracy changed each year due to vegetation shifts, new images, and model improvements (i.e. model versions). We also assessed how map agreement between satellite-based and field-based models changed with scale of application, topography, and time since fire. Accuracy and map agreement varied considerably among the vegetation types and across time and space (r2 ranging from 0 to 0.53), and some of the variability was predictable. All models tended to over or underestimate cover when field-measured cover was relatively low or high, respectively, i.e. a "false moderating effect". Accuracy was greater and improved with newer versions of RAP (+0.05 to 0.29 r2) compared to RCMAP and USGS fractional model estimates, and in some cases was greater than field-based models. Variability in map agreement tended to decrease with larger areas sampled (particularly in areas >12 km), and this scale dependency was more evident in RAP and USGS-fractional-EAG models. Creating a "fair" basis for comparison of spatial models of lowstatured semiarid vegetation derived from satellite compared to field data is not trivial because scaling the field data to the scale of large satellite pixels (or downscaling satellite-based models to field scale) requires modeling and associated model uncertainty. Accuracy can vary considerably and understanding the variation can help guide application of the models to the appropriate time, place, and variables.

TI  - Generating Graph-Inspired Descriptors by Merging Ground-Level and Satellite Data for Robot Localization
T2  - CYBERNETICS AND SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Semantic interpretation of regions or entities is increasingly attracting the attention of scholars, owing to its vast applicability in several disciplines. In this context, modern autonomous systems are capable to semantically recognize and separate entities from camera measurements, while effectively interprete and interact with their environment in a higher level. Extending this notion, the semantic representation of the surroundings, based on satellite and ground-level data, is considered a fundamental property for self-localization, especially in the absence of any georeferencing signal. Keeping that in mind, in this article, we present a robust algorithm to locate the position of an autonomous vehicle within a georeferenced map using graph-based descriptors with semantic and metric information from both its memory and query measurements. In particular, an enhanced prerecorded satellite map is processed to compute semantic memories, whilst ground-level query views are used as a means to identify similarities and extrapolate the location of a moving vehicle. The above components are evaluated under an extensive set of experiments, revealing the robustness and accuracy of our final robot localization system.

TI  - A Review of Data Assimilation on Aerosol Optical, Radiative, and Climatic Effects Study
T2  - AEROSOL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Review
AB  - Aerosol plays an important role in many significant environmental and climate-related issues. Accurate simulation and prediction are critical to understanding aerosol behaviors, aerosol processes, and aerosol effects. However, large uncertainties in the simplified parameterizations of aerosol processes, the optical calculations, and radiation calculations hinder the accurate simulations of aerosol distributions and their influences. The observation limitations in spatio-temporal scales also make it difficult to reproduce the three-dimensional aerosol features. The aerosol data assimilation method can combine both the modeling information with multi-platform aerosol observations to improve the accurate predictions and behaviors of aerosols, hence optimizing the evaluations of aerosol radiative and climatic effects. In this paper, we briefly introduce the developments of the principal methods for aerosol data assimilation and their implementations in investigating the aerosol optical properties, radiative effects, and climatic effects in China. The challenges and development trends in improvements of aerosol data assimilation are also highlighted.

TI  - Framework for near real-time forest inventory using multi source remote sensing data
T2  - FORESTRY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Forestry inventory update is a critical component of sustainable forest management, requiring both the spatially explicit identification of forest cover change and integration of sampled or modelled components like growth and regeneration. Contemporary inventory data demands are shifting, with an increased focus on accurate attribute estimation via the integration of advanced remote sensing data such as airborne laser scanning (ALS). Key challenges remain, however, on how to maintain and update these next-generation inventories as they age. Of particular interest is the identification of remotely sensed data that can be applied cost effectively, as well as establishing frameworks to integrate these data to update information on forest condition, predict future growth and yield, and integrate information that can guide forest management or silvicultural decisions such as thinning and harvesting prescriptions. The purpose of this article is to develop a conceptual framework for forestry inventory update, which is also known as the establishment of a 'living inventory'. The proposed framework contains the critical components of an inventory update including inventory and growth monitoring, change detection and error propagation. In the framework, we build on existing applications of ALS-derived enhanced inventories and integrate them with data from satellite constellations of free and open, analysis-ready moderate spatial resolution imagery. Based on a review of the current literature, our approach fits trajectories to chronosequences of pixel-level spectral index values to detect change. When stand-replacing change is detected, corresponding values of cell-level inventory attributes are reset and re-established based on an assigned growth curve. In the case of non-stand-replacing disturbances, cell estimates are modified based on predictive models developed between the degree of observed spectral change and relative changes in the inventory attributes. We propose that additional fine-scale data can be collected over the disturbed area, from sources such as CubeSats or remotely piloted airborne systems, and attributes updated based on these data sources. Cells not identified as undergoing change are assumed unchanged with cell-level growth curves used to increment inventory attributes. We conclude by discussing the impact of error propagation on the prediction of forest inventory attributes through the proposed near real-time framework, computing needs and integration of other available remote sensing data.

TI  - Inventory of large landslides along the Central Western Andes (ca. 15?-20? S): Landslide distribution patterns and insights on controlling factors
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The western flank of the Central Andes hosts some of the largest terrestrial landslides (v > km3), which morphologies are particularly well-preserved due to low erosion rates related to the hyper-arid climate prevailing in this region since the Miocene. First-order questions are pending about the factors controlling the development and the triggering of those large-scale slope failures. Previous studies provided some geomorphological analysis and dating on individual study cases, but a regional-scale vision of landslide processes long the Central Western Andes is missing. Here we report an original inventory of large landslides (areas from 0.1 to 180 km2) established along the western flank of the Central Andes between latitudes ca. 15 and 20 degrees S, and from the Pacific coast to the Altiplano. Based on manual mapping (using satellite images analysis, Google Earth and DEMs analysis) and a compilation of previous works, we inventoried more than a thousand large landslides in this region. We then statistically explored the database according to the landslides typology, size, abundance and relation to geologic, tectonic and climatic settings of the Central Western Andes in order to provide a first insight on their controlling factors. Landslide size-frequency distribution follows a power-law with an exponent of 2.31 +/- 0.16 and a cut-off of 4.0 +/- 1.9 km2 showing a strong contribution of the largest landslides to the cumulated landslide area. We revealed a dominance of rockslide typology (86%) characterized by in-mass slides, the rest being rock-avalanche type (14%) marked by typical granular-flow morphologies. Combination of specific lithology and great local relief emerge as favorable conditioning factor for large landslide initiation, in particular in the case of river incisions though ignimbrites of the Paleogene-Neogene (Huaylillas Formation), concentrating >30% of the landslides. Moreover, landslide clusters tend to follow crustal faults networks suggesting a long-term control of tectonic activity. Most of the identified landslides are paleo events. We tentatively argue that their triggering could not have been possible in the current hyper-arid conditions of the Atacama Desert and its periphery. Future research providing dating on some of the landslide clusters identified in this study is needed to explore possible temporal correlations between periods of landslide activity and external seismic and/or climatic cycles.

AB  - The difference between the convolutional neural network and the ordinary neural network is that the convolutional neural network contains a feature extractor composed of a convolutional layer and a subsampling layer. With the development of society and economy, the pace of urbanization is accelerating, and the number and types of urban buildings are also growing rapidly. Digital management has put forward higher requirements for 3D reconstruction of urban buildings. Aiming at explanation the question that sharpness form are proetrate to be blea or bewildered in CNN-supported structure birth from lofty-separation airy conception, an optimise construction birth algorithmic rule is converse to increase the construction brink of proud-resoluteness atmospheric semblance and the twist projection. Remote sensing image target recognition, as the main research content in the current remote sensing image application field, has important theoretical significance and extensive application value. In recent years, deep learning has become an emerging research direction in the field of machine learning, and convolutional neural network is a deep learning model that has been widely studied and applied. More specifically, the construction brink is better by realm vary recursive filter out, and the better appearance is fed into the U-Net nerval netting for making. Afterward, in custom to plentifully take advantage of the sumptuous detail shape of buildings on supercilious sake picture, we tempt to en plot impair from the manage copy and pigeonhole supported on the origin U-Net edifice to increase the school data.

The trial effect of edifice extract from the Panjin City have demonstrated that for the hoagie-optimum pattern data with division of shade areas, the everywhere assortment propriety of buildings recognized by U-Net is above 80%, and the zenith everywhere assortment truth of the amended regularity extension 83%. In this paper, through the research on the application of convolutional neural network in the field of image segmentation, the problems of low segmentation accuracy, long time and high cost in the task of aerial image building image segmentation are solved to a certain extent. The detection and segmentation method of buildings in aerial images based on CNN can automatically detect and segment buildings, and can segment a large number of buildings in aerial images in batches. In scenarios with high segmentation efficiency requirements.

TI  - Interseismic deformation and strain-partitioning along the Main Kopetdag Fault, Turkmenistan, with Sentinel-1 InSAR time-series
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Main Kopetdag Fault (MKDF) is a predominantly right-lateral strike-slip fault that dissects the northern edge of the Kopetdag mountains of Turkmenistan and Iran. The fault represents the northernmost expression of deformation from the Arabia-Eurasia collision to the east of the Caspian Sea, and plays an important role facilitating the motion of the South Caspian Basin (SCB). Despite the kinematic significance of the MKDF, previous geodetic measurements of the slip-rate across the fault have been highly variable, with a recent geological slip-rate supporting evidence for rapid motion across the fault. To resolve this ambiguity, we derive Sentinel-1 InSAR time-series in both the ascending and descending LOS (line-of-sight) to measure interseismic motion across the MKDF. This implements a processing strategy for the correction and performance analysis of tropospheric models from GACOS (Generic Atmospheric Correction Online Service), which suggests a 25-40 per cent underestimation in the amplitude of the tropospheric path delay in this region. Modelling the rate of fault-parallel motion across the MKDF and combining this with a geological slip-rate constrains 9 +/- 2 mm yr(-1) right-lateral motion, along with a shallow locking depth of approximate to 6 km. The LOS time-series resolves path delays of greater than 1 mm yr(-1) in both LOS geometries to the north of the MKDF, aligned with mapped frontal thrust scarps to the north of the MKDF. Modelling this as uplift from deformation across these frontal thrusts estimates 4 +/- 2 mm yr(-1) of shortening across the fault system. This implies that convergence measured with GNSS within the East Caspian Lowlands is partitioned across frontal thrusts to the north of the MKDF. Revising an Iran-Eurasia-SCB velocity triangle suggests that motion along the conjugate MKDF and Shahroud fault zones is representative of the motion of the SCB, which is moving at 10 +/- 2 mm yr(-1) in a direction of 330 degrees +/- 10 degrees relative to Eurasia.

TI  - GNSS-corrected InSAR displacement time-series spanning the 2019 Ridgecrest, CA earthquakes
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - InSAR displacement time-series are emerging as a valuable product to study a number of Earth processes. One challenge to current time-series processing methods, however, is that when large earthquakes occur, they can leave sharp coseismic steps in the time-series. These discontinuities can cause current atmospheric correction and noise smoothing algorithms to break down, as these algorithms commonly assume that deformation is steady through time. Here, we aim to remedy this by exploring two methods for correcting earthquake offsets in InSAR time-series: a simple difference offset estimate (SDOE) process and a multiparameter offset estimate (MPOE) parametric time-series inversion technique. We apply these methods to a 2-yr time-series of Sentinel-1 interferograms spanning the 2019 Ridgecrest, CA earthquake sequence. Descending track results indicate that the SDOE method precisely corrects for only 20 per cent of the coseismic offsets at 62 study locations included in our scene and only partially corrects or sometimes overcorrects for the rest of our study sites. On the other hand, the MPOE estimate method successfully corrects the coseismic offset for the majority of sites in our analysis. This MPOE method allows us to produce InSAR time-series and data-derived estimates of deformation during each phase of the earthquake cycle. In order to better isolate and estimate the signal of post-seismic lithospheric deformation in the InSAR time-series, we apply a GNSS-based correction to our interferograms. This correction ties the interferograms to median-filtered weekly GNSS displacements and removes additional atmospheric artefacts. We present InSAR-based estimates of post-seismic deformation for the area around the Ridgecrest rupture, as well as a 2-yr coseismic-corrected, GNSS-corrected InSAR time-series data set. This GNSS-corrected InSAR time-series will enable future modelling of post-seismic processes such as afterslip in the near field of the rupture, poroelastic deformation at intermediate distances and viscoelastic deformation at longer timescales in the far field.

TI  - Characterizing urban growth in Vientiane from 2000 to 2019 using time-series optical and SAR-based estimates of urban land
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - While annual urban growth rates are declining in many highly urbanized regions of the world, Southeast Asia (SEA) is experiencing an accelerated urbanization process in small and medium-sized cities (SMCs), to which little attention has been paid. High-precision urban land information is a prerequisite for analyzing urban expansion characteristics for SMCs. However, accurately extracting urban land information for SMCs in SEA has remained challenging, considering the lower urban land density, higher vegetation cover, and complex landscape mosaic. This study systematically analyzed the capacities of a set of statistical indicators of time-series optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images in impervious surface extraction. Then, an automatic urban land mapping method was developed by integrating time-series optical and SAR statistical indicators to map urban land area at a finer spatial resolution. The method was applied to Vientiane, Laos, as a case to explore the characteristics of the rapid urbanization process over 2000-2019 and problems related to sustainable urban development. Our results show the statistical indicators of SWIR1, SWIR2, VV, and VH can distinguish urban land from bare soil and cropland, and statistical indicators of NDVI can separate urban land from seasonal vegetated land. The overall accuracies of our products on Vientiane exceeded 95%, and the kappa coefficient was close to 0.90. The study found that the city was experiencing accelerated urban growth, and the urban land area increased from 25.93 km(2) in 2000 to 37.23 km(2) in 2010 and 62.12 km(2) in 2019. Spatially, the urbanization patterns of Vientiane showed a certain degree of sprawl, especially in the suburbs. Rapid urban sprawl poses a significant threat to the urban environment and sustainable development.

TI  - Bio-optical depiction of a polar ocean under global change: Exploring the regional absorption traits
T2  - GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Southern Ocean (SO) is a vital ecoregion that plays a crucial role in modulation of the global carbon cycle and changing climate. Light absorption properties of clear waters are challenging to study due to very low absorption coefficients typical for these waters, and the SO is no exception to this. The present study examines the bio-optical variability of light absorption coefficients of phytoplankton and non-phytoplankton constituents during the Indian Scientific Expedition to the Southern Ocean (ISESO) in the austral summer 2017-18. We characterize the light absorption coefficients of bio-optical constituents, quantify their relative contributions to total absorption, derive phytoplankton size classes from two absorption-based approaches and compare the results with hyperspectral radiometric observations. Our observations suggest a prevalence of the pigment package effect (phenomenon interfering with photosynthetic efficiency of phytoplankton) at both, the frontal (40 degrees S-60 degrees S) and coastal (60 degrees S-69 degrees S) domains, inducing deviations from the expected bio-optical classification of the study region. The total light absorption budget indicated a clear dominance of phytoplankton absorption at the frontal (41.93-85.27%) as well as coastal (36.77-93.71%) region. Further, the dominance of microphytoplankton indicated by the aph (443)/aph (675) Blue/Red spectral ratios supported the impact of pigment package on phytoplankton absorption at both, the frontal (0.5-3.2) and coastal (0.9-3.7) regions. The global absorptionbased (that links the phytoplankton absorption to their size classes) model captured smaller sized (pico and nano) phytoplankton better than the larger (micro). A satisfactory agreement was observed between the QuasiAnalytical Algorithm (radiometer based) and Quantitative Filter Technique (in-situ measurements) for aph retrieval. The OC5 algorithm of Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) was well-correlated with in situ Chlorophyll-a in the region. Our findings improve the existing understanding of bio-optical variability in the SO and highlight the essential considerations that should be taken while assessing the study region through global ocean colour platforms. They also highlight the necessity to assess the impact of pigment package on optical variability while designing satellite data tools at regional a level.

TI  - Mapping winter wheat in Kaifeng, China using Sentinel-1A time-series images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop planting area mapping is essential for crop phenology monitoring, yield prediction, and disaster prevention. In this study, a winter wheat identification method combining Markov Random Field and Spectral Similarity Measure (MRF-SSM) is proposed by using Sentinel-1 A time-series images. It is found that compared with VH polarization, the backscattering coefficient of winter wheat at VV polarization fluctuates more at all growth stages and is used for winter wheat mapping. The result shows that the precision of mapping winter wheat using the MRF-SSM is 89.62% which is higher than using the support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) methods. Because winter wheat near towns can be accurately identified using MRF-SSM methods. Moreover, the MRF-SSM method has the advantages of fewer winter wheat samples and less computation time. Therefore, time-series Sentinel-1A images with MRF-SSM have great potential for mapping winter wheat or other crops.

TI  - Novel vegetation indices for estimating photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic fractional vegetation cover from Sentinel data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The empirical retrieval method based on vegetation indices (VIs) has been extensively utilized to estimate the photosynthetic vegetation fractional cover (FPV) and non-photosynthetic vegetation fractional cover (FNPV). These indices, however, saturate in high biomass environments and are easily influenced by external factors. Three red edge (RE) bands (i.e., RE1, RE2, RE3) are available on the Sentinel-2 satellite, providing new options for estimating FPV and FNPV. Here, sensitivity analysis from PROSAIL-PRO simulations provided a theoretical foundation for developing new indices. Sentinel-2 images and field observations were collected at three growth stages to test the original and new-developed indices for FPV and FNPV estimations. Compared to the original photosynthetic vegetation indices (PVIs) containing the near-infrared (NIR) and red bands, the optimal combinations for FPV estimation in August were RE3 and red bands, while the combination of RE2 and RE1 bands performed best in April. By introducing RE3, RE2, RE1, and red bands in a certain proportion, 4-band red edge PVIs had the strongest correlation with FPV. Although the optimal 2-band non-photosynthetic vegetation indices (NPVIs) in November were two shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands, the combinations of NIR and RE3 bands performed best for FNPV estimation in April. Combining SWIR1, SWIR2, NIR, and RE3 bands, three 4-band red edge NPVIs were put forward, had the highest accuracy for estimating FNPV. The most prominent achievement of the red edge indices is to suppress undervaluation when vegetation cover is high while mitigating overestimation at low vegetation cover levels. However, the optimum weighting parameters of the improved VIs differed depending on different growth stages. We discovered novel 4-band red edge indices are useful for estimating FPV and FNPV.

TI  - Transcriptome mining of genes in<i> Zanthoxylum</i><i> armatum</i> revealed<i> ZaMYB86</i> as a negative regulator of prickly development
T2  - GENOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Zanthoxylum armatum DC. is an important economic tree species. Prickle is a type of trichome with special morphology, and there are a lot of prickles on the leaves of Z. armatum, which seriously restricts the development of Z. armatum industry. In this study, the leaves of Z. armatum cv. Zhuye (ZY) and its budding variety 'Rong-changwuci' (WC) (A less prickly mutant variety) at different developmental stages were used as materials, and the transcriptome sequencing data were analyzed. A total of 96,931 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified among the samples, among which 1560 were candidate DEGs that might be involved in hormone metabolism. The contents of JA, auxin and CK phytohormones in ZY leaves were significantly higher than those in WC leaves. Combined with weighted gene co-expression network analysis, eight genes (MYC, IAA, ARF, CRE/ AHK, PP2C, ARR-A, AOS and LOX) were identified, including 25 transcripts, which might affect the metabolism of the three hormones and indirectly participate in the formation of prickles. Combining with the proteins successfully reported in other plants to regulate trichome formation, ZaMYB86, a transcription factor of R2R3 MYB family, was identified through local Blast and phylogenetic tree analysis, which might regulate prickle formation of Z. armatum. Overexpression of ZaMYB86 in mutant A. thaliana resulted in the reduction of tri-chomes in A. thaliana leaves, which further verified that ZaMYB86 was involved in the formation of pickles. Yeast two-hybrid results showed that ZaMYB86 interacted with ZaMYB5. Furthermore, ZaMYB5 was highly homolo-gous to AtMYB5, a transcription factor that regulated trichomes development, in MYB DNA binding domain. Taken together, these results indicated that ZaMYB86 and ZaMYB5 act together to regulate the formation of prickles in Z. armatum. Our findings provided a new perspective for revealing the molecular mechanism of prickly formation.

TI  - Investigating the effects of planting date and <i>Aphis gossypii</i> management on reducing the final incidence of cotton leafroll dwarf virus
T2  - CROP PROTECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - This is the first study to research management strategies for cotton leafroll dwarf virus (CLRDV) in the south-eastern U.S. The efficacy of aphid vector management to reduce final CLRDV incidence was investigated con-current with efforts to monitor aphid population dynamics and timing of CLRDV spread. Adjusting the planting date and insecticide applications did not reduce the final incidence of CLRDV, which was confirmed in 60-100% of plants per plot using RT-PCR. Aphid population density was reduced, but not eliminated with foliar insecticide applications. Aphis gossypii was the only species observed on cotton and was the dominant species collected in pan traps. Three distinct periods of virus spread were detected with sentinel plants including early, mid-and late-season. Most virus spread occurred during large aphid dispersal events.

TI  - Multi-scale species density model for conserving an endangered songbird
T2  - JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Habitat modeling across a landscape that has gradients of habitat conditions requires potential predictor data that can be quantified at biologically relevant scales. We used remotely sensed data to develop a multi-scale density model in 2018 for the golden-cheeked warbler (Setophaga chrysoparia; warbler), a species that breeds in Ashe juniper (Juniperus ashei)-oak (Quercus spp.) woodlands in central Texas, USA. We first classified Ashe juniper and broadleaf tree cover at a 1-m resolution and used this to map potential habitat across the warbler's >67,000-km(2) breeding range. We then designed a survey for estimating warbler density based on hierarchical distance sampling. We used stratified random sampling to survey for male warblers at 1,804 points across the continuum of tree canopy cover and composition and detected 810 warblers during our surveys. We developed a suite of potential predictor variables for modeling warbler density that reflected vegetation, topography, climate, and anthropogenic land use conditions across the breeding range and developed these at 3 scales representing the territory, site, and landscape. We modeled warbler density and used the best fit model to produce a spatially explicit estimate. Predicted warbler density was influenced by tree canopy cover and canopy height at the territory scale (100-m radius); tree canopy cover, percent of the canopy comprised of juniper, and an interaction between canopy cover and compound topographic index at the site scale (1-km radius); and annual temperature range at the landscape scale (5-km radius). We estimated a population size of 217,444 male warblers (95% CI = 153,917-311,965) and >3,000 males in each recovery unit. After controlling for the duration of point count surveys, our estimate of population size was similar to that reported from the only previous breeding range survey conducted in 2008-2009. Our model results indicated that management activities to increase warbler density should promote woodlands with high tree canopy cover, approximately 60-80% Ashe juniper composition, and tree heights >3 m. In contrast to a patch-based approach, our treatment of habitat variables as continuous helped to credibly map the warbler distribution across areas with broad transitions from woodlands to shrublands. By measuring these predictor variables at biologically relevant scales, we allowed the warbler survey data to define habitat relationships instead of using anthropogenically defined habitat patches. Outcomes from our study show the benefits of developing spatial products tailored to individual species of interest for conservation and management decisions.

TI  - Assessment of Open Access Global Elevation Model Errors Impact on Flood Extents in Southern Niger
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent studies have estimated annual flood loss at over two billion USD dollars in damage per year globally. This figure is likely to increase as populations grow, people move to flood prone areas, and flooding dynamics change. Digital Elevation Models are a primary input into many flood models; therefore, the accuracy and resolution of these data sets have implications for model accuracy that are not completely understood. An increasing number of DEMs are becoming open and freely available, which presents analysts with the challenge of selecting the most appropriate inputs for their specific use case, especially in countries such as Niger where these global DEMs have not been formally evaluated. This study compares the absolute vertical accuracy of four global and freely available DEMs: Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, ASTER, Advanced Land Observing Satellite, and MERIT, with reference to a high-resolution LiDAR DEM, in southern Niger. Specifically, the Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) model is used to investigate the impact of resolution and error on simulated flood extent. There are currently no studies that assess the vertical accuracy of global DEMs in Niger nor that investigate the impact of the DEM geometric variability on flood extents. The ALOS DEM showed the lowest Root Mean Square Error of 1.19 m when compared to the LiDAR DEM, while ASTER had the highest RMSE of 4.2 m. The results of the Height Above Nearest Drainage model showed that at floods under 3 m in depth, the higher resolution DEMs simulated less flood extent; however, once the flood depth exceeded 3 m, the higher the resolution the DEM, the larger the flood extent. These findings suggest that both absolute error and relative error, as well as resolution, should be addressed when applying a DEM to a flood model.

TI  - The nexus between drivers of wetland utilisation patterns, land use/land cover change and ecosystem services in two wetlands, Zimbabwe
T2  - Transactions of the Royal Society of South Africa
M3  - Article
AB  - The study assesses the nexus between the drivers of wetland utilisation patterns, land-use and land-cover change (LULCC) and the current status of provisioning and cultural services in Driefontein and Intunjambili wetlands, Zimbabwe. A total of 280 household questionnaires were administered together with semi-structured interviews conducted with key informants in the two wetlands. Qualitative data were analysed using the content analysis method whereas descriptive and inferential statistics were used for quantitative data. LULCC was assessed using Landsat and Sentinel data for the years 1999, 2009 and 2019. Supervised classification was performed using the Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC) algorithm in ArcMap 10.5. Eighty-six percent of Driefontein and 75% of Intunjambili households indicated that wetland use for horticulture farming was the predominant activity, but for different reasons in the two areas. In Intunjambili wetland, horticultural farming was mainly for subsistence use due to the prevailing semi-arid conditions. This was different from Driefontein, where market availability for horticultural produce was the major factor behind commercialised wetland use. Results of the LULCC analysis showed an increase in the spatial extent of the cultivated area in the two wetland areas, at the expense of vegetation and water and some of the associated ecosystem services. The studied wetlands provide cultural services since they are used as sites for research and academic excursions. The variations in the anthropogenic drivers of wetland use in Driefontein and Intunjambili show that location-specific wetland studies are important to inform appropriate wetland scale utilisation and management policies and strategies that result in the maintenance of ecosystem services.

TI  - One-step nucleic acid amplification for intraoperative diagnosis of lymph node metastasis in lung cancer patients: a single-center prospective study
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - One-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) is a rapid intraoperative molecular detection technique for sentinel node assessment via the quantitative measurement of target cytokeratin 19 (CK19) mRNA to determine the presence of metastasis. It has been validated in breast cancer but its application in lung cancer has not been adequately investigated. 214 LNs from 105 patients with 100 primary lung cancers, 2 occult primary lung tumors, and 3 metastatic lung tumors, who underwent surgical lung resection with LN dissection between February 2018 and January 2020, were assessed. Resected LNs were divided into two parts: one was snap-frozen for OSNA and the other underwent rapidly frozen histological examination. Intraoperatively collected LNs were evaluated by OSNA using loop-mediated isothermal amplification and compared with intraoperative pathological diagnosis as a control. Among 214 LNs, 14 were detected as positive by OSNA, and 11 were positive by both OSNA and intraoperative pathological diagnosis. The sensitivity and specificity of OSNA was 84.6% and 98.5%, respectively. The results of 5 of 214 LNs were discordant, and the remainder all matched (11 positive and 198 negative) with a concordance rate of 97.7%. Although the analysis of public mRNA expression data from cBioPortal showed that CK19 expression varies greatly depending on the cancer type and histological subtype, the results of the five cases, except for primary lung cancer, were consistent. OSNA provides sufficient diagnostic accuracy and speed and can be applied to the intraoperative diagnosis of LN metastasis for non-small cell lung cancer.

TI  - Modelling soil organic carbon stock distribution across different land-uses in South Africa: A remote sensing and deep learning approach
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a critical measure for ecosystem health and offers opportunities to understand carbon fluxes and associated implications. However, SOC can be significantly influenced by anthropogenic land use change, with intensive and extensive disturbances resulting in considerable SOC loss. Consequently, understanding the spatial distribution of SOC across different land uses, particularly at national level characterised by different biomes, is vital for integrated land-use planning and climate change mitigation. Remote sensing and deep learning (DL) offer a reliable largescale mapping of SOC by leveraging on their big data provision and powerful analytical prowess, respectively. This study modelled SOC stocks across South Africa's major land uses using Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and Sentinel-3 satellite data. Based on 1936 soil samples and 31 spectral predictors, results show a relatively high accuracy with an R-2 and RMSE value of 0.685 and 10.15 t/h (26% of the mean), respectively. From the seven land uses evaluated, grasslands (31.36%) contributed the most to the overall SOC stocks while urban vegetation (0.04%) contributed the least. Moreover, although SOC stock was found to be relatively proportional to land coverage, commercial (46.06 t/h) and natural (44.34 t/h) forests showed a higher carbon sequestration capacity. These findings provide an important guideline to managing SOC stocks in South Africa, useful in climate change mitigation through sustainable land-use practices. Whereas landscape restoration, and other relevant interventions are encouraged to improve SOC storage, care must be taken within land use decision making to maintain an appropriate balance between carbon sequestration, biodiversity, and general ecosystem functions.

TI  - Catastrophic PM<sub>2.5</sub> emissions from Siberian forest fires: Impacting factors analysis
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - With increased forest fires due to climate change, PM2.5 emissions also intensified. Record PM2.5 emissions according to Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service in Russia amounted to 8 megatons (Mt) in 2021, which is 78% higher than the average level of 2004-2021 (4.5 Mt). Seven federal subjects (the constituent entities) with vast forest areas without fire protection produced 86% of emissions (6.8 Mt) in 2021, the major losses (6.1 Mt) in Yakutia (Sakha Republic). The ambient temperature in Eastern Siberia is increasing, especially in months of winter and spring seasons (up to +3.6 degrees C) in 1990-2020 compared to 1901-2020 (CEDA Archive); climate change has affected meteorological conditions leading to increased forest fires. The results of the SARIMAX model study for PM2.5 emissions considering meteorological factors using ERA5 and burnt forest area using MODIS (MCD64A1), establishing a significant dependence of PM2.5 emissions on the lack of precipitation and the associated parameters of complete and potential evaporation. This influence long before the fire season (up to 9 months), as it affects the snow cover and the dryness of the fuel by the beginning of forest fires. In turn, high PM2.5 emission values are accompanied by a drop in 2 m air temperature and surface solar radiation downwards due to the aerosol saturation with suspended particles. The average COR for seven federal subjects was 0.79, with the highest forecast result in Yakutia (0.95), indicating the maximum propensity for record emissions due to weather conditions. In combination with forest management without fire protection, meteorological parameters have caused an increase in PM2.5 emissions in recent years in Siberia. The forest needs other ways to manage under the pressures of climate change to reduce environmental pollution associated with PM2.5 emissions from vast Siberian fires.

TI  - Is health-related quality of life 1-year after coronary artery bypass graft surgery associated with living in a greener environment?
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Greenery in the residential environment and in the hospital has been associated with improved surgical outcomes and recovery. We investigated the association between the level of residential greenness of patients with coronary disease and their heart disease-related Quality of Life (HRQoL) 1-year after a coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery.Methods: Participants in a prospective cohort study who underwent CABG surgery at seven cardiothoracic units throughout Israel during the years 2004-2007 filled in the MacNew HRQoL one day before and one year after surgery. Successful recovery was defined as >= 0.5 increase in the MacNew score between baseline and follow-up. Exposure to residential greenness in 90 m and 300 m buffers around the patient's home was assessed with Linear Spectral Unmixing analysis of Landsat 30 m imagery.Results: The cohort comprised of 861 patients (22% female) with a mean age of 65.5 years, and 59.2% classified as low-income. In the total cohort, higher residential greenness was associated with an improvement in emotional HRQoL (OR = 1.33 (95%CI: 0.99-1.79)), adjusting for demographic and socio-economic factors, living in the periphery/center, presence of diabetes, attending cardiac rehabilitation following surgery, BMI, and change in physical fitness and depression over the 1-year follow-up. Although no association was found between greenness and change in the physical or social subscales, a positive association was specifically observed among the low-income patients for the global HRQoL score, OR = 1.42 (95%CI: 0.97-2.10), as compared to the higher-income patients, p for interaction = 0.03.Conclusions: Residential greenness is associated with improvement in HRQoL 1-year after CABG surgery, but not the physical and social scales, only in low-income patients. Ensuring greenery in the living environment may act as a social intervention that supports human health and disease recovery.

TI  - Distributed scatterer interferometry for forested and hilly areas using a topographical homogeneous filtering
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The application of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) has been challenged over hilly and vegetated regions due to significant phase decorrelation. The spatiotemporal filtering techniques can partially overcome this, whereas the so-called 'homogeneous pixels' are selected based on the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) datasets and the computation is not satisfactorily efficient. In this letter, we propose the idea of interferogram homogeneous filtering relying on Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) derived topography features, instead of using amplitude or phase from the SAR images. The method exploits terrain slope and aspect to cluster topographically homogeneous pixels (THPs) and uses a coherence weighted phase-link (WPL) algorithm to reconstruct pixel phase histories. We compare the proposed method with two representative strategies, i.e., the amplitude statistically homogeneous pixels (SHPs) and the similar time-series interferometric phase pixels (STIPs). Results are given using L-band ALOS-1 data covering the forested Island of Lantau, Hong Kong. It is demonstrated that the LiDAR-derived THP has substantially decreased the computation load whereas the coherence of phase and the InSAR parameter estimation have been improved.

TI  - Land use and cover changes on the Loess Plateau: A comparison of six global or national land use and cover datasets
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Image classification often produces large deviations between land use and land cover (LULC) datasets and the 'real' changes, leading to uncertainty in the results of LULC related assessments and the propagated impacts through modelling. LULC products are widely used as input for various large-scale climatic, ecological and hydrological models, but the accuracy and authenticity associated with data quality are rarely fully considered. In the study, six widely used global or national LULC datasets, MODIS-MCD12Q1, EAS CCI-LC, GlobeLand30, GLASS-GLC, CAS-CLUDs and ChinaCover, are used to assess the consistency and reliability of LULC on the Loess Plateau, where land cover has undergone major changes due to "Grain to Green" Project. Results show that MODIS and GLASS products have low quality, with the overall accuracy of 55.3-58.2% and 34.7-39.4% respectively, and the areal and spatial results cannot reflect the real changes of the Loess Plateau. Large areas of croplands in MODIS-MCD12Q1 are classified as natural grassland. Croplands in GLASS-GLC are overestimated in the central parts of the Loess Plateau. Both of MODIS and GLASS products are hard to separate woodlands from grasslands. ESA CCI-LC has higher classification accuracy (73.9%-74.2%) than the released MODIS and GLASS products. The woodlands in ESA CCI-LC is relatively underestimated than that of CAS-CLUD and ChinaCover, and the conversion feature from cropland to forest and grasses is almost absent on ESA CCI-LC maps. Although GlobeLand30 has a high overall accuracy at 86. 6-86.7%, it is inadequate to get the characteristic of returning of cropland to forest and grasses. The most similar land covers are CAS-CLUDs and ChinaCover, which are considered to have highest classification accuracy ranging from 89.4% to 91.6% and can reflect the actual LULC status and its changes on the Loess Plateau. A blending LULC dataset is developed and the overall accuracies for all classes can be improved by 1.63-7.49%.

TI  - Linearized Bayesian estimation of magnetization and depth to magnetic bottom from satellite data
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating the depth to magnetic bottom (DTB) from magnetic data is one of the most important and difficult potential field inversion problems. Since DTB can often be linked to the Curie isotherm depth of magnetite (similar to 580 degrees C), it could provide crucial constraints on heat flow, even in remote or inaccessible areas. Spectral methods are the most popular approach to estimate DTB, but their reliability has been challenged on many grounds. In contrast, space-domain methods have received relatively little attention, even though they might avoid some of the limitations of spectral methods. Furthermore, many DTB estimation methods are to some extent ad hoc, which makes uncertainty estimation and effective communication of the results difficult. In this work, we develop a Bayesian approach to estimate susceptibility and DTB from magnetic data. We describe the subsurface in terms of tesseroids and use a two-step inversion procedure that consists of a Monte Carlo Markov Chain hyperparameter optimization and a linearized inversion. This way, the uncertainties due to unknown hyperparameter are rigorously propagated to the final maps of susceptibility and DTB. Additionally, pointwise constraints based on heat flow measurements can be easily included into the inversion. Synthetic tests are used to determine the accuracy and reliability of the new algorithm. We find that heat flow constraints are necessary to achieve reliable results, although already a small number of points is sufficient. Finally, we apply the algorithm to the Australian continent and demonstrate applicability to real data.

TI  - Consecutive retrieval of aerosol optical depth and total suspended solid concentration in turbid coastal water of Eastern China
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER
M3  - Article
AB  - An algorithm is proposed for consecutive retrieval of aerosol optical depth (AOD) and total suspended solid (TSS) concentration in turbid coastal water using a shortwave infrared band and a visible band. MODIS band 7 (similar to 2.1 mu m) was used to retrieve the AOD in turbid coastal water, as the top-of-atmosphere reflectance in this band is more sensitive than in other bands and water-leaving reflectance (rho(w)) can be ignored. The aerosol model is determined through iteration by predetermining the proportion range of four basic aerosol modes (dust, water-soluble, ocean and soot). The retrieved AOD is used for atmospheric correction. Based on the Pearson correlation coefficient between TSS and rho(w) for the different bands, MODIS band 4 was used to obtain rho(w). A logarithmic model associated with TSS retrieval was established between rho(w) and TSS products of GOCI. For the MOD09GA product, the median, moving, adaptive, and Fourier-transform filters were employed to eliminate strip noise with respect to TSS retrieval. The retrieved AOD was strongly correlated with AOD observed at the Huaniao Island site (R = 0.94; RMSE = 0.0437; mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) = 10.9%). The new AOD retrievals are more accurate than MODIS ocean retrievals and can provide missing AOD products in turbid coastal areas. Fourier-filtered TSS has the best retrieval results (RMSE = 1.3538; MAPE = 32.03%) in comparisons between retrieved and in situ TSS.

TI  - An operational method for mapping the composition of post-fire litter
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent increase in the frequency and spatial extent of wildfires motivates the quick recognition of the affected soil properties over large areas. Digital Soil Mapping is a valuable approach to map soil attributes based on remote sensing and field observations. We predicted the spatial distribution of post-fire litter composition in a 40,600 ha basin burned on the 2017 wildfire of Chile. Remotely sensed data of topography, vegetation structure and spectral indices (SI) were used as predictors of random forest (RF) models. Litter sampled in 60 hillslopes after the fire provided training and validation data. Predictors selected by the Variable Selection Using Random Forests (VSURF) algorithm resulted in models for litter composition with acceptable accuracy (coefficient of determination, R (2) = 0.51-0.64, Normalized Root Mean Square Error, NRMSE = 16.9-22.1, percentage bias, pbias = -0.35%-0.5%). Modelled litter parameters decrease in concentration respect to the degree of burn severity, and the pre-fire biomass. Because pre-fire vegetation was conditioned by land cover and by a previous (2 years old) wildfire event, our results highlight the cumulative effect of severe wildfires in the depletion of litter composition.

TI  - Mapping paddy rice and rice phenology with Sentinel-1 SAR time series using a unified dynamic programming framework
T2  - OPEN GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring rice planting areas and their phenological phases is crucial for yield estimation and informed decision-making. This study proposed a unified method for mapping rice field and rice phenology with a dynamic time wrapping (DTW) distance-based classifier and its variant sub-DTW algorithm using Sentinel-1's synthetic aperture radar (SAR) VH band. Field samplings were conducted for broad landcover types in one of the areas of interest (AOIs). We implemented a pixel-wise k-nearest neighbor classification model with DTW distance to identify paddy rice pixels. Standard rice phenological profiles of the SAR VH band were defined by ground monitoring of a sample rice field. Based on rice planting maps and the standard phenological profiles, rice phenological phases were estimated by pattern matching strategy with the sub-DTW algorithm. Experiments on six counties in Northeast China presented promising results. The overall producer and user accuracy reached 92.9 and 91.9% for rice mapping, respectively. The mean root mean square error (RMSE) for phenology estimation was 3.5 days. Rice planting and rice phenology maps were generated for the six AOIs. The phenological variances of the AOIs implied the effects of climate and rice cultivars on phenological development.

TI  - Time scale selection and periodicity analysis of grassland drought monitoring index in Inner Mongolia
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought monitoring index is the basis for drought monitoring and early warning. SPEI index is characterized by multiple time scales, which time scale SPEI is more applicable to grassland drought monitoring continues to be a hot topic of research. To find the optimal time scale of SPEI for drought monitoring in Inner Mongolia, we randomly selected 11 stations in the lively area of Inner Mongolia grasslands and calculated the correlation coefficients between EVI and SPEI at different time scales for these stations. We founded that the SPEI6 is more applicability and practicability for drought monitoring in Inner Mongolia. Moreover, we applied wavelets to discuss drought periodic fluctuations in Inner Mongolia during 1960-2018. The drought evolution of Inner Mongolia grasslands was characterized by multiple time scales with small cycles nested within larger cycles during the study period. There were 4 types of cycles for the drought evolution of Inner Mongolia grasslands: 3-8 years, 4-32 years, 24-32 years and 6-24 years. Besides, we also found that the 17-year time scale was the primary period for the drought evolution of Inner Mongolia grasslands. Overall, the drought in Inner Mongolia grasslands has eased since 2017. The results will provide some theoretical basis for grassland drought monitoring and early warning.

TI  - Land Reform in The Southern Yunnan Muslim Community: Growing Divergence Beneath The Socialist Rhetoric of Unity, 1949-1958
T2  - JOURNAL OF CHINESE HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - As one of the most influential CCP campaigns that dramatically transformed the Chinese pre-revolutionary society, the early 1950s land reform has not been fully explored in the case of China's ethnic periphery. This article sheds light on the CCP's land reform and its impact on China's ethnic frontier by examining the official policies, implementation, and the reactions of the southern Muslim community in Yunnan between 1949 and 1958. Drawing on county government work team reports and the Party's land reform policy and evaluation records, it argues that although southern Yunnan Muslims were able to selectively internalize some Communist secular ideologies to cope with social and political changes that land reform brought about, the inconsistency between the Party's freedom of religion policy on paper and its local implementation failed to mitigate the ideological discord between Maoist revolutionaries' atheist worldview and Muslim villagers' religiosity. This jeopardized the possibility of reconciliation between the class-struggle-focused radical state and the community life of its religious subjects.

TI  - Remotely sensed carotenoid dynamics improve modelling photosynthetic phenology in conifer and deciduous forests
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Detecting the phenology of photosynthesis, which conveys the length of the growing season, is key for terrestrial ecosystem models to constrain total annual carbon uptake and estimate gross primary productivity (GPP). However, some of the vegetation indices that are widely used for modelling GPP lack the ability to represent changes in the magnitude of photosynthesis, leading to errors in detecting phenology and large uncertainties. Crucially, remotely sensed vegetation indices such as the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) and chlorophyll/ carotenoid index (CCI) can detect changes in foliar carotenoid composition that represent adjustments in photosynthetic light-use-efficiency (LUE) and changes in phenology. We modeled GPP from remote sensing data using PRI and CCI to represent foliar carotenoid changes as proxies for LUE. GPP values estimated from these PRI and CCI modified LUE models were compared against GPP from eddy covariance flux tower measurements, MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) GPP product, conventional meteorological driven LUE-model, and process-based dynamic global vegetation model (ie. JULES) in an evergreen needleleaf and a deciduous broadleaf forest in the Great Lakes region. Overall, and in particular for evergreen needleleaf forests, estimates of start and end of growing season using PRI and CCI LUE-models showed less year-to-year variability than estimates obtained by process-based meteorological models. Although many process-based models provide reasonable estimates of start and end of growing season, our results demonstrate that using regulatory carotenoids and photosynthetic efficiency can improve remote monitoring of the phenology of forest vegetation.

TI  - Ultrahigh-resolution PM<sub>2.5</sub> estimation from top-of-atmosphere reflectance with machine learning: Theories, methods, and applications
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Intra-urban pollution monitoring requires fine particulate (PM2.5) concentration mapping at ultrahigh-resolution (dozens to hundreds of meters). However, current PM2.5 concentration estimation, which is mainly based on aerosol optical depth (AOD) and meteorological data, usually had a low spatial resolution (kilometers) and severe spatial missing problem, cannot be applied to intra-urban pollution monitoring. To solve these problems, top-of-atmosphere reflectance (TOAR), which contains both the information about land and atmosphere and has high resolution and large spatial coverage, may be efficiently used for PM2.5 estimation. This study aims to systematically evaluate the feasibility of retrieving ultrahigh-resolution PM2.5 concentration at a large scale (national level) from TOAR. Firstly, we make a detailed discussion about several important but unsolved theoretic problems on TOAR-based PM2.5 retrieval, including the band selection, scale effect, cloud impact, and mapping quality evaluation. Secondly, four types and eight retrieval models are compared in terms of quantitative accuracy, mapping quality, model generalization, and model efficiency, with the pros and cons of each type summarized. Deep neural network (DNN) model shows the highest retrieval accuracy, and linear models were the best in efficiency and generalization. As a compromise, ensemble learning shows the best overall performance. Thirdly, using the highly accurate DNN model (cross-validated R-2 equals 0.93) and through combining Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 images, a 90 m and similar to 4-day resolution PM2.5 product was generated. The retrieved maps were used for analyzing the fine-scale interannual pollution change inner the city and the pollution variations during novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Results of this study proves that ultrahigh resolution can bring new findings of intra-urban pollution change, which cannot be observed at previous coarse resolution. Lastly, some suggestions for future ultrahigh-resolution PM2.5 mapping research were given.

TI  - Temporal changes of phytoplankton biomass in the western Black Sea shelf waters: Evaluation by satellite data (1998-2018)
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated temporal changes of phytoplankton biomass with particular focus on blooms and their underlying mechanisms within different shelf regions in the western part of the Black Sea for the poorly studied post-eutrophication period. We combined satellite chlorophyll with carbon-to-Chl a ratios to obtain a better proxy of phytoplankton biomass, and applied an algorithm to partition these data into a base seasonal variation and blooms. The base phytoplankton biomass was characterized by a seasonal maximum in October-November, highest values in the Romanian inner shelf region that receives inputs directly from the Danube River, and downward time trends in all shelf regions, coinciding with reduced nitrate inputs from the Danube. The majority of phytoplankton blooms were short-lived events (lasting up to 5 days), which accounted for over 60% of total bloom events. The initiation of spring blooms coincided with the peak riverine input for the Romanian inner shelf and with the formation of the thermocline in other regions. Autumn blooms were observed with the breakdown of the thermocline in October-November. These were most likely sustained by nutrient accumulation in bottom waters originating from riverine inputs in spring and regenerated nutrients from sedimenting organic matter and sediments. Large diatoms may contribute to autumn blooms in the outer shelf regions through harvesting "new" nitrate from deeper waters and hosting endosymbiotic cyanobacteria to extract "new" nitrogen from the atmosphere. Finally, high intensity of upwelling processes could support winter blooms in the Bulgarian outer shelf region.

TI  - The spatial-temporal patterns and multiple driving mechanisms of carbon emissions in the process of urbanization: A case study in Zhejiang, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization has been viewed as an important factor in rapidly increasing carbon emissions. While urbanization relates to various aspects across space and time, a comprehensive assessment of its influences on carbon emission remains scare. In order to explore the multiple effects of urbanization on carbon emissions, a spatial panel data model was applied in this study, by combing nighttime light remote sensing data form 1995 to 2015 in the case of Zhejiang, China. The results showed that on time series, carbon emissions showed an overall trend of growing rapidly first and slowing down then, and its growth rate was closely related to the socio-economic development. Spatially, high carbon emission areas were mainly concentrated in the northeast and eastern coastal areas, while the southwest regions were the main low-carbon emission areas. Furthermore, the investigation of impact factors revealed that the expansion and fragmentation of urban land, augment of the secondary industry, and consumption behavior would lead to growth in carbon emissions, while the connectivity between urban lands, rising of urban population, and residents' low-carbon awareness could promote carbon mitigation. To be noticed, the impact of economic growth on carbon emissions may gradually be weakening as the industry upgrades. Overall, this research has provided a useful insight into the relationship between urbanization and carbon emissions that can support policy makers and urban planners.

TI  - A novel spectral-temporal Bayesian unmixing algorithm with spatial prior for Sentinel-2 time series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Temporal unmixing of Sentinel-2 time series is very challenging due to the heterogeneity in spatial, spectral and temporal domains. To tackle this problem, we develop an advanced spectral-temporal Bayesian unmixing approach, with the following characteristics. First, a heterogenous noise model is designed to address the noise variation across spectral bands and time frames. Second, a conditional distribution of endmembers is designed to better characterize endmembers in heterogeneous mixed pixels. Third, the spatial prior is used to better exploit the spatial information for enhanced abundance estimates and noise resistance. Last, the proposed Bayesian framework is solved by a block coordinate descent strategy to better estimate endmembers and abundances. Experiments using both synthetic and real Sentinel-2 time series demonstrate that the proposed approach provides improved unmixing result compared with existing methods.

TI  - Can axillary lymphadenectomy be avoided in breast cancer with positive sentinel lymph node biopsy? Predictors of non-sentinel lymph node metastasis
T2  - ARCHIVES OF GYNECOLOGY AND OBSTETRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Completion axillary lymph node dissection (cALND) can currently be avoided in those patients with a low tumor load (LTL) and/or a low-risk profile that tested with positive sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). Our objective is to identify prognostic factors that significantly influence axillary lymph node involvement to identify patients who could benefit from surgery without axillary lymphadenectomy. Methods This is an observational retrospective study of consecutive patients diagnosed and operated of breast cancer between 2000 and 2014 at University Hospital La Ribera (UHR). Results The size of the sample was 1641 patients, from which 1174 underwent SLNB. In the multivariate analysis, we objectify a raise of risk of positive sentinel lymph node (SLN) up to 5.2% for every millimeter of increase. The risk of positive SLNB when showing lymphovascular invasion seems to be 2.80 times greater but becomes lower when SLN involvement appears in luminal A, luminal B and triple-negative types, regarding HER2. In case of triple negatives, the difference is statistically significant. 16.7% present affected additional lymph nodes. The proportion of patients with affected additional lymph nodes increase dramatically above OSNA values of 12,000 copies/mu l of CK19 mRNA and it depends on tumor size and lymphovascular infiltration. Conclusions Tumors smaller than 5 cm whose OSNA SLNB analysis is less than 12,000 copies/mu l of CK19 mRNA have a low chance to develop additional affected lymph nodes, thus cALND can be avoided.

TI  - Protecting farm privacy while researching large-scale unmanned aircraft systems platforms for agricultural applications
T2  - AGRONOMY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this paper is to explore data privacy and sharing challenges associated with conducting regional data collection using large-scale unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) technologies. During the 2016 growing season, the North Dakota State University Extension Service and Elbit Systems of America conducted a proof-of-concept UAS Research and Development (R&D) project to use large-scale UAS platforms to address some of the issues limiting UAS technology adoption. While the researchers initially thought that the high-resolution spatial and temporal field imagery collected would be well received by area farmers, the team learned that some had concerns over farm operations privacy and about who would have access to the data. The team conducted multiple stakeholder meetings to address the issues raised. While the flights were successfully executed, problems related to farmer interest in the data collected and how to get that data to farmers were identified. Though the project demonstrated how third party operation of large-scale UAS can remove the operational burden from farmers, the project introduced additional privacy concerns and highlighted the need for better rural broadband to make grower access to data in the cloud practical.

TI  - Understanding Black-White Differences in Support for the Racial Invariance Thesis: Lessons Learned From Philadelphia Area Residents
T2  - CRIME & DELINQUENCY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The racial invariance thesis contends causes of offending are similar across race/ethnicity. Black Criminology perceives some tension with this claim, suggesting instead that Black people share a unique worldview due to the racial oppression they face. This worldview may make Black people more receptive to criminological explanations identifying race-specific pathways to committing crime. In the post-Civil Rights era, many white people explain social phenomena like crime in colorblind ways. This study used a random sample of Philadelphia area residents to explore whether Black people were less likely than white people to support the racial invariance thesis. Logistic regression analyses revealed the odds of Black Philadelphians agreeing with the racial invariance thesis were 85% higher than the odds for white Philadelphians.

TI  - How Do Green Finance and Energy Efficiency Mitigate Carbon Emissions Without Reducing Economic Growth in G7 Countries?
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is one of the most serious threats facing the world today. Environmental pollution and depletion of natural resources have been highlighted by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), paving the way for modern concepts such as sustainable growth to be introduced. Therefore, this research explores the relationship between green finance, energy efficiency, and CO2 emissions in the G7 countries. The study uses panel data model technique to examine the dependence structure of green finance, energy efficiency, and CO2 emissions. Moreover, we use DEA to construct an energy efficiency index of G7 countries. A specific interval exists between the values of the energy efficiency indexes. Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States were named the most energy-efficient countries in the world, based on results obtained for five consecutive years in this category. However, according to the comparative rankings, France and Italy are the most successful of all the G7 members, followed by the United Kingdom and Germany. Our overall findings of the econometric model confirm the negative impact of green finance and energy efficiency on CO2 emissions; however, this relationship varies across the different quantiles of the two variables. The findings in the study confirm that green finance is the best financial strategy for reducing CO2 emissions.

TI  - Seroprevalence of <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> and associated risk factors in cats from Lima, Peru
T2  - VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY- REGIONAL STUDIES AND REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Toxoplasmosis is an important zoonotic disease worldwide caused by the intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii. Cats, being hosts, act as a good sentinel for this disease. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of T. gondii in cats by examining serum from seven districts of Metropolitan Lima, Peru. We collected and analyzed 303 cat serum samples, and the owners answered a questionnaire about age, gender, lifestyle (indoors only and outdoors access) and feeding (commercial and home food). The samples were tested using indirect hemagglutination (IHA) for detection of antibody IgM and IgG. Among the animals analyzed, we found 52 (17.2%, 95% CI: 13.1% -21.9%) seropositive cats to T. gondii, of which one corresponded to acute infection (IgM) and 51 to chronic infections (IgG). In addition, the presence of anti-T. gondii antibodies was associated with feeding commercial food and living outdoors access. Our results concluded that T. gondii infections are common in cats with owners in Metropolitan Lima and will be useful to future epidemiological studies.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping and monitoring forest with time-series remote sensing methodologies requires reference data constructed in a sampling framework. Few worldwide reference data sets with time-series information are currently available for large areas. We produced a global forest reference set at 30 m with time-series information from 2000 to 2020 based on a stratified random sampling scheme. All available Landsat, high-resolution Google Earth images and other relative land cover/land change products were used in a visual interpretation approach. This reference dataset contains 10339 sample units (6252 persisting forest sample units, 2049 change sample units and 2038 persisting non-forest sample units) attributed with annual forest/non-forest information from 2000 to 2020. The results of our analysis highlight many cases of undetected forest change due to definition and other factors, and suggest that change of forest canopy cover could be monitored instead of land cover types. The reference set can be potentially used for many large-area applications such as validation of forest mapping projects or as auxiliary data for forest monitoring analysis. And this reference set will be available online (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5524258).

TI  - Dynamic regionalization of the Panama Bight, Eastern Tropical Pacific, using remote sensing data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study establishes the dynamic biogeographic regions (DBGRs) of the Panama Bight (PB) based on remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs412 and R-rs488) of the MODIS-Aqua sensor and the sea-surface temperature (SST) and the concentration of chlorophyll a (Chl-a) derived from the same sensor. Monthly images with a spatial resolution of 4 km from the MODIS-Aqua sensor were used for July 2002-July 2020. To define the DBGR, the first standardized empirical orthogonal function (SEOF1) was calculated. Due to the low spatial variability in the PB, the number of DBGRs found with the analysis of the SST and Chl-a was lower than that found in the analysis of the R-rs. Therefore, the DBGRs of the PB were delineated based only on the study of the R-rs. The PB was divided into 11 DBGRs belonging to two provinces: oceanic and coastal. Five of the DBGRs were coastal, the others oceanic, including a transition one. The coastal regions were characterized by the highest averages of Chl-a and high SST. On the other hand, the regions located northeast of the PB (Panama Gulf, PB-transition, and Choco) were characterized by an average SST greater than 28 degrees C and an average Chl-a between 0.8 and 1.0 mg center dot m(-3). The DBGRs located further west (west and PB-west) showed an average SST greater than 28 degrees C and the lowest concentrations of Chl-a. The DBGRs PB-east and PB-central, presented average SSTs of 26.7-27.1 degrees C and average Chl-a concentrations lower than 0.5 mg center dot m(-3). The south Ecuador DBGR presented the lowest average SST (<25 degrees C) and average Chl-a of 0.50 mg center dot m(-3). Our approach allowed us to generate a dynamic regionalization of the PB, which most of the year has small SST and Chl-a gradients, making this an alternative to the homogeneous areas generated from the thermohaline structure.

TI  - Does Lymph Node Dissection Impact Adjuvant Treatment or Survival Outcomes in High-Risk Endometrial Cancers?
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectivesLymphadenectomy does not improve overall survival outcomes in patients with low-risk endometrial cancers. Sentinel node mapping has a high detection rate and accuracy; however, its prognostic implications have not been well explored. We evaluated the overall survival and therapies received by patients undergoing varied lymph node dissection approaches for high-risk endometrial cancers.MethodsRetrospective review of grade 3 endometrioid and high-grade non-endometrioid cancers at one institution over ten years. Patients who received neoadjuvant therapy and/or debulking of only grossly abnormal lymph nodes were excluded. Data was abstracted from electronic medical records. Chi-squared tests and survival analyses were used to compare groups.ResultsOne hundred and fifty-three patients with grade 3 endometrioid, serous, clear cell, carcinosarcoma, or mixed high-grade on final pathology were identified; 16 had no lymph node dissection, 26 had sentinel lymph nodes, and 111 had complete lymph node dissection. Patients with open surgery were more likely to have complete nodes than sentinel nodes when compared to a minimally invasive approach (p<0.001). Sentinel nodal dissection significantly impacted the utilization of, or modality choice, in adjuvant therapy (p=0.051). Recurrence-free survival and cancer-specific overall survival were not significantly different across the three nodal-assessment groups.ConclusionsSentinel lymph node dissection in high-risk endometrial cancers led to no significant differences in recurrence-free survival or cancer-specific overall survival. While limited by sample size and its retrospective nature, results from this single-institution study are hypothesis-generating and prompt consideration of non-inferiority trials. Performing the least invasive surgery possibly can lead to fewer complications while maintaining overall survival outcomes.

TI  - Estimation of the Secchi disk depth from the NASA MODIS-Aqua diffuse attenuation coefficient data in the northern Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman: A spatiotemporal assessment
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to propose a method for the estimation of the Secchi disk depth (Z(sd)) values in the northern Persian Gulf, the Strait of Hormuz, and the Gulf of Oman (N-PG-SH-GO), based on MODIS- K-d(490) data. The field-observed Z(sd) values were collected during seven research cruises conducted by a research vessel between 2018 and 2021. A total number of 114 field-observed Z(sd) values were observed in 68 stations. The daily K-d(490) of MODIS-Aqua/L2 data were downloaded for all days (+/- three), where in the field-observed data were available. Different fitting models were examined to estimate the Z(sd) values from the K-d(490). A total number of 73 Z(sd) values observed in the first six research cruises were utilized to propose the optimum model, and the data of 41 stations, observed in the last research cruise were used for the validation of the results. Upon designating the optimum method, all the field-observed Z(sd) values were then employed to create the final model. The results demonstrated that the power model is optimal (R-2 = 0.81 and RMSE = 2.04 m), so the model in the form of Z(sd) = 0.34 K-d(490)(-1.42) might be utilized to compute the Z(sd) values in the N-PG-SH-GO. This model was then employed to determine the monthly and seasonal Z(sd) values to assess the spatiotemporal variation of water clarity in the N-PG-SH-GO. The results showed that the annual variation domain of the Z(sd) values in the N-GO was extremely higher than that in the N-PG and N-SH so that the maximum and minimum water clarity respectively occurred in warm months and colder ones. Compared with the N-PG and the N-GO, the average annual water clarity of the N-SH was lower where the mean annual Z(sd) values for the N-PG, N-SH, and N-GO were determined as 8.91, 6.27, and 10.27 m, respectively.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Seasonal inundation dynamics and water balance of the Mara Wetland, Tanzania based on multi-temporal Sentinel-2 image classification
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic hydrologic alternations are a threat to flood dependent wetland ecosystems like The Mara Wetland in Tanzania, which plays an important role in regulating the quality, timing and magnitude of the flow of water into Lake Victoria and provides natural resources and habitat for a variety of species. Baseline information on the spatiotemporal dynamics of the seasonal inundation is critical to manage potential threats such as dam construction and local climate change, but is challenging to acquire due to the heterogeneity of the landscape caused by the interspersion of open water and emergent vegetation. In this study, intra- and inter-annual inundation pattern of the Mara Wetland are reproduced for 2017-2019 using remotely sensed data. A Random Forest (RF) algorithm is trained bi-seasonally, using eight Sentinel-2 bands, five water- and vegetation-indices and a Digital Surface Model (DSM) to classify the land cover of the wetland region in a semi-automated way, by processing a total of 73 Sentinel-2 scenes based on wet- and dry-state training images for 2017. The scenes are classified into seven classes; three wetland- and four dryland-classes. The overall classification accuracy achieved (based on an independent validation set) is 98.6%. The inundation extents are used in combination with available hydrological field-data to estimate the water balance. The seasonal expansion and contraction of the wetland follows a consistent bi-modal regime, and the results from the water balance affirm the importance of river-flow during the dry-season and local precipitation for the seasonal fluctuations in water-availability.

TI  - Estimating soil organic carbon levels in cultivated soils from satellite image using parametric and data-driven methods
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) is one of the key soil components for cultivated soils. SOC is regularly monitored and mapped to improve the quality, health, and productivity of the soil. However, traditional SOC-level monitoring is expensive for land managers and farmers. Estimating SOC using satellite imagery provides an easy, efficient, and cost-effective way to monitor surface SOC levels. The objective of this study was to estimate the surface SOC distribution in selected soils of Major Land Resource Areas (MLRA), 102A (Rolling Till Plain, Brookings County, SD), and 103 (Central Iowa and Minnesota Till Prairies, Lac qui Parle County, MN), using satellite imagery with different resolutions (Landsat 8 and PlanetScope). The dominant soils in the study area are Haplustolls, Calciustolls, and Endoaquolls, which are formed in silty sediments, local silty alluvium, and till. Landsat 8 and PlanetScope spectral bands were used to develop SOC prediction models. Parametric and data-driven methods were employed to predict the SOC. Multiple linear regression and Linear Spatial Mixed Model (LSMM) were used on the Landsat 8 and PlanetScope data. In addition to the parametric models, Regression Trees and Random Forest were also employed on both satellite data. The results showed that reduced LSMM provided the lowest RMSE, which are 0.401 and 0.367 for Landsat 8 and PlanetScope, respectively. Furthermore, the random forest has the highest RPD and RPIQ for Landsat 8 (RPD of 2.67 and RPIQ of 2.49) and PlanetScope (RPD of 2.85 and RPIQ of 3.7). In all cases, models obtained from PlanetScope are better than those obtained from Landsat 8.

TI  - Multi-modal land cover mapping of remote sensing images using pyramid attention and gated fusion networks
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-modality data is becoming readily available in remote sensing (RS) and can provide complementary information about the Earth's surface. Effective fusion of multi-modal information is thus important for various applications in RS, but also very challenging due to large domain differences, noise, and redundancies. There is a lack of effective and scalable fusion techniques for bridging multiple modality encoders and fully exploiting complementary information. To this end, we propose a new multi-modality network (MultiModNet) for land cover mapping of multi-modal remote sensing data based on a novel pyramid attention fusion (PAF) module and a gated fusion unit (GFU). The PAF module is designed to efficiently obtain rich fine-grained contextual representations from each modality with a built-in cross-level and cross-view attention fusion mechanism, and the GFU module utilizes a novel gating mechanism for early merging of features, thereby diminishing hidden redundancies and noise. This enables supplementary modalities to effectively extract the most valuable and complementary information for late feature fusion. Extensive experiments on two representative RS benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and superiority of the MultiModNet for multi-modal land cover classification.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Data Interpolation Empirical Orthogonal Functions (DINEOF) method is accurate in filling missing remote sensing datasets. This study used the Data-Interpolating Convolutional Auto-Encoder (DINCAE) method to reconstruct chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) data from the Bohai and Yellow seas and compare it with DINEOF. The reconstruction power of the two methods was evaluated using cross-validation and in situ data, and the accuracy of both data validated by DINCAE was higher than that of DINEOF. The reconstruction results of the two methods were analysed from two perspectives: time and space scale. The reconstruction errors of DINCAE were lower than those of DINEOF at different temporal scales, and the temporal sensitivity of DINEOF was greater than that of DINCAE. DINCAE outperforms DINEOF in terms of controlling the small-scale features and Chl-a values. In terms of efficiency, DINCAE is five times faster than DINEOF for similar reconstruction conditions.

TI  - Constrained Retrievals of Aerosol Optical Properties Using Combined Lidar and Imager Measurements During the FIREX-AQ Campaign
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Smoke aerosols arise from a variety of regional sources and fuel types dependent on the properties of the fire, leading to spatial variability in smoke composition and optical properties. After emission, these aerosols age and mix in the atmosphere with other aerosol species, such as sulfates, altering the optical, and microphysical properties of the smoke aerosols over time. Thus, lidar ratio (extinction to backscatter ratio) derived from lidar sensors exhibit spatiotemporal variability for smoke. Traditional backscatter lidar processing algorithms employ a signal loss method that utilizes the reduction of signals below and above cloud layers, enabling simultaneous retrievals of both layer-averaged lidar ratio and particulate extinction, which avoids the need for assigning lidar ratios based on layer type as is typically used for backscatter lidar algorithms. In this study, the signal loss method, which is traditionally designed for cloud property retrievals, is attempted for elevated smoke plume property retrievals using NASA's Cloud Physics Lidar (CPL) observations from the 2019 Fire Influence on Regional to Global Environments and Air Quality (FIREX-AQ) field campaign. Good agreement (linear correlation coefficient of 0.67) is found between aerosol optical depth (AOD) derived from the signal loss method and the constrained method, utilizing collocated GOES MAGARA AOD values as constraints for lidar ratio retrievals, for the Williams Flats smoke event. Differences in derived lidar ratios from the signal loss method and the constrained method (13.6 and 7.4%) are found to be smaller than the expected signal loss lidar ratio error estimate of & SIM;17-23%. A good agreement is also found in lidar ratios derived from this study and from using Differential Absorption Lidar-High Spectral Resolution Lidar (DIAL-HSRL) measurements for the Williams Flats Fire. The lidar ratio statistics of smoke plumes presented in this analysis (51 & PLUSMN; 13 sr) also compare favorably with lidar ratio values found in previous studies; however, they remain lower than the assumed smoke lidar ratio of 70 sr (at 532 nm) used by CALIPSO and CPL, and vary with plume transport distance. These findings suggest lidar ratio is likely to be regionally specific and evolve with plume transport. Thus, innovative methods for simultaneous retrieval of lidar ratio and aerosol extinction, such as the signal loss method proposed in this study, are needed for accurate aerosol retrievals from standard backscatter lidars in the future.

TI  - Stability-dependent increases in liquid water with droplet number in the Arctic
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The effects of aerosols on cloud microphysical properties are a large source of uncertainty when assessing anthropogenic climate change. The aerosol-cloud relationship is particularly unclear in high-latitude polar regions due to a limited number of observations. Cloud liquid water path (LWP) is an important control on cloud radiative properties, particularly in the Arctic, where clouds play a central role in the surface energy budget. Therefore, understanding how aerosols may alter cloud LWP is important, especially as aerosol sources such as industry and shipping move further north in a warming Arctic.Using satellite data, this work investigates the effects of aerosols on liquid Arctic clouds over open ocean by considering the relationship between cloud droplet number concentration (N-d) and LWP, an important component of the aerosol-LWP relationship. The LWP response to N-d varies significantly across the region, with increases in LWP with N-d observed at very high latitudes in multiple satellite datasets, with this positive signal observed most strongly during the summer months. This result is in contrast to the negative response typically seen in global satellite studies and previous work on Arctic clouds showing little LWP response to aerosols.The lower tropospheric stability (LTS) was found to be an important control on the spatial variations in LWP response, strongly influencing the sign and magnitude of the N-d-LWP relationship, with increases in LWP in high-stability environments. The influence of humidity varied depending on the stability, with little impact at low LTS but a strong influence at high LTS. The mean Nd state does not dominate the LWP response, despite the nonlinearities in the relationship. As the N-d-LWP sensitivity changed from positive to negative when moving from high- to low-LTS environments, this work shows evidence of a temperature-dependent aerosol indirect effect. Additionally, the LWP-LTS relationship changes with Nd, generating an aerosol-dependent cloud feedback. As the LTS is projected to decrease and the boundary layer to become more polluted in a future Arctic, these results show that aerosol increases may produce lower cloud water paths. This shift to more unstable environments implies that LWP adjustments shift from enhancing the Twomey effect by 8 % to offsetting it by around 40 %, with this warming effect having potential consequences for sea ice extent.

T2  - INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Phytoplankton growth in estuaries is regulated by a complex combination of physical factors with freshwater discharge usually playing a dominating role controlling nutrient and light availability. The role of other factors, including upwelling-generating winds, is still unclear because most estuaries are too small for upwelling to emerge. In this study, we used remotely sensed proxies of phytoplankton biomass and concentration of suspended mineral particles to compare the effect of river discharge with the effect of upwelling events associated with persistent along-channel southerly winds in the Chesapeake Bay, a large estuary where upwelling and its effects on biogeochemical dynamics have been previously reported. The surface chlorophyll-a concentrations (Chl-a) were estimated from Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) satellite data using the Generalized Stacked-Constraints Model (GSCM) corrected for seasonal effects by comparing remotely sensed and field-measured data. Light limitation of phytoplankton growth was assessed from the concentration of suspended mineral particles estimated from the remotely sensed backscattering at blue (443 nm) wavelength b(bp)(443). The nine-year time series (2012-2020) of Chl-a and b(bp)(443) confirmed that a primary factor regulating phytoplankton growth in this nearshore eutrophic area is discharge from the Susquehanna River, and presumably the nutrients it delivers, with a time lag up to four months. Persistent southerly wind events (2-3 days with wind speed >4 m/s) affected the water column stratification in the central part of the bay but did not result in significant increases in remotely sensed Chl-a. Analysis of model simulations of selected upwelling-favorable wind events revealed that strong southerly winds resulted in well-defined lateral (East-West) responses but were insufficient to deliver high-nutrient water to the surface layer to support phytoplankton bloom. We conclude that, in the Chesapeake Bay, which is a large, eutrophic estuary, wind-driven upwelling of deep water plays a limited role in driving phytoplankton growth under most conditions compared with river discharge.

TI  - An advanced algorithm for fusing Gaofen multispectral satellite data with drone imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Common image fusion methods used to merge remotely sensed data of varying spatial and spectral information as provided by different air-, and space-borne sensors often do not provide the optimal reachable information. This paper proposes a novel fusion method for pansharpening using a multi-resolution analysis (MRA) based on Chinese Gaofen (GF-1/2) satellite data and corresponding drone data as an example. The novel fusion method is named droesharpening fusion method, which addresses common poor spatial and spectral feature issues of fusion results. The droesharpening fusion method designed several separate computing steps based on wavelets and a pulse-coupled neural network (PCNN) to calculate low-resolution drone (LDRO) images and an injection weight (g ( k )) for significantly improved results. The droesharpening fusion method includes a new algorithm for reducing the MDRO image dimensions (RDA). The proposed new algorithm calculated image feature (IFA), and the proposed algorithm of calculating the gk (IWA). ARD is used to reduce the dimensionalities of a drone (MDRO) image to a new single-band drone (SDRO) image. Then, we applied an improved 'a trous' Wavelet Transform (ATWT) to SDRO images to extract LDRO images and an improved PCNN for the multispectral (MS) images. Additionally, edge processing is deployed to the PCNN segmented images. The IFA is then used to calculate the spatial characteristics of the SDRO images based on the ATWT decomposed image and the spectral features of the MS images based on the PCNN segmented images. In the next step, the IMA calculates the gk based on the spatial and spectral characteristics. The detailed spatial information of the MDRO images is then injected into the MS images by using the gk to obtain the fused drone/multispectral satellite imagery. Additional experimental results using several drone/multispectral satellite images proved that the proposed method achieves high spectral fidelity and simultaneously improves the spatial resolution of fused images.

TI  - Regime shift in sea-ice characteristics and impact on the spring bloom in the Baltic Sea
T2  - OCEANOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - We evaluated the temporal and spatial trends of the hydrological (temperature and sea ice) and biochemical (chlorophyll-a concentration) characteristics in springtime in the Baltic Sea. Both are strongly affected by climate change, resulting in a decrease in the duration of sea-ice melting in the previous decade. A new regime of sea ice began in 2008 and in all basins of the Baltic Sea, a rapid warming during spring could be detected. Using satellite data, the temporal and spatial variations in spring bloom were analysed during severe and warmer winters. Using a coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model, we tested the response of spring bloom to the changing ice conditions. The results of the modelling indicated that the presence of ice significantly influences the predicted chlorophyll-a concentration values in the Baltic Sea. Therefore, it is necessary that any coupled model system has a realistic ice model to ensure the best simulation results for the lower trophic food web as well. ?? 2021 Institute of Oceanology of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

TI  - Diurnal variation of cloud cover over the Baltic Sea
T2  - OCEANOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Instantaneous cloud cover over the Baltic Sea, estimated from satellite information, may differ by as much as several dozen percent between the day and night. This difference may result from both weather conditions and different algorithms used for the day and night. The diurnal differences in cloudiness measured by proprietary and operational systems were analysed as part of research on marine environmental assessment and monitoring. An optimised algorithm for 2017 was presented and supplemented with information from radiation modelling. The study showed that, in general, the average values of daily changes in cloud cover over the sea depend on the season, which generally corresponds to the length of the day and contrasts with the amount of cloudiness. The results were compared with available online data that met the night and day detection criteria, the climate model, and the climate index. The averaged analysis of seasonal changes showed that similar values of the satellite estimates are higher than those obtained from the climate model and the lidar estimation. The satellite estimates from SatBaltic showed the lowest uncertainty. The diurnal cycle was confirmed by all analysed systems. These results may indicate common physical mechanisms and a methodological reason for the uncertainty of satellite-based data. The results clearly showed the existing diurnal difference in the amount of cloud cover over the Baltic Sea and indicated that this difference is not always explained by the physical properties of the atmosphere. The probable causes for these uncertainties were identified and diagnosed. (c) 2021 Institute of Oceanology of the Polish Academy of Sciences. Production and host-ing by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Impacts of Covid-19 interventions on air quality: evidence from Brazilian metropolitan regions
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Covid-19 pandemic has negatively disrupted the way our economy and society functions. Nonetheless, there have also been some positive externalities of the pandemic on the environment. This paper aims to evaluate the concentration of nitrogen dioxide in Brazilian metropolitan regions after the policies adopted to confront Covid-19. In terms of methodological approach, the study employs cross-sectional quantitative analyses to compare the period of 36 days, i.e., 12 March to 16 April-before (in 2019) and after (in 2020) the pandemic declaration. The data were obtained from the Sentinel 5-P low-Earth polar satellite concerning Brazilian metropolitan regions (n = 24). Thorough spatial and statistical analyses were undertaken to identify the pre- and during pandemic nitrogen dioxide concentrations. Complementarily, Spearman's correlation test was performed with variables that impact air quality. The study results a fall in nitrogen dioxide concentration levels in 21 of the 24 metropolitan regions which was observed. The Spearman's correlation coefficient between the nitrogen dioxide variation and the vehicle density was 0.485, at a significance level of 0.05. With these findings in mind, the paper advocates that while the pandemic has a significant negative consequence on the health of population globally, a series of measures that result in a new social organization directly interfere in the reduction of air pollution that contributes to the quality of the air we breathe.

TI  - Diagnostic accuracy of de-escalated surgical procedure in axilla for node-positive breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant systemic therapy: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - CANCER MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Background More initial clinical node-positive breast cancer patients achieve axillary pathological complete response (ax-pCR) after neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST). Restaging axillary status and performing de-escalated surgical procedures to replace routine axillary lymph nodes dissection (ALND) is urgently needed. Targeted axillary lymph node biopsy (TLNB) is a novel de-escalated surgical strategy marking metastatic axillary nodes before NST and targeted dissection and biopsy intraoperatively to tailor individual axillary management. Methods This study provided a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the feasibility and diagnosis accuracy of TLNB. Prospective and retrospective clinical trials on TLNB were searched from Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane. Identification rate (IFR), false-negative rate (FNR), negative predictive value (NPV), and rate of ax-pCR were the outcomes of this meta-analysis. Results One thousand nine hundred and twenty patients attempted TLNB, with an overall IFR of 93.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 90.1%-96.2%). IFR of three nodal marking methods, namely iodine seeds, clips, and carbon dye, was 95.6% (95% CI 91.2%-98.7%), 91.7% (95% CI 87.3%-95.4%), and 97.1% (95% CI 89.1%-100.0%), respectively. Of them, 847 patients received ALND, with an overall FNR of 5.5% (95% CI 3.3%-8.0%), and NPV ranged from 90.1% to 96.1%. Regression analysis showed that the overlap of targeted and sentinel biopsied nodes might associate with IFRs and FNRs. Conclusion TLNB is a novel, less invasive surgical approach to distinguish initial node-positive breast cancer that achieves negative axillary conversion after NST. It yields an excellent IFR with a low FNR and a high NPV. A combination of preoperative imaging, intraoperative TLNB with SLNB, and postoperative nodal radiotherapy might affect the future treatment paradigm of primary breast cancer with nodal metastases.

TI  - Integrated assessment of offshore wind power potential using Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) downscaling with Sentinel-1 satellite imagery, optimal sites, annual energy production and equivalent CO<sub>2</sub> reduction
T2  - RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to assess the offshore wind power potential in Cambodia using the WRF and Sentinel-1 level 2 ocean (L2 OCN) products, to evaluate potential sites and to estimate the annual energy production (AEP) and equivalent CO2 reduction. The model is initially calibrated and validated against observed onshore winds at four weather stations before its main simulation for the two-years study period of 2018-2019. As a result, the spatially averaged annual wind speed errors between the WRF and L2 OCN data are 0.70 m/s for mean bias error and 0.79 m/s for root mean square error, indicating good model performance. The annual mean wind speeds over the Cambodian Sea are 5.15 m/s, 5.20 m/s and 5.27 m/s at 80 m, 100 m and 140 m above sea level, respectively. Then, analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is applied to evaluate the optimal sites for offshore wind power generation. The most potential areas in Cambodian sea are along Kampot and Kep shoreline. The resulting AEPs are 11,949.02 GWh for 80-m V112 turbines, 20,013.34 GWh for 100-m V164 turbines and 31,880.48 GWh for 150-m HX12 turbines, which could reduce CO2 emissions by 5.48 Mt-CO2, 9.18 Mt-CO2 and 14.63 Mt-CO2 per year, respectively. If 10% of the total AEP could be generated by 2030, the offshore wind source would contribute to 1.95%, 3.27%, or 5.20% of the country's electric demands forecasted for 2030. The integrated assessment methodology and resources adopted in this study can be applicable to other regions particularly where offshore measurements are not readily available.

TI  - Forecasting water quality using seasonal ARIMA model by integrating <i>in-situ</i> measurements and remote sensing techniques in Krishnagiri reservoir, India
T2  - WATER PRACTICE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Krishnagiri reservoir is the main source of irrigation in Tamil Nadu, India. It has been reported to be hypereutrophic for over a decade with sediment and nutrient load sources responsible for the degradation of water quality. Remotely sensed satellite imagery analysis plays a significant role in assessing the water quality for developing a management strategy for reservoirs. The present study is an attempt to demonstrate the improvement in the chlorophyll-a (chl-a) estimation in the Krishnagiri reservoir by integrating remote sensing and in-situ measurements. Multiple regression equations were developed with the reflectance of Green, Red, NIR and SWIR1 bands of the Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensor of Landsat 8 satellite yielded the coefficient of determination for chlorophyll-a (chl-a) as 0.812, Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) as 0.945 and Electrical Conductivity (EC) as 0.960 respectively. The developed regression model was further utilised to forecast chl-a and EC of the reservoir through the Seasonal Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model. It is found that chl-a prediction showed that the reservoir continued to be hypereutrophic and EC significantly changed from a class C3 (high salinity) to class C4 (very high salinity). These results are alarming and an immediate reduction of the external load from the catchment through effective watershed management programs should be implemented.

TI  - Adaptive weighted learning for vegetation contribution in soil moisture inversion using PolSAR data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The high-resolution soil moisture inversion under vegetation from remote-sensing data is a challenging task. The key issue is to separate or eliminate the influence of vegetation. Therefore, the difficult problem is to select appropriate vegetation descriptors and accurately deal with them. With the great success of convolutional neural network (CNN) in PolSAR image classification, this paper intends to use CNN and introduce an adaptive weighted learning mechanism to calculate the new vegetation descriptors and eliminate the influence of vegetation on soil moisture inversion under vegetation by modifying the network structure. First, we propose an adaptive weighted learning module that can learn the adaptive weights of vegetation contribution which are the volume scattering components and the double-bounce scattering components in the Freeman-Durden decomposition to obtain new vegetation parameters. Second, we transform the inversion problem into a classification-regression problem, and use CNN to design two corresponding models to complete the inversion of soil moisture. In the proposed strategy, the adaptive weighted learning can effectively extract salient features from different components and combine them to obtain new vegetation descriptors and, the CNN can effectively utilize the spatial distribution of PolSAR data to automatically extract features that are useful for soil moisture inversion. The experimental results show that both classification network and retrospective network can achieve high inversion accuracy, whose inversion accuracy reaches up 96.66%, and root mean square error and the determination coefficient are 2.32% and 0.93, respectively. It suggests the great potential of combining the deep learning technique with traditional inversion model for soil moisture inversion from PolSAR data.

TI  - Community structure and insecticide resistance of malaria vectors in northern-central Myanmar
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Myanmar is one of the six countries in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) of Southeast Asia. Malaria vectors comprise many Anopheles species, which vary in abundance and importance in malaria transmission among different geographical locations in the GMS. Information about the species composition, abundance, and insecticide resistance status of vectorial systems in Myanmar is scarce, hindering our efforts to effectively control malaria vectors in this region.Methods: During October and November 2019, larvae and adult females of Anopheles mosquitoes were collected in three sentinel villages of Banmauk township in northern Myanmar. Adult female mosquitoes collected by cow-baited tent collection (CBTC) and adults reared from field-collected larvae (RFCL) were used to determine mortality rates and knockdown resistance (kdr) against deltamethrin using the standard WHO susceptibility test. Molecular species identification was performed by multiplex PCR and ITS2 PCR, followed by DNA sequencing. The kdr mutation at position 1014 of the voltage-gated sodium channel gene was genotyped by DNA sequencing for all Anopheles species tested.Results: A total of 1596 Anopheles mosquitoes from seven morphologically identified species groups were bioassayed. Confirmed resistance to deltamethrin was detected in the populations of An. barbirostris (s.l.), An. hyrcanus (s.l.), and An. vagus, while possible resistance was detected in An. annularis (s.l.), An. minimus, and An. tessellatus. Anopheles kochi was found susceptible to deltamethrin. Compared to adults collected by CBTC, female adults from RFCL had significantly lower mortality rates in the four species complexes. A total of 1638 individuals from 22 Anopheles species were molecularly identified, with the four most common species being An. dissidens (20.5%) of the Barbirostris group, An. peditaeniatus (19.4%) of the Hyrcanus group, An. aconitus (13.4%) of the Funestus group, and An. nivipes (11.5%) of the Annularis group. The kdr mutation L1014F was only detected in the homozygous state in two An. subpictus (s.l.) specimens and in a heterozygous state in one An. culicifacies (s.l.) specimen.Conclusions: This study provides updated information about malaria vector species composition and insecticide resistance status in northern Myanmar. The confirmed deltamethrin resistance in multiple species groups constitutes a significant threat to malaria vector control. The lack or low frequency of target-site resistance mutations suggests that other mechanisms are involved in resistance. Continual monitoring of the insecticide resistance of malaria vectors is required for effective vector control and insecticide resistance management.

TI  - ASSESSMENT OF THE IMPACTS OF URBAN EXPANSION ON AGRICULTURAL LAND-USE INTENSITY IN ETHIOPIA, THE CASE OF ADDIS ABABA
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Unplanned urban expansion is one of the challenging problems faced by developing countries, such as Ethiopia. Therefore, this study was conducted to assess the impact of urbanization on the land-use intensity in Addis Ababa by taking advantage of modern techniques, such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Remote Sensing (RS). The research used multi-spatiotemporal Landsat OLI images of 2010, 2015, and 2020 with a 30 m resolution. Maximum likelihood-based supervised classification was employed to extract the study area's leading land use/land cover (LULC) classes. Six land cover classes were identified: built-up land, water bodies, woodland, grassland, arable land, and unused lands. Results revealed that 11.87% of the arable land was converted into built-up land over the study period (2010-2020). Interestingly, urbanization showed adverse trends, occupying 30.63%, 39.03%, and 46.62% of the entire study area in 2010, 2015, and 2020, respectively. Of all the classes, arable land was the most affected category, as 78.65% (86.282 km(2)) of the land encroached upon by urbanization belonged to arable land. Therefore, the aggressive and rapid encroachment of built-up land was a significant factor in the severe degradation of agricultural land, significantly impacting agricultural land-use intensity.

TI  - Value of routine cytokeratin immunohistochemistry in detecting low volume disease in cervical cancer
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. In cervical cancer, sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) are processed according to the pathological ultrastaging protocol. According to current guidelines, immunohistochemistry with pancytokeratin antibodies is performed in addition to step sectioning with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), aiding the detection of low volume disease (micrometastasis and isolated tumor cells (ITC)). We studied the added clinical value, and costs, of routine immunohistochemistry (IHC).Methods. We retrospectively included all FIGO stage IA-IIA1 cervical cancer patients who had undergone SLN procedures at UMC Utrecht from 2008 to 2020. Pathological data were derived from the Dutch Pathology Registry (PALGA) including SLN tumor status and number of slides stained with IHC.Results. In total 234 cervical cancer patients were included. In the 516 surgically resected SLN specimens, 630 SLNs were discovered by the pathologist. Hereof, 579 SLNs from 211 patients were routinely processed with IHC. IHC identified three patients with micrometastasis and five patients with ITC undetected with H&E staining. Thereby, IHC significantly increased the number of patients with low volume disease from 11 (5.3%) to 19 patients (9.1%) (p = 0.04). To achieve this, 3791 slides were stained with IHC at an estimated additional cost of (SIC)94,775. In 1.4% (95% CI 0.3%-4.3%) of patients routine use of IHC adjusted the adjuvant treatment.Conclusions. Routine use of IHC increases detection of low volume disease in cervical cancer SLNs compared to step sectioning with H&E alone by nearly 4%, with an impact on therapeutic strategy-decisions in about 1% of pa-tients. In view of the high associated costs, cost-effectiveness of routine IHC is questionable. (C) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Increased burned area in the Pantanal over the past two decades
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires are behaving differently now compared to other time in history in relation to frequency, intensity and affected ecosystems. In Brazil, unprecedented fires are being experienced in the last decade. Thus, to prevent and minimize similar disasters, we must better understand the natural and human drivers of such extreme events. The Brazilian Pantanal is the largest contiguous wetland in the world and a complex environmental system. In 2020, Pantanal experienced catastrophic wildfires due to the synergy between climate, inadequate fire management strategies and weak environmental regulations. In this study, we analyzed recent patterns and changes in fire behavior across the Pantanal based on land use and cover (LULC) classes. The inter-annual variability of the fire and land cover changes between 2000 and 2021 was assessed using BA from MCD64A1 V.6 product and LULC data from Landsat satellite. Our work reveals that fires in the Pantanal over the last two decades tended to occur more frequently in grassland than in others land cover types, but the 2020 fires have preferentially burned forest regions. Large fire patches are more frequent in forest and grasslands; in contrast, croplands exhibit small patches. The results highlight that a broad scale analysis does not reflect distinct localized patterns, thus stratified and refined studies are required. Our work contributes as a first step to disentangling the role of anthropogenic-related drivers, namely LULC changes, in shaping the fire regime in the Pantanal biome. This is crucial not only to predict future fire activity but also to guide appropriated fire management in the region.

TI  - Extraction of individual trees based on Canopy Height Model to monitor the state of the forest
T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
M3  - Article
AB  - Active remotely sensed data can be used to perform a variety of forestry tasks including stand characterization, inventory, and management of forest and fire behavior modeling. The present work investigates the potential of Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) derived methods applied in the deciduous forest by processing an individual tree detection (ITD) based on canopy Height model (CHM) and tree segmentation of larger-area point clouds. Different algorithms are tested and their performances are evaluated to show which of them can provide the most adequate number of trees compared with the ground truth. Tree scale information is used in order to determine stand age. The forest height, structure, and density are specified by applying individual tree Detection (ITD) to calculate some forest attributes such as stem volume, forest uniformity, and biomass estimation. The major aim of this post is to examine the state of the forest to monitor it in real-time. We assume that utilizing the LM algorithm, which was originally built for ITD from LiDAR data, trees should be automatically distinguished from the ALS-derived CHM with reasonable accuracy. As a result, the present research work studies the fixed treetop window size (FWS), fixed smoothing window size (SWS), and variable window (VW) effect on ITD performance (RMSE=3.4% and R=0.88). It is obvious, from the obtained results that smaller window sizes result in more trees. In fact, the smallest trees obscured by the largest trees containing the highest points in the neighborhood are often ignored by large windows. Crown delineation is also explored to extract the height of the trees, radius crown and, 3D coordinates and to compare them to those detected by a Low Bluetooth sensor "iBeacon. ".

TI  - Development and Application of Landsat-Based Wetland Vegetation Cover and UnVegetated-Vegetated Marsh Ratio (UVVR) for the Conterminous United States
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Effective management and restoration of salt marshes and other vegetated intertidal habitats require objective and spatially integrated metrics of geomorphic status and vulnerability. The unvegetated-vegetated marsh ratio (UVVR), a recently developed metric, can be used to establish present-day vegetative cover, identify stability thresholds, and quantify vulnerability to open-water conversion over a range of spatial scales. We developed a Landsat-based approach to quantify the within-pixel vegetated fraction and UVVR for coastal wetlands of the conterminous United States, at 30-m resolution for 2014-2018. Here we present the methodology used to generate the UVVR from spectral indices, along with calibration, validation, and spatial autocorrelation assessments. We then demonstrate multiple applications of the data across varying spatial scales: first, we aggregate the UVVR across individual states and estuaries to quantify total vegetated wetland area for the nation. On the state level, Louisiana and Florida account for over 50% of the nation's total, while on the estuarine level, the Chesapeake Bay Estuary and selected Louisiana coastal areas each account for over 6% of the nation's total vegetated wetland area. Second, we present cases where this dataset can be used to track wetland change (e.g., expansion due to restoration and loss due to stressors). Lastly, we propose a classification methodology that delineates areas vulnerable to open-water expansion based on the 5-year mean and standard deviation of the UVVR. Calculating the UVVR for the period-of-record back to 1985, as well as regular updating, will fill a critical gap for tracking national status of salt marshes and other vegetated habitats through time and space.

TI  - Eutrophication state in the Eastern China based on Landsat 35-year observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Eutrophication of the eastern plain lake (EPL) region has a significant impact on the sustainable economic development and is closely related to the shortage of water resources in China. Remote sensing provides an effective tool for quantifying the trophic state of inland waters by associating the trophic state index (TSI) with optically active water quality parameters. However, limited by the satellite coverage range and operation time, the long-term changes in the trophic state of the EPL region have not been thoroughly investigated. This study aims to fill this gap by generating a 35-year (1986-2020) TSI dataset of lakes in the eastern plain based on Landsat images. The TSI inversion algorithm based on the algal biomass index (ABI) was designed for Landsat series after consistency analysis. The seasonal variations of the TSI showed the highest TSI (62.0 +/- 11.4) in summer and the lowest TSI (51.6 +/- 8.0) in winter, with uncertainties caused by the limitation of ABI for extremely turbid waters and the number of Landsat seasonal images. The TSI of the EPLs increased over the past 35 years by about 8.2%. Four change patterns were defined for the long-term interannual TSI variations: increasing trend less than 50% (Mode 1) or more than 50% (Mode 2), breaking points that show a surge trend (Mode 3), and decreasing trend (Mode 4). The contribution of meteorological and anthropogenic factors was calculated using a generalized linear model, which revealed that the eutrophication of inland lakes in the EPL region is mainly affected by industrial wastewater discharge and urban expansion. The influence of these explanatory variables becomes more complex with an increase in lake area. Our research provides an estimation of the TSI for the first 35-year basin-scale in the EPL region and a comprehensive evaluation of the driving factors of inland water eutrophication. The results can be used for the effective management and restoration of lakes.

TI  - A High-Resolution Remote-Sensing-Based Method for Urban Ecological Quality Evaluation
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban ecological quality evaluation attracts more and more attention in urban land use and ecosystem planning optimization due to continuity problems from rapid urbanization and population growth. Remote sensing was always considering contribute to the evaluation. However, accurate and efficient evaluation of urban ecological quality is being challenged, as traditional remote-sensing-based methods were mainly based on low spatial resolution data, pixel-based land cover classification, and vegetation condition factors, and ignored object-oriented high spatial resolution classification and urban landscape pattern. Thus, method for urban ecological quality evaluation based on high-resolution remote sensing is greatly needed to support spatially explicit decision-making in urban planning. In this study, a novel high-resolution remote-sensing-based method based on six ecological indicators from vegetation conditions and landscape patterns was proposed to evaluate urban ecological quality. The six ecological indicators were derived from high-resolution remote sensing data using an object-oriented land cover classification. Factor analysis indicated that the sensitivity of landscape patterns to ecological quality is relatively weaken. Therefore, vegetation conditions and landscape patterns were used as two respective variables to generate a linear evaluation model, with their weights calculated from the loadings of factor analysis, to evaluation urban ecological quality. The results showed that the proposed linear model, considering both vegetation conditions and landscape patterns, is effective and trustworthy, and can provide more suitable support to urban land use and ecological planning.

TI  - Oil spills in the Barents Sea: The results of multiyear monitoring with synthetic aperture radar
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the results of multiyear satellite monitoring of oil pollution in the Barents Sea conducted in 2015-2020. Monitoring was based on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images from the European Space Agency's Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B satellites. During monitoring, more than 26,000 SAR images were collected and analyzed for oil pollution in the form of oil spills. A geographic information system (GIS) and a conventional interactive technique were used to efficiently analyze a substantial number of SAR images covering the Barents Sea. Our approach employed online geoportal based on GIS technology with a large volume of additional information (oceanographic, physical-geographical, and industrial) about the marine basin, including those for offshore oil and gas infrastructure. As a result, multiyear oil spill distribution map was generated and analyzed, and the most oil-polluted regions of the sea and natural seeps were identified. The analysis focused on the general characteristics of the spatial and temporal distribution and the main sources of oil pollution of the Barents Sea. Sources of oil spills with areas ranging from 0.5 to 90 km(2) were interpreted based on data from the automatic ship identification systems used to monitor shipping and fishing. Based on the monitoring results, the general level of oil pollution in the Barents Sea is established, statistics were calculated, and risk zones identified. The most polluted marine areas are in the southern part of the sea, where maritime shipping continuous; moderate levels of pollution appear in the fishing zones in the central part of the sea. Finally, the study results show that overall oil pollution in the Barents Sea is still relatively low compared to other marginal and inland seas of Europe.

TI  - Alongshore upwelling modulates the intensity of marine heatwaves in a temperate coastal sea
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Analyses of long-term temperature records based on satellite data have revealed an increase in the frequency and intensity of marine heatwaves (MHWs) in the world oceans, a trend directly associated with global change according to climate model simulations. However, these analyses often target open ocean pelagic systems and rarely include local scale, field temperature records that are more adequate to assess the impact of MHWs close to the land-sea interface. Here, we compared the incidence and characteristics of open ocean MHWs detected by satellites with those observed in the field over two decades (1998-2019) at two temperate intertidal locations in the central Cantabrian Sea, southern Bay of Biscay. Satellite retrievals tended to smooth out cooling events associated with intermittent, alongshore upwelling, especially during summer. These biases propagated to the characterization of MHWs and resulted in an overestimation of their incidence and duration close to the coast. To reconcile satellite and field records, we developed a downscaling approach based on regression modeling that enabled the reconstruction of past temperatures and analyze MHW trends. Despite the cooling effect due to upwelling, the temperature reconstructions revealed a six-fold increase in the incidence of MHWs in the Cantabrian Sea over the last four decades. A comparison between static (no trend) vs. dynamic (featuring a linear warming trend) MHW detection thresholds allowed us to attribute over half of the increase in MHW incidence to the ocean warming trend. Our results highlight the importance of local processes to fully characterize the complexity and impacts of MHWs on marine coastal ecosystems and call for the conservation of climate refugia associated with coastal upwelling to counter the impacts of climate warming.

TI  - Oncologic Outcomes of Multi-Institutional Minimally Invasive Inguinal Lymph Node Dissection for Melanoma Compared with Open Inguinal Dissection in the Second Multicenter Selective Lymphadenectomy Trial (MSLT-II)
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Minimally invasive inguinal lymphadenectomy (MILND) is safe and feasible, but limited data exist regarding oncologic outcomes. Methods This study performed a multi-institutional retrospective cohort analysis of consecutive MILND performed for melanoma between January 2009 and June 2016. The open ILND (OILND) comparative cohort comprised patients enrolled in the second Multicenter Selective Lymphadenectomy Trial (MSLT-II) between December 2004 and March 2014.The pre-defined primary end point was the same-basin regional nodal recurrence, calculated using properties of binomial distribution. Time to events was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The secondary end points were overall survival, progression-free survival, melanoma-specific survival (MSS), and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS). Results For all the patients undergoing MILND, the same-basin regional recurrence rate was 4.4 % (10/228; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 2.1-7.9 %): 8.2 % (4/49) for clinical nodal disease and 3.4 % (6/179) for patients with a positive sentinel lymph node (SLN) as the indication. For the 288 patients enrolled in MSLT-II who underwent OILND for a positive SLN, 17 (5.9 %) had regional node recurrence as their first event. After controlling for ulceration, positive LN count and positive non-SLNs at the time of lymphadenectomy, no difference in OS, PFS, MSS or DMFS was observed for patients with a positive SLN who underwent MILND versus OILND. Conclusion This large multi-institutional experience supports the oncologic safety of MILND for melanoma. The outcomes in this large multi-institutional experience of MILND compared favorably with those for an OILND population during similar periods, supporting the oncologic safety of MILND for melanoma.

AB  - ECOCLIMAP-Second Generation (ECO-SG) is the land-cover map used in the HARMONIE-AROME configuration of the shared ALADIN-HIRLAM Numerical Weather Prediction system used for shortrange operational weather forecasting for Ireland. The ECO-SG urban classification implicitly includes building heights. The work presented in this paper involved the production of the first open-access building height map for the island of Ireland which complements the Ulmas-Walsh land cover map, a map which has improved the horizontal extent of urban areas over Ireland. The resulting building height map will potentially enable upgrades to ECO-SG urban information for future implementation in HARMONIE-AROME.This study not only produced the first open-access building height map of Ireland at 10 m x 10 m resolution, but assessed various types of regression models trained using pre-existing building height information for Dublin City and selected 64 important spatio-temporal features, engineered from both the Sentinel-1A/B and Sentinel-2A/B satellites. The performance metrics revealed that a Convolutional Neural Network is superior in all aspects except the computational time required to create the map. Despite the superior accuracy of the Convolutional Neural Network, the final building height map created results from the ridge regression model which provided the best blend of realistic output and low computational complexity.The method relies solely on freely available satellite imagery, is cost-effective, can be updated regularly, and can be applied to other regions depending on the availability of representative regional building height sample data.

TI  - Physical and Biological Factors Underlying Long-Term Decline of Dissolved Oxygen Concentrationin the East/Japan Sea
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - A substantial decrease in the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration over the lower layers of the East/Japan Sea (EJS), including the deep and bottom waters (1500 to 2500 m and 2500 to 3500 m, respectively), has been reported during the last few decades. This study quantitatively explain the mechanisms underlying the long-term decline in the DO concentration of the EJS for the first time using a coupled physical-biogeochemical model. We demonstrated that the cessation of new water formation was a major factor underlying the long-term decline in the DO concentration over the lower layers, and its contribution exceeded the net decrease. In addition, our simulations confirmed that the enhanced primary production in the euphotic zone accompanying increases in organic matter exported to the lower layers accelerates the DO decline in a quantitative respect. It was accounted for 12% of the net DO change at the lower layers from 1980 to 2015. The enhanced primary production resulted from increases in available nutrients due to the intensified vertical mixing caused by the strengthened inflow transport through the Korea/Tsushima Strait. Physical activities such as vertical transport of oxygen from the central water increased the DO concentration of the lower layers, and offset 42% of the net decrease in DO concentration due to organic matter decomposition.

TI  - Green Space Cooling Effect and Contribution to Mitigate Heat Island Effect of Surrounding Communities in Beijing Metropolitan Area
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid process of urbanization and global warming, many metropolises are vulnerable to high temperatures in summer, threatening the health of residents. However, green spaces can generate a cooling effect to mitigate the urban heat island effect in big cities. They can also help to improve the living quality and wellbeing of surrounding residents. In this paper, we utilized the radiative transfer equation algorithm, k-means clustering algorithm, big data crawling, and spatial analysis to quantify and map the spatial distribution, cooling capacity, and cooling contribution for surrounding communities of 1,157 green spaces within Beijing Fifth Ring Road, a typical metropolitan area. The findings showed that (1) the area proportion of the heat island in the study area is larger than that of the cooling island. Accounting for only about 30% area in the study area, the green spaces reduce the average land surface temperature by 1.32 degrees C. (2) The spatial features of green space, such as area and shape complexity, have a significant influence on its cooling effect. (3) Four clusters of green spaces with specific spatial features and cooling capacity were identified. And there were differences among these clusters in green space cooling contribution for the surrounding communities. (4) The differences in green space cooling contribution also existed in different urban zones. Specifically, the middle zone performed significantly better than the inner and outer zones. (5) We furthered in finding that some green spaces with medium and high cooling contributions need to improve their cooling capacity soon, and some green spaces with low cooling contributions or no contributions have a good potential for constructing new communities in the future. Our study could help planners and government understand the current cooling condition of green spaces, to improve their cooling capacity, mitigate the urban heat island effect, and create a comfortable and healthy thermal environment in summer.

T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examined the temporal and spatial changes in the urban land cover of the northern region of Jordan from 2000 to 2020. Automated processing of satellite images was carried out and different statistical indicators were applied to analyze the data. The data facilitated the monitoring of urban sprawl and determination of trends based on the Geographic Information System (GIS) and remote sensing analysis of Landsat satellite images. The results revealed an increase in urban segments, population, and reverse migration compared to neighboring areas. The classified land use and land cover maps depicted an expansion of 19.22% from 2000 to 2010 and 8.04% from 2010 to 2020. In comparison to the areas at the urban saturation stage, more rapid urban growth was observed in the seven southwest and northwest districts. Thus, the study presents reliable information and a cartographic database to demonstrate the changes in urban cover of Irbid city, over the past 20 years.

TI  - Characterizing isolated tumor cells in regional lymph nodes of early endometrial cancer
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. To examine the characteristics of isolated tumor cells (ITCs) in regional lymph nodes of early-stage endometrial cancer.Methods. This is a retrospective cohort study examining the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Result Program. The study population was 6472 women with non-metastatic, node-negative T1 endometrial cancer who underwent primary hysterectomy and surgical nodal evaluation. Multivariable binary logistic regression model was used to identify the independent characteristics for ITCs. Postoperative therapy according to ITCs status was also assessed with propensity score weighting.Results. ITCs were seen in 111 (1.7%) cases. In a multivariable analysis, ITCs were largely associated with tumor factors including deep myometrial invasion (T1b versus T1a, 4.0% versus 1.0%, adjusted-odds ratio [aOR] 3.42, P 0.001) and larger tumor size (>4 versus <= 4 cm, 3.0% versus 1.6%, aOR 1.55, P = 0.037). Moreover, women undergoing sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy had a higher likelihood of identifying ITCs compared to those undergoing lymphadenectomy (LND): 2.7% for SLN alone, 3.7% for SLN/LND, and 1.2% for LND alone (aOR ranged 2.60-2.99, P < 0.001). Women who had ITCs identified were more likely to receive postoperative therapy (81.8% versus 31.7%, P < 0.001), including external beam radiotherapy (EBT) alone (25.1% versus 3.2%) and chemotherapy/EBT (16.3% versus 1.9%). Similar associations were observed in the low-risk group (stage IA, grade 1-2 endometrioid, 78.4% versus 9.2%, P < 0.001), including EBT alone (35.3% versus 0.6%).Conclusion. This study suggests that a SLN protocol can identify more ITCs in the regional lymph nodes of early endometrial cancer. Deep myometrial invasion and large tumor size were associated with increased risk of ITCs. Postoperative therapy is offered more frequently in the setting of ITCs with variable treatment patterns, warranting further outcome studies and practice guidelines. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Uptake in sentinel lymph node biopsy for endometrial cancer with T3 classification
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. The current clinical practice guidelines for endometrial cancer specify sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy to be performed in apparent uterine-confined disease. However, a recent population-based analysis found that the utilization of SLN biopsy is increasing in extra-uterine disease such as T2 classification. The objective of this studywas to examine trends and outcomes related to SLN biopsy for endometrial cancer with T3 classification, another extra-uterine disease.Methods. A population-based retrospective cohort studywas conducted to examine 7004womenwith T3 endometrial cancerwho underwent primary surgery between 2010 and 2018, identified in the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program. Trends and characteristics related to SLN biopsy were assessed by multinomial regression analysis, and inverse probability of treatment weighting propensity score was used to assess overall survival related to SLN biopsy.Results. Nodal evaluation type included lymphadenectomy (n = 5276, 75.3%), SLN biopsy (n = 287, 4.1%), and none (n = 1441, 20.6%). The utilization of SLN biopsy increased from 0.4% to 12.9% between 2010 and 2018 (P< 0.001) that this association remained independent inmultivariable analysis (adjusted-odds ratio compared to 2010-2012, 2.63 [95% confidence interval 1.57-4.42] for 2013-2015 and 10.1 [95% confidence interval 6.30-16.2] for 2016-2018). When compared to the lymphadenectomy group, the SLN biopsy group was less likely to have T3b disease (adjusted-odds ratio 0.69, 95% confidence interval 0.51-0.94) but had similar postoperative chemotherapy and radiotherapy (both, P > 0.05). In a weighted model, the 3-year overall survival rate was 66.3% for the SLN biopsy group and 64.7% for the lymphadenectomy group (hazard ratio 0.85, 95% confidence interval 0.69-1.05). Similar association was observed in subcohorts for young, old, endometrioid, nonendometrioid, T3a, T3b, and N0 cases.Conclusion. Utilization of SLN biopsy in T3 endometrial cancer is increasing in the United States. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Augmenting Heritage Ocean-Color Aerosol Models for Enhanced Remote Sensing of Inland and Nearshore Coastal Waters
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing of near-surface water composition in terrestrial and coastal regions is challenging largely due to uncertainties linked to a lack of representative continental aerosols in the atmospheric correction (AC) framework. A comprehensive family of absorbing aerosols is proposed by analyzing global AERONET measurements using the Partition Around Medoids (PAM) classifier. The input to the classifier is composed of Version 3, Level 2.0 daily average aerosol properties [i.e., single scattering albedo at & lambda; = 0.44 & mu;m, (SSA(0.44)) and the Angstrom exponents for extinction and absorption AEe(0.44-0.87) and AEa(0.44-0.87), respectively from observations from June 1993 to September 2019. The PAM classification based on low daily aerosol optical depth (AOD(0.44) & LE; 0.4) suggested 27 distinct aerosol clusters encompassing five major absorbing aerosol types (Dust (DU), Marine (MAR), Mixed (MIX), Urban/Industrial (U/I), and Biomass Burning (BB)). Seasonal patterns of dominant PAM-derived clusters at three AERONET sites (GSFC, Kanpur, and Banizoumbou) strongly influenced by U/I, DU, and BB types, respectively, showed a satisfactory agreement with variations of aerosol mixtures reported in the literature. These PAM-derived models augment the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's) aerosol models (A2010) applied in its operational AC. To demonstrate the validity and complementary nature of our models, a coupled ocean-atmosphere radiative transfer code is employed to create a simulated dataset for developing two experimental machine-learning AC processors. These two processors differ only in their aerosol models used in training: 1) a processor trained with the A2010 aerosol models (ACI) and 2) a processor trained with both PAM and A2010 aerosol models (ACII). These processors are applied to Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) matchups (N = 173) from selected AERONET sites equipped with ocean color radiometers (AERONET-OC). Our assessments showed improvements of up to 30% in retrieving remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) in the blue bands. In general, our empirically derived PAM aerosol models complement A2010 models (designed for regions strongly influenced by marine conditions) over continental and coastal waters where absorbing aerosols are present (e.g., urban environments, areas impacted by dust, or wildfire events). With the expected geographic expansion of in situ aquatic validation networks (e.g., AERONET-OC), the advantages of our models will be accentuated, particularly in the ultraviolet and short blue bands.

TI  - Synergic effects of land-use management systems towards the reclamation of Aeolian Desertified Land in the Shiyang River Basin
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Achieving zero land degradation neutrality in Aeolian Desertified Land (ADL) is a challenging task that requires continuous scientific understanding and technical efforts to effectively manage natural resources for economic development while meeting environmental needs. This study used Landsat collection and annual average climate data from the growing season to investigate the efficacy of established land management policies to restore degraded land and reverse the aeolian desertification process in the Shiyang river basin between 1974 and 2020. The time-series Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) results revealed that greening and browning trend patterns depend on climatic conditions in rangelands and water allocation management systems in farmlands. Thanks to land rehabilitation and watershed management projects, farmland has been extended to 3.1%, shifting sand area has been reduced to 9.2%, and water in Qingtu lake area re-emergedfrom 0 to 17.05 Km(2) in the early 2010 s. Built-up areas also extended to 87.05 km2 between 2010 and 2020 due to extensive construction of solar power panels in the area. The severity of desertification is profoundly linked to climate and land-use management systems in the Shiyang river basin. Moreover, the ADL area declined from 14.65% to 10.74% of the entire river basin, where intensity has steadily reversed in several basin parts, mainly in the middle reach. Around 2248 km(2) of land were entirely rehabilitated, 2298 km(2) remained steady, 1706 km(2) exhibited a reverse in desertification intensity, 199 km2 degraded, and 277 km2 of land were newly turned into ADL between 1974 and 2020, with a large portion of degraded land occurred in the lower reach of the Basin. These findings highlight land management contribution, rational water allocation, and conservation measures to reverse desertification and maintain a sustainable ecosystem despite climate change impacts and water resources shortage in the Shiyang river basin. This research will help decision-makers set up novel land management programs for better eco-environment development in the future.

TI  - Flooding and emergency department visits: Effect modification by the CDC/ATSDR Social Vulnerability Index
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)/Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) is a census-based metric that includes 15 socioeconomic and demographic factors split into four themes relevant to disaster planning, response, and recovery. Using CDC/ATSDR SVI, health outcomes, and remote sensing data, we sought to understand the differences in the occurrence of overall and cause-specific emergency department (ED) visits before and after a 2017 flood event in Texas following Hurricane Harvey, modified by different levels of social vulnerability. We used a controlled before-after study design to estimate the association between flooding and overall and cause-specific ED visits after adjusting for the baseline period, seasonal trends, and individual-level characteristics. We estimated rate ratios stratified by CDC/ATSDR SVI quartiles (overall and 4 themes separately) and tested for the presence of effect modification. Positive effect modification was found such that total ED visits from flooded census tracts with moderate, high, and very high levels of social vulnerability were less reduced compared to tracts with the least vulnerability during flooding and the month following the flood event. The CDC/ATSDR SVI socioeconomic status theme, household composition and disability theme, and housing and transportation type theme explained this result. We found predominantly negative effect modification with higher ED visits among tracts with the least vulnerability for ED visits related to insect bites, dehydration, and intestinal infectious diseases.

TI  - Greenwashing in the US metal industry? A novel approach combining SO<sub>2</sub> concentrations from satellite data, a plant-level firm database and web text mining
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study deals with the issue of greenwashing, i.e. the false portrayal of companies as environmentally friendly. The analysis focuses on the US metal industry, which is a major emission source of sulfur dioxide (SO2), one of the most harmful air pollutants. One way to monitor the distribution of atmospheric SO2 concentrations is through satellite data from the Sentinel-5P programme, which represents a major advance due to its unprecedented spatial resolution. In this paper, Sentinel-5P remote sensing data was combined with a plant-level firm database to investigate the relationship between the US metal industry and SO2 concentrations using a spatial regression analysis. Additionally, this study considered web text data, classifying companies based on their websites in order to depict their self portrayal on the topic of sustainability. In doing so, we investigated the topic of greenwashing, i.e. whether or not a positive self-portrayal regarding sustainability is related to lower local SO2 concentrations. Our results indicated a general, positive correlation between the number of employees in the metal industry and local SO2 concentrations. The web-based analysis showed that only 8% of companies in the metal industry could be classified as engaged in sustain ability based on their websites. The regression analyses indicated that these self-reported "sustainable " companies had a weaker effect on local SO2 concentrations compared to their "non-sustainable " counterparts, which we interpreted as an indication of the absence of general greenwashing in the US metal industry. However, the large share of firms without a website and lack of specificity of the text classification model were limitations to our methodology.

TI  - To shift a paradigm or not: worldviews at play in responsible management education literature
T2  - JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose This study analyzes which worldviews on the interrelatedness of the economic, environmental and social systems are adopted in the literature on responsible management education (RME) and explores how this affects the way business schools educate future responsible managers. Design/methodology/approach The sustainability-focused relational worldviews of Kurucz et al. (2014) were used to perform a content analysis on 100 articles from the field of RME to understand which worldviews are adopted and to distill potential implications of the prevalence of such worldviews in the RME field. Findings In the sample, the most adopted view was the intertwined view that imagines a balance between the economic, environmental, and social system (61% of the articles). The subsuming worldview (highlighting the business case for sustainability) accounted for 8% of articles in the sample. The embedded worldview (a new paradigm that respects the limitations of the environmental and social systems) accounted for 31% of the articles in the sample. The disparate view (representing classic economic views of discrete systems) was not adopted, indicating a rather uniform belief that RME is about moving management education away from this view. Examining the evolution of views over the last 20 years, it can be observed that the embedded view is growing in popularity. The continuing prevalence of the ambiguous and malleable intertwined view in the RME literature could explain why so many RME initiatives have been taken in the last two decades, while simultaneously critics remain vocal that business schools are not preparing future managers to engage with ethics, responsibility, and sustainability (ERS). Originality/value While sustainability-focused relational worldviews have been introduced in the RME literature, this study provides empirical evidence of the prevalence of such worldviews in the literature, allowing an exploration of the implications for the field. The presence of multiple - and at times competing - worldviews adds tension to the field of RME. Seen on the trajectory of increasingly progressive worldviews, the intertwined view is not limited by economic rationalism (like the subsuming view) but also stops short of requiring a full paradigm shift (like the embedded view).

TI  - A walk on the wild side: Wild ungulates as potential reservoirs of multi-drug resistant bacteria and genes, including Escherichia coli harbouring CTX-M beta-lactamases
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL)-producing Enterobacterales have been classified as critical priority pathogens by the World Health Organization (WHO). ESBL are universally distributed and, in 2006, were firstly reported on a wild animal. Understanding the relative contributions of wild animals to ESBL circulation in the environment is urgently needed. In this work, we have conducted a nationwide study in Portugal to investigate the occurrence of bacteria carrying clinically significant antimicrobial resistance genes (ARG), using widely distributed wild ungulates as model species. A total of 151 antimicrobial resistant-Enterobacterales isolates were detected from 181 wild ungulates: 50% (44/88) of isolates from wild boar (Sus scrofa), 40.3% (25/62) from red deer (Cervus elaphus), 41.4% (12/29) from fallow deer (Dama dama) and 100% (2/2) from mouflon (Ovis aries subsp. musimon). Selected isolates showed a diversified resistance profile, with particularly high values corresponding to ampicillin (71.5%) and tetracycline (63.6%). Enterobacterales strains carried blaTEM, tetA, tetB, sul2, sul1 or dfrA1 ARG genes. They also carried blaCTX-M-type genes, which are prevalent in human infections, namely CTX-M-14, CTX-M-15 and CTX-M-98. Strikingly, this is the first report of CTX-M-98 in wildlife. Almost 40% (n = 59) of Enterobacterales were multi-drug resistant. The diversity of plasmids carried by ESBL isolates was remarkable, including IncF, K and P. This study highlights the potential role of wild ungulates as environmental reservoirs of CTX-M ESBL-producing E. coli and in the spill-over of AMR bacteria and their determinants. Our findings suggest that wild ungulates are useful as strategic sentinel species of AMR in terrestrial environments, especially in response to potential sources of anthropogenic pollution, providing early warning of potential risks to human, animal and environmental health.

TI  - Whole breast radiotherapy in cN0 early breast cancer patients with pathological sentinel lymph nodes (pN1mic, pN1a) without axillary dissection: preliminary results of the observational LISEN trial
T2  - STRAHLENTHERAPIE UND ONKOLOGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Axillary management remains unclear when sentinel lymph node (SLN) results are positive in cN0 patients with breast cancer (BC). The trial ACOSOG Z0011 represented a revolution with axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) omission in SLN+ patients, despite critiques regarding non-uniformity of radiation fields. We conducted an observational study (LISEN) where whole breast radiotherapy (WBRT) was planned with tangential fields without nodal irradiation in patients eligible for the Z0011 trial. Methods Inclusion criteria were female patients with histologically proven BC, cT1-2cN0, planned conservative surgery, no neoadjuvant therapy. Patients were stratified into two groups: micrometastatic (pN1mic, group 1) and macrometastatic (pN1a, group 2) lymph nodes. Tangential field WBRT was mandatory. Clinical outcomes were analysed, measured from surgery until the first event. Results In all, 199 patients underwent conservative surgery and SLN biopsy; 133 patients meeting criteria were analysed: 41 patients (30.8%) pN1mic and 92 (69.2%) pN1a. The 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 95.0% (85.9-100%) in group 1 and 93.0% (86.3-100.0%) in group 2 (p = 0.78). Overall survival (OS) was 100% (100-100%) in group 1 and 97.4% (92.4-100%) in group 2 (p = 0.74). For the whole cohort DFS and OS were 93.6% (88.2-99.4%) and 96.9% (91.5-100.0%), respectively. For groups 1 and 2, the 5-year outcomes were 5.0% (0.0-14.4%) and 2.3% (0.0-6.1%) for local recurrence (p = 0.51), and 6.2% (0.0-17.4%) and 7.0% (0.0-13.7%) for distant metastasis (p = 0.61), respectively. In group 1, regional recurrence (RR) and local regional recurrence (LRR) were 5.0% (0.0-14.1%; p = 0.13). In group 2, RR and LRR were 0.0% (0.0-0.0%). Conclusion Our results showed good regional control in patients who met the Z0011 trial criteria. WBRT, without nodal surgery or RT, avoiding axillary morbidity, seems to be a good choice.

TI  - Impact of Obesity on Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping in Patients with apparent Early-Stage Endometrial Cancer: The ObeLyX study
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. Conflicting data exists on the impact of Body Mass Index (BMI) on sentinel lymph-node (SLN) detection.The primary study endpointwas to investigate the impact of obesity on overall detection rate, bilateralmapping, and mapping failure rate of SLN. In addition, we evaluated possible differences in terms of surgicalmanagement and "empty-packet dissection" rate among obese and non-obese patients.Methods. Multicenter, propensity-matched, retrospective study. Patients with apparent early-stage endometrial cancer were included. Study population was divided into women with BMI </>= 30 (Group-1 and Group-2). To lower the selection bias, a propensity-matched analysis was performed. Matching was based on histotype (endometrioid vs non-endometrioid), age (</>= 65 years old), and presence of lymph-vascular space invasion.Results. Eight-hundred forty-four women were enrolled. After a 1:1 propensity-matched analysis, 764 patients were identified (Group-1 n= 382, Group-2 n= 382). A 1.156-fold increase in the risk of mapping failure for every 5 units of BMI increase was found (OR 1.156, 95% CI 1.033-1.294, p= 0.012), with a consequently decrease in bilateralmapping and overall detection rate (respectively OR 0.865, 95% CI 0.773-0.968, p= 0.012 and OR 0.785, 95% CI 0.670-0.920, p = 0.003). Obese patients were surgically under-staged in 9.4% of cases and showed an 8.2% of empty packet dissection (surgical under-staging: 5.0% vs 9.4%, p= 0.017; empty-packet dissection: 3.9% vs 8.2%, p= 0.022).Conclusions. BMI was confirmed as a statistically relevant predictor ofmapping failure and decreased overall detection rate. In addition, obese women had a significantly higher odds of empty packet dissection.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variations and drivers of ecological carrying capacity in a typical mountain-oasis-desert area, Xinjiang, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The aggravation of climate change and human activities have challenged the fragile ecology of the arid and semiarid Xinjiang in Northwest China. The concept of ecological carrying capacity (ECC) refers to the ability of an ecosystem to support the healthy development of the human social system and provide adequate resources and enabling environmental conditions. A comprehensive evaluation of ECC could rationalize ecological restoration and sustainable development. This study evaluates the ECC of Xinjiang's unique landscape structure of mountainoasis-desert ecosystems from 1982 to 2017, using remote sensing data such as vegetation and evapotranspiration and geographic information system technology, and index evaluation method. The ECC patterns and change trends were explained from multidisciplinary perspectives, and the internal drivers of ECC spatio-temporal variations were evaluated by partial correlation analysis and residual analysis. The results showed an average ECC value at the median level of 0.29. For spatial distribution, ECC value decreased from west to east, the median ECC area was the most widespread, and the poorest ECC area was concentrated mainly in Southern Xinjiang's deserts. From the analysis of the significance of the change, ECC in Xinjiang had generally declined, with the decreasing areas exceeding the increasing areas. The driver analysis found temperature exerting a greater impact than precipitation on ECC improvement, and human activities positively impacted ECC. Altitude was closely associated with ECC distribution with better ECC in high elevation areas. The positive correlation between urbanization and ECC level was significant. The findings provide a relatively comprehensive and synoptic framework for ecological assessment in arid and semi-arid areas to inform sustainable development and ecological restoration in Xinjiang.

TI  - Analyzing the Spatial Distribution of LST and Its Relationship With Underlying Surfaces in Different Months by Classification and Intersection
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban heat islands (UHIs) have become one of the most critical issues around the world, especially in the context of rapid urbanization and global climate change. Extensive research has been conducted across disciplines on the factors related to land surface temperature (LST) and how to mitigate the UHI effect. However, there remain deficiencies in the exploration of LST changes across time and their relationship with underlying surfaces in different temperature ranges. In order to fill the gap, this study compared the LST of each month by using the quantile classification method taking the Landsat 8 images of Nanjing on May 18(th), July 21(st), and October 9(th) in 2017 as the subject and then calculated the differences between July and May as well as that between July and October by an intersection tool taking the LST classes of July as the baseline. Additionally, the spatial pattern of each temperature class and intersection area was analyzed with the help of several landscape metrics, and the land contribution index (LCI) was utilized to better quantify the thermal contribution of each underlying surface to the area. The results indicated that the difference between months mainly reflected in the medium temperature area, especially between July and October, in which landscape patterns illustrated a trend of fragmentation and decentralization. The proportions of underlying surfaces in different types of intersection revealed the distinction of their warming and cooling degrees over time, in which the warming degree of other rigid pavement was higher in the warming process from May to July, and the cooling degree of buildings was greater in the cooling process from July to October. The LCI of each underlying surface in the entire study area was different from that in each temperature class, indicating that underlying surfaces had distinguished thermal contributions in different temperature ranges. This study is expected to fill the gap in previous studies and provide a new perspective on the mitigation of UHI.

TI  - Robust metagenomic evidence that local assemblage richness increases with latitude in ground-active invertebrates of North America
T2  - OIKOS
M3  - Article
AB  - Biodiversity monitoring is imperative for understanding how changing climate may impact the distributions of taxa from single species to the spatial distribution of biological diversity. Large-scale and cross-taxa biodiversity monitoring also allows an empirical understanding of biogeographic patterns across taxa. One such pattern, where in taxonomic richness peaks at tropical latitudes are typically treated as a biogeographical rule with few notable exceptions. Here we leveraged the invertebrate pitfall collections of the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) across North America to describe patterns of local taxonomic richness across taxa and across taxonomic scale. We focused on Arthropoda, Annelida and Mollusca. Additionally, we estimated regional species richness using expert-identified samples of three NEON sentinel taxa: Carabidae, Culicidae and Ixodida. To sample pitfall animals, we filtered storage ethanol and employed environmental DNA-barcoding methodologies to amplify and sequence extracted DNA from the filtrate for two regions of a mitochondrial gene. We assigned taxonomic names to these sequences at 97% similarity to reference sequences and calculated local taxonomic richness at the levels of species, genus, family and order. We calculated local species richness for 12 common invertebrate taxa. We used generalized linear models to describe the relationships between taxonomic richness and spatial, climatic and abundance predictor variables. At four taxonomic scales, ranging from species to order, taxonomic richnessincreased significantly as a function of latitude. Of the twelve invertebrate taxa weexamined, seven mirrored this positive latitudinal gradient in species richness. At theregional scale, two of three NEON Sentinel Taxa showed positive latitudinal gradientsin species richness. Temperature, precipitation, abundance and sequence read numberplayed minor roles in explaining patterns of taxonomic richness. When considering these mostly temperate sites that span 46 degrees of latitude, we found no support for the expected negative latitudinal gradients across taxa and taxonomic scales. Instead, for many of these taxa and taxonomic scales, we observed significant, positive richness gradients with increasing latitude among ground-dwelling invertebrate communities. Thus, one of the most 'general' patterns in biogeography was not found for most invertebrate taxa across temperate latitudes.

TI  - Traffic restrictions during the 2008 Olympic Games reduced urban heat intensity and extent in Beijing
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite thermal remote sensing has been utilized to examine the urban heat dynamics in relation to the urban traffic restriction policy. During the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, the traffic volume was approximately cut off by half through the road space rationing. Based on daily MODIS satellite thermal observations on the surface temperature, statistical models were developed to analyze the contribution of traffic volume reduction to the urban heat intensity and spatial extent. Our analyses show that cutting off half of the traffic volume has led to a marked decrease in the mean surface temperature by 1.5-2.4 degrees C and shrinkage of the heat extent by 820 km(2) in Beijing. This research suggests that the impact of urban traffic on heat intensity is considerably larger than previously thought, and the management of urban traffic and vehicle fossil fuel use should be included in the future urban heat mitigation plan.Road space rationing policies reduced traffic volume by half in Beijing during the 2008 Olympic Games, which in turn decreased the mean surface temperature by up to 2.4 degrees C, according to statistical analysis of remotely sensed thermal observations.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy alone compared to systematic lymphadenectomy in patients with uterine carcinosarcoma
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. To assess survival among patients diagnosed with uterine carcinosarcoma (CS) who underwent sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy alone vs. systematic lymph node dissection (LND).Methods. We identified newly diagnosed CS patients who underwent primary surgical management from January 1996-December 2019. The SLN cohort underwent SLN biopsy alone with bilateral SLNs identified. The systematic LND cohort did not undergo SLN biopsy.Results. Ninety-nine patients underwent SLN biopsy, and 100 patients underwent systematic LND. There was no difference by age, stage, body mass index, myoinvasion (< 50%, >= 50%), lymphovascular space invasion, or positive washings. Eighty-five SLN (85.9%) and 15 LND (15%) underwent minimally invasive surgery (P < 0.001). Themedian total node countwas four (range, 1-13) for SLN and 19 (range, 2-50) for LND (P < 0.001). Nodalmetastasis occurred in 23 (23.2%) SLN and in 22 (22%) LND (P= 0.4). Postoperative therapywas administered to 85 (85.9%) SLN and 71 (71%) LND (P = 0.02). Median follow-up was 33 months (range, 1-205) for SLN and 55.3 months (range, 1-269) for LND (P = 0.001). The three-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 62.9% (SE 5.2%) for SLN and 52.3% (SE 5.3%) for LND (P = 0.13). The three-year overall survival (OS) was 72.1% (SE 5.1%) for SLN and 71.6% (SE 4.6%) for LND (P = 0.68). An isolated nodal recurrence occurred in two (2%) SLN and four (4%) LND (P = 0.26).Conclusions. There is no difference in PFS or OS among CS patients who undergo SLN biopsy vs. systematic LND. SLN biopsy detects nodal metastasis without compromising oncologic outcomes. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - A characterization of clouds over the Great Barrier Reef and the role of local forcing
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A characterization of cloud properties associated with precipitation in the region around the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is constructed using decade-long (2007-2017) satellite observations from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) combined with CloudSat. The spatial and vertical distributions of low-level cloud properties over the region are also investigated and discussed. In general, different cloud types are observed over different regions and vary by season: high clouds are dominant over the low latitudes in summer, altocumulus are mainly observed over northeast Queensland and low-level clouds are dominant over the ocean and coast during the winter months at higher latitudes under a trade wind regime. A strong latitudinal dependence of total precipitation across the Greater GBR region is identified with a significant orographic enhancement near Cairns in the wet tropics. MODIS and CloudSat-CALIPSO cloud observations show good agreement on significant differences in low-level cloud microphysical properties between the land and the ocean. The largest land-ocean differences in warm cloud microphysical properties are found over the mid-latitudes near 18 degrees S, which is strongly associated with orographic forcing, with these enhancements extending further east to the coral reef area. However, the frequency of warm cloud is not enhanced upwind of the mountains in the wet tropics. In addition, no significant differences in warm cloud properties between the actual GBR and the open ocean are identified. These results suggest that low-level clouds over the GBR do not show any significant response to the reef-related microphysical perturbations.

T2  - CANCER RADIOTHERAPIE
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. - To determine the dose received by the low axilla during locoregional radiotherapy (RT) for early-stage breast cancer and to assess the impact of the treatment technique (three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) or rotational IMRT (VMAT) or helical tomotherapy (HT).Materials and methods. - The dosimetric study was performed on patients receiving normofractionated (NFRT - 50 Gy in 25 fractions) or hypofractionated (HFRT - 40 Gy in 15 fractions) locoregional radiotherapy (breast or chest wall and internal mammary, supraclavicular and infraclavicular nodes + axillary nodes) by 3D -CRT or VMAT or HT at the Institut Curie Paris. Patients treated by breast-conserving surgery received a boost dose of 16 Gy and 10 Gy to the tumour bed, respectively.Results. - Sixty-eight patients treated by RT from February 2017 to January 2019 were studied. The mean dose received by the low axilla when it was not part of the target volume was 30.8 Gy, 41.0 Gy and 44.4 Gy by 3D-CRT, VMAT and HT, respectively for NFRT and 24.2 Gy, 33.0 Gy and 34.9 Gy, respectively, for HFRT. With NFRT, 4.1% of the axilla received 95% (V95) of the prescribed dose by 3D-CRT compared to 24.5% and 33.6% by VMAT and HT, respectively; with HFRT, V95 was 3.9%, 19.5% and 24.1%, respectively.Conclusion. - The axilla receives a non-negligible dose during locoregional radiotherapy; this dose is greater when VMAT or HT are used. Prospective studies must be conducted to assess the impact of this axillary dose in terms of morbidity, which currently remains unknown.(c) 2021 Societe francaise de radiotherapie oncologique (SFRO).

M3  - Article
AB  - The study involved assessment of changes in Oba Hills Forest Reserve between 1984 and 2020 and simulated future scenario in the wake of rising impactful and uses in the protected forest land. Landsat TM, ETM+, and OLI/TC of 1984, 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020 were acquired from the United States Geological Survey. Ground-truth data were collected to enhance imagery re-classifications. I he acquired images were pre-processed and processed using ArcGIS 10.5 to characterize land-use and land-cover changes in the area. Past changes between 1984 and 2020 were evaluated, and a possible future outlook was determined. Image classification accuracy was assessed using Kappa's and other accuracy statistics and confusion matrix. Five land cover classes were distinguished. The result revealed consistent losses of forest covers over 36-year period. There was a gross loss of 42.7% (1519 ha) in total forest covers within the period at 12% yr(-1). Specifically, primary and secondary forests shrank by 12.3 and 66.8% between 1984 and 2020, respectively, whereas agriculture and grassland rose by 145.2 and 258.8% at 4 and 7.2% yr(-1), respectively. Prime drivers of forest losses were subsistence agriculture and cocoa farming cum illegal timber extractions through filtching. These may have had severe negative impacts on faunal population while subjecting forest-dependent rural populace to livelihood challenges. On the other hand, critical components of the ecosystem may also be in jeopardy due to forest degradation, fragmentation, and eventual loss of high conservation values. Therefore. effective forest protection and conservation means. like providing alternative livelihood means, afforestation programs, and multi-stakeholder fore st management strategies, are advised.

T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective We aimed to assess if emergency department (ED) syndromic surveillance during the first and second waves of the COVID-19 outbreak could have improved our surveillance system. Design and settings We did an observational study using aggregated data from the ED of a university hospital and public health authorities in western Switzerland. Participants All patients admitted to the ED were included. Primary outcome measure The main outcome was intensive care unit (ICU) occupancy. We used time series methods for ED syndromic surveillance (influenza-like syndrome, droplet isolation) and usual indicators from public health authorities (new cases, proportion of positive tests in the population). Results Based on 37 319 ED visits during the COVID-19 outbreak, 1421 ED visits (3.8%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Patients with influenza-like syndrome or droplet isolation in the ED showed a similar correlation to ICU occupancy as confirmed cases in the general population, with a time lag of approximately 13 days (0.73, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.80; 0.79, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.86; and 0.76, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.83, respectively). The proportion of positive tests in the population showed the best correlation with ICU occupancy (0.95, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.96). Conclusion ED syndromic surveillance is an effective tool to detect and monitor a COVID-19 outbreak and to predict hospital resource needs. It would have allowed to anticipate ICU occupancy by 13 days, including significant aberration detection at the beginning of the second wave.

TI  - Flood Management, Characterization and Vulnerability Analysis Using an Integrated RS-GIS and 2D Hydrodynamic Modelling Approach: The Case of Deg Nullah, Pakistan
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - One-dimensional (1D) hydraulic models have been extensively used to conduct flood simulations for investigating flood depth and extent maps. However, the 1D models cannot simulate many other flood characteristics, such as flood velocity, duration, arrival time and recession time when the flow is not restricted within the channel. These flood characteristics cannot be disregarded as they play an important role in developing flood mitigation and evacuation strategies. This study formulates a two-dimensional (2D) hydrodynamic model combined with remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) approach to generate additional flood characteristic maps that cannot be produced with 1D models. The model was applied to a transboundary river of Deg Nullah in Pakistan to simulate an extreme flood event experience in 2014. The flood extent images from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) and observed flood extents were used to evaluate the model performance. Moreover, an entropy distance-based approach was proposed to facilitate the integrated multivariate flood vulnerability classification. The simulated 2D flood modeling results showed a good agreement with the flood extents registered by MODIS and the observed ones. The northwest parts of Deg Nullah near Seowal, Dullam Kahalwan and Zafarwal were the most vulnerable areas due to high flood depths and prolonged flooding duration. Whereas high flood velocities, short flood arrival time, prolonged flood duration and recession times were observed in the upper reach of Deg Nullah thereby making it the most susceptible, critical and vulnerable region to flooding events.

It is focused on evaluating the accruable benefits of Principal Component Analysis as part of an image preprocessing procedure for image classification. Land-use-land-cover (LULC) and accuracy assessment datasets were obtained with remote sensing and geographic information system's software. The principal component analysis was statistically used to assess the level of correlation amongst bands in Landsat 8. The image classification was premised on the Maximum Likelihood classifier for land use land cover analysis. To ascertain the accuracy of the classified images, the Producer's accuracy, User's accuracy and Kappa coefficient derivatives of accuracy assessment was calculated. The results revealed that the first three PCs of the raw Landsat data accounted for 99.37 % variance of the original Landsat data, while the last three PCs represented only 0.63% of the original data. The results of land use land cover based on raw bands composite were Forest (41%), Shrubs (33%) and Built-up (26%) respectively. On the other hand, land use land cover based on Principal Component Analysis showed Forest (39%), Shrubs (39%) and Builtup (22%) respectively. Comparing the results of Kappa coefficients of both LULC of raw bands' composite was 0.88 while that of PCA was 0.91. Conclusively, there is a significant level of difference in the classification outputs of PCA derived classification and that of raw Landsat bands' composite.

TI  - An Approach for Monitoring and Classifying Marshlands Using Multispectral Remote Sensing Imagery in Arid and Semi-Arid Regions
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Marshlands in arid and semi-arid areas are considered constantly changing environments due to unsecured water supplies as a result of high evapotranspiration and limited and highly variable rainfall. Classification of marshlands in these regions and mapping of their land cover is not an easy task and maps need to be upgraded frequently. Satellites provide enormous amounts of information and data for the continuous monitoring of changes. The aim of this paper is to introduce an approach using multispectral satellite imagery that was adopted to classify and monitor the Al Hammar Marsh (Iraq) over several years and to suggest a relationship between the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), and the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), using Landsat 8 data with a resolution of 30 m x 30 m, validated with Sentinel-2 datasets at 10 m x 10 m. Six land cover classes were used: (1) open water, (2) dry area, (3) dense vegetation, (4) medium-density vegetation, (5) sparse vegetation, and (6) wet soil. Three indices, NDWI, NDMI, and NDVI, were chosen for the automatic classification of each pixel and the creation of a time series of land cover maps. The proposed method can efficiently classify and monitor marshlands and can be used to study different marshlands by adjusting the thresholds for NDVI, NDMI, and NDWI. Overall, the correlation for all classes (R) between Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 is about 0.78. Thus, this approach will help to preserve marshes through improved water management.

TI  - Remote Sensing and Field Survey Data Integration to Investigate on the Evolution of the Coastal Area: The Case Study of Bagnara Calabra (Southern Italy)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal areas worldwide are the result of a weak balance between man and the natural environment. They are exposed to strong anthropogenic pressure and natural hazard events whose intensity has increased in recent decades. In this frame, the satellite and drone monitoring systems as well as field survey are key tools to learn about the factors responsible for coastal changes. Here we describe the formation and dismantling of a fan delta at Sfalassa Stream mouth, Calabria Region (Southern Italy) to shed light on the environmental drivers modelling this coast. The flood event of 2 November 2015 placed approximately 25,000 m(3) of coarse sand and gravel sediments in a few hours forming a fan-shaped delta, while three main storm surges, occurring from November 2015 to January 2016, caused its dismantling. Sentinel 2 images and several photographs captured the gradual erosion of fan delta highlighting its complete dismantling in about 3 months. The eroded sediments only partially feed the neighbouring beaches, as they were rapidly funnelled several hundred metres seaward by submarine channels whose heads cut back up at depths <10 m. This analysis showed that observing systems with high spatial and temporal resolution provide the proper knowledge to model the processes that characterise this transitional environment. They are fundamental tools for coastal zone management, which aims to ensure the sustainability of coastal zones by mitigating the effects of erosion and flooding.

TI  - Characterizing Air Pollution and Its Association with Emission Sources in Lahore: A Guide to Adaptation Action Plans to Control Pollution and Smog
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Featured Application Low-cost surveillance of emission sources for eminent pollutants to combat smog in cities using remote sensing. Lahore, the home of 11 million people, is one of the most polluted cities in the world. Pollution causes deaths, birth defects, and years of life lost. This study's real-time data analysis of the air quality index (AQI) showed that air pollution remained "unhealthy for everyone" for 54% of the time, and "unhealthy for sensitive groups" for 88% of the time, during the last three years (June 2019-September 2021). The air quality index (AQI) value in Lahore reached 175 mu g/m(3) in 2021. This alarmingly hazardous air situation was analyzed by selecting fourteen sites based on the provenance of industrialization and tailpipe emissions. An analysis of remote sensing data for these sites was performed, in addition to field surveys, to identify the relationship between pollutant concentration and on-ground current practices. The key primary and secondary air pollutants selected for analysis were carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2), aerosol optical depth (AOD), methane (CH4), and formaldehyde (HCHO). The assessment was carried out for the study period of July 2018 to April 2021. The real-time AQI was plotted against each pollutant's monthly concentration, which showed a significant positive correlation of AQI with SO2, NO2, and CO. A plotting of the percentage contribution of each pollutant with its emission sources highlighted the main pollutant to take action to reduce, as a priority on those particular sites. The pollutant hotspot within each economic activity was also determined. Assessments showed that the AQI value was higher on weekends than on weekdays. These findings can help to develop smart adaptation action plans for immediate implementation, to dilute the current environmental risks in the city.

TI  - Characterizing the Patterns and Trends of Urban Growth in Saudi Arabia's 13 Capital Cities Using a Landsat Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Development and a growing population in Saudi Arabia have led to a substantial increase in the size of its urban areas. This sustained development has increased policymakers' need for reliable data and analysis regarding the patterns and trends of urban expansion throughout the country. Although previous studies on urban growth in Saudi cities exist, there has been no comprehensive research that focused on all 13 regional capitals within the country. Our study addressed this gap by producing a new annual long-term dataset of 30 m spatial resolution that covered 35 years (1985-2019) and maintained a high overall accuracy of annual classifications across the study period, ranging between 93 and 98%. Utilizing the continuous change detection and classification (CCDC) algorithm and all available Landsat data, we classified Landsat pixels into urban and non-urban classes with an annual frequency and quantified urban land cover change over these 35 years. We implemented a stratified random sampling design to assess the accuracy of the annual classifications and the multi-temporal urban change. The results revealed that Saudi capitals experienced massive urban growth, from 1305.28 +/- 348.71 km(2) in 1985 to 2704.94 +/- 554.04 km(2) in 2019 (+/- values represent the 95% confidence intervals). In addition to the high accuracy of the annual classifications, the overall accuracy of the multi-temporal urban change map was also high and reached 91%. The urban expansion patterns varied from city to city and from year to year. Most capital cities showed clear growth patterns of edge development, that is, a continuous expansion of built-up lands radiating from existing urban areas. This study provides distinct insights into the urban expansion characteristics of each city in Saudi Arabia and a synoptic view of the country as a whole over the past four decades. Our results provided a dataset that can be used as the foundation for future socioeconomic and environmental studies.

TI  - Effects of the In Ovo Vaccination of the ts-11 Strain of <i>Mycoplasma gallisepticum</i> in Layer Embryos and Posthatch Chicks
T2  - ANIMALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) is responsible for reductions in egg production and other economic losses in the poultry industry. In this study, the potential application of in ovo vaccination of the ts-11of MG vaccine (ts-11MGV) in layer embryos for the subsequent early protection as well as live performance of pullets were investigated. The use of various dosages of live attenuated ts-11MGV ranging from 3.63 x 10(1) to 3.63 x 10(4) cfu that were delivered in ovo at 18 days of incubation were evaluated. The results of current study revealed that the in ovo injection of various dosage of ts-11MGV had no negative impacts on any hatch variables. Additionally, the higher dosage of ts-11MGV (3.63 x 10(4)) resulted in a reduction in body weight gain in three-week-old pullets in comparison to all other treatments. Furthermore, MG DNA remained undetectable for hatchling and three-week-old pullets and no serological response was observed at 3 weeks posthatch. Total flock protection from field-strain MG infections is facilitated by the prior systemic establishment of vaccine strains in pullets. Therefore, it is concluded that the ts-11MGV may not be an appropriate candidate for in ovo injection due to the lack of its presence in hatchlings and posthatch chicks subsequent to its in ovo administration. The transmission of the ts-11 strain of Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) vaccine (ts-11MGV) between incubated eggs and between hatchlings that was administrated via in ovo injection, and its subsequent effects on their posthatch performance were evaluated. Marek's disease diluent alone (sham-injected) or containing either 3.63 x 10(1), 10(2), 10(3), or 10(4) cfu of ts-11MGV was manually in ovo-injected into the amnion on 18 days of incubation. Egg residue analysis, percentage incubational egg weight loss, hatchability of viable injected eggs, and hatchling body weight (BW) were assessed. Selected hatchlings from each treatment replicate group were swabbed in the choanal cleft for MG DNA detection. Female chick live performance was also assessed through 21 days of posthatch age. Unexposed control sentinel chicks were allocated to each treatment replicate group to assess horizontal transmission. Birds were later swabbed and bled respectively, for detection of MG DNA and IgM production at 21 days posthatch. In all birds, no MG DNA was detected and SPA tests for IgM were negative. Among all variables, only 0 to 21 day BW gain was significantly affected by treatment and was lower in the 3.63 x 10(4) ts-11 MGV treatment in comparison to all the other treatments. Because ts-11MGV does not exhibit vertical or horizontal transmission capabilities under commercial conditions, it may not be a good candidate for in ovo injection.

TI  - Impact of Urbanization on Seismic Risk: A Study Based on Remote Sensing Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The management of seismic risk is an important aspect of social development. However, urbanization has led to an increase in disaster-bearing bodies, making it more difficult to reduce seismic risk. To understand the changes in seismic risk associated with urbanization and then adjust the risk management strategy, remote-sensing technology is necessary. By identifying the types of earthquake-bearing bodies, it is possible to estimate the seismic risk and then determine the changes. For this purpose, this study proposes a set of algorithms that combine deep-learning models with object-oriented image classification and extract building information using multisource remote sensing data. Following this, the area of the building is estimated, the vulnerability is determined, and, lastly, the economic and social impacts of an earthquake are determined based on the corresponding ground motion level and fragility function. Our study contributes to the understanding of changes in seismic risk caused by urbanization processes and offers a practical reference for updating seismic risk management, as well as a methodological framework to evaluate the effectiveness of seismic policies. Experimental results indicate that the proposed model is capable of effectively capturing buildings' information. Through verification, the overall accuracy of the classification of vulnerability types reaches 86.77%. Furthermore, this study calculates social and economic losses of the core area of Tianjin Baodi District in 2011, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2018, 2020, and 2021, obtaining changes in seismic risk in the study area. The result shows that for rare earthquakes at night, although the death rate decreased from 2.29% to 0.66%, the possible death toll seems unchanged, due to the increase in population.

TI  - Bibliometric Analysis of Data Sources and Tools for Shoreline Change Analysis and Detection
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Review
AB  - The world has a long record of shoreline and related erosion problems due to the impacts of climate change/variability in sea level rise. This has made coastal systems and large inland water environments vulnerable, thereby activating research concern globally. This study is a bibliometric analysis of the global scientific production of data sources and tools for shoreline change analysis and detection. The bibliometric mapping method (bibliometric R and VOSviewer package) was utilized to analyze 1578 scientific documents (1968-2022) retrieved from Scopus and Web of Science databases. There is a chance that in the selection process one or more important scientific papers might be omitted due to the selection criteria. Thus, there could be a bias in the present results due to the search criteria here employed. The results revealed that the U.S.A. is the country with the most scientific production (16.9%) on the subject. Again, more country collaborations exist among the developed countries compared with the developing countries. The results further revealed that tools for shoreline change analysis have changed from a simple beach transect (0.1%) to the utilization of geospatial tools such as DSAS (14.6%), ArcGIS/ArcMap (13.8%), and, currently, machine learning (5.1%). Considering the benefits of these geospatial tools, and machine learning in particular, more utilization is essential to the continuous growth of the field. Found research gaps were mostly addressed by the researchers themselves or addressed in other studies, while others have still not been addressed, especially the ones emerged from the recent work. For instance, the one on insights for reef restoration projects focused on erosion mitigation and designing artificial reefs in microtidal sandy beaches.

TI  - A robust stochastic approach in correcting the TRMM precipitation product and simulating flood features
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Logical management and decision-making on water resources require reliable weather variables, where precipitation is considered the main weather variable. Accurate estimation of precipitation is the most important topic in hydrological studies. Due to the lack of a dense network and low temporal and spatial resolution levels at ground-level rain gauges, especially in developing countries, remote sensing methods have been used widely. In recent years, a combination of satellite-ground data on precipitation has led to a more accurate insight into precipitation and improved hydrological model performance. In this study, the Kosar Dam Basin in the Khuzestan province of Iran is selected as the research zone. The TRMM satellite data is used on 50 events to analyze the satellite precipitation data. Copula theory is then employed to check the uncertainties of precipitation estimation, and new precipitations are generated through original data and bias errors. A comparison of the results of the improved TRMM, which was bias-corrected by Gaussian copula, and ground-based rainfall demonstrated the efficacy of this method, with nearly 104% and 51% improvement in the CC and RMSE performance indicators, respectively. The HEC-HMS model was used to simulate flood features based on copula-corrected precipitation over different quartiles (10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, and 90%) and rainfall duration (3, 6, 9, and 24 h). The obtained R-factor values show that the associated uncertainty decreases with rainfall duration, down to 46 and 20% for discharge peak and volume, respectively. In general, the copula approach is a robust approach to improve the accuracy of the TRMM precipitation product for simulating hydrological processes.

TI  - Evaluation of Different Landslide Susceptibility Models for a Local Scale in the Chitral District, Northern Pakistan
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - This work evaluates the performance of three machine learning (ML) techniques, namely logistic regression (LGR), linear regression (LR), and support vector machines (SVM), and two multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques, namely analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), for mapping landslide susceptibility in the Chitral district, northern Pakistan. Moreover, we create landslide inventory maps from LANDSAT-8 satellite images through the change vector analysis (CVA) change detection method. The change detection yields more than 500 landslide spots. After some manual post-processing correction, the landslide inventory spots are randomly split into two sets with a 70/30 ratio for training and validating the performance of the ML techniques. Sixteen topographical, hydrological, and geological landslide-related factors of the study area are prepared as GIS layers. They are used to produce landslide susceptibility maps (LSMs) with weighted overlay techniques using different weights of landslide-related factors. The accuracy assessment shows that the ML techniques outperform the MCDM methods, while SVM yields the highest accuracy of 88% for the resulting LSM.

TI  - Dust Climatology of Turkey as a Part of the Eastern Mediterranean Basin via 9-Year CALIPSO-Derived Product
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Turkey is located in the heart of complex transition geography between Eurasia and the Middle East. In the grand scheme, the so-called eastern Mediterranean Basin is located almost in the middle of the dusty belt, and is a hot spot of climate change. The downstream location of dust-carrying winds from close desert sources reveals Turkey as an open plane to particulate matter exposure throughout the year. In order to clarify this phenomenon, this paper aims to determine the desert dust climatology of Turkey via CALIPSO onboard Lidar. This prominent instrument enables us to understand clouds, aerosols and their types, and related climatic systems, with its valuable products. In this study, a 9-year CALIPSO-derived pure dust product dataset was formed to explain horizontal and vertical distributions, transport heights and case incidences. The results indicated that the pure dust extinction coefficient increased as the location shifted from west to east. Moreover, in the same direction of west to east, the dominant spring months changed to summer and autumn. Mountain range systems surrounding Anatolia were the main obstacles against lofted and buoyant dust particles travelling to northern latitudes. Even if high ridges accumulated mass load on the southern slopes, they also enabled elevated particles to reach the ground level of the inner cities.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Grasslands Using Landsat Data in Livestock Micro-Watersheds in Amazonas (NW Peru)
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - In Peru, grasslands monitoring is essential to support public policies related to the identification, recovery and management of livestock systems. In this study, therefore, we evaluated the spatial dynamics of grasslands in Pomacochas and Ventilla micro-watersheds (Amazonas, NW Peru). To do this, we used Landsat 5, 7 and 8 images and vegetation indices (normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI). The data were processed in Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform for 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020 through random forest (RF) classification reaching accuracies above 85%. The application of RF in GEE allowed surface mapping of grasslands with pressures higher than 85%. Interestingly, our results reported the increase of grasslands in both Pomacochas (from 2457.03 ha to 3659.37 ha) and Ventilla (from 1932.38 ha to 4056.26 ha) micro-watersheds during 1990-2020. Effectively, this study aims to provide useful information for territorial planning with potential replicability for other cattle-raising regions of the country. It could further be used to improve grassland management and promote semi-extensive livestock farming.

TI  - On the Use of Radar and Optical Satellite Imagery for the Monitoring of Flood Hazards on Heritage Sites in Southern Sinai, Egypt
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study focuses on the use of radar and optical satellite imagery for flood hazard mapping and monitoring around the archaeological sites of the Wadi Baba area, situated at Sinai (Egypt) and well known for its heritage treasures belonging to diverse historical periods and civilizations from the Pharaonic, Nabateans, Christian, and Islamic eras. Although this area is located in an arid to semi-arid climatic region, it is intermittently flooded due to torrential rainstorms. To assess the amount of rainfall expected and its impacts on heritage sites, satellite Sentinel-1 (C-Band) and Tropical Rainfall Monitoring Mission (TRMM) data were jointly used with measurements from meteorological stations and the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). Envi5.1, ArcGIS 10.4.1, Snap 6.0, and the GEE platform were used to process optical and radar data, which were further analysed using the ArcHydro model. In this study, the TRMM accumulated rainfall data acquired on 17 January 2010, Sentinel-1 radar images between 2017 and 2019, and Sentinel-1 data captured from 1 to 30 March 2020 processed by GEE platform were chosen to assess the effects of flood events on the archaeological sites in the study area. The results indicated that the study area is exposed to flood risk that significantly threatens these heritage sites. Based on that, mitigation strategies were devised and recommended to mitigate the flood hazard impact around the archaeological areas.

TI  - A Distributed N-FINDR Cloud Computing-Based Solution for Endmembers Extraction on Large-Scale Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, we introduce a novel, distributed version of the N-FINDR endmember extraction algorithm, which is able to exploit computer cluster resources in order to efficiently process large volumes of hyperspectral data. The implementation of the distributed algorithm was done by extending the InterCloud Data Mining Package, originally adopted for land cover classification, through the HyperCloud-RS framework, here adapted for endmember extraction, which can be executed on cloud computing environments, allowing users to elastically administer processing power and storage space for adequately handling very large datasets. The framework supports distributed execution, network communication, and fault tolerance, transparently and efficiently to the user. The experimental analysis addresses the performance issues, evaluating both accuracy and execution time, over the processing of different synthetic versions of the AVIRIS Cuprite hyperspectral dataset, with 3.1 Gb, 6.2 Gb, and 15.1Gb respectively, thus addressing the issue of dealing with large-scale hyperspectral data. As a further contribution of this work, we describe in detail how to extend the HyperCloud-RS framework by integrating other endmember extraction algorithms, thus enabling researchers to implement algorithms specifically designed for their own assessment.

TI  - District-based urban expansion monitoring using multitemporal satellite data: application in two mega cities
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban expansion is a process of urban development as a result of population growth. Urban sprawl, known as unplanned and unrestricted urban expansion, is among the most important topics in urban studies. In recent decades, many cities around the world in both developing and developed countries have experienced urban expansion. Istanbul and Sydney are two of those cities encountering the urban expansion. Thus, in this study, the spatial and temporal pattern of urban expansion of the most urbanized districts of Istanbul (Arnavutkoy) and Sydney (Hills Shire) was analyzed using multi-temporal remote sensing data. Initially, the Landsat images were classified to evaluate the land use/land cover (LULC) changes. The change detection analysis revealed that urban area of Arnavutkoy district has increased about 669% from 1997 to 2017 and urban area of Hills Shire Local Government Area (LGA) increased by 78% between 1996 and 2018. The relationship of land surface temperature (LST) and urban areas extracted by recoding the LULC maps was also evaluated in different buffer zones. The results showed that with the increase in urban area extent, the LST has also increased. Then, Shannon's entropy and spatial landscape metrics were used to analyze the district-based urban expansion. The results showed that both study areas expanded over the time but the main differences observed are that Arnavutkoy has more fragmented and Hills Shire has a more compact urban growth process.

TI  - On the Discovery of a Roman Fortified Site in Gafsa, Southern Tunisia, Based on High-Resolution X-Band Satellite Radar Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing availability of multiplatform, multiband, very-high-resolution (VHR) satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data has attracted the attention of a growing number of scientists and archeologists. In particular, over the last two decades, archeological research has benefited from SAR development mainly due to its unique ability to acquire scenes both at night and during the day under all weather conditions, its penetration capability, and the provided polarimetric and interferometric information. This paper explored the potential of a novel method (nonlocal (NL)-SAR) using TerraSAR-X (TSX) and Constellation of Small Satellites for Mediterranean Basin Observation (COSMO)-SkyMed (CSK) data to detect buried archeological remains in steep, rugged terrain. In this investigation, two test sites were selected in southern Tunisia, home to some of the most valuable and well-preserved limes from the Roman Empire. To enhance the subtle signals linked to archeological features, the speckle noise introduced into SAR data by the environment and SAR system must be mitigated. Accordingly, the NL-SAR method was applied to SAR data pertaining to these two significant test sites. Overall, the investigation (i) revealed a fortified settlement from the Roman Empire and (ii) identified an unknown urban area abandoned during this period via a field survey, thus successfully confirming the capability of SAR data to reveal unknown, concealed archeological sites, even in areas with a complex topography.

TI  - Unraveling the Multiple Drivers of Greening-Browning and Leaf Area Variability in a Socioeconomically Sensitive Drought-Prone Region
T2  - CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The complex attribution of climatic, hydrologic, and anthropogenic drivers to vegetation and agricultural production and their consequential societal impacts are not well understood, especially in socioeconomically sensitive states like Maharashtra, India. Here, we analyzed trends and variability in the MODIS leaf area index (LAI) time series, along with spatiotemporal patterns in precipitation, groundwater storage, agriculture statistics, and irrigation infrastructure, to identify their influences on the vegetation response and discuss their implications for farmers. The state showed greening in all biomes except forests, with a net gain of 17.478 x 10(3) km(2) of leaf area during 2003-2019, where more than 70% of the trend in LAI is represented in croplands. Maximum greening was observed in irrigated croplands, attributable to increased crop productivity, whereas inadequate irrigation facilities with erratic rainfall patterns and droughts were primarily responsible for cropland browning. We discerned the dynamics and variability of vegetation response by incorporating a spectrum of synergistic feedbacks from multiple confounding drivers and found that uneven distribution of water availability across the administrative divisions governed the quantitative distinction in leaf area change. Despite the observed greening trends, the state witnessed a high number of farmer suicides related to droughts and agriculture failures hampering their socioeconomic security; therefore, improved irrigation infrastructure and comprehensive policy interventions are crucial for abatement of farmer distress.

TI  - Retrieval of High-Resolution Aerosol Optical Depth for Urban Air Pollution Monitoring
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) is one of the most important parameters of aerosol and a key physical quantity to characterize atmospheric turbidity and air pollution. Accurate retrieval of AOD is of great significance for air quality assessment. However, the spatial resolution of the currently widely used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) AOD products is too low to meet the application research of atmospheric environment at the regional scale. In 2013, China launched the Gaofen-1 (GF-1) satellite, which provides a new idea for AOD retrieval. In this paper, we apply the synergetic use of TERRA and AQUA satellite MODIS data to calculate the high-resolution AOD over Beijing based on the Synergetic Retrieval of Aerosol Properties algorithm (SRAP) and discussed scale conversion problems between AODs with different resolutions. To obtain the 100 m MODIS data, we use GF-1 wide-field-of-view data to downscale 1 km MODIS data based on mutual information method. The retrieved AOD has a spatial resolution of 100 m and can cover many land surface types. Preliminary validation was carried out with the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) ground observation data. The correlation coefficient is about 0.88, and the root-mean-square error is about 0.15. Due to the high resolution of retrieved results, more detailed features can be provided in the spatial distribution. The experimental results show that the method has high precision, and further verification work is continuing.

TI  - Using Satellite NDVI Time-Series to Monitor Grazing Effects on Vegetation Productivity and Phenology in Heterogeneous Mediterranean Forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The reintroduction of livestock grazing to regulate biomass load is being tested for large-scale restoration in Mediterranean landscapes affected by rural abandonment. Concurrently, there is a need to develop cost-effective methods to monitor such interventions. Here, we investigate if satellite data can be used to monitor the response of vegetation phenology and productivity to grazing disturbance in a heterogenous forest mosaic with herbaceous, shrub, and tree cover. We identify which vegetation seasonal metrics respond most to grazing disturbances and are relevant to monitoring efforts. The study follows a BACI (Before-After-Control-Impact) design applied to a grazing intervention in a Pyrenean oak forest (Quercus pyrenaica) in central Portugal. Using NDVI time-series from Sentinel-2 imagery for the period between June 2016 and June 2021, we observed that each type of vegetation exhibited a distinct phenology curve. Herbaceous vegetation was the most responsive to moderate grazing disturbances with respect to changes in phenology and productivity metrics, namely an anticipation of seasonal events. Results for shrubs and trees suggest a decline in peak productivity in grazed areas but no changes in phenology patterns. The techniques demonstrated in this study are relevant to a broad range of use cases in the large-scale monitoring of fine-grained heterogeneous landscapes.

TI  - Characterizing Spatiotemporal Variations in the Urban Thermal Environment Related to Land Cover Changes in Karachi, Pakistan, from 2000 to 2020
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the spatiotemporal patterns of urban heat islands and the factors that influence this phenomenon can help to alleviate the heat stress exacerbated by urban warming and strengthen heat-related urban resilience, thereby contributing to the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The association between surface urban heat island (SUHI) effects and land use/land cover features has been studied extensively, but the situation in tropical cities is not well-understood due to the lack of consistent data. This study aimed to explore land use/land cover (LULC) changes and their impact on the urban thermal environment in a tropical megacity-Karachi, Pakistan. Land cover maps were produced, and the land surface temperature (LST) was estimated using Landsat images from five different years over the period 2000-2020. The surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII) was then quantified based on the LST data. Statistical analyses, including geographically weighted regression (GWR) and correlation analyses, were performed in order to analyze the relationship between the land cover composition and LST. The results indicated that the built-up area of Karachi increased from 97.6 km(2) to 325.33 km(2) during the period 2000-2020. Among the different land cover types, the areas classified as built-up or bare land exhibited the highest LST, and a change from vegetation to bare land led to an increase in LST. The correlation analysis indicated that the correlation coefficients between the normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) and LST ranged from 0.14 to 0.18 between 2000 and 2020 and that NDBI plays a dominant role in influencing the LST. The GWR analysis revealed the spatial variation in the association between the land cover composition and the SUHII. Parks with large areas of medium- and high-density vegetation play a significant role in regulating the thermal environment, whereas the scattered vegetation patches in the urban core do not have a significant relationship with the LST. These findings can be used to inform adaptive land use planning that aims to mitigate the effects of the UHI and aid efforts to achieve sustainable urban growth.

TI  - Turbidity classification of the Paraopeba River using machine learning and Sentinel-2 images
T2  - IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The collapse of Dam I, owned by Vale S.A, in Brumadinho-MG (Brazil), among other serious socio-environmental consequences, contaminated the waters of the Paraopeba River in a stretch of hundreds of kilometers. Considering the relevance of monitoring water quality, and knowing that field evaluation is a time-consuming and costly procedure, the use of satellite images, widely available at low cost, emerges as a relevant alternative. This work proposes a systematic experimental evaluation of five machine learning methods - Extra Trees, Multilayer Perceptron, Naive Bayes, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine, under different configurations and input data treatments, to classify the turbidity of the Paraopeba River waters from Sentinel-2 mission images. In a classification setup defined from Brazilian legislation turbidity classes, all methods obtained results equal to or greater than 0.87 accuracy, with appropriate settings and data treatments. The best result was obtained using the Support Vector Machine classifier with hyperparameters adjustment by random search, input data processed by the Yeo-Johnson transformation and selection of spectral bands by collinearity analysis. In this case, the accuracy was 0.96 with two classes, and 0.91 with 3 classes, indicating the feasibility of using this method to classify turbidity.

TI  - Comparative Analysis of the Sensitivity of SAR Data in C and L Bands for the Detection of Irrigation Events
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Comprehensive knowledge about irrigation timing is crucial for water resource management. This paper presents a comparative analysis between C- and L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data for the detection of irrigation events. The analysis was performed using C-band time series data derived from the Sentinel-1 (S1) satellite and two L-band images from the PALSAR-2 (ALOS-2) sensor acquired over irrigated grassland plots in the Crau plain of southeast France. The S1 C-band time series was first analyzed as a function of rainfall and irrigation events. The backscattering coefficients in both the L and C bands were then compared to the time difference between the date of the acquired SAR image and the date of the last irrigation event occurring before the SAR acquisition (Delta t). Sensitivity analysis was performed for 2 classes of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI <= 0.7 and NDVI > 0.7). The main results showed that when the vegetation is moderately developed (NDVI <= 0.7), the C-band temporal variation remains sensitive to the soil moisture dynamics and the irrigation events could be detected. The C-VV signal decreases due to the drying out of the soil when the time difference between the S1 image and irrigation event increases. For well-developed vegetation cover (NDVI > 0.7), the C-band sensitivity to irrigation events becomes dependent on the crop type. For well-developed Gramineae grass with longs stalks and seedheads, the C band shows no correlation with Delta t due to the absence of the soil contribution in the backscattered signal, contrary to the legume grass type, where the C band shows a good correspondence between C-VV and Delta t for NDVI > 0.7. In contrast, analysis of the L-band backscattering coefficient shows that the L band remains sensitive to the soil moisture regardless of the vegetation cover development and the vegetation characteristics, thus being more suitable for irrigation detection than the C band. The L-HH signal over Gramineae grass or legume grass types shows the same decreasing pattern with the increase in Delta t, regardless of the NDVI-values, presenting a decrease in soil moisture with time and thus high sensitivity of the radar signal to soil parameters. Finally, the co-polarizations for both the C and L bands (L-HH and C-VV) tend to be more adequate for irrigation detection than the HV cross-polarization, as they show higher sensitivity to soil moisture values.

TI  - Comparative Analysis between Two Operational Irrigation Mapping Models over Study Sites in Mediterranean and Semi-Oceanic Regions
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate information about the irrigated surface is essential to help assess the impact of irrigation on water consumption, the hydrological cycle and regional climate. In this study, we compare recently developed operational and spatially transferrable classification models proposed for irrigation mapping. The first model suggests the use of spatio-temporal soil moisture indices derived from the Sentinel-1/2 soil moisture product ((SMP)-M-2) at plot scale to map irrigated areas using the unsupervised K-means clustering algorithm (Dari model). The second model called the Sentinel-1/2 Irrigation mapping ((SIM)-I-2) is a classification model based on the use the Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) time series data. Five study cases were examined including four studied years in a semi-oceanic area in north-central France (between 2017 and 2020) and one year (2020) in a Mediterranean context in south France. Main results showed that the soil-moisture based model using K-means clustering (Dari model) performs well for irrigation mapping but remains less accurate than the (SIM)-I-2 model. The overall accuracy of the Dari model ranged between 72.1% and 78.4% across the five study cases. The Dari model was found to be limited over humid conditions as it fails to correctly distinguish rain-fed plots from irrigated plots with an accuracy of the rain-fed class reaching 24.2% only. The (SIM)-I-2 showed the best accuracy in the five study cases with an overall accuracy ranging between 72.8% and 93.0%. However, for humid climatic conditions, the (SIM)-I-2 had an accuracy of the rain-fed class reaching 62.0%. The (SIM)-I-2 is thus superior in terms of accuracy but with higher complexity for application than the Dari model that remains simple yet effective for irrigation mapping.

TI  - Aerosol Distributions and Sahara Dust Transport in Southern Morocco, from Ground-Based and Satellite Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study investigates aerosols distributions and a strong Sahara dust-storm event that occurred by early August 2018, in the South of Morocco. We used columnar aerosol optical depth (AOD), Angstrom Exponent (AE) and volume size distributions (VSD) as derived from ground-based observations by 2 AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork) sun-photometers at Saada (31.63 degrees N, 8.16 degrees W) and Ouarzazate (30.93 degrees N, 6.91 degrees W) sites, over the periods 2004-2019 and 2012-2015, respectively. The monthly seasonal distributions of AOD, AE, and VSD showed a seasonal trend dominated by the annual cycle, with a maximum aerosol load during summer (July-August) and a minimum in winter (December-January), characterized by a coarse mode near the radius of 2.59 mu m and a fine mode at the radius of 0.16 mu m, respectively. Indeed, this study showed that aerosol populations in southern Morocco are dominated by Saharan desert dust, especially during the summer season. The latter can sometimes be subject of dust-storm events. The case study presented in this paper reports on one of these events, which happened in early August 2018. The HYSPLIT (HYbrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory) model was used to simulate air-mass back-trajectories during the event. In agreement with ground-based (AERONET sun-photometers) and satellite (CALIOP, MODIS and AIRS) observations, HYSPLIT back-trajectories showed that the dust air-mass at the 4-km layer, the average height of the dust plume, has crossed southern Morocco over the Saada site, with a westward direction towards the Atlantic Ocean, before it changed northward up to the Portuguese coasts.

TI  - Spectral Unmixing Based Approach for Measuring Gas Flaring from VIIRS NTL Remote Sensing Data: Case of the Flare FIT-M8-101A-1U, Algeria
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - During the oil extraction procedure, natural gases escape from wells, and the process of recuperating such gases requires important investments from oil and gas companies. That is why, most often, they favor burning them with flares. This practice, which is frequently employed by oil-producing companies, is a major cause of greenhouse gas emissions. Under growing demands from the World Bank and environmental defenders, many producer countries are devoted to decreasing gas flaring. For this reason, several researchers in the oil and gas industry, academia, and governments are working to propose new methods for estimating flared gas volumes, and among the most used techniques are those that exploit remote sensing data, particularly Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Nighttime Light (NTL) ones. Indeed, it is possible to extract, from such data, some physical parameters of flames produced by gas flares. In this investigation, a linear spectral unmixing-based approach, which addresses the spectral variability phenomenon, was designed to estimate accurate physical parameters from VIIRS NTL data. Then, these parameters are used to derive flared gas volumes through intercepting zero polynomial regression models that exploit in situ measurements. Experiments based on synthetic data were first conducted to validate the proposed linear spectral unmixing-based approach. Second, experiments based on real VIIRS NTL data covering the flare, named FIT-M8-101A-1U and located in the Berkine basin (Hassi Messaoud) in Algeria, were carried out. Then, the obtained flared gas volumes were compared with in situ measurements.

TI  - Predicting Tree Mortality Using Spectral Indices Derived from Multispectral UAV Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Past research has shown that remotely sensed spectral information can be used to predict tree health and vitality. Recent developments in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have now made it possible to derive such information at the tree and stand scale from high-resolution imagery. We used visible and multispectral bands from UAV imagery to calculate a set of spectral indices for 52,845 individual tree crowns within 38 forest stands in western Canada. We then used those indices to predict the mortality of these canopy trees over the following year. We evaluated whether including multispectral indices leads to more accurate predictions than indices derived from visible wavelengths alone and how the performance varies among three different tree species (Picea glauca, Pinus contorta, Populus tremuloides). Our results show that spectral information can be effectively used to predict tree mortality, with a random forest model producing a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 89.8% and a balanced accuracy of 83.3%. The exclusion of multispectral indices worsened the model performance, but only slightly (AUC = 87.9%, balanced accuracy = 81.8%). We found variation in model performance among species, with higher accuracy for the broadleaf species (balanced accuracy = 85.2%) than the two conifer species (balanced accuracy = 73.3% and 77.8%). However, all models overpredicted tree mortality by a major degree, which limits the use for tree mortality predictions on an individual level. Further improvements such as long-term monitoring, the use of hyperspectral data and cost-sensitive learning algorithms, and training the model with a larger and more balanced data set are necessary. Nevertheless, our results demonstrate that imagery from UAVs has strong potential for predicting annual mortality for individual canopy trees.

TI  - A Simplified Spatial Methodology for Assessing Land Productivity Status in Africa
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The degradation of soil, vegetation and socio-economic transformations are a huge threat to Africa's land production. This study aimed to (i) assess the soil and land productivity of standing biomass and (ii) determine the effect of rainfall on the standing biomass in Eastern Africa. Soil productivity was determined using the Soil Productivity Index (SPI) and a simplified model was developed to estimate the Net Primary Productivity (NPP). The SPI indicators used included soil-organic matter, texture, soil moisture, base-saturation, pH, cation-exchange-capacity, soil-depth and drainage. The inputs of the simplified model are: MODIS Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), soil erosion, soil nutrient content and input, rainfall, land-use/cover and agro-ecological zones. The findings reveal that the countries with the most productive soils are Mauritius, Rwanda and South Sudan-while, for standing biomass, the countries with the highest spatial extent are Mauritius (97%), Rwanda (96%), Uganda (95%), South Sudan (89%), Ethiopia (47%) and Kenya (36%). Standing biomass is dominant in biomes such as natural forests, woodlands, croplands, grasslands, wetlands and tree-plantations. High land productivity was attributed to soil quality and management, land policy reforms, favourable climatic conditions and sustainable land husbandry activities. Rainfall was significantly correlated with standing biomass in most of the studied countries (p < 0.05) except Djibouti and Rwanda. Therefore, monitoring soil health, use and land reforms are key to sustaining vegetative biomass.

TI  - Evaluation of a multi-species Protein A-ELISA assay for plague serologic diagnosis in humans and other mammal hosts
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe Hemagglutination assay (HA) is widely used in plague diagnosis, however, it has a subjective interpretation and demands high amounts of antigen and other immunobiological supplies. On the other hand, the conventional Anti-IgG ELISA is limited by the need of specific conjugates for multiple plague hosts, which leaves a gap for new diagnostic methods able to cover both the diagnosis of human cases and the epidemiological surveillance of multiple sentinel species. MethodsWe developed an ELISA Protein A-peroxidase method to detect anti-F1 antibodies across several species, including humans. To determine the cut-off and performance rates, HA results from 288 samples (81 rabbits, 64 humans, 66 rodents and 77 dogs) were used as reference. Next, we evaluated the agreement between Protein A-ELISA and Anti-IgG ELISA in an expanded sample set (n = 487). ResultsOptimal conditions were found with 250ng/well of F1 and 1:500 serum dilution. Protein A-ELISA showed high repeatability and reproducibility. We observed good correlation rates between the Protein A and IgG ELISAs optical densities and a higher positive/negative OD ratio for the Protein A-ELISA method. The overall sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve for Protein A-ELISA were 94%, 99% and 0.99, respectively. Similar results were observed for each species separately. In the analysis of the expanded sample set, there was a strong agreement between Protein A and IgG assays (kappa = 0.97). Furthermore, there was no cross-reaction with other common infectious diseases, such as dengue, Zika, Chagas disease, tuberculosis (humans) and ehrlichiosis, anaplasmosis and leishmaniasis (dogs). ConclusionsAltogether, the Protein A-ELISA showed high performance when compared both to HA and Anti-IgG ELISA, with a polyvalent single protocol that requires reduced amounts of antigen and can be employed to any plague hosts.Author summaryHere, we developed and evaluated an ELISA diagnostic test based on the Protein A-peroxidase conjugate that allows the test to be used for plague laboratorial diagnosis not only in humans, but also in a wide range of mammalian species. This particularity is specifically important for plague epidemiological surveillance, given that Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague, have a long list of animal reservoirs across distinct ecosystems. Briefly, we first evaluated the best reaction parameters, such as antigen concentration, serum and protein A-conjugate dilutions. Next, we used serum samples from humans, dogs, rodents and rabbits (n = 288) with known results for plague serology by a conventional method, to evaluate the performance of the new Protein A-ELISA test. We observed a good performance of the novel Protein A-ELISA test, with high sensitivity and specificity rates. Evaluation of the coefficient of variation revealed that the test measurements suffer little variation, and therefore, has high repeatability and reproducibility. Next, by evaluating 487 samples, we observed a high degree of concordance between the Protein A-ELISA with a conventional IgG-based ELISA. Furthermore, this test showed no significant cross-reaction with other common infectious diseases. Altogether, the Protein A-ELISA showed high performance when compared both to HA and Anti-IgG ELISA, with a single protocol that requires reduced amounts of antigen and can be employed to several plague hosts.

TI  - Nitrogenous and carbonaceous aerosols in PM 2.5 and TSP during pre-monsoon: Characteristics and sources in the highly polluted mountain valley
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study reports for the first time a comprehensive analysis of nitrogenous and carbonaceous aerosols in simultaneously collected PM 2.5 and TSP during pre-monsoon (March-May 2018) from a highly polluted urban Kathmandu Valley (KV) of the Himalayan foothills. The mean mass concentration of PM 2.5 (129.8 mu g/m 3 ) was only tilde 25% of TSP mass (558.7 mu g/ m 3 ) indicating the dominance of coarser mode aerosols. However, the mean concentration as well as fractional contributions of water-soluble total nitrogen (WSTN) and carbonaceous species reveal their predominance in find-mode aerosols. The mean mass concentration of WSTN was 17.43 +4.70 mu g/m 3 (14%) in PM 2.5 and 24.64 +8.07 mu g/m 3 (5%) in TSP. Moreover, the fractional contribution of total carbonaceous aerosols (TCA) is much higher in PM 2.5 ( tilde 34%) than that in TSP ( tilde 20%). The relatively low OC/EC ratio in PM 2.5 (3.03 + 1.47) and TSP (4.64 + 1.73) suggests fossil fuel combustion as the major sources of carbonaceous aerosols with contributions from secondary organic aerosols. Five-day air mass back trajectories simulated with the HYSPLIT model, together with MODIS fire counts indicate the influence of local emissions as well as transported pollutants from the Indo-Gangetic Plain region to the south of the Himalayan foothills. Principal component analysis (PCA) also suggests a mixed contribution from other local anthropogenic, biomass burning, and crustal sources. Our results highlight that it is necessary to control local emissions as well as regional transport while designing mitigation measures to reduce the KV's air pollution.

TI  - Evapotranspiration Seasonality over Tropical Ecosystems in Mato Grosso, Brazil
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazilian tropical ecosystems in the state of Mato Grosso have experienced significant land use and cover changes during the past few decades due to deforestation and wildfire. These changes can directly affect the mass and energy exchange near the surface and, consequently, evapotranspiration (ET). Characterization of the seasonal patterns of ET can help in understanding how these tropical ecosystems function with a changing climate. The goal of this study was to characterize temporal (seasonal-to-decadal) and spatial patterns in ET over Mato Grosso using remotely sensed products. Ecosystems over areas with limited to no flux towers can be performed using remote sensing products such as NASA's MOD16A2 ET (MOD16 ET). As the accuracy of this product in tropical ecosystems is unknown, a secondary objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of the MOD16 ET (ETMODIS) to appropriately represent the spatial and seasonal ET patterns in Mato Grosso, Brazil. Actual ET was measured (ETMeasured) using eight flux towers, three in the Amazon, three in the Cerrado, and two in the Pantanal of Mato Grosso. In general, the ETMODIS of all sites had no significant difference from ETMeasured during all analyzed periods, and ETMODIS had a significant moderate to strong correlation with the ETMeasured. The spatial variation of ET had some similarity to the climatology of Mato Grosso, with higher ET in the mid to southern parts of Mato Grosso (Cerrado and Pantanal) during the wet period compared to the dry period. The ET in the Amazon had three seasonal patterns, a higher and lower ET in the wet season compared to the dry season, and minimal to insignificant variation in ET during the wet and dry seasons. The wet season ET in Amazon decreased from the first and second decades, but the ET during the wet and dry season increased in Cerrado and Pantanal in the same period. This study highlights the importance of deepening the study of ET in the state of Mato Grosso due to the land cover and climate change.

TI  - Analysis of Two Convective Storms Using Polarimetric X-Band Radar and Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We analyzed two convective storms that passed over or near the Milesovka meteorological observatory. The observatory is located at the top of a hill and has been recently equipped with a Doppler polarimetric X-band radar FURUNO WR2120 for cloud investigations. Our analysis was based mainly on Doppler polarimetric radar data measured in vertical cross-sections (RHI-Range-Height Indicator). Radar data was also used for classifying hydrometeors by a newly developed XCLASS (X-band radar CLASSification) algorithm. We also used rapid scan data measured by the geostationary satellite Meteosat Second Generation to validate radar measurements at the upper parts of storms. Although an attenuation correction was applied to the reflectivity and differential reflectivity measurements, the attenuation typical of X-band radars was noticeable. It was mainly manifested in the differential reflectivity, co-polar correlation coefficient and specific differential phase. Nevertheless, radar measurements can be used to analyze the internal cloud structure of severe convective storms. The XCLASS classification was developed by major innovation of a previously published algorithm. The XCLASS algorithm identifies seven types of hydrometeors: light rain, rain, wet snow, dry snow, ice, graupel, and hail. It uses measured horizontal and vertical radar reflectivity, specific differential phase, co-polar correlation coefficient, and temperature, and applies fuzzy logic to determine the type of hydrometeor. The new algorithm practically eliminates unrealistic results around and below the melting layer provided by the original algorithm. It identifies wet snow in more cases, and areas with individual hydrometeors have more realistic shapes compared to the original algorithm. The XCLASS algorithm shows reasonable results for the classification of hydrometeors and can be used to study the structure of convective storms.

TI  - Estimation of Postfire Reforestation with SAR Polarimetry and NDVI Time Series
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - This communication is devoted to the methodology of remote complex analysis of forest restoration after strong wildfires. It is proposed to quantify the projective leaf/needles area index by multispectral optical images. The increase in dimensions of trunks and branches commensurate with a radar wavelength of 24 cm is estimated using radar polarimetric data. It is shown that the growth's potential of aboveground biomass in different spots of test site ranges from 35 to 70% in the case under consideration. Such a new approach will make it possible to further consider more accurately the role of boreal forests as one of the largest carbon stocks.

TI  - Comparing Coarse-Resolution Land Surface Temperature Products over Western Australia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-derived land surface temperature (LST) has commonly been used to monitor global temperature changes. The MODIS MYD11A2 product is the most common coarse-resolution product used for this purpose. An updated MODIS product (MYD21A2) and new VIIRS (VNP21A2) product have also recently become available. This study analyses eight-day, quality-controlled, LST imagery over Western Australia (WA) for the three products for an urban and a non-urban area for the years 2013, 2016, and 2019. An analysis of the data indicates that (i) the averaged daytime LST difference between the three products for Perth city over the three years was 1.32 degrees C, while at night it was 0.89 degrees C; (ii) the averaged daytime difference over the Kimberley region was 7.02 degrees C with a night average difference of 2.39 degrees C; and (iii) both the MYD21A2 and VNP21A2 products still appear to record anomalous monthly LST values, particularly in the humid Kimberley monsoonal months. The overall objective of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is to ensure that the LST values of the two satellite system products are comparable, so evidence of LST value differences will require further investigation, especially if the older product is to be replaced by the newer systems.

TI  - Green Area Index and Soil Moisture Retrieval in Maize Fields Using Multi-Polarized C- and L-Band SAR Data and the Water Cloud Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The green area index (GAI) and the soil moisture under the canopy are two key variables for agricultural monitoring. The current most accurate GAI estimation methods exploit optical data and are rendered ineffective in the case of frequent cloud cover. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) measurements could allow the remote estimation of both variables at the parcel level, on a large scale and regardless of clouds. In this study, several methods were implemented and tested for the simultaneous estimation of both variables using the water cloud model (WCM) and dual-polarized radar backscatter measurements. The methods were tested on the BELSAR-Campaign data set consisting of in-situ measurements of bio-geophysical variables of vegetation and soil in maize fields combined with multi-polarized C- and L-band SAR data from Sentinel-1 and BELSAR. Accurate GAI estimates were obtained using a random forest regressor for the inversion of a pair of WCMs calibrated using cross and vertical co-polarized SAR data in L- and C-band, with correlation coefficients of 0.79 and 0.65 and RMSEs of 0.77 m(2) m(-2) and 0.98 m(2) m(-2), respectively, between estimates and in-situ measurements. The WCM, however, proved inadequate for soil moisture monitoring in the conditions of the campaign. These promising results indicate that GAI retrieval in maize crops using only dual-polarized radar data could successfully substitute for estimates derived from optical data.

TI  - Conjunctival Melanocytic Lesions
T2  - ARCHIVES OF PATHOLOGY & LABORATORY MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - center dot Context.-Conjunctival melanocytic lesions consist of a variety of neoplastic and nonneoplastic conditions. These include benign processes such as primary intraepithelial hypermelanosis and melanocytic hyperplasia, secondary forms of intraepithelial hypermelanosis and melanocytic hyperplasia, melanocytic nevi, melanocytic proliferations with malignant potential, and melanoma. Objective.-To provide a concise yet comprehensive resource regarding the histopathologic diagnosis of con-junctival melanocytic lesions. We aim to detail and clarify the numerous classification schemes that exist for junc-tional melanocytic proliferations of the conjunctiva (known as primary acquired melanosis or PAM; also termed conjunctival melanocytic intraepithelial neoplasia or C-MIN). Although not uniformly adopted, C-MIN is classified by using a numeric system based on a defined set of criteria. A less complex scheme (conjunctival melano-cytic intraepithelial lesion or CMIL) has recently been proposed by the World Health Organization. Additionally, we aim to update the reader regarding molecular features and prognostic indicators. Data Sources.-Peer-reviewed literature and archived cases for illustration. Conclusions.-Accurate histologic classification is es-sential, as PAM/C-MIN/CMILs that have a significant potential to progress to invasive melanoma may be clinically indistinguishable from low-risk lesions. Conjunc-tival melanoma (CM) more closely resembles cutaneous melanoma in terms of its pathogenesis and molecular features, compared to melanoma arising at other mucosal sites or to uveal melanoma. Depth of invasion and ulceration status, among other factors, have emerged as important prognostic indicators in CM. Sentinel lymph node biopsy may provide further prognostic information. Lastly, integration of pathologic and clinical findings is essential at this anatomically sensitive location to deter-mine appropriate clinical management.

TI  - Investigating Relationships between Runoff-Erosion Processes and Land Use and Land Cover Using Remote Sensing Multiple Gridded Datasets
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate variability, land use and land cover changes (LULCC) have a considerable impact on runoff-erosion processes. This study analyzed the relationships between climate variability and spatiotemporal LULCC on runoff-erosion processes in different scenarios of land use and land cover (LULC) for the Almas River basin, located in the Cerrado biome in Brazil. Landsat images from 1991, 2006, and 2017 were used to analyze changes and the LULC scenarios. Two simulations based on the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) were compared: (1) default application using the standard model database (SWATd), and (2) application using remote sensing multiple gridded datasets (albedo and leaf area index) downloaded using the Google Earth Engine (SWATrs). In addition, the SWAT model was applied to analyze the impacts of streamflow and erosion in two hypothetical scenarios of LULC. The first scenario was the optimistic scenario (OS), which represents the sustainable use and preservation of natural vegetation, emphasizing the recovery of permanent preservation areas close to watercourses, hilltops, and mountains, based on the Brazilian forest code. The second scenario was the pessimistic scenario (PS), which presents increased deforestation and expansion of farming activities. The results of the LULC changes show that between 1991 and 2017, the area occupied by agriculture and livestock increased by 75.38%. These results confirmed an increase in the sugarcane plantation and the number of cattle in the basin. The SWAT results showed that the difference between the simulated streamflow for the PS was 26.42%, compared with the OS. The sediment yield average estimation in the PS was 0.035 ton/ha/year, whereas in the OS, it was 0.025 ton/ha/year (i.e., a decrease of 21.88%). The results demonstrated that the basin has a greater predisposition for increased streamflow and sediment yield due to the LULC changes. In addition, measures to contain the increase in agriculture should be analyzed by regional managers to reduce soil erosion in this biome.

TI  - Radiotherapy instead of axillary lymph node dissection: evaluation of axillary lymph node dose coverage with whole breast radiotherapy
T2  - REPORTS OF PRACTICAL ONCOLOGY AND RADIOTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The purpose of this study was to investigate the dose coverage of sentinel lymph nodes (SLN), level I, II and III axillary volumes from tangent fields for breast cancer patients with positive SLN without axillary dissection. Materials and methods: In 30 patients with cN0 invasive breast cancer treated with breast conserving surgery and SLN biopsy, the SLN area was intraoperatively marked with a titanium clip. Retrospectively, the SLN area and axillary target volumes were contoured, and three plans [standard tangent fields (STgF), high tangent fields (HTgF), and STgF + axillary-supraclavicular field] were generated for each patient. The prescribed dose was standardized to 50 Gy in 2 Gy fractions to the isocenter. Results: The mean dose with STgF or HTgF was 33.1 and 49.1 Gy (p = 0.0001) in the SLN area, 25.7 and 45.1 Gy (p < 0.0001) in the volume of level I, 7.2 and 28.9 Gy (p < 0.0001) in the level II and 3.5 and 12.7 Gy (p = 0.0003) in the level III. Adequate therapeutic doses to the level II or III volumes were delivered only with STgF + axillary-supraclavicular field. The mean dose of ipsilateral lung was the highest with the three-field-technique, 9.9 Gy. SLN area, level I, II or III were completely included in the HTgF with 93.3%, 73.3%, 13.3% and 0%, respectively. Conclusions: SLN area should be marked by surgical clip and axillary target volumes should be contoured to obtain accurate dose estimations. The use of HTgF improve axillary coverage.

TI  - Bayesian Cloud Detection over Land for Climate Data Records
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud detection is a necessary step in the generation of land surface temperature (LST) climate data records (CDRs) and affects data quality and uncertainty. We present here a sensor-independent Bayesian cloud detection algorithm and show that it is suitable for use in the production of LST CDRs. We evaluate the performance of the cloud detection with reference to two manually masked datasets for the Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) and find a 7.9% increase in the hit rate and 4.9% decrease in the false alarm rate when compared to the operational cloud mask. We then apply the algorithm to four instruments aboard polar-orbiting satellites, which together can produce a global, 25-year LST CDR: the second Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR-2), AATSR, the Moderate Resolution Spectroradiometer (MODIS Terra) and the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR-A). The Bayesian cloud detection hit rate is assessed with respect to in situ ceilometer measurements for periods of overlap between sensors. The consistency of the hit rate is assessed between sensors, with mean differences in the cloud hit rate of 4.5% for ATSR-2 vs. AATSR, 4.9% for AATSR vs. MODIS, and 2.5% for MODIS vs. SLSTR-A. This is important because consistent cloud detection performance is needed for the observational stability of a CDR. The application of a sensor-independent cloud detection scheme in the production of CDRs is thus shown to be a viable approach to achieving LST observational stability over time.

TI  - Landsat-8 Sea Ice Classification Using Deep Neural Networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowing the location and type of sea ice is essential for safe navigation and route optimization in ice-covered areas. In this study, we developed a deep neural network (DNN) for pixel-based ice Stage of Development classification for the Baltic Sea using Landsat-8 optical satellite imagery to provide up-to-date ice information for Near-Real-Time maritime applications. In order to train the network, we labeled the ice regions shown in the Landsat-8 imagery with classes from the German Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH) ice charts. These charts are routinely produced and distributed by the BSH Sea Ice Department. The compiled data set for the Baltic Sea region consists of 164 ice charts from 2014 to 2021 and contains ice types classified by the Stage of Development. Landsat-8 level 1 (L1b) images that could be overlaid with the available BSH ice charts based on the time of acquisition were downloaded from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) global archive and indexed in a data cube for better handling. The input variables of the DNN are the individual spectral bands: aerosol coastal, blue, green, red and near-infrared (NIR) out of the Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensor. The bands were selected based on the reflectance and emission properties of sea ice. The output values are 4 ice classes of Stage of Development and Ice Free. The results obtained show significant improvements compared to the available BSH ice charts when moving from polygons to pixels, preserving the original classes. The classification model has an accuracy of 87.5% based on the test data set excluded from the training and validation process. Using optical imagery can therefore add value to maritime safety and navigation in ice- infested waters by high resolution and real-time availability. Furthermore, the obtained results can be extended to other optical satellite imagery such as Sentinel-2. Our approach is promising for automated Near-Real-Time (NRT) services, which can be deployed and integrated at a later stage at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) ground station in Neustrelitz.

TI  - Comparative Study on Potential Landslide Identification with ALOS-2 and Sentinel-1A Data in Heavy Forest Reach, Upstream of the Jinsha River
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Many SAR satellites such as the ALOS-2 satellite and Sentinel-1A satellite can be used in Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) to identify landslides. As their wavelengths are different, they can perform differently in the same area. In this study, we selected the alpine canyon heavy forest area of the Baishugong-Shangjiangxiang section of the Jinsha River with a strong uplift of faults and folds as the study area. The Small Baseline Subset (SBAS)-InSAR was used for landslide identification to compare the reliability and applicability of L-band ALOS-2 data and C-band Sentinel-1A data. In total, 13 potential landslides were identified, of which 12 potential landslides were identified by ALOS-2 data, two landslides were identified by Sentinel-1A data, and the Kongzhigong (KZG) landslide was identified by both datasets. Then, the field investigation was used to verify the identification results and analyze the genetic mechanism of four typical landslides. Both the Duila (DL) and KZG landslides are bedding slip, while the Jirenhe (JRH) and Maopo (MP) landslides are creep-pull failure. Then, the difference between ALOS-2 and Sentinel-1A data on KZG landslide was compared. A total of 35,961 deformation points on the KZG landslide were obtained using ALOS-2 data, which are relatively dense. Meanwhile, a total of 7715 deformation points were obtained by Sentinel-1A data, which are relatively scattered and seriously lacking, especially in areas with dense vegetation coverage. Comparing the advantages of ALOS-2 and Sentinel-1A data and the identification results of potential landslides, the reliability and applicability of ALOS-2 data in the identification of potential landslides in areas with dense vegetation cover and complex geological conditions were confirmed from the aspects of vegetation cover, topography, field investigation, and comparative analysis of typical landslides.

TI  - Rafael Halperin's Contribution to Israel's Emerging Body Culture
T2  - SPORT HISTORY REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - The concept of ???muscular Judaism??? coined by Max Nordau has been interpreted in different ways. For Nordau, the image of a Jew standing fit was a rebuttal to antiSemites and the answer to Jews??? unmet aspirations for a national home. In practical terms, ???muscular Judaism??? translated into excellence in sport. As athletes, the Jews could make their mark and move from the fringes of society into the mainstream. This concept evolved over the years, reflecting changing times, shifts in global thinking and national needs. After the establishment of the state, Israeli society underwent a process of Americanization that was accompanied by a new understanding of muscular Judaism and body image. This article discusses three physical fitness trends that redefined the concept of muscular Judaism: gym training, bodybuilding, and catch wrestling. These were rooted in the American aesthetic ideal, a far cry from the ideology and collective socialist worldview prevalent in Israel.

TI  - Mapping Three Decades of Changes in the Tropical Andean Glaciers Using Landsat Data Processed in the Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The fast retreat of the tropical Andean glaciers (TAGs) is considered an important indicator of climate change impact on the tropics, since the TAGs provide resources to highly vulnerable mountain populations. This study aims to reconstruct the glacier coverage of the TAGs, using Landsat time-series images from 1985 to 2020, by digitally processing and classifying satellite images in the Google Earth Engine platform. We used annual reductions of the Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) and spectral bands to capture the pixels with minimum snow cover. We also implemented temporal and spatial filters to have comparable maps at a multitemporal level and reduce noise and temporal inconsistencies. The results of the multitemporal analysis of this study confirm the recent and dramatic recession of the TAGs in the last three decades, in base to physical and statistical significance. The TAGs reduced from 2429.38 km(2) to 1409.11 km(2) between 1990 and 2020, representing a loss of 42% of the total glacier area. In addition, the time-series analysis showed more significant losses at altitudes below 5000 masl, and differentiated changes by slope, latitude, and longitude. We found a more significant percentage loss of glacier areas in countries with less coverage. The multiannual validation showed accuracy values of 92.81%, 96.32%, 90.32%, 97.56%, and 88.54% for the metrics F1 score, accuracy, kappa, precision, and recall, respectively. The results are an essential contribution to understanding the TAGs and guiding policies to mitigate climate change and the potential negative impact of freshwater shortage on the inhabitants and food production in the Andean region.

TI  - Estimating Soil Moisture over Winter Wheat Fields during Growing Season Using RADARSAT-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture content (SMC) is a significant factor affecting crop growth and development. However, SMC estimation, based on synthetic aperture radar (SAR), is influenced by a variety of surface parameters, such as vegetation cover and surface roughness. As a result, determining the SMC across agricultural areas (e.g., wheat fields) remotely (i.e., without ground measurement) is difficult to achieve. In this study, a model-based polarization decomposition method was used to decompose the original SAR signal into different scattering components that represented different scattering mechanisms. The different volume scattering models were applied, and then the results were compared in order to remove the scattering contribution from vegetation canopy, and extract the surface scattering components related to the soil moisture. Finally, by combining extensively used surface scattering models (e.g., CIEM and Dubois), and a method of roughness parameters optimization, a lookup table was developed to estimate the soil moisture during the wheat growth period. When CIEM is applied, the R-2 and RMSE of the SMC are 0.534, 5.62 vol.%, and for the Dubois model, 0.634, 5.16 vol.%, respectively, which indicates that this approach provides good estimation performance for measuring soil moisture during the wheat growing season.

TI  - Tea Cultivation Suitability Evaluation and Driving Force Analysis Based on AHP and Geodetector Results: A Case Study of Yingde in Guangdong, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tea is an economically important crop. Evaluating the suitability of tea can better optimize the regional layout of the tea industry and provide a scientific basis for tea planting plans, which is also conducive to the sustainable development of the tea industry in the long run. Driving force analysis can be carried out to better understand the main influencing factors of tea growth. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the suitability of tea planting in the study area, determine the prioritization of tea industry development in this area, and provide support for the government's planning and decision making. This study used Sentinel image data to obtain the current land use data of the study area. The results show that the accuracy of tea plantation classification based on Sentinel images reached 86%, and the total accuracy reached 92%. Then, we selected 14 factors, including climate, soil, terrain, and human-related factors, using the analytic hierarchy process and spatial analysis technology to evaluate the suitability of tea cultivation in the study area and obtain a comprehensive potential distribution map of tea cultivation. The results show that the moderately suitable area (36.81%) accounted for the largest proportion of the tea plantation suitability evaluation, followed by the generally suitable area (31.40%), the highly suitable area (16.91%), and the unsuitable area (16.23%). Among these areas, the highly suitable area is in line with the distribution of tea cultivation at the Yingde municipal level. Finally, to better analyze the contribution of each factor to the suitability of tea, the factors were quantitatively evaluated by the Geodetector model. The most important factors affecting the tea cultivation suitability evaluation were temperature (0.492), precipitation (0.367), slope (0.302), and elevation (0.255). Natural factors influence the evaluation of the suitability of tea cultivation, and the influence of human factors is relatively minor. This study provides an important scientific basis for tea yield policy formulation, tea plantation site selection, and adaptation measures.

TI  - Improving Spatial Disaggregation of Crop Yield by Incorporating Machine Learning with Multisource Data: A Case Study of Chinese Maize Yield
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatially explicit crop yield datasets with continuous long-term series are essential for understanding the spatiotemporal variation of crop yield and the impact of climate change on it. There are several spatial disaggregation methods to generate gridded yield maps, but these either use an oversimplified approach with only a couple of ancillary data or an overly complex approach with limited flexibility and scalability. This study developed a spatial disaggregation method using improved spatial weights generated from machine learning. When applied to Chinese maize yield, extreme gradient boosting (XGB) derived the best prediction results, with a cross-validation coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.81 at the municipal level. The disaggregated yield at 1 km grids could explain 54% of the variance of the county-level statistical yield, which is superior to the existing gridded maize yield dataset in China. At the site level, the disaggregated yields also showed much better agreement with observations than the existing gridded maize yield dataset. This lightweight method is promising for generating spatially explicit crop yield datasets with finer resolution and higher accuracy, and for providing necessary information for maize production risk assessment in China under climate change.

TI  - Application of Cosmic-Ray Neutron Sensor Method to Calculate Field Water Use Efficiency
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Field water use efficiency is an important parameter for evaluating the quality of field irrigation in irrigated areas, which directly affects the country's food security and water resource allocation. However, most current studies use point-scale soil moisture (SM) or remote sensing water balance models to calculate the field water use coefficient, which cannot avoid errors caused by the spatial heterogeneity of SM and insufficient spatial resolution of remote sensing data. Therefore, in this study, the cosmic-ray neutron sensor (CRNS), Time-Domain Reflectometers (TDR) and Automatic Weather Stations (AWS) were used to monitor the meteorological and hydrological data such as SM, atmospheric pressure, and precipitation in the experimental area of Jinghuiqu Irrigation District for three consecutive years. The scale of the CRNS SM lies between the point and the remote sensing. Based on the CRNS SM, the calculation method for canal head and tail water was used to calculate the field water use efficiency to evaluate the level of agricultural irrigation water use in the experimental irrigation area. The results showed that CRNS could accurately detect the change in SM, and four irrigation events were monitored during the winter wheat growth period from October 2018 to June 2019; the calculation result of field water use efficiency in the experimental area was 0.77. According to the field water use efficiency of the same irrigation area from October 2013 to October 2015 in other studies, the field water use efficiency during the growing period of winter wheat in this area increased from 0.503 to 0.770 in 2013-2019, indicating a significant improvement in the field water use level. In general, this study not only solves the problem of low calculation accuracy of field water use efficiency caused by the mismatch of SM monitoring scales but also explores the application potential of CRNS in agricultural irrigation management and water resource allocation.

TI  - Atmospheric Severe Convective Events in Russia: Changes Observed from Different Data
T2  - RUSSIAN METEOROLOGY AND HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in the frequency and intensity of atmospheric severe convective events, including heavy rainfall, thunderstorm, hailstorm, squall, and tornado, in the Russian regions during the warm season are analyzed using different independent sources of information. Based on observations at Russian weather stations in 1966-2020, the frequency of thunderstorm, hailstorm, and strong wind, the contribution of extreme showers to total precipitation, and the cumulonimbus cloud fraction are estimated. Based on satellite data, the frequency and intensity of tornado and squall events that caused windthrows for 1986-2021 and the height of the top of deep convective clouds for 2002-2021 are also evaluated. The ERA5 reanalysis data are used to analyze the frequency of conditions favorable for the development of moderate and intense severe convective events in 1979-2020. The results indicate a general intensification of severe convective events in most Russian regions, except for a number of regions in the south of the European part of Russia. The frequency of moderate hazards has a decreasing trend, and the frequency of the most intense severe hazards has an increasing trend. It is reasonable to take the results into account when developing plans for the adaptation of Russian regions and industries to climate change.

TI  - Clinical and neurocognitive outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) with cerebral protection: initial experience with a novel dual-filter device in Southeast Asia
T2  - SINGAPORE MEDICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is increasingly performed in patients with severe aortic stenosis. A novel dual-filter system to reduce cerebral embolism during TAVI recently became available. We aimed to assess the feasibility, safety, and clinical and neurocognitive outcomes of TAVI with cerebral protection in Asian patients. METHODS 40 consecutive patients undergoing TAVI with cerebral protection were enrolled. All procedures were performed via femoral access using the self-expanding Evolut R/PRO or Portico, or the balloon-expandable SAPIEN 3 bioprostheses. Baseline characteristics, procedural and clinical outcomes were recorded. Cognition was assessed at baseline and 30 days using the abbreviated mental test (AMT). RESULTS The mean age of the patients (75% male) was 76.4 +/- 8.4 years. TAVI was uncomplicated in all patients. The filter device was successfully deployed in 38 (95.0%) patients without safety issues. There was no stroke or death at 30 days, and the survival rate at nine months was 95.0%. There was no overall cognitive change (baseline vs. 30-day AMT: 9.2 +/- 1.1 vs. 9.0 +/- 1.5, p = 0.12), and only 1 (2.5%) patient developed impaired cognition at 30 days. Patients with a decreased AMT score at 30 days were significantly older than those without (82.1 +/- 4.5 vs. 74.4 +/- 7.7 years, p = 0.019). All patients with decreased AMT scores were aged >= 76 years. CONCLUSION In this early Asian experience of TAVI under cerebral protection, the filter device was successfully deployed in 95% of patients, with 100% procedural success. There were no filter-related complications and no stroke or mortality at 30 days. Overall cognition was preserved, although increased age was associated with a decline in AMT score.

TI  - Using Objective Analysis for the Assimilation of Satellite-Derived Aerosol Products to Improve PM<sub>2</sub><sub>.5</sub> Predictions over Europe
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - We used the objective analysis method in conjunction with the successive correction method to assimilate MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) data into the Chimere model in order to improve the modeling of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations and AOD field over Europe. A data assimilation module was developed to adjust the daily initial total column aerosol concentrations based on a forecast-analysis cycling scheme. The model is then evaluated during one-month winter period to examine how such a data assimilation technique pushes the model results closer to surface observations. This comparison showed that the mean biases of both surface PM2.5 concentrations and the AOD field could be reduced from -34 to -15% and from -45 to -27%. The assimilation, however, leads to false alarms because of the difficulty in distributing AOD(550) over different particle sizes. The impact of the influence radius is found to be small and depends on the density of satellite data. This work, although preliminary, is important in terms of near-real time air quality forecasting using the Chimere model and can be further developed to improve modeled PM2.5 and ozone concentrations.

TI  - Marine Litter Detection by Sentinel-2: A Case Study in North Adriatic (Summer 2020)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aggregates of floating materials detected in North Adriatic in six Sentinel-2 scenes of August 2020 have been investigated. Most of the floating materials were identified by the chlorophyll red edge and consisted of vegetal materials, probably conveyed by rivers and exchanged with the lagoons. Traces of marine litter were looked for in the spectral anomalies of the Red Edge bands, assuming changes of the red edge in pixels where marine litter was mixed with vegetal materials. About half of the detected patches were unclassified due to the weakness of the useful signal (pixel filling percentage < 25%). The classification produced 59% of vegetal materials, 16% of marine litter mixed with vegetal materials and 22% of intermediate cases. A small percentage (2%) was attributed to submerged vegetal materials, found in isolated patches. The previous percentages were obtained with a separation criterion based on arbitrary thresholds. The patches were more concentrated at the mouths of the northern rivers, less off the Venice lagoon, and very few outside the Po River, with the minimal river outflow during the period. Sentinel-2 is a valid tool for the discrimination of marine litter in aggregates of floating matter. The proposed method requires validation, and the North Adriatic is an excellent site for field work, as in summer many patches of floating matter form in proximity to the coast.

TI  - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Antibody Seroprevalence in Decedents Undergoing Forensic Postmortem Examination: Feasibility for \nReal-Time Pandemic Surveillance
T2  - OPEN FORUM INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence was 16% among Maryland decedents undergoing forensic postmortem examination (May-November 2020). Hispanic ethnicity and motor vehicle deaths were associated with seropositivity. Estimates in decedents exemplify feasible/real-time data for disease spread and potential sentinel surveillance meriting exploration.Background Population-based seroprevalence studies offer comprehensive characterization of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread, but barriers exist and marginalized populations may not be captured. We assessed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody seroprevalence among decedents in Maryland over 6 months in 2020. Methods Data were collected on decedents undergoing forensic postmortem examination in Maryland from 24 May through 30 November 2020 from whom a blood specimen could be collected. Those with available blood specimens were tested with the CoronaCHEK lateral flow antibody assay. We assessed monthly seroprevalence compared to the statewide estimated number of cases and proportion of positive test results (testing positivity). We used Poisson regression with robust variance to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations of demographic characteristics, homelessness, and manner of death with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Results Among 1906 decedents, 305 (16%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Monthly seroprevalence increased from 11% to 22% over time and was consistently higher than state-level estimates of testing positivity. Hispanic ethnicity was associated with 2- to 3.2-fold higher seropositivity (P < .05) irrespective of sex. Deaths due to motor vehicle crash were associated with 62% increased seropositivity (aPR, 1.62 [95% CI, 1.15-2.28]) vs natural manner of death. Though seroprevalence was lower in decedents of illicit drug overdose vs nonoverdose in early months, this shifted, and seroprevalence was comparable by November 2020. Conclusions Decedents undergoing forensic postmortem examination, especially those dying due to motor vehicle trauma, may be a sentinel population for COVID-19 spread in the general population and merits exploration in other states/regions.

TI  - Significant Loss of Ecosystem Services by Environmental Changes in the Mediterranean Coastal Area
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mediterranean coastal areas are among the most threated forest ecosystems in the northern hemisphere due to concurrent biotic and abiotic stresses. These may affect plants functionality and, consequently, their capacity to provide ecosystem services. In this study, we integrated ground-level and satellite-level measurements to estimate the capacity of a 46.3 km(2) Estate to sequestrate air pollutants from the atmosphere, transported to the study site from the city of Rome. By means of a multi-layer canopy model, we also evaluated forest capacity to provide regulatory ecosystem services. Due to a significant loss in forest cover, estimated by satellite data as -6.8% between 2014 and 2020, we found that the carbon sink capacity decreased by 34% during the considered period. Furthermore, pollutant deposition on tree crowns has reduced by 39%, 46% and 35% for PM, NO2 and O-3, respectively. Our results highlight the importance of developing an integrated approach combining ground measurements, modelling and satellite data to link air quality and plant functionality as key elements to improve the effectiveness of estimate of ecosystem services.

T2  - Actas dermo-sifiliograficas
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: No recent data on health care resources and medical and surgical activity in Spanish dermatology departments are available in the literature. The aim of this study was to compile this information for 2019.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cross-sectional study based on an online survey sent to the heads of dermatology departments at public hospitals in Spain.RESULTS: Of the 162 department heads contacted, 59 answered the survey (participation rate, 36.4%). General findings included a shortage of staff, especially dermatologists, in hospitals of low and medium complexity. The main reason given for the shortage of dermatologists was a lack of interested applicants. Large hospital complexes had more infrastructure and equipment. Over 50% of the departments surveyed used a combination of in-person and virtual visits. Psoriasis units were the most common specialized care units. Approximately 75% of the hospitals had operating rooms with an anesthetist. More complex procedures such as sentinel lymph node biopsy and Mohs micrographic surgery were performed more often in large hospital complexes. Hospitalization and the presence of dermatology residents working call shifts were also more common in these hospitals. Teaching and research activity differed according to hospital complexity.CONCLUSIONS: We have mapped health care resource availability and medical and surgical activity in Spanish dermatology departments prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings could be useful for improving clinical management and defining future actions and areas for improvement.

TI  - Temperature Mediates the Dynamic of MODIS NPP in Alpine Grassland on the Tibetan Plateau, 2001-2019
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although alpine grassland net primary productivity (NPP) plays an important role in balancing the carbon cycle and is extremely vulnerable to climate factors, on the Tibetan Plateau, the generalized effect of climate factors on the NPP in areas with humid and arid conditions is still unknown. Hence, we determined the effects of precipitation and temperature on the MODIS NPP in alpine grassland areas from 2001 to 2019 according to information from humid and arid climatic regions. On a spatial scale, we found that temperature generated a larger effect on the NPP than precipitation did in humid regions, but as a primary factor, precipitation had an impact on the NPP in arid regions. These results suggest that temperature and precipitation are the primary limiting factors for plant growth in humid and arid regions. We also found that temperature produced a greater effect on the NPP in humid regions than in arid regions, but no significant differences were observed in the effects of precipitation on the NPP in humid and arid regions. In a time series (2001-2019), the effects of precipitation and temperature on the NPP presented fluctuating decrease (R-2 = 0.28, p < 0.05) and increase (R-2 = 0.24, p < 0.05) trends in arid regions. However, the effect of the climate on the NPP remained stable in humid regions. In both humid and arid regions, the dynamics of the NPP from 2001 to 2019 were mediated by an increase in temperature. Specifically, 35.9% and 2.57% of the dynamic NPP in humid regions and 45.1 and 7.53% of the dynamic NPP in arid regions were explained by variations in the temperature and precipitation, respectively. Our findings highlighted that grassland areas in humid regions can adapt to dynamic climates, but plants in arid regions are sensitive to changes in the climate. These findings can increase our understanding of climate and ecological responses and provide a framework for adapting management practices.

TI  - Hyperspectral Wave Band Selection Based on Golden Sine and Chaotic Spotted Hyena Optimizer Algorithm
T2  - LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wave band selection is an effective means to reduce the dimension and much redundancy of hyperspectral data, and it is an important prerequisite for pixel classification of hyperspectral images. It is a complex combinatorial optimization problem in essence, and it is difficult to get satisfactory solution by traditional search methods. To solve the above problems, a method of hyperspectral band selection based on golden sine and chaotic the spotted hyena optimization algorithm (GSSHO) is proposed. Firstly, chaos strategy is used to initialize the spotted hyena population to improve the randomness and diversity of the population. Secondly, golden sine algorithm is used to improve the original spotted hyena optimization (SHO) algorithm to search individual position update mode to improve the global search ability of the algorithm. Finally, a fitness function combining classification accuracy and band number is designed to evaluate the optimization performance of the algorithm. On hyperspectral remote sensing data sets, this method is compared with other advanced optimization algorithms. The experimental results show that the number of bands selected in this algorithm is close to one tenth of the original band, and the classification accuracy of Pavia Centre data set is up to 99.08%, which is better than those of other comparison methods. It can find the optimal solution with more reasonable convergence direction, and the number of selected bands is less, and the classification accuracy is higher. It is an efficient method for selecting wave band.

TI  - Detection of heartwood rot in Norway spruce trees with lidar and multi-temporal satellite data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Norway spruce pathogenic fungi causing root, butt and stem rot represent a substantial problem for the forest sector in many countries. Early detection of rot presence is important for efficient management of the forest resources but due to its nature, which does not generate evident exterior signs, it is very difficult to detect without invasive measurements. Remote sensing has been widely used to monitor forest health status in relation to many pathogens and infestations. In particular, multi-temporal remotely sensed data have shown to be useful in detecting degenerative diseases. In this study, we explored the possibility of using multi-temporal and multispectral satellite data to detect rot presence in Norway spruce trees in Norway. Images with four bands were acquired by the Dove satellite constellation with a spatial resolution of 3 m, ranging over three years from June 2017 to September 2019. Field data were collected in 2019-2020 by a harvester during the logging: 16163 trees were recorded, classified in terms of species and presence of rot at the stump and automatically geo-located. The analysis was carried out at individual tree crown (ITC) level, and ITCs were delineated using lidar data. ITCs were classified as healthy, infested and other species using a weighted Support Vector Machine. The results showed an underestimation of the rot presence (balanced accuracy of 56.3%, producer's accuracies of 64.3 and 48.4% and user's accuracies of 81.0% and 32.7% respectively for healthy and rot ITCs). The method can be used to provide a tentative map of the rot presence to guide more detailed assessments in field and harvesting activities.

T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Local vector control and public health agencies in California use the California MosquitoBorne Virus Surveillance and Response Plan to monitor and evaluate West Nile virus (WNV) activity and guide responses to reduce the burden of WNV disease. All available data from environmental surveillance, such as the abundance and WNV infection rates in Culex tarsalis and the Culex pipiens complex mosquitoes, the numbers of dead birds, seroconversions in sentinel chickens, and ambient air temperatures, are fed into a formula to estimate the risk level and associated risk of human infections. In many other areas of the US, the vector index, based only on vector mosquito abundance and infection rates, is used by vector control programs to estimate the risk of human WNV transmission. We built models to determine the association between risk level and the number of reported symptomatic human disease cases with onset in the following three weeks to identify the essential components of the risk level and to compare California's risk estimates to vector index. Risk level calculations based on Cx. tarsalis and Cx. pipiens complex levels were significantly associated with increased human risk, particularly when accounting for vector control area and population, and were better predictors than using vector index. Including all potential environmental components created an effective tool to estimate the risk of WNV transmission to humans in California.

TI  - Assessment of landuse/landcover dynamics of Kaduna watershed, using remote sensing data and GIS techniques
T2  - GEOGRAFIA-MALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF SOCIETY & SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Watershed assessment and developmental strategy demands precise measurement of the past and present land use parameters. Failure of Shiroro dam in 1999 and 2004 was attributes to upstream soil erosion. Hence, the study of land use change within the corridors of the reservoir for proper understanding of the watershed dynamics becomes very crucial. These dynamics was studied for a period of 38 years (1975-2013) in the Kaduna watershed, north central Nigeria using Soil and Water Assessment Tool. The land-use land cover of the year 1975, 2000, and 2013 was reclassified into nine (9) classes in 1975 and eight (8) classes in 2000 and 2013, because of the extinction of Forest evergreen land use between 1975 and 2000. The classification shows the percentage land area of each of the land use type and the area in hectares. Findings revealed total extinction of the 0.03% of Forest evergreen land before 2000, in 2013 range grasses, forest-mixed and wetlands-forested land-use have lost 23.92%, 2.06%, 3.77%, watershed land area respectively while, wetlands-mixed, agricultural land, water, barren and built-up land gained 0.18%, 27.81%, 0.53%, 0.02% and 1.25% respectively as at 2013. The lost in land-use area was attributed to human activities such as clearing and degradation of the natural landscape to another land-use type which posed a stern threat to the Shiroro dam downstream and the environment. If this persists it might contribute to global warming problems and land exposure to agents of erosion. Thus, appropriate best management practice of the watershed become essential.

TI  - Analysing Process and Probability of Built-Up Expansion Using Machine Learning and Fuzzy Logic in English Bazar, West Bengal
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The study sought to investigate the process of built-up expansion and the probability of built-up expansion in the English Bazar Block of West Bengal, India, using multitemporal Landsat satellite images and an integrated machine learning algorithm and fuzzy logic model. The land use and land cover (LULC) classification were prepared using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier for 2001, 2011, and 2021. The landscape fragmentation technique using the landscape fragmentation tool (extension for ArcGIS software) and frequency approach were proposed to model the process of built-up expansion. To create the built-up expansion probability model, the dominance, diversity, and connectivity index of the built-up areas for each year were created and then integrated with fuzzy logic. The results showed that, during 2001-2021, the built-up areas increased by 21.67%, while vegetation and water bodies decreased by 9.28 and 4.63%, respectively. The accuracy of the LULC maps for 2001, 2011, and 2021 was 90.05, 93.67, and 96.24%, respectively. According to the built-up expansion model, 9.62% of the new built-up areas was created in recent decades. The built-up expansion probability model predicted that 21.46% of regions would be converted into built-up areas. This study will assist decision-makers in proposing management strategies for systematic urban growth that do not damage the environment.

AB  - The study investigates the impact of land use/cover changes on the dynamics of surface temperature in the Abaminus watershed. Northwest Ethiopia. Landsat-5 images of 1987, 1999, and 2010. and the Landsat-8 image of 2018 were used as the sources of data. The land use/cover changes were calculated using a land-use transition matrix. Data generated from household surveys were presented using percentage values to identify the driving forces of land use/cover changes. The land surface temperature (LST) result was quantified using the respective index equation. Results indicated that wetland. forest, shrublands, and grasslands declined by 96.6%. 72%. 77.7%. and 89.4% respectively over the analysis period. The encroachment of cultivation and overgrazing to marginal lands, weak institutional arrangement, sedimentation. high drainage of wetlands for crop production. and recurrent drought were the major driving forces behind the land use/cover change. Within this effect s the average land surface temperature was increased by 11.5 degrees C, 3.22 degrees C. and 2.02 degrees C due to wetland loss. clearing of the forest, and decline of shrublands respectively for the last 31 years. LSTs had correspondingly decreased by 5.42 degrees C and 3.77 degrees C on the afforested barren surfaces and planted shrublands. Hence. there should be an improved institutional arrangement for managing open access resources through the participation of local people in the management for minimizing the increase of land surface temperature in the study watershed. Moreover. enclosure management and plantation of multipurpose species on degraded communal lands shall be scaled-up to significantly reduce land surface temperatures.

TI  - CO<sub>2</sub>Flux Model Assessment and Comparison between an Airborne Hyperspectral Sensor and Orbital Multispectral Imagery in Southern Amazonia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In environmental research, remote sensing techniques are mostly based on orbital data, which are characterized by limited acquisition and often poor spectral and spatial resolutions in relation to suborbital sensors. This reflects on carbon patterns, where orbital remote sensing bears devoted sensor systems for CO2 monitoring, even though carbon observations are performed with natural resources systems, such as Landsat, supported by spectral models such as CO(2)Flux adapted to multispectral imagery. Based on the considerations above, we have compared the CO(2)Flux model by using four different imagery systems (Landsat 8, PlanetScope, Sentinel-2, and AisaFenix) in the northern part of the state of Mato Grosso, southern Brazilian Amazonia. The study area covers three different land uses, which are primary tropical forest, bare soil, and pasture. After the atmospheric correction and radiometric calibration, the scenes were resampled to 30 m of spatial resolution, seeking for a parametrized comparison of CO(2)Flux, as well as NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and PRI (Photochemical Reflectance Index). The results obtained here suggest that PlanetScope, MSI/Sentinel-2, OLI/Landsat-8, and AisaFENIX can be similarly scaled, that is, the data variability along a heterogeneous scene in evergreen tropical forest is similar. We highlight that the spatial-temporal dynamics of rainfall seasonality relation to CO2 emission and uptake should be assessed in future research. Our results provide a better understanding on how the merge and/or combination of different airborne and orbital datasets that can provide reliable estimates of carbon emission and absorption within different terrestrial ecosystems in southern Amazonia.

TI  - Winter Wheat Yield Estimation Based on Optimal Weighted Vegetation Index and BHT-ARIMA Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to use remote sensing (RS) time-series data to explore the intrinsic relationship between crop growth and yield formation at different fertility stages and construct a high-precision winter wheat yield estimation model applicable to short time-series RS data. Sentinel-2 images were acquired in this study at six key phenological stages (rejuvenation stage, rising stage, jointing stage, heading stage, filling stage, filling-maturity stage) of winter wheat growth, and various vegetation indexes (VIs) at different fertility stages were calculated. Based on the characteristics of yield data continuity, the RReliefF algorithm was introduced to filter the optimal vegetation index combinations suitable for the yield estimation of winter wheat for all fertility stages. The Absolutely Objective Improved Analytic Hierarchy Process (AOIAHP) was innovatively proposed to determine the proportional contribution of crop growth to yield formation in six different phenological stages. The selected VIs consisting of MTCI(RE2), EVI, REP, MTCI(RE1), RECI(RE1), NDVI(RE1), NDVI(RE3), NDVI(RE2), NDVI, and MSAVI were then fused with the weights of different fertility periods to obtain time-series weighted data. For the characteristics of short time length and a small number of sequences of RS time-series data in yield estimation, this study applied the multiplexed delayed embedding transformation (MDT) technique to realize the data augmentation of the original short time series. Tucker decomposition was performed on the block Hankel tensor (BHT) obtained after MDT enhancement, and the core tensor was extracted while preserving the intrinsic connection of the time-series data. Finally, the resulting multidimensional core tensor was trained with the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model to obtain the BHT-ARIMA model for wheat yield estimation. Compared to the performance of the BHT-ARIMA model with unweighted time-series data as input, the weighted time-series input significantly improves yield estimation accuracy. The coefficients of determination (R-2) were improved from 0.325 to 0.583. The root mean square error (RMSE) decreased from 492.990 to 323.637 kg/ha, the mean absolute error (MAE) dropped from 350.625 to 255.954, and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) decreased from 4.332% to 3.186%. Besides, BHT-ARMA and BHT-CNN models were also used to compare with BHT-ARIMA. The results indicated that the BHT-ARIMA model still had the best yield prediction accuracy. The proposed method of this study will provide fast and accurate guidance for crop yield estimation and will be of great value for the processing and application of time-series RS data.

TI  - PM<sub>2.5</sub> in Sri Lanka: Trend Analysis, Low-cost Sensor Correlations and Spatial Distribution
T2  - AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The South Asian island nation of Sri Lanka did not have any permanent PM2.5 monitors sharing data publicly in near-real-time until the U.S. Embassy installed a Beta Attenuation Monitor (BAM) in September 2017. This research aims to better understand the PM2.5 distribution in Sri Lanka by analyzing data collected by that BAM, and leveraging low-cost sensors, model and remote sensing data.BAM data show PM 2 . 5 levels were "Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups" or "Unhealthy" according to the U.S. classification system, for at least 50% of the time between each November and the following February. This coincides with the northeast monsoon when stable air masses reduce dispersion of pollutants. Back trajectory analyses suggest long range transport also contributes to elevated PM2.5 during these months. Although slightly cleaner than regional embassies, this location has exceeded the Sri Lankan 24-hr standard for PM2.5 (50 mu g m(-3)) every year since 2018. The area has met Sri Lanka's annual standard (25 mu g m(3)) since 2019.We used PurpleAir (PA) and Atmos low-cost PM2.5 sensors co-located with the Embassy BAM, to develop correction factors to transform raw sensor data to BAM-like data. The influence of meteorological variables and the performance of different statistical models were considered and the regression coefficients of the most applicable models are presented. We also compared our PA correction factor against user-selectable options on the PurpleAir.com website. The Australian "Woodsmoke" correction can be applied to quickly visualize a reasonably accurate estimate of PM2.5 concentrations.We applied our PA correction factor to six other PurpleAir sensors operated around the country, to understand Sri Lanka's PM2.5 distribution. With these corrected data, we interpolated satellite and model-derived PM2.5 annual averages at 1 km intervals. The most populated Western Province had the highest concentrations with elevated levels extending offshore. The sparsely populated southeast had the cleanest air.

TI  - Near-Surface and High-Resolution Satellite Time Series for Detecting Crop Phenology
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detecting crop phenology with satellite time series is important to characterize agroecosystem energy-water-carbon fluxes, manage farming practices, and predict crop yields. Despite the advances in satellite-based crop phenological retrievals, interpreting those retrieval characteristics in the context of on-the-ground crop phenological events remains a long-standing hurdle. Over the recent years, the emergence of near-surface phenology cameras (e.g., PhenoCams), along with the satellite imagery of both high spatial and temporal resolutions (e.g., PlanetScope imagery), has largely facilitated direct comparisons of retrieved characteristics to visually observed crop stages for phenological interpretation and validation. The goal of this study is to systematically assess near-surface PhenoCams and high-resolution PlanetScope time series in reconciling sensor- and ground-based crop phenological characterizations. With two critical crop stages (i.e., crop emergence and maturity stages) as an example, we retrieved diverse phenological characteristics from both PhenoCam and PlanetScope imagery for a range of agricultural sites across the United States. The results showed that the curvature-based Greenup and Gu-based Upturn estimates showed good congruence with the visually observed crop emergence stage (RMSE about 1 week, bias about 0-9 days, and R square about 0.65-0.75). The threshold- and derivative-based End of greenness falling Season (i.e., EOS) estimates reconciled well with visual crop maturity observations (RMSE about 5-10 days, bias about 0-8 days, and R square about 0.6-0.75). The concordance among PlanetScope, PhenoCam, and visual phenology demonstrated the potential to interpret the fine-scale sensor-derived phenological characteristics in the context of physiologically well-characterized crop phenological events, which paved the way to develop formal protocols for bridging ground-satellite phenological characterization.

TI  - Functional Brain Asymmetry and Menopausal Treatments: Is There a Link?
T2  - MEDICINA-LITHUANIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Objectives: The human brain presents a functional asymmetry for every cognitive function, and it is possible that sexual hormones could have an impact on it. Visual-spatial attention, one of the most lateralized functions and one that is mainly dependent on the right hemisphere, represents a sentinel for functional cerebral asymmetry (FCA). The aim of this study was to evaluate whether menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) or phytoestrogens could modulate FCA in postmenopausal women. Materials and Methods: We enrolled postmenopausal women who were taking MHT or soy isoflavones or receiving no therapy and asked them to perform the line bisection test at study enrollment and after 18 and 36 months. Results: Ninety women completed the follow-up. At zero time, women who had not been subjected to therapy showed a leftward deviation (F = -3.0), whereas, after 36 months, the test results showed a rightward deviation (F = 4.5; p < 0.01). Women taking MHT showed a leftward deviation at the start (F = -3.0) and a persistent leftward deviation after 36 months (F = -4.0; p = 0.08). Conversely, women taking soy isoflavones started with a leftward deviation (F = -3.0) that became rightward (F = 3.0), with a significant difference shown after 36 months (p < 0.01). Conclusions: Our data suggest that hormonal modulation improves the interplay between the two hemispheres and reduces FCA. We propose, therefore, that the functions of the right hemisphere are mainly affected by aging and that this could be one of the reasons why the right hemisphere is more susceptible to the effects of MHT.

TI  - Spectral consistency of satellite and airborne data: Application of an equivalent dipole layer for combining satellite and aeromagnetic data sets
T2  - GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a novel approach for the combination of aeromagnetic and satellite data applying an equivalent dipole layer and spherical harmonic (SH) expansion of the dipoles. The method involves two steps: (1) inversion for the magnetic parameters of the equivalent dipole layer and (2) conversion of the magnetic parameters into SH coefficients. With this approach, SH analysis can be used for a regional study area, and, for example, the long-wavelength range of aeromagnetic data can be replaced with satellite data. We test our approach on the third, fourth, and fifth editions of the Magnetic Anomaly Map of Australia, which were releveled using independent aeromagnetic data sets for long-wavelength correction. The results indicate that the magnetic compilations leveled to long-haul control lines have a good agreement with the LCS-1 satellite model in the range of SH degree 40 to 110 (corresponding to half-wavelengths between 180 to 500 km), Australia demonstrates poor control over long- wavelengths in this spectral range. Our analysis suggests that even the carefully processed fifth edition would benefit from the replacement of long-wavelength data with satellite data.

TI  - Heatwaves Significantly Slow the Vegetation Growth Rate on the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, heatwaves have been reported frequently by literature and the media on the Tibetan Plateau. However, it is unclear how alpine vegetation responds to the heatwaves on the Tibetan Plateau. This study aimed to identify the heatwaves using long-term meteorological data and examine the impact of heatwaves on vegetation growth rate with remote sensing data. The results indicated that heatwaves frequently occur in June, July, and August on the Tibetan Plateau. The average frequency of heatwaves had no statistically significant trends from 2000 to 2020 for the entire Tibetan Plateau. On a monthly scale, the average frequency of heatwaves increased significantly (p < 0.1) in August, while no significant trends were in June and July. The intensity of heatwaves indicated a negative correlation with the vegetation growth rate anomaly (Delta VGR) calculated from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) (r = -0.74, p < 0.05) and the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) (r = -0.61, p < 0.1) on the Tibetan Plateau, respectively. Both NDVI and EVI consistently demonstrate that the heatwaves slow the vegetation growth rate. This study outlines the importance of heatwaves to vegetation growth to enrich our understanding of alpine vegetation response to increasing extreme weather events under the background of climate change.

M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, the authors consider the metaphor in accordance with the cognitive science achievements in the context of the figurative system of Chechen poetry of the XX century. Based on the analysis of the poetic texts of the word masters, basic metaphors, conceptually significant for the Chechen national consciousness, are revealed, that is, the emphasis is not on the occasional system of tropes and the individual author's model of the world, but on what role mentally conditioned metaphorization plays in this system. The subject of the study is the ethnocultural concepts-metaphors "mountain", "tower", "river", "burka", "papakha", "wolf", "eagle", "jigit (konakh)" and a number of others, which are characterized on the basis of classical lyrical works of Sh. Aishanov,A. Dudaeva, M. Isaeva,A. Mamakaeva, M. Mamakaeva The methodology of literary criticism and cognitive linguistics is used in this work. The analysis carried out by the authors of the publication allows us to conclude that the individual picture of the world is under the unconscious influence of national imagery, which is a part of the world national language picture, which makes it possible to encode in the poetic text the most significant axiological concepts for the ethnic group "honor", "freedom", "dignity", "bravery", "love for the native land", "loyalty to the word" and others, the lexical and symbolic expressions of which are the concepts-metaphors indicated above.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Terrestrial Vegetation and Its Driver Analysis over Southwest China from 1982 to 2015
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global environmental changes have been dramatic recently, exerting substantial effects on the structures and functions of terrestrial ecosystems, especially for the ecologically-fragile karst regions. Southwest China is one of the largest karst continuum belts around the world, which also contributes about 1/3 of terrestrial carbon sequestration to China. Therefore, a deep understanding of the long-term changes of vegetation across Southwest China over the past decades is critical. Relying on the long time series of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies normalized difference vegetation index (GIMMS NDVI3g) data set, this study examined the spatial and temporal patterns of vegetation conditions in Southwest China from 1982 to 2015, as well as their response to the environmental factors including temperature, precipitation and downward shortwave radiation. Multi-year mean NDVI showed that except the northwestern region, the NDVI of Southwest China was large, ranging from 0.5 to 0.8. Meanwhile, nearly 43.7% of the area experienced significant improvements in NDVI, whereas only 3.47% of the area exhibited significant decreases in NDVI. Interestingly, the NDVI in karst area increased more quickly with 1.035 x 10(-3)/a in comparison with that in the non-karst area with about 0.929 x 10(-3)/a. Further analysis revealed that temperature is the dominant environmental factor controlling the interannual changes in NDVI, accounting for 48.19% of the area, followed by radiation (3.71%) and precipitation (3.09%), respectively.

TI  - Monitoring and Mapping of Soil Salinity on the Exposed Seabed of the Aral Sea, Central Asia
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The incredible drying of the Aral Sea has resulted in a large area of exposed seafloor with saline soils, which has led to catastrophic consequences. This study investigated ground-truth soil salinity data and used Landsat data to map the soil salinity distribution of the exposed seabed of the Aral Sea from 1960 onwards. The soil salinity distribution, with the depth from 0 cm to 100 cm, was analyzed. The correlation analysis was applied to find the best performance index in describing soil salinity changes. The results showed that ground-truth data of topsoil salinity (depth of 0-5 cm) exhibited a significantly strong correlation with soil salinity index 4 (SI4) among seven indices, where the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) was up to 0.92. Based on the relationship between soil salinity sampling data and SI4, a linear regression model was employed to determine the capability of evaluating the soil salinity distribution of the Aral Sea with the coefficient of determination (R-2), root mean squared error (RMSE), and ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) values of 0.84 and 0.86 dS m(-1) and 2.36, respectively. The SI4 performed well and was used to predict the soil salinity distribution on the exposed seabed. The distribution showed that soil salinity increased from the former to current shoreline. In the North Aral Sea, compared to 1986, the water area remained stable, accounting for 50.3% in 2020, and the soil salinization level was relatively low. However, the moderately and slightly saline areas dominated 73.8% and 7.5% of the South Aral Sea in 2020, with an increase of 53% and 6% transformed from the water area. The area of salinized soils dramatically increased. The strongly and extremely saline areas were mainly located in the northeastern part of the eastern basin and western part of Vozrozhdeniya Island, respectively, and were the main source of salt-dust storms. These results support the dynamic monitoring and distribution patterns of soil salinization in the Aral Sea.

TI  - Monitoring Annual Land Use/Land Cover Change in the Tucson Metropolitan Area with Google Earth Engine (1986-2020)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tucson metropolitan area, located in the Sonoran Desert of southeastern Arizona (USA), is affected by both massive population growth and rapid climate change, resulting in important land use and land cover (LULC) changes. As its fragile arid ecosystem and scarce resources are increasingly under pressure, there is a crucial need to monitor such landscape transformations. For such ends, we propose a method to compute yearly 30 m resolution LULC maps of the region from 1986 to 2020, using a combination of Landsat imagery, derived transformation and indices, texture analysis and other ancillary data fed to a Random Forest classifier. The entire process was hosted in the Google Earth Engine with tremendous computing capacities that allowed us to process a large amount of data and to achieve high overall classification accuracy for each year, ranging from 86.7 to 96.3%. Conservative post-processing techniques were also used to mitigate the persistent confusions between the numerous isolated houses in the region and their desert surroundings and to smooth year-specific LULC changes in order to identify general trends. We then show that policies to lessen urban sprawl in the area had little effects and we provide an automated tool to continue monitoring such dynamics in the future.

TI  - Predicting incidence of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever using satellite monitoring (remote sensing) data in the Stavropol Territory
T2  - Zhurnal Mikrobiologii Epidemiologii i Immunobiologii
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction. With the epidemiological situation for Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) remaining tense in many countries worldwide, special attention should be focused on development and improvement of risk-based epidemiological prediction methods.The aim of the study was to build a prediction model for CCHF incidence dynamics (based on the Stavropol Territory) using satellite monitoring (remote sensing) data.Materials and methods. We analyzed the climate data obtained from the Space Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences as well as the data of public statistics reports on CCHF incidence from 2005 to 2021. The prediction model incorporated the Bayes theorem and Wald sequential analysis. The information content of the factors was assessed using the Kullback method.Results. Predictions for each of 26 districts were made stepwise (compared to threshold levels) to predict whether there will be at least one case of CCHF, whether the relative incidence per 100,000 population will exceed the median level (0.9 cases) or the average rate (3.5 cases) or the third quartile rate (4.7 cases). The highest values of information coefficients were obtained for soil temperature and moisture content (at depths of 10 and 40 cm), normalized relative vegetation index, relative humidity, maximum and average air temperature, relative air humidity. During the testing of the model in 2021, false-negative (erroneous) prediction was made for 2 districts.Discussion. The model proved to be most efficient in prediction of occurrence or absence of cases. More accurate quantitative prediction may be difficult due to subjective factors (including misdiagnosing CCHF cases without hemorrhagic manifestations and administering treatment for other conditions with similar symptoms).Conclusion. The tests of the model demonstrate its potential. The practical application of the prediction will make healthcare workers more alert when screening and detecting CCHF cases.

TI  - Assimilation of AMSU-A in All-Sky Conditions
T2  - MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Radiances from microwave temperature sounders have been assimilated operationally at ECMWF for two decades, but observations significantly affected by clouds and precipitation have been screened out. Extending successful assimilation beyond clear-sky scenes is a challenge that has taken several years of development to achieve. In this paper we describe the all-sky treatment of AMSU-A, which enables greater numbers of temperature sounding radiances to be used in meteorologically active parts of the troposphere. Successful all-sky assimilation required combining lessons learned from the clear-sky assimilation of AMSU-A with the approach initially developed for humidity-sensitive microwave radiances. This concerned particularly observation thinning, error modeling, and variational quality control. As a result of the move to all-sky assimilation, the forecast impact of AMSU-A now replicates and exceeds that of the previous clear-sky usage. This is shown via trials in comparison to the current ECMWF assimilation system, judged with respect to forecast scores and background fits to independent observations. Persistently cloudy regions and phenomena such as tropical cyclones are better sampled when assimilating AMSU-A in all-sky conditions, causing an increase of about 13% in used channel-5 radiances globally. These impacts are explored, with an emphasis on tropical cyclones in the 2019 season. Independent observations provide consistent evidence that representation of humidity is improved, for example, while extratropical Z500 forecasts are improved by about 0.5% out to at least day 2. On the strength of these results, assimilation of AMSU-A moved to all-sky conditions with the upgrade to IFS cycle 47R3 in October 2021.

TI  - Impact of "the Blob" 2014 and 2019 in the sea surface temperature and chlorophyll-<i>a</i> levels of the Gulf of California: a satellite-based study
T2  - LATIN AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2014, an unexpected and unusual warm patch of ocean water was discovered in the northeast Pacific Ocean (PO) that moved south, reaching the Mexican coasts; this patch, returning in 2019, was nicknamed "the Blob". This paper aimed to assess the impacts of this phenomenon on the sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a (CHLA) levels in the Gulf of California (GC), a high-productivity region. Daily satellite images of SST and CHLA with a spatial resolution of 1 km/pixel were obtained for 2014, 2017, and 2019 from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Two disc-shaped areas of around 25 km in diameter were selected in the southern portion of the GC to assess the variability of both parameters quantitatively. An additional site was selected in the PO for comparison and, thus, to better characterize and have a complete vision of these events. The results showed that in the PO, during the periods in which the Blob occurred, the SST values were higher concerning the neutral year (2017), and the levels of CHLA were very low (barely 0.15 mg m(-3)). Within the GC, the results showed the presence of a strong seasonal variability, with maximum values of SST (>30 degrees C) and the lowest concentrations of CHLA (<2 mg m(-3)) during the summer, with maximum concentrations of CHLA (similar to 10 mg m(-3)) observed during the winter months. Contrary to expectations, no dramatic changes in SST and CHLA were observed during the years impacted by the Blob. This apparent absence of negative impacts could be related to different mechanisms in the gulf that "protect" to avoid climate disruptions. The presence of complex geomorphology and hydrodynamic processes at different scales induce mixing and fertilizing of the euphotic layer. Could these factors protect the southern gulf from the negative impacts of the Blob?

M3  - Article
AB  - Protected areas (PAs) are intended to preserve the health of humans, animals and ecosystems and to meet the global challenges of biodiversity and climate change. The key role of French PAs as preferential sites for turning the "One health" concept into practice is highlighted.PAs apply a practical territorial model of socio-ecological systems based on the interdependence between human society and nature and on an exchange of ecosystem and anthropic goods and services. They have a range of tools for maintaining good overall stability. By highlighting operational examples of applying the "One health" concept, the article provides a toolbox divided into four main categories of actions to promote the proper functioning of socio-ecological systems. Sustainability tools are illustrated by the alpine sentinel networks. The stabilization tools set forth the fundamental role of wildlife and some principles of its management. The various governance tools provide contractual frameworks adapted to the various territories. Finally, integrating tools are presented as key elements to network actors and construct nature-based solutions. PAs are thus the most appropriate interfaces for action directly linked to the sustainable development objectives of the 2030 Agenda, guaranteeing, in particular, health and well-being for all.

TI  - Evaluation of the Impact Caused by the Snowfall after Storm Filomena on the Arboreal Masses of Madrid
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Following a copious and famous snowfall in Madrid city (Spain) and its surrounding area, the tree masses were analysed to assess the impact of this snowfall. In this way, this paper proposes an approach towards urban forest impact inventory mapping as a consequence of the snowfall of January 2021, and the subsequent atmospheric stability, which kept surface temperatures in Madrid close to -10 degrees C. The study has been carried out using snowfall data from 1920 to 2020 and images from the Sentinel, Landsat and MODIS satellites. The results obtained by means of image changes in the NDVI reveal a clear impact on the trees, with 11% of the winter vegetation cover of the municipality being affected. Especially significant has been the damage detected both in the forest areas in the city and in the parks, gardens or urban roads.

TI  - Conifers May Ameliorate Urban Heat Waves Better Than Broadleaf Trees: Evidence from Vancouver, Canada
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are increasing the frequency of deadly heat waves. Heat waves are particularly devastating in cities, where air pollution is high and air temperatures are already inflated by the heat island effect. Determining how cities can ameliorate extreme summer temperature is thus critical to climate adaptation. Tree planting has been proposed to ameliorate urban temperatures, but its effectiveness, particularly of coniferous trees in temperate climates, has not been established. Here, we use remote sensing data (Landsat 8), high-resolution land cover data, and Bayesian models to understand how different tree and land cover classes affect summer surface temperature in Metro Vancouver, Canada. Although areas dominated by coniferous trees exhibited the lowest albedo (95% CrI 0.08-0.08), they were significantly (12.2 degrees C) cooler than areas dominated by buildings. Indeed, we found that for conifers, lower albedo was associated with lower surface temperatures. Planting and maintaining coniferous trees in cities may not only sequester CO2 to mitigate global climate change, but may also ameliorate higher temperatures and deadly heat waves locally.

TI  - Comparison of Variable Selection Methods among Dominant Tree Species in Different Regions on Forest Stock Volume Estimation
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The forest stock volume (FSV) is one of the crucial indicators to reflect the quality of forest resources. Variable selection methods are usually used for FSV estimated models. However, few studies have explored which variable selection methods can make the selected data set have better explanatory and robustness for the same dominant tree species in different regions after the feature variables were filtered by the feature selection methods. In this study, we chose six dominant tree species from Lin'an District, Anji County, and a part of Longquan City. The tree species include broad-leaved, coniferous, Masson pine, Chinese fir, coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forest, and all tree species which include the above five groups of tree species. The last two tree species were represented by mixed and all, respectively. Then, the satellite images, terrain factors, and forest inventory data were selected by six variable selection methods (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), recursive feature elimination (RFE), stepwise regression (Step-Reg), permutation importance (PI), mean decrease impurity (MDI), and SelectFromModel based on LightGBM (SFM)), according to different dominant tree types in different regions. The selected variables were formed into a new dataset divided by different dominant trees. Besides, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) was used, combined with variable selection methods to estimate the FSV. The performed results are as follows: In the feature selection of coniferous, RFE performed better both in the average and in the separate regions. In the feature selection of Chinese fir and all, PI performed better both in the average and in the separate regions. In the feature selection of Masson pine, MDI performed better both in the average and in the separate regions. In the feature selection of mixed, MDI performed better in the average while RFE performed better in the separate regions comprehensively. The results showed that not only in separate regions, but the average result two factors, RFE, MDI, and PI all performed well to select variables to estimate the FSV. Furthermore, we selected the top five high feature-importance factors of different tree types, and the results showed that tree age and canopy density were both of great importance to the estimation of FSV. Besides, in the exhibited results of feature selection methods, compared with no variable selection, the research also found that variable selection can improve the performance of the model. Additionally, from the results of different tree types in different regions, we also found that small-scale and diversity of dominant tree types may lead to the instability and unreliability of experimental results. The study provides some insight into the application the optimal variable selection methods of the same dominant tree type in different regions. This study will help the development of variable selection methods to estimate FSV.

TI  - Multi-Temporal Landsat-8 Images for Retrieval and Broad Scale Mapping of Soil Copper Concentration Using Empirical Models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping soil heavy metal concentration using machine learning models based on readily available satellite remote sensing images is highly desirable. Accurate mapping relies on appropriate data, feature extraction, and model selection. To this end, a data processing pipeline for soil copper (Cu) concentration estimation has been designed. First, instead of using single Landsat scenes, the utilization of multiple Landsat scenes of the same location over time is considered. Second, to generate a preferred feature set as input to a regression model, a number of feature extraction methods are motivated and compared. Third, to find a preferred regression model, a variety of approaches are implemented and compared for accuracy. In this research, 11 Landsat-8 images from 2013 to 2017 of Gulin County, Sichuan China, and 138 soil samples with lab-measured Cu concentrations collected from the area in 2015 are used. A variety a metrics under cross-validation are used for comparison. The results indicate that multi-temporal images increase accuracy compared to single Landsat images. The preferred feature extraction varies based on the regression model used; however, the best results are obtained using support vector regression and the original data. The final soil Cu map generated using the recommended data processing pipeline shows a consistent spatial pattern with a ground-truth land cover classification map. These results indicate that machine learning has the ability to perform large-scale soil heavy metal mapping from widely available satellite remote sensing images.

TI  - Rapid and automatic burned area detection using sentinel-2 time-series images in google earth engine cloud platform: a case study over the Andika and Behbahan Regions, Iran
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - For proper forest management, accurate detection and mapping of burned areas are needed, yet the practice is difficult to perform due to the lack of an appropriate method, time, and expense. It is also critical to obtain accurate information about the density and distribution of burned areas in a large forest and vegetated areas. For the most efficient and up-to-date mapping of large areas, remote sensing is one of the best technologies. However, the complex image scenario and the similar spectral behavior of classes in multispectral satellite images may lead to many false-positive mistakes, making it challenging to extract the burned areas accurately. This research aims to develop an automated framework in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform for detecting burned areas in Andika and Behbahan, located in the south and southwest of Iran, using Sentinel-2 time-series images. After importing the images and applying the necessary preprocessing, the Sentinel-2 Burned Areas Index (BAIS2) was used to create a map of the Primary Burned Areas (PBA). Detection accuracy was then improved by masking out disturbing classes (vegetation and water) on the PBA map, which resulted in Final Burned Areas (FBA). The unimodal method is used to calculate the ideal thresholds of indices to make the proposed method automatic. The final results demonstrated that the proposed method performed well in both homogeneous and heterogeneous areas for detecting the burned areas. Based on a test dataset, maps of burned areas were produced in the Andika and Behbahan regions with an overall accuracy of 90.11% and 92.40% and a kappa coefficient of 0.87 and 0.88, respectively, which were highly accurate when compared to the BAIS2, Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Mid-Infrared Bispectral Index (MIRBI), and Normalized Difference SWIR (NDSWIR) indices. Based on the results, accurate determination of vegetation classes and water zones and eliminating them from the map of burned areas led to a considerable increase in the accuracy of the obtained final map from the BAIS2 spectral index.

We study perception biases with respect to a concrete indicator that can be objectively measured: land use changes in a local area. We examine four hypotheses about land use change perceptions and test them with farm survey data complemented by satellite data. We discover systematic biases in farmers??? perceptions about local land use changes that are consistent with motivated beliefs and evidence that links perceptions with intended future land conversions. Alternative explanations and policy implications are discussed. (JEL Q15, Q24)

TI  - Harmonizing Definitions and Methods to Estimate Deforestation at the Lacandona Tropical Region in Southern Mexico
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation is a major factor reducing natural habitats, leading to tropical ecosystems and biodiversity loss worldwide. The Lacandona region in southern Mexico holds one of the largest fragments of tropical rainforest in North America. We evaluated the deforestation of the Lacandona region harmonizing concepts and methodologies. An international (FAO definition), governmental (national definition), and regional definition of deforestation with applications at different scales were analyzed and harmonized with two classification methods (likelihood and spectral angle mapper (SAM)). We used 2015 and 2018 Landsat 8 images, and likelihood and SAM classifications were applied for FAO and regional definitions of deforestation. Overall, the best evaluated classifier in quantity was likelihood for 2015 and 2018 (kappa: 0.87 and 0.70, overall accuracy: 91.8 and 80.4%, and quantity disagreement: 4.1 and 10 %, respectively). The allocation disagreement only showed exchange between classes. Nevertheless, they did not show differences between classifiers, although 2015 had less disagreement than 2018: exchange, 4.1% for likelihood and SAM; shift: 0% for likelihood and SAM. Maps based on the regional definition of deforestation showed that the likelihood classification detected 11,441 ha less deforestation than SAM (40,538 and 51,979 ha, respectively). The FAO definition of deforestation showed that likelihood classification detected 11,914 ha less deforestation than SAM classification (37,152 and 49,066 ha, respectively). Further, the likelihood classification showed 3387 ha more of deforestation according to the regional definition than the FAO definition of deforestation (40,538 and 37,152 ha, respectively). SAM classification showed that the regional definition showed 2913 ha more deforestation than the FAO definition (51,979 and 49,066, respectively). We concluded that implementation of governmental programs in the Lacandona region requires estimations based on a careful selection of deforestation definitions and methods.

TI  - "Concomitant" Cutaneous and Nodal Spitz Nevus/Tumor: A New Scenario for an Old Problem
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF DERMATOPATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Spitz tumors are notoriously characterized by a high propensity to nodal involvement with a morphologically malignant (intraparenchymal) pattern but with little or no tendency toward further spread. We describe a case of spindle cell Spitz neoplasm removed from the thigh in a 34-year-old woman and initially diagnosed as "Spitzoid melanoma;" the sentinel node was characterized by a morphologically benign pattern of nodal involvement, with prevailingly capsular and septal aggregated of melanocytes showing the same cytomorphological features as the cutaneous tumor. Both the cutaneous and the nodal tumor were strongly ROS1-positive on immunohistochemistry; rearrangement of the ROS1 gene was confirmed with fluorescence in situ hybridization on the cutaneous tumor. The clonal relationship between the cutaneous and the nodal capsular/trabecular tumor, as established by their morphological and immunophenotypical resemblance, underlines the existence of a morphologically benign pattern of spread of Spitz neoplasms, as also suggested by the occurrence of eruptive Spitz nevi.

TI  - Multisite sentinel surveillance of self-harm in New Zealand: protocol for an observational study
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction New Zealand (NZ) has a persistently high rate of suicide, particularly among young people. Hospital presentation for self-harm (SH) is one of the strongest predictors of death by suicide. Improving the monitoring of SH and suicide is a key recommendation for suicide prevention by WHO. This study will establish the first ever sentinel surveillance for SH at several large hospitals and a monthly survey of all practicing paediatricians in NZ. The study will provide robust information about the epidemiology of SH, factors associated with SH and the types of interventions required for those presenting to hospital with SH. Method and analysis This observational study will establish SH surveillance in the emergency departments of three public hospitals for the first time in NZ, where study population will include individuals of all ages who present with SH or suicidal ideation. The study methodology is in line with the WHO Best Practice guidelines and international collaborators in Australia and Europe. Electronic triage records will be reviewed manually by the research team to identify potential cases that meet inclusion criteria. For all eligible cases, variables of interest will be extracted from routine clinical records by the research team and recorded on a secure web-based survey application. Additionally, SH surveillance data for the national paediatric population (<15 years) will be obtained via the New Zealand Paediatric Surveillance Unit (NZPSU); paediatricians will report on included cases using the same variables using a secure survey application. A deidentified dataset will be produced for aggregated statistical analysis. Ethics and dissemination The University of Otago Health Ethics Committee granted ethical approval for this study in addition to local ethics approval at participating hospital sites. The study findings will be disseminated to relevant stakeholders in NZ, in addition to international audiences through publications in peer-reviewed scientific journals and conference presentations.

TI  - Antagonistic roles of Ras-MAPK and Akt signaling in integrin-K<SUP>+</SUP> channel complex-mediated cellular apoptosis
T2  - FASEB JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Complexes formed with alpha 5-integrins and the voltage-gated potassium (K+) channel KCNB1 (Kv2.1), known as IKCs, transduce the electrical activity at the plasma membrane into biochemical events that impinge on cytoskeletal remodeling, cell differentiation, and migration. However, when cells are subject to stress of oxidative nature IKCs turn toxic and cause inflammation and death. Here, biochemical, pharmacological, and cell viability evidence demonstrates that in response to oxidative insults, IKCs activate an apoptotic Mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Ras-MAPK) signaling pathway. Simultaneously, wild-type (WT) KCNB1 channels sequester protein kinase B (Akt) causing dephosphorylation of BCL2-associated agonist of cell death (BAD), a major sentinel of apoptosis progression. In contrast, IKCs formed with C73A KCNB1 variant that does not induce apoptosis (IKCC73A), do not sequester Akt and thus are able to engage cell survival mechanisms. Taken together, these data suggest that apoptotic and survival forces co-exist in IKCs. Integrins send death signals through Ras-MAPK and KCNB1 channels simultaneously sabotage survival mechanisms. Thus, the combined action of integrins and KCNB1 channels advances life or death.

TI  - Can Forel-Ule Index Act as a Proxy of Water Quality in Temperate Waters? Application of Plume Mapping in Liverpool Bay, UK
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of ocean colour classification algorithms, linked to water quality gradients, can be a useful tool for mapping river plumes in both tropical and temperate systems. This approach has been applied in operational water quality programs in the Great Barrier Reef to map river plumes and assess trends in marine water composition and ecosystem health during flood periods. In this study, we used the Forel-Ule colour classification algorithm for Sentinel-3 OLCI imagery in an automated process to map monthly, annual and long-term plume movement in the temperate coastal system of Liverpool Bay (UK). We compared monthly river plume extent to the river flow and in situ water quality data between 2017-2020. The results showed a strong positive correlation (Spearman's rho = 0.68) between the river plume extent and the river flow and a strong link between the FUI defined waterbodies and nutrients, SPM, turbidity and salinity, hence the potential of the Forel-Ule index to act as a proxy for water quality in the temperate Liverpool Bay water. The paper discusses how the Forel-Ule index could be used in operational water quality programs to better understand river plumes and the land-based inputs to the coastal zones in UK waters, drawing parallels with methods that have been developed in the GBR and Citclops project. Overall, this paper provides the first insight into the systematic long-term river plume mapping in UK coastal waters using a fast, cost-effective, and reproducible workflow. The study created a novel water assessment typology based on the common physical, chemical and biological ocean colour properties captured in the Forel-Ule index, which could replace the more traditional eutrophication assessment regions centred around strict geographic and political boundaries. Additionally, the Forel-Ule assessment typology is particularly important since it identifies areas of the greatest impact from the land-based loads into the marine environment, and thus potential risks to vulnerable ecosystems.

TI  - Application of "OTSU"-an image segmentation method for differentiation of snow and ice regions of glaciers and assessment of mass budget in Chandra basin, Western Himalaya using Remote Sensing and GIS techniques
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, an image segmentation algorithm ("OTSU") is applied for differentiation of snow/ice regions followed by interpretation of snowlines and estimation of mass budget of glaciers in Chandra basin, Western Himalaya, India between 2014 and 2020. The observations strongly suggest that the OTSU method can be used to differentiate the snow and ice regions on a glacier accurately from any satellite image, irrespective of the sensor characteristics. Also, this method suits well to delineate the snowlines for large sample of glaciers, other than the manual interpretation and semi-automated methods. The estimates of mass budget of the glaciers are observed varying from - 1.20 +/- 0.51 m w.e to almost 0.64 +/- 0.51 m w.e, with a total loss of - 61.91 +/- 6.70 m w.e of ice mass at basin scale during the observation period. Based on this study, it is highly recommended the application of OTSU method for the differentiation of snow/ice zones of glaciers and snowline demarcation at a large spatial scale in the harsh weather rugged terrain of the Western Himalaya.

TI  - Analysis of Water Yield Changes from 1981 to 2018 Using an Improved Mann-Kendall Test
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water yield (WY) refers to the difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration (ET), which is vital for available terrestrial water. Climate change has led to significant changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration on a global scale, which will affect the global WY. Nevertheless, how terrestrial WY has changed during the past few decades and which factors dominated the WY changes are not fully understood. In this study, based on climate reanalysis and remote sensing data, the spatial and temporal patterns of terrestrial WY were revisited from 1981 to 2018 globally using an improved Mann-Kendall trend test method with a permutation test. The response patterns of WY to precipitation and ET are also investigated. The results show that the global multi-year mean WY is 297.4 mm/a. Based on the traditional Mann-Kendall trend test, terrestrial WY showed a significant (p < 0.05) increase of 5.72% of the total valid grid cells, while it showed a significant decrease of 7.68% of those. After correction using the calibration method, the significantly increasing and decreasing areas are reduced by 10.52% and 10.58% of them, respectively. After the correction, the confirmed increase and decrease in WY are mainly located in Africa, eastern North America and Siberia, and parts of Asia and Oceania, respectively. The dominant factor for increasing WY is precipitation, while that for decreasing WY was the combined effect of precipitation and evapotranspiration. The achievements of this study are beneficial for improving the understanding of WY in response to hydrological variables in the context of climate change.

TI  - Source Geometry and Causes of the 2019 Ms6.0 Changning Earthquake in Sichuan, China Based on InSAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On 17 June 2019, an Ms6.0 earthquake occurred in Changning, Sichuan, China (Changning event), which was the largest earthquake on record within 50 km of the area. It attracted great attention as the area has the largest shale gas production in China as well as significant mineral salt production. Using the Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), we extract the coseismic deformation of the Changning event and two earlier Ms > 5.0 earthquakes which occurred in the same region (16 December 2018 Ms5.7 and 3 January 2019 Ms5.3) from the Sentinel-1 and ALOS2 data. We use nonlinear and linear methods to invert the fault models of the three earthquakes based on the deformation fields. The final model shows that the Changning event was caused by a fault with left-lateral strike and thrust slip. The strike is 124.3 degrees with a dip angle of 43.4 degrees. The seismic moment obtained by inversion is 5.28 x 10(17) Nm, corresponding to Mw 5.78. Based on the fault models, we analyze the cause of the Changning earthquake considering the local tectonic setting, Coulomb stress change, mining, and fluid injection. We consider that the event may be related to salt mining. The two earlier Ms > 5.0 earthquakes may also play an important role in advancing the Changning earthquake.

TI  - Evaluation of FY-4A Temperature Profile Products and Application to Winter Precipitation Type Diagnosis in Southern China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - FY-4A GIIRS temperature profile products have provided unprecedented information for studying the atmospheric characteristics of thermal structures since 2020. The main objective of this paper is to evaluate GIIRS temperature profile products by using radiosonde observations and then apply them to the diagnosis of winter precipitation types in southern China. GIIRS temperature profile products for four types (clear sky perfect quality, cloudy sky perfect quality, cloudy sky good quality and cloudy sky bad quality) show different performances. Relatively, the cloud can affect the quality and quantity of GIIRS products. At different pressure levels, the perfect flagged data under the clear or cloudy sky show the best agreement with radiosonde observations, yielding the highest Pearson correlation coefficient and lowest mean bias as well as root mean square error. The good flagged data have a slight deviation from the perfect data. The impact on the quantity of the GIIRS temperature data is greater than that on the quality with an increase in cloud top height. A case investigation was carried out to analyze the performance of GIIRS temperature profiles for the diagnosis of precipitation types in a winter storm of 2022. The GIIRS temperature profiles represent the reasonable atmospheric thermal structures in the rain and snow in Hubei and Hunan provinces. The GIIRS temperature below 700 hPa is an important indictor to precipitation type diagnosis. Furthermore, two critical thresholds for GIIRS temperatures, which are below -2 degrees C at 850 hPa and below 0 degrees C at 925 hPa, respectively, are proposed for the occurrence of snowfall in this winter storm. In addition, the distribution of GIIRS temperature at different pressure levels is consistent with radiosonde observations in a freezing rain event in Guiyang, all of which show the warm rain mechanism by combining the cloud top information.

TI  - Spatial pattern-based performance evaluation and uncertainty analysis of a distributed hydrological model
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Advancement in data acquisition techniques (e.g., satellites) has provided enormous opportunities to improve the predictions of distributed hydrological models by incorporating new types of information. Moreover, such advancements have paved the way for the spatial scale evaluation rather than the conventional temporal evaluation of models for more accurate water management by considering the spatial variability. The present study focuses on the spatial pattern-oriented model evaluation by intercomparing the satellite remote sensing data-driven patterns of actual evapotranspiration (AET) and soil moisture with simulated patterns from a hydrological model for the 19 276 km(2) Subarnarekha basin in Eastern India. Pattern comparison is carried out by incorporating three spatial performance metrics as diagnostic tools, that is, joint empirical orthogonal functions (EOF), fractional skill score (FSS), and spatial efficiency (SPAEF). Moreover, the present study made a novel contribution to spatial pattern evaluation by incorporating the uncertainty associated with the patterns through the "Quantile Regression' technique". The EOF analysis indicated a significant similarity between simulated and observed patterns. High scores for both the FSS and SPAEF metrics also revealed similarities between simulated and observed spatial patterns. Overall, the results show an acceptable spatial pattern performance of the hydrological model mimicking the observed spatial patterns across time. The uncertainty analysis represents reasonable predictive ranges, with a 95 per cent prediction uncertainty (PPU) band enclosing 80%-95% of AET and 79%-92% of the soil moisture observations. The present study demonstrated a framework for improving the basin's overall water balance analysis by incorporating a spatial pattern-based evaluation of hydrological models.

TI  - Azimuth-Sensitive Object Detection of High-Resolution SAR Images in Complex Scenes by Using a Spatial Orientation Attention Enhancement Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The scattering features of objects in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery are highly sensitive to different azimuth angles, and detecting azimuth-sensitive objects in complex scenes becomes a challenging task. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework called the spatial orientation attention enhancement network (SOAEN) by using aircraft detection in complex scenes of SAR imagery as a case study. Taking YOLOX as the basic framework, this framework introduces the inverted pyramid ConvMixer network (IPCN), the spatial-orientation-enhanced path aggregation feature pyramid network (SOEPAFPN), and the anchor-free decoupled head (AFDH) to achieve performance improvement. A spatial orientation attention module is proposed and introduced into the path aggregation feature pyramid network to form a new structure, the SOEPAFPN, for capturing feature transformations in different directions, highlighting object features and suppressing background effects; the IPCN is adapted to replace the backbone network of YOLOX for enhancing the multiscale feature extraction capability and reducing the computational complexity, while the AFDH is used to decouple object localization and classification to improve the efficiency and accuracy of object localization and classification. The experimental results of the multiple real complex scenes on Gaofen-3 1 m images show that the proposed method achieves the highest detection accuracy, with an average detection rate of 91.22% compared with the YOLO series networks.

TI  - Prediction of Snowmelt Days Using Binary Logistic Regression in the Umbria-Marche Apennines (Central Italy)
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover in a mountain area is a physical parameter that induces quite rapid changes in the landscape, from a geomorphological point of view. In particular, snowmelt plays a crucial role in the assessment of avalanche risk, so it is essential to know the days when snowmelt is expected, in order to prepare operational alert levels. Moreover, melting of the snow cover has a direct effect on the recharge of the water table, as well as on the regulation of the vegetative cycle of mountain plants. Therefore, a study on snowmelt, its persistence on the ground, and the height of the snow cover in the Umbria-Marche Apennines in central Italy is of great interest, since this is an area that is extremely poorly sampled and analysed. This study was conducted on the basis of four mountain weather stations equipped with a recently installed sonar-based snow depth gauge, so that a relatively short period, 2010-2020, was evaluated. A trend analysis revealed non-significant decreases in snow cover height and snow persistence time, in contrast to the significant increasing trend of mean temperature, while parameters such as relative humidity and wind speed did not appear to have a dominant trend. Further analysis showed relationships between snowmelt and the climatic parameters considered, leading to the definition of a mathematical model developed using the binary logistic regression technique, and having a predictive power of 82.6% in the case of days with snowmelt on the ground. The aim of this study was to be a first step towards models aimed at preventing avalanche risk, hydrological risk, and plant species adaptation, as well as providing a more complete definition of the climate of the study area.

TI  - Surface Displacement and Source Parameters of the 2021 Bandar-e Genaveh, Iran, Earthquake Determined from InSAR Observations
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - On 18 April 2021, a M-W 5.8 earthquake occurred near the city of Bandar-e Genaveh, southwestern Iran. Four synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, acquired from Sentinel-1 (ESA Copernicus project) satellites in ascending and descending orbits, were used to get two displacement maps, catching the surface co-seismic effects through the two-pass InSAR technique. Modeling the deformation patterns using equations for a shear dislocation in elastic half-space allowed the source parameters and the slip distribution of the seismogenic source to be determined. We calculated that the rupture occurred on a reverse fault extending NW-SE, gently dipping NE and with a maximum slip reaching about 1 m. The northeast and low-dip angle of this fault are also consistent with the tectonics of the region, which is subject to deformation and shortening along the northern margin of the Arabian plate. Our estimations of the fault parameters agree with the Zagros Foredeep reverse fault. We additionally processed four other SAR images to investigate the possibility that the Mw 5.0 aftershock, which occurred about one month later, induced surface effects visible with InSAR. This analysis, however, did not provide any clear conclusions.

TI  - Uncertainty in parameterizing a flux-based model of vegetation carbon phenology using ecosystem respiration
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The seasonal dynamics of plant communities are important indicators for assessment of long-term vegetation patterns and provide valuable information to predict ecosystem responses to climate change. However, increased frequency of extreme weather events can force ecosystems into unstable states, which leads to greater uncertainty in determining phenological metrics (e.g., growing season length). To better understand these uncertainties, we utilized 9 years of eddy covariance and remote sensing data to parameterize models of seasonal ecosystem respiration (Re) for two subtropical longleaf pine forests (mesic and xeric), with similar vegetation but different water holding capacity. We compared two commonly used algorithms to extract phenology metrics, the growth rate (GR) and third derivative (TD) methods, which are usually used without justification. We determined the impact of algorithm selection on estimating key biological dates related to plant community carbon dynamics (e.g., start, end, and length of physiologically active season, specifically Re), characterized the model's response to extreme weather events, and compared estimates to those derived via remotely sensed greenness from the enhanced vegetation index (EVI). We observed that periods of winter warming increased duration of physiological activity in terms of Re, and summer water limitation caused multi-peaked, asymmetric behavior, creating significant uncertainties. We found that choice of phenology metric extraction algorithm significantly impacted biological event dates; the GR method estimated longer phenophases than the TD in both sites, as well as earlier starting and later ending dates for phenophases. Because the TD method was unable to give estimates during the buffer period of phenophase transition under certain weather conditions, the GR method may be more suitable for studies in subtropical forests. Dates derived from EVI greenness rarely matched those of plant community seasonal dynamics models, especially in spring and summer. The estimated length of Re from the model was significantly longer than that derived from EVI, indicating that the use of EVI could result in shorter growing season estimates and greater uncertainty. Our results provide direction for optimization of future approaches to extract phenological metrics and better scientific understanding of forest land surface phenology, as weather anomalies become more common with climate change.

TI  - <i>RASGRF1</i>-rearranged Cutaneous Melanocytic Neoplasms With Spitzoid Cytomorphology A Clinicopathologic and Genetic Study of 3 Cases
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SURGICAL PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Spitz neoplasms, according to 2018 WHO Blue Book, are morphologically defined by spindled and/or epithelioid melanocytes and genetically by either HRAS mutations or kinase gene fusions. The terminology "spitzoid" refers to lesions with similar morphology but with alternate or undefined genetic anomalies. Herein, we present 3 melanocytic neoplasms with a spitzoid cytomorphology, variable nuclear atypia, and harboring undescribed fusions involving RASGRF1. Two cases presented as unpigmented papules on the heel of a 26-year-old female (case 1) and the forearm of a 13-year-old boy (case 2). They were classified as low-grade melanocytomas (WHO 2018). The third case appeared as a pigmented ulcer on the sole of a 72-year-old female (case 3) that displayed diagnostic features of an invasive melanoma (Breslow thickness 6 mm, Clark level V). A wide skin reexcision identified an epidermotropic metastasis, and sentinel lymph node biopsy displayed multiple subcapsular metastatic deposits. RNA sequencing revealed CD63::RASGRF1, EHBP1::RASGRF1, and ABCC2::RASGRF1 fusions in cases 1 to 3, respectively. They were confirmed by a RASGRF1 break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization technique. Translocations of RASGRF1, a gene coding a guanine nucleotide exchange factor but not a kinase, have rarely been reported in tumors. While all these cases showed spitzoid cytomorphology, it is too early to tell if they are true Spitz neoplasms as currently defined.

TI  - Initial Cross-Calibration of Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 Using the Simultaneous Underfly Event
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the launch of Landsat 9 in September 2021, an optimal opportunity for in-flight cross-calibration occurred when Landsat 9 flew underneath Landsat 8 while being moved into its final orbit. Since the two instruments host nearly identical imaging systems, the underfly event offered ideal cross-calibration conditions. The purpose of this work was to use the underfly imagery collected by the instruments to estimate cross-calibration parameters for Landsat 9 for a calibration update scheduled at the end of the on-orbit initial verification (OIV) period. Three types of uncertainty were considered: geometric, spectral, and angular (bidirectional reflectance distribution function-BRDF). Differences caused by geometric uncertainty were found to be negligible for this application. Spectral uncertainty was found to be minimal except for the green band when viewing vegetative targets. BRDF models derived from the MODIS BRDF product indicated substantial error could occur and required development of a mitigating methodology. With these three contributions of uncertainty properly addressed, it was estimated that the total cross-calibration uncertainty for underfly data could be kept under 1%. The data collected during the underfly were filtered to remove outliers based on uncertainty analysis. These data were used to calculate the TOA reflectance and radiance cross-calibration values for each spectral band by taking the ratio of Landsat 8 average pixel values to Landsat 9. Initial results of this approach indicated the cross-calibration may be as accurate as 0.5% in reflectance space and 1.0% in radiance space. The initial results developed in this study were used to refine the cross-calibration of Landsat 9 to Landsat 8 at the end of the OIV period.

TI  - Intelligent online guiding network regional planning based on software-driven autonomous communication system
T2  - AUTOMATED SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, with the rapid development of Internet technology, the large-scale popularization of smart phones, tablet computers and other intelligent terminal devices, and the gradual enrichment of 3G, 4G and other mobile network resources, the digital and mobile online guiding method is more and more accepted by people. At the same time, there are still many problems in online education, such as poor learning effect, enterprise profit difficulties and so on. At present, with the rapid development of higher education in China, the scale of higher education has achieved unprecedented growth, but there are also many problems, among which the more prominent problem is the unbalanced development of regional higher education. Therefore, it is necessary to adjust the regional structure of higher education so that higher education can become an inexhaustible driving force for regional development and promote the benign interaction and coordinated development between higher education and the region. The core idea of distributed communication system is to establish multiple call servers to provide services for users. The whole system adopts fully distributed structure, and a certain number of servers are deployed in each node of the network. The bearing capacity of the server is expanded to facilitate customers to access the communication network. Users can use the services provided by such a communication system anytime and anywhere, and realize real mobile communication. Based on the remote sensing deep learning method and the principle of distributed communication, this paper constructs intelligent online guiding network regional planning based on the remote sensing edge-driven distributed communication system with soft computing. Theough the modelling and simulation, the designed systen is proven to be effective.

TI  - Religion and empire in the life of a 16th century pilgrim
T2  - TOPOI-REVISTA DE HISTORIA
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper intends to study the life and thoughts of Francisco Barbosa, who was born in the middle of the 16th century, in the midst of a peasantry family, in the rural areas of northern Portugal. He visited several continents having many different occupations, from Portugal to Brazil, passing through Africa and Flanders. At a certain stage in his life, he ended up dedicating himself to the Jacobean pilgrimage. His life path was determined by two fundamental vectors: religion and empire. Under the pretext of studying Barbosa's existence, it is our aim to unveil aspects connected to the worldview of popular social strata, more specifically those of peasant families, which are usually understated by historiography in detriment of elites or institutions.

TI  - Mining Residues Characterization and Sentinel-2A Mapping for the Valorization and Efficient Resource Use by Multidisciplinary Strategy
T2  - MINERALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Raw materials are essential for all sectors of the economy as well as for all innovative technologies. Currently, industry is largely dependent on imports and consumption of these materials, and in the future, following the global energy transition, this trend will drastically increase. For this reason, it is necessary to develop new strategies to meet the supply-demand of raw materials by strategic sectors and technologies. To this end, mining residues are turning into viable raw materials sources as they represent reliable access to valuable resource supply. This work aims to validate a methodology providing more in-depth quali-quantitative information about 100 samples of mining residues collected in the Joda West mine (India) by multidisciplinary strategy in order to valorize and promote efficient resource use. In this paper, physicochemical and mineralogical characterization and hyperspectral signatures have been integrated with satellite Sentinel-2A data. In particular, the X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) analyses indicated the presence of mining residues samples rich in raw materials that were possible to spectrally distinguish in order to use them as input for the object-oriented classification of a satellite image. The satellite resulting map highlighted four different classes of mining residues with mean concentrations of around 36% for hematite, 23.5% for quartz, 9% for kaolinite and 5% for pyrolusite. These results represent the possibility of transforming an environmental problem (mining residues) into a resource potentially exploitable by industries knowing their composition and position in the study area. Moreover, by doing so, it will be possible to ensure sustainable consumption of the raw materials and to build resilient economies and societies, minimizing environmental degradation.

TI  - Sentinel Surveillance Contributes to Tracking Lyme Disease Spatiotemporal Risk Trends in Southern Quebec, Canada
T2  - PATHOGENS
M3  - Article
AB  - Lyme disease (LD) is a tick-borne disease which has been emerging in temperate areas in North America, Europe, and Asia. In Quebec, Canada, the number of human LD cases is increasing rapidly and thus surveillance of LD risk is a public health priority. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the ability of active sentinel surveillance to track spatiotemporal trends in LD risk. Using drag flannel data from 2015-2019, we calculated density of nymphal ticks (DON), an index of enzootic hazard, across the study region (southern Quebec). A Poisson regression model was used to explore the association between the enzootic hazard and LD risk (annual number of human cases) at the municipal level. Predictions from models were able to track both spatial and interannual variation in risk. Furthermore, a risk map produced by using model predictions closely matched the official risk map published by provincial public health authorities, which requires the use of complex criteria-based risk assessment. Our study shows that active sentinel surveillance in Quebec provides a sustainable system to follow spatiotemporal trends in LD risk. Such a network can support public health authorities in informing the public about LD risk within their region or municipality and this method could be extended to support Lyme disease risk assessment at the national level in Canada.

TI  - Individual Tree Species Classification Based on Convolutional Neural Networks and Multitemporal High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The classification of individual tree species (ITS) is beneficial to forest management and protection. Previous studies in ITS classification that are primarily based on airborne LiDAR and aerial photographs have achieved the highest classification accuracies. However, because of the complex and high cost of data acquisition, it is difficult to apply ITS classification in the classification of large-area forests. High-resolution, satellite remote sensing data have abundant sources and significant application potential in ITS classification. Based on Worldview-3 and Google Earth images, convolutional neural network (CNN) models were employed to improve the classification accuracy of ITS by fully utilizing the feature information contained in different seasonal images. Among the three CNN models, DenseNet yielded better performances than ResNet and GoogLeNet. It offered an OA of 75.1% for seven tree species using only the WorldView-3 image and an OA of 78.1% using the combinations of WorldView-3 and autumn Google Earth images. The results indicated that Google Earth images with suitable temporal detail could be employed as auxiliary data to improve the classification accuracy.

TI  - Analyses of a Lake Dust Source in the Middle East through Models Performance
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Drying lakes have become a new source of dust, causing severe problems in surrounding areas. From 2000 to 2017, a statistical study was conducted on Lake Urmia in Iran in the Middle East. The results indicated a significant increase in the annual number of dusty days in stations around the lake and the mean annual aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 550 nm. The sharp decrease in annual snowfall rate over the Lake Urmia area since 2007 has been linked to the lake's decreasing water level and drying. During a dust storm event from 27 October to 31 October 2017, a local dust storm originated from Lake Urmia before another large-scale dust storm originated from the An-Nafud desert. According to MODIS true-color images, dust particles were lifted from Lake Urmia and transported eastward to the Caspian Sea and the HYSPLIT model. The comparison of the four models under the Sand and Dust Storm Warning Advisory and Assessment System (SDS-WAS) revealed that the models overestimated surface dust concentrations compared to ground-based PM10 measurements. Nevertheless, the NOAA/WRF-Chem and DREAMABOL models simulated higher dust concentrations during the dust period. More emphasis should be placed on the development of dust models for SDS-WAS models in Lake Urmia.

TI  - REAL AND DECLARED INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM IN LEGISLATIVE ACTS ON FREEDOM OF RELIGION DURING THE SOVIET ERA
T2  - OCCASIONAL PAPERS ON RELIGION IN EASTERN EUROPE
M3  - Article
AB  - This article examines anthropological grounds for the formation of fundamental documents on freedom of conscience and religion in the Soviet Union. It also considers ideological prerequisites for the development of a new type of person-the Soviet man. A comparison is made between the two main ideological struggles with religious consciousness-state-church relations and the sphere of education. The separation of the church from the state and the state from the church, which were enshrined by the relevant decrees of the Soviet government, resulted in a false idea that the Soviet citizen is free in his/her worldview choice. However, a careful analysis of the implementation of the decrees on freedom of conscience shows a total lack of this freedom. The ideological machinery of the Soviet government widely used the spheres of education, culture, and religion to build a strong negative and degrading attitude towards believers and, on the contrary, a positive and exalting attitude towards atheists. Under such conditions, there emerged a type of person -an atheist, who was not capable of critically analyzing whether he/she had his/her own worldview freedoms and who was sure he/she had them in their absence.

TI  - Formation of the meaning of pedagogical activity in future teachers
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The effectiveness of any type of professional activity is associated with a clear and scientifically grounded understanding of its meaning. The article proves that the formation of the meaning of pedagogical activity should become one of the leading directions of the educational process in a professional pedagogical educational institution. The similar approaches of Russian and foreign scientists to the organization of professional training of future teachers are revealed, which consist in taking into account such components of the meaning of pedagogical activity as value, purpose and motive. The meaning of pedagogical activity is defined as a complex category of professional worldview that integrates the interconnected system of "values-goals-motives-actions", implemented in the aggregate of interactions of participants in the educational process. Among the main characteristics of the meaning of pedagogical activity, the following are highlighted: determination by the level of professional outlook and practical experience; determination by the sociohistorical context and features of the national education system, in which the personality of the future teacher is formed; dynamism and continuity of development; stability due to professional convictions; interrelation and interdependence of the meaning of life and professional activity of the teacher, as well as the meanings of the participants in the educational process. The results of the study of the opinions of future teachers (first year students and graduates) about the meaning of pedagogical activity are analyzed. The leading role of a professional educational institution in the formation of the meaning of pedagogical activity among future teachers is discovered. The methodological experience of the formation of the meaning of pedagogical activity among students of a pedagogical college is described. Within the framework of the "multi-technology" approach, methods of various educational technologies that can be combined in the formation of the meaning of pedagogical activity are highlighted. The forms and methods of organizing the educational process, the most effective in the formation of the meaning of pedagogical activity, are highlighted. These are problematic and heuristic questions and tasks, the solution of pedagogical situations, the discussion pedagogical club, the study of the activities and main ideas of humanist teachers in the course of an educational project and practice at school. It has been established that the content of academic disciplines should include such interrelated components as the meaning of the subject-subject interaction of the participants in the educational process, the meaning of the implementation of the mission of the teacher and the pupil, the meaning of professional self-education and self-development.

TI  - A Remote Sensing-Based Analysis of the Impact of Syrian Crisis on Agricultural Land Abandonment in Yarmouk River Basin
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we implemented a remote sensing-based approach for monitoring abandoned agricultural land in the Yarmouk River Basin (YRB) in Southern Syria and Northern Jordan during the Syrian crisis. A time series analysis for the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) was conducted using 1650 multi-temporal images from Landsat-5 and Landsat-8 between 1986 and 2021. We analyzed the agricultural phenological profiles and investigated the impact of the Syrian crisis on agricultural activities in YRB. The analysis was performed using JavaScript commands in Google Earth Engine. The results confirmed the impact of the Syrian crisis on agricultural land use. The phenological characteristics of NDVI and NDMI during the crisis (2013-2021) were compared to the phenological profiles for the period before the crisis (1986-2010). The NDVI and NDMI profiles had smooth, bell-shaped, and single beak NDVI and NDMI values during the period of crisis in comparison to those irregular phenological profiles for the period before the crisis or during the de-escalation/reconciliation period in the study area. The maximum average NDVI and NDMI values was found in March during the crisis, indicating the progress of natural vegetation and fallow land, while they fluctuated between March and April before the crisis or during the de-escalation/reconciliation period, indicating regular agricultural and cultivation practices.

TI  - Examining the Effects of Agricultural Aid on Forests in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Causal Analysis Based on Remotely Sensed Data of Sierra Leone
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - In sub-Saharan Africa, extreme poverty highlights the tension between development aid and the environment. Foreign aid is considered one of the most important factors affecting forest health in this region. Although many studies have empirically examined the effects of different kinds of foreign aid on forests, few have investigated the potential impact of agricultural aid. This study investigated the causal effects of agricultural aid on forests in Sierra Leone, a country that relies heavily on agricultural products. We constructed a fine-grained (16-day) indicator of forest growth from 2001 to 2015 by combining remotely sensed data of land cover and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. The high frequency of forest growth data enables us to trace the dynamic causal process. To reduce the confounding effects of heterogeneity, we applied a difference-in-difference design with data at the sub-national level to estimate the causal effect. This study provides robust empirical evidence that foreign agricultural aid harms forests both in the short term (i.e., 16 days) and long term (i.e., years) in Sierra Leone. Agricultural aid projects with agricultural development as their primary objective or aid projects without specific objectives lead to the highest levels of forest degradation.

TI  - Comparative Study of the 60 GHz and 118 GHz Oxygen Absorption Bands for Sounding Sea Surface Barometric Pressure
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The 60 GHz and 118 GHz oxygen absorption bands are prominent in the passive microwave remote sensing of atmospheric temperature, and also can be used for sounding sea surface barometric pressure (SSP). Microwave Temperature Sounder II (MWTS-II) has 13 channels in the 60 GHz band, and Microwave Humidity and Temperature Sounder (MWHTS) has 8 channels in the 118 GHz band. They are both carried on Fengyun-3C Satellite (FY-3C) and Fengyun-3D Satellite (FY-3D), which provide measurements for comparing the retrieval accuracies of SSP using 60 GHz and 118 GHz bands. In this study, based on the weighting functions for MWHTS and MWTS-II, the 60 GHz and 118 GHz channel combinations representing 60 GHz and 118 GHz are established, respectively, and the retrieval accuracies of SSP from these two channel combinations are compared in different weather conditions. The experimental results show that the retrieval accuracy of SSP at 60 GHz is higher than that of 118 GHz in clear, cloudy, and rainy sky conditions. In addition, the retrieval experiments of SSP from MWTS-II and MWHTS are also carried out, and the experimental results show that the retrieval accuracy of SSP from MWTS-II is higher. The comparative study of the 60 GHz and 118 GHz for sounding SSP can provide support for the theoretical study of microwave remote sensing of SSP with practical measurements, and further contribute to understand the performance of 60 GHz and 118 GHz in atmospheric sounding.

TI  - SAR Ship-Iceberg Discrimination in Arctic Conditions Using Deep Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Maritime surveillance of the Arctic region is of growing importance as shipping, fishing and tourism are increasing due to the sea ice retreat caused by global warming. Ships that do not identify themselves with a transponder system, so-called dark ships, pose a security risk. They can be detected by SAR satellites, which can monitor the vast Arctic region through clouds, day and night, with the caveat that the abundant icebergs in the Arctic cause false alarms. We collect and analyze 200 Sentinel-1 horizontally polarized SAR scenes from areas with high maritime traffic and from the Arctic region with a high density of icebergs. Ships and icebergs are detected using a continuous wavelet transform, which is optimized by correlating ships to known AIS positions. Globally, we are able to assign 72% of the AIS signals to a SAR ship and 32% of the SAR ships to an AIS signal. The ships are used to construct an annotated dataset of more than 9000 ships and ten times as many icebergs. The dataset is used for training several convolutional neural networks, and we propose a new network which achieves state of the art performance compared to previous ship-iceberg discrimination networks, reaching 93% validation accuracy. Furthermore, we collect a smaller test dataset consisting of 424 ships from 100 Arctic scenes which are correlated to AIS positions. This dataset constitutes an operational Arctic test scenario. We find these ships harder to classify with a lower test accuracy of 83%, because some of the ships sail near icebergs and ice floes, which confuses the classification algorithms.

TI  - Soils and landscapes of Marajo island, Brazilian Amazonia: Holocene evolution, geoarchaeology and climatic vulnerability
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazilian territory has a very extensive coastline, with more than 7500 km, and the largest and complex fluvio-marine archipelago on the planet, centred by Marajo Island, located in the Amazon River mouth, representing a key area for long-term sustainable management of coastal resources under threat of ongoing climate changes. Our study carried out the first detailed geoenvironmental stratification analysis to increase the knowledge of the largest and most heterogenous fluvial-estuarine landscape worldwide, and important sentinel of the global marine ecosystem's changes. Marajo Island is a very fragile and dynamic territory under global sea-level rise, demanding studies on a long-term response to such impacts. We used remote sensing technics to carry out the geoenvironmental stratification, coupled with soil characterization and landscape description. The results highlight the local complex social and environmental features and interplays, recording widespread evidence of part indigenous occupation (335-527 yr. B.P.) on present-day soils. The impacts of sea-level rise on mangrove ecosystem's, and old weathering soil profiles developed between 5300 and 3300 years (BP) during Holocene warmer, well-drained phases. The complexity of landscapes of the Amazon River mouth, and their dynamics, account for varying phases and modes of human occupation at the largest fluvio-marine environment. Soils are key elements, both influencing the human-constructed landscapes, and recording the physical and chemical inheritances of such cultural memories conciliate with signs of long-term climate change. Under constant processors of climate change, and accompanying human settlement dynamics, Marajo Island represents a remarkable laboratory to investigate how long-term environmental changes affect sustainable management resources of a large and fragile tropical estuary.

TI  - Does Angiosarcoma of the Breast Need Nodal Staging?
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF SURGEONS
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Breast angiosarcoma is a rare malignancy classically associated with hematogenous metastases. We sought to determine the prevalence of pathologic nodal involvement in patients with nonmetastatic, resected breast angiosarcoma and its association with overall survival.STUDY DESIGN: The National Cancer Database was used to identify patients with nonmetastatic angiosarcoma of the breast who underwent surgical resection from 2004 to 2017. The prevalence of regional lymph node operation and nodal positivity was calculated. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to evaluate overall survival among node-positive and node-negative patients. Cox proportional hazard modeling was used to evaluate the adjusted association of nodal positivity with overall survival.RESULTS: We included 991 patients with angiosarcoma. The median age was 69 years (interquartile range 57 to 78), and the cohort was 99% female. A total of 298 patients (30%) had pathologic regional nodal evaluation. Of those, 15 (5.0%) had positive regional lymph nodes. Node-positive patients had significantly worse survival than patients with negative regional lymph nodes. After adjusting for patient, tumor, and treatment factors, a positive regional lymph node was associated with worse overall survival compared with patients with no nodal evaluation (hazard ratio 3.20; 95% CI 1.75 to 5.86; p < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Patients with nonmetastatic angiosarcoma of the breast have a 5% regional lymph node positivity rate, which is at a common threshold to consider evaluation, and identifies patients with poor survival. A prospective study to determine performance characteristics of sentinel lymph node biopsy is warranted. (C) 2022 by the American College of Surgeons. Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

TI  - Field Testing Satellite-Derived Vegetation Health Indices for a Koala Habitat Managers Toolkit
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A Central Queensland University (CQU) partnership with the Queensland Government National Park management agency has developed a koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) habitat managers' toolkit for vegetation health assessment. Private and public landholders use the field-based toolkit to assess habitat suitability or monitor conservation outcomes for the koala-an iconic Australian arboreal herbivorous marsupial. The toolkit was upgraded recently with instructions to process European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite-derived selected vegetation maps for areal vegetation health trend monitoring. A field campaign sought to validate the relatively coarse spatial resolution derived indices (photosynthetic health, leaf area index and leaf water content) to verify their suitability for the habitat management decision-support toolkit. Other user requirement-driven criteria for including remote sensing in the toolkit were imagery and associated processing software costs and ease of map production for habitat managers without cost-effective access to spatial science skills. Despite moderate-to-low field and image vegetation proxy correlations, discussing the results with stakeholders indicates that, at a landscape scale, the use of cost-free, suitable temporal resolution, 10-m spatial resolution imagery is satisfactory when aligned with the design outcomes of a habitat health toolkit.

TI  - The Curious Case of ASASSN-20hx: A Slowly Evolving, UV- and X-Ray-Luminous, Ambiguous Nuclear Transient
T2  - ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - We present observations of ASASSN-20hx, a nearby ambiguous nuclear transient (ANT) discovered in NGC 6297 by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN). We observed ASASSN-20hx from -30 to 275 days relative to the peak UV/optical emission using high-cadence, multiwavelength spectroscopy and photometry. From Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite data, we determine that the ANT began to brighten on 2020 June 22.8 with a linear rise in flux for at least the first week. ASASSN-20hx peaked in the UV/optical 30 days later on 2020 July 22.8 (MJD = 59052.8) at a bolometric luminosity of L = (3.15 +/- 0.04) x 10(43) erg s(-1). The subsequent decline is slower than any TDE observed to date and consistent with many other ANTs. Compared to an archival X-ray detection, the X-ray luminosity of ASASSN-20hx increased by an order of magnitude to L ( x ) similar to 1.5 x 10(42) erg s(-1) and then slowly declined over time. The X-ray emission is well fit by a power law with a photon index of Gamma similar to 2.3-2.6. Both the optical and near-infrared spectra of ASASSN-20hx lack emission lines, unusual for any known class of nuclear transient. While ASASSN-20hx has some characteristics seen in both tidal disruption events and active galactic nuclei, it cannot be definitively classified with current data.

TI  - Robust Extraction of Soil Characteristics Using Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This research utilized various methods for extracting soil characteristics from Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS imagery in the Thua Thien Hue province, Vietnam. In this study, the Object-Based Oriented Classification (OBOC) method was used to extract information about land cover (focusing on rock outcrops) on the basis of the TGSI, NDVI, and NDBI indicators. The soil moisture information was determined by examining the correlation between the Land Surface Temperature (LST) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The findings indicated that 40 locations in the study area were covered with rock outcrops, with a Kappa index of 85.10%. In addition, soil moisture varied markedly from the sandy coastal regions, urban areas, and hilly and mountainous areas on the study area's surface. The extracted soil information can serve as a foundation for local socio-economic development planning.

TI  - Continuous Monitoring of the Surface Water Area in the Yellow River Basin during 1986-2019 Using Available Landsat Imagery and the Google Earth Engine
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Yellow River Basin (YRB) has been facing severe water shortages; hence, the long-term dynamic monitoring of its surface water area (SWA) is essential for the efficient utilization of its water resources and sustainable socioeconomic development. In order to detect the changing trajectory of the SWA of the YRB and its influencing factors, we used available Landsat images from 1986 through to 2019 and a water and vegetation indices-based method to analyze the spatial-temporal variability of four types of SWAs (permanent, seasonal, maximum and average extents), and their relationship with precipitation (Pre), temperature (Temp), leaf area index (LAI) and surface soil moisture (SM).The multi-year average permanent surface water area (SWA) and seasonal SWA accounted for 46.48% and 53.52% in the Yellow River Basin (YRB), respectively. The permanent and seasonal water bodies were dominantly distributed in the upper reaches, accounting for 70.22% and 48.79% of these types, respectively. The rate of increase of the permanent SWA was 49.82 km(2)/a, of which the lower reaches contributed the most (34.34%), and the rate of decrease of the seasonal SWA was 79.18 km(2)/a, of which the contribution of the source region was the highest (25.99%). The seasonal SWA only exhibited decreasing trends in 13 sub-basins, accounting for 15% of all of the sub-basins, which indicates that the decrease in the seasonal SWA was dominantly caused by the change in the SWA in the main river channel region. The conversions from seasonal water to non-water bodies, and from seasonal to permanent water bodies were the dominant trends from 1986 to 2019 in the YRB. The SWA was positively correlated with precipitation, and was negatively correlated with the temperature. Because the permanent and seasonal water bodies were dominantly distributed in the river channel region and sub-basins, respectively, the change in the permanent SWA was significantly affected by the regulation of the major reservoirs, whereas the change in the seasonal SWA was more closely related to climate change. The increase in the soil moisture was helpful in the formation of the permanent water bodies. The increased evapotranspiration induced by vegetation greening played a significant positive role in the SWA increase via the local cooling and humidifying effects, which offset the accelerated water surface evaporation caused by the atmospheric warming.

TI  - High-resolution satellite images combined with hydrological modeling derive river discharge for headwaters: A step toward discharge estimation in ungauged basins
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The reliance on ground-based measurements has been a long-standing barrier toward deriving river discharge for ungauged headwaters, which are quite sensitive to climate change due to relatively high contributions of snow and glacier meltwater to river discharge. In addition, information pertaining to discharge is scarce and inconsistent across the globe due to economic, geographic, and political reasons. Therefore, understanding spatiotemporal dynamics of river discharge in ungauged headwaters is extremely challenging, particularly in high mountain regions such as the Tibetan Plateau (TP). This study presents a methodology of estimating daily continuous discharge using multisource remote sensing and a hydrological model that can simulate cryospheric processes including snow and glacier accumulation and melt. The hydrological model is forced and calibrated purely by satellite-observed information, particularly by river widths derived from high-spatial-resolution images without using in situ river discharge measurements. Poorly gauged or ungauged headwaters with river widths on the order of 100 m, including the Lhasa (the tributary of the upper Brahmaputra River), Salween, Mekong, and Yangtze rivers originating on the TP were chosen to test the methodology. At-a-section river widths were derived from high-resolution satellite images (i.e., IKONOS, QuickBird, RapidEye-1/2/4/5, GeoEye-1, and WorldView-2) and Landsat archives. As exemplified by the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient values (NSE) (up to 0.8 and higher than 0.5 overall), simulated daily continuous discharge was reliable in the four testbeds with different river bathymetry, narrow river widths, and complex terrain. Uncertainties associated with the accuracy, number, and variability of calibration references (i.e., remotely sensed widths) and optimization algorithms were fully discussed. This study highlights the potential of deriving daily continuous discharge without a priori information on river flow, paving the way for discharge estimation in ungauged headwaters globally and providing important implications for satellite-based discharge estimation in narrow rivers across high-mountain regions.

TI  - A Novel Fusion Method for Generating Surface Soil Moisture Data With High Accuracy, High Spatial Resolution, and High Spatio-Temporal Continuity
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface soil moisture (SSM) has a considerable impact on land-atmosphere exchanges of water and energy fluxes. However, due to the inherent deficiencies of remotely sensed data (e.g., cloud contamination in thermal remote sensing and coarse resolutions for microwave remote sensing), none of the current algorithms alone can provide daily and seamless field-scale (30 m) SSM information. To fill the gap, we proposed a novel SSM fusion framework to Generate high Resolution, Accurate, Seamless data using Point-Surface fusion (GRASPS) based on remotely sensed, reanalysis, and in-situ data sets. First, 30 m seamless continuous SSM correlated variables (land surface temperature, NDVI, and albedo) were downscaled by enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model. Then, downscaled auxiliary variables and other background variables were input into a deep learning model to produce 30 m daily and seamless SSM fields. To further improve the SSM estimation accuracy, a pixel classification-based bias correction method was developed. The GRASPS method was validated over an in situ soil moisture sensor network (HOAL network) in Austria. The average Pearson correlation coefficient, root mean square error (RMSE), unbiased RMSE (ubRMSE), bias, and mean absolute error (MAE) over all validation sites achieved 0.78, 0.048, 0.033, -0.001, and 0.041 m(3)m(-3) respectively. After bias correction, RMSE, ubRMSE, bias, and MAE decreased by 13%, 7%, 22%, and 18%, respectively. The proposed method maximizes the potential of data fusion and deep learning in generating field-scale seamless SSM, which is promising for fine-scale studies and applications in agricultural, hydrological, and environmental domains.

TI  - High-Resolution Mapping of Winter Cereals in Europe by Time Series Landsat and Sentinel Images for 2016-2020
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Winter cereals, including wheat, rye, barley, and triticale, are important food crops, and it is crucial to identify the distribution of winter cereals for monitoring crop growth and predicting yield. The production and plating area of winter cereals in Europe both contribute 12.57% to the total global cereal production and plating area in 2020. However, the distribution maps of winter cereals with high spatial resolution are scarce in Europe. Here, we first used synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data from Sentinel-1 A/B, in the Interferometric Wide (IW) swath mode, to distinguish rapeseed and winter cereals; we then used a time-weighted dynamic time warping (TWDTW) method to discriminate winter cereals from other crops by comparing the similarity of seasonal changes in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Landsat and Sentinel-2 images. We generated winter cereal maps for 2016-2020 that cover 32 European countries with 30 m spatial resolution. Validation using field samples obtained from the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform show that the producer's and user's accuracies are 91% +/- 7.8% and 89% +/- 10.3%, respectively, averaged over 32 countries in Europe. The winter cereal map agrees well with agricultural census data for planted winter cereal areas at municipal and country levels, with the averaged coefficient of determination R-2 as 0.77 +/- 0.15 for 2016-2019. In addition, our method can identify the distribution of winter cereals two months before harvest, with an overall accuracy of 88.4%, indicating that TWDTW is an effective method for timely crop growth monitoring and identification at the continent level. The winter cereal maps in Europe are available via an open-data repository.

TI  - Intercomparison of Real and Simulated GEDI Observations across Sclerophyll Forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest structure is an important variable in ecology, fire behaviour, and carbon management. New spaceborne lidar sensors, such as the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI), enable forest structure to be mapped at a global scale. Virtual GEDI-like observations can be derived from airborne laser scanning (ALS) data for given locations using the GEDI simulator, which was a tool initially developed for GEDI's pre-launch calibration. This study compares the relative height (RH) and ground elevation metrics of real and simulated GEDI observations against ALS-derived benchmarks in southeast Australia. A total of 15,616 footprint locations were examined, covering a large range of forest types and topographic conditions. The impacts of canopy cover and height, terrain slope, and ALS point cloud density were assessed. The results indicate that the simulator produces more accurate canopy height (RH95) metrics (RMSE: 4.2 m, Bias: -1.3 m) than the actual GEDI sensor (RMSE: 9.6 m, Bias: -1.6 m). Similarly, the simulator outperforms GEDI in ground detection accuracy. In contrast to other studies, which favour the Gaussian algorithm for ground detection, we found that the Maximum algorithm performed better in most settings. Despite the determined differences between real and simulated GEDI observations, this study indicates the compatibility of both data sources, which may enable their combined use in multitemporal forest structure monitoring.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variation in Land Use Land Cover in the Response to Local Climate Change Using Multispectral Remote Sensing Data
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is likely to have serious social, economic, and environmental impacts on farmers whose subsistence depends on nature. Land Use Land Cover (LULC) changes were examined as a significant tool for assessing changes at diverse temporal and spatial scales. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) has the potential ability to signify the vegetation structures of various eco-regions and provide valuable information as a remote sensing tool in studying vegetation phenology cycles. In this study, we used remote sensing and Geographical Information System (GIS) techniques with Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC) to identify the LULC changes for 40 years in the Sahiwal District. Later, we conducted 120 questionnaires administered to local farmers which were used to correlate climate changes with NDVI. The LULC maps were prepared using MLC and training sites for the years 1981, 2001, and 2021. Regression analysis (R-2) was performed to identify the relationship between temperature and vegetation cover (NDVI) in the study area. Results indicate that the build-up area was increased from 7203.76 ha (2.25%) to 31,081.3 ha (9.70%), while the vegetation area decreased by 14,427.1 ha (4.5%) from 1981 to 2021 in Sahiwal District. The mean NDVI values showed that overall NDVI values decreased from 0.24 to 0.20 from 1981 to 2021. Almost 78% of farmers stated that the climate has been changing during the last few years, 72% of farmers stated that climate change had affected agriculture, and 53% of farmers thought that rainfall intensity had also decreased. The R-2 tendency showed that temperature and NDVI were negatively connected to each other. This study will integrate and apply the best and most suitable methods, tools, and approaches for equitable local adaptation and governance of agricultural systems in changing climate conditions. Therefore, this research outcome will also meaningfully help policymakers and urban planners for sustainable LULC management and strategies at the local level.

TI  - Augmentation-Based Methodology for Enhancement of Trees Map Detalization on a Large Scale
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing tasks play a very important role in the domain of sensing and measuring, and can be very specific. Advances in computer vision techniques allow for the extraction of various information from remote sensing satellite imagery. This information is crucial in making quantitative and qualitative assessments for monitoring of forest clearing in protected areas for power lines, as well as for environmental analysis, in particular for making assessments of carbon footprint, which is a highly relevant task. Solving these problems requires precise segmentation of the forest mask. Although forest mask extraction from satellite data has been considered previously, no open-access applications are able to provide the high-detailed forest mask. Detailed forest masks are usually obtained using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) that set particular limitations such as cost and inapplicability for vast territories. In this study, we propose a novel neural network-based approach for high-detailed forest mask creation. We implement an object-based augmentation technique for a minimum amount of labeled high-detailed data. Using this augmented data we fine-tune the models, which are trained on a large forest dataset with less precise labeled masks. The provided algorithm is tested for multiple territories in Russia. The Fl-score, for small details (such as individual trees) was improved to 0.929 compared to the baseline score of 0.856. The developed model is available in an SAAS platform. The developed model allows a detailed and precise forest mask to be easily created, which then be used for solving various applied problems.

TI  - Assessment of the Usefulness of Spectral Bands for the Next Generation of Sentinel-2 Satellites by Reconstruction of Missing Bands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-2 constellation has been providing high spatial, spectral and temporal resolution optical imagery of the continental surfaces since 2015. The spatial and temporal resolution improvements that Sentinel-2 brings with respect to previous systems have been demonstrated in both the literature and operational applications. On the other hand, the spectral capabilities of Sentinel-2 appear to have been exploited to a limited extent only. At the moment of definition of the new generation of Sentinel-2 satellites, an assessment of the usefulness of the current available spectral bands seems appropriate. In this work, we investigate the unique information contained by each 20 m resolution Sentinel-2 band. A statistical quantitative approach is adopted in order to yield conclusions that are application agnostic: multivariate regression is used to reconstruct some bands, using the others as predictors. We conclude that, for most observed surfaces, it is possible to reconstruct the reflectances of most red edge or NIR bands from the rest of the observed bands with an accuracy within the radiometric requirements of Sentinel-2. Removing two of those bands could be possible at the cost of slightly higher reconstruction errors. We also identify mission scenarios for which several of the current Sentinel-2 bands could be removed for the next generation of sensors.

TI  - Enhanced Feature Pyramid Vision Transformer for Semantic Segmentation on Thailand Landsat-8 Corpus
T2  - INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Semantic segmentation on Landsat-8 data is crucial in the integration of diverse data, allowing researchers to achieve more productivity and lower expenses. This research aimed to improve the versatile backbone for dense prediction without convolutions-namely, using the pyramid vision transformer (PRM-VS-TM) to incorporate attention mechanisms across various feature maps. Furthermore, the PRM-VS-TM constructs an end-to-end object detection system without convolutions and uses handcrafted components, such as dense anchors and non-maximum suspension (NMS). The present study was conducted on a private dataset, i.e., the Thailand Landsat-8 challenge. There are three baselines: DeepLab, Swin Transformer (Swin TF), and PRM-VS-TM. Results indicate that the proposed model significantly outperforms all current baselines on the Thailand Landsat-8 corpus, providing Fl-scores greater than 80% in almost all categories. Finally, we demonstrate that our model, without utilizing pre-trained settings or any further post-processing, can outperform current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for both agriculture and forest classes.

TI  - Remote Sensing Survey of Altiplano-Puna Volcanic Complex Rocks and Minerals for Planetary Analog Use
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Altiplano-Puna Volcanic Complex (APVC) of the Central Andes is an arid region with extensive volcanism, possessing various geological features comparable to those of other solar system objects. The unique features of the APVC, e.g., hydrothermal fields and evaporite salars, have been used as planetary analogs before, but the complexity of the APVC presents a wealth of opportunities for more analog studies that have not been exploited previously. Motivated by the potential of using the APVC as an analog of the volcanic terrains of solar system objects, we mapped the mineralogy and silica content of the APVC up to similar to 100,000 km(2) in northern Chile based on a combination of remote sensing data resembling those of the Moon and Mars. The band ratio indices of Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager multispectral images and mineral classifications based on spectral hourglass approach using Earth Observing-1 Hyperion hyperspectral images (both in the visible to shortwave infrared wavelengths) were used to map iron-bearing and alteration minerals. We also used Hyperion imagery to detect feldspar spectral signatures and demonstrated that feldspar minerals can be detected on non-anorthosites, which may influence interpretations of feldspar spectral signatures on Mars. From the Terra Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer Global Emissivity Dataset, we derived the silica percentage of non-evaporite rocks within errors of approximately 2-3 wt.% SiO2 for those in the 60-70 wt.% range (about 8 wt.% errors for the 50-60 wt.% range). Based on an integrated assessment of the three datasets, we highlighted three regions of particular interest worthy of further field investigation. We also evaluated the benefits and limitations of all three remote sensing methods for mapping key minerals and capturing rock diversity, based on available samples and existing geological maps.

TI  - Evaluating Seagrass Meadow Dynamics by Integrating Field-Based and Remote Sensing Techniques
T2  - PLANTS-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine phanerogams are considered biological sentinels or indicators since any modification in seagrass meadow distribution and coverage signals negative changes in the marine environment. In recent decades, seagrass meadows have undergone global losses at accelerating rates, and almost one-third of their coverage has disappeared globally. This study focused on the dynamics of seagrass meadows in the northern Adriatic Sea, which is one of the most anthropogenically affected areas in the Mediterranean Sea. Seagrass distribution data and remote sensing products were utilized to identify the stable and dynamic parts of the seagrass ecosystem. Different seagrass species could not be distinguished with the Sentinel-2 (BOA) satellite image. However, results revealed a generally stable seagrass meadow (283.5 Ha) but, on the other hand, a stochastic behavior in seagrass meadow retraction (90.8 Ha) linked to local environmental processes associated with anthropogenic activities or climate change. If systemized, this proposed approach to monitoring seagrass meadow dynamics could be developed as a spatial decision support system for the entire Mediterranean basin. Such a tool could serve as a key element for decision makers in marine protected areas and would potentially support more effective conservation and management actions in these highly productive and important environments.

TI  - HDOP and VDOP Analysis in an Ideal Placement Environment for Dual GNSSs
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing the number of satellites in a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) improves the positioning accuracy and increases availability. However, it reduces the positioning accuracy improvement rate and increases the calculation loads, which can cause battery usage problems in mobile devices using a GNSS. An appropriate satellite selection method is required. One current method entails the use of ideal satellite placement with respect to the minimum geometric dilution of precision (GDOP). In this study, the described ideal satellite placement with the minimum GDOP were divided in terms of the horizontal dilution of precision (HDOP) and vertical dilution of precision (VDOP). HDOP and VDOP were mathematically derived and analyzed. The derived formula was verified using simulations. The analysis was performed with actual dual GNSS satellite data. The satellites adjacent to the ideal placement were selected and the DOP was calculated. Simply selecting satellites closest to the ideal placement afforded large values for HDOP and VDOP. This issue was addressed using a satellite changing algorithm considering the dual GNSS, resulting in reduced values of the HDOP and VDOP.

TI  - Integration of Satellite-Based Optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar Imagery to Estimate Winter Cover Crop Performance in Cereal Grasses
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The magnitude of ecosystem services provided by winter cover crops is linked to their performance (i.e., biomass and associated nitrogen content, forage quality, and fractional ground cover), although few studies quantify these characteristics across the landscape. Remote sensing can produce landscape-level assessments of cover crop performance. However, commonly employed optical vegetation indices (VI) saturate, limiting their ability to measure high-biomass cover crops. Contemporary VIs that employ red-edge bands have been shown to be more robust to saturation issues. Additionally, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data have been effective at estimating crop biophysical characteristics, although this has not been demonstrated on winter cover crops. We assessed the integration of optical (Sentinel-2) and SAR (Sentinel-1) imagery to estimate winter cover crops biomass across 27 fields over three winter-spring seasons (2018-2021) in Maryland. We used log-linear models to predict cover crop biomass as a function of 27 VIs and eight SAR metrics. Our results suggest that the integration of the normalized difference red-edge vegetation index (NDVI_RE1; employing Sentinel-2 bands 5 and 8A), combined with SAR interferometric (InSAR) coherence, best estimated the biomass of cereal grass cover crops. However, these results were seasonand species-specific (R-2 = 0.74, 0.81, and 0.34; RMSE = 1227, 793, and 776 kg ha(-1), for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), triticale (Triticale hexaploide L.), and cereal rye (Secale cereale), respectively, in spring (March-May)). Compared to the optical-only model, InSAR coherence improved biomass estimations by 4% in wheat, 5% in triticale, and by 11% in cereal rye. Both optical-only and optical-SAR biomass prediction models exhibited saturation occurring at similar to 1900 kg ha(-1); thus, more work is needed to enable accurate biomass estimations past the point of saturation. To address this continued concern, future work could consider the use of weather and climate variables, machine learning models, the integration of proximal sensing and satellite observations, and/or the integration of process-based crop-soil simulation models and remote sensing observations.

TI  - The Relative Roles of Climate Variation and Human Activities in Vegetation Dynamics in Coastal China from 2000 to 2019
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation in the terrestrial ecosystem, sensitive to climate change and human activities, exerts a crucial influence on the carbon cycles in land, ocean, and atmosphere. Discrimination between climate and human-induced vegetation dynamics is advocated but still limited, especially in coastal China, which is characterized by a developed economy, a large population, and high food production, but also by unprecedented climate change and warming. Taking coastal China as the research area, our study used the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in growing seasons, as well as precipitation, temperature, and sunlight hours datasets, adopted residual trend analysis at pixel and regional scales in coastal China from 2000-2019 and aims to (1) delineate the patterns and processes of vegetation changes, and (2) separate the relative contributions of climate and human activities by adopting residual trend analysis. The results indicated that (1) coastal China experienced the most vegetation greening (83.04% of the whole region) and partial degradation (16.86% of the whole region) with significant spatial heterogeneity; (2) compared with climate change, human activities have a greater positive impact on NDVI, and the regions were mainly located in the north of the North China Plain and the south of southern China; (3) the relative contribution rates of climate change and human activities were detected to be 0-60% and 60-100%, respectively; (4) in the northern coastal areas, the improvement of cultivated land management greatly promoted the greening of vegetation and thus the increase of grain yield, while in southern coastal areas, afforestation and the restoration of degraded forest were responsible for vegetation restoration; and (5) similar results obtained by partial correlation between nighttime lights and NDVI indicated the reliability of the residual trend analysis. The linear relationships of precipitation, temperature, and radiation on NDVI may limit the accurate estimation of climate drivers on vegetation, and further ecosystem process-modeling approaches can be used to estimate the relative contribution of climate change and human activities. The findings in our research emphasized that the attribution for vegetation dynamics with heterogeneity can provide evidence for the designation of rational ecological conservation policies.

TI  - Remote Sensing-Based Assessment of the Water-Use Efficiency of Maize over a Large, Arid, Regional Irrigation District
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantitative assessment of crop water-use efficiency (WUE) is an important basis for high-efficiency use of agricultural water. Here we assess the WUE of maize in the Hetao Irrigation District, which is a representative irrigation district in the arid region of Northwest China. Specifically, we firstly mapped the location of the maize field by using a remote sensing/phenological-based vegetation classifier and then quantified the maize water use and yield by using a dual-source remote-sensing evapotranspiration (ET) model and a crop water production function, respectively. Validation results show that the adopted phenological-based vegetation classifier performed well in mapping the spatial distributions and inter-annual variations of maize planting, with a kappa coefficient of 0.86. In addition, the ET model based on the hybrid dual-source scheme and trapezoid framework also obtained high accuracy in spatiotemporal ET mapping, with an RMSE of 0.52 mm/day at the site scale and 26.21 mm/year during the maize growing season (April-October) at the regional scale. Further, the adopted crop water production function showed high accuracy in estimating the maize yield, with a mean relative error of only 4.3%. Using the estimated ET, transpiration, and yield of maize, the mean maize WUE based on ET and transpiration in the study region were1.94 kg/m(3) and 3.06 kg/m(3), respectively. Our results demonstrate the usefulness and validity of remote sensing information in mapping regional crop WUE.

TI  - Climatic and Topographical Effects on the Spatiotemporal Variations of Vegetation in Hexi Corridor, Northwestern China
T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Oases, as complex geographical landscapes, are strongly influenced by both natural variation and human activities. However, they have degenerated because of unplanned land use and water resource development. The research of oasis changes has mostly discussed single components, but multiple components, especially spatial changes to oasis vegetation, need further strengthening. Land use and NDVI were extracted based on Landsat 5/8 and Mod13A3, respectively, and a transfer matrix was constructed to analyze changes of land use in the Hexi Corridor during 2000-2020. The significant changes in the area of each land use were also quantified. Combined with regional temperature and precipitation, interpolated from meteorological data, the correlations between regional temperature, precipitation, and vegetation coverage were calculated, especially in the quantized areas with significant associations. The results showed that the area of bare land or desert decreased, while the areas of agricultural and residential land increased. The normalized difference NDVI of the studied oases increased at the rate of 0.021 per decade, which was positively related to precipitation (p < 0.05), rather than temperature; of which, farmland and planted grass land were 55.65% and 33.79% in the significantly increased area. In the area of significant positive relation between NDVI and precipitation, the ratio of grassland, farmland, and forest was 79.21%, 12.82%, and 4.06%, respectively. Additionally, changes in oasis vegetation were determined primarily by agricultural activities, which reflected a combination of natural and anthropic influences.

TI  - A Cloud Classification Method Based on a Convolutional Neural Network for FY-4A Satellites
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The study of cloud types is critical for understanding atmospheric motions and climate predictions; for example, accurately classified cloud products help improve meteorological predicting accuracies. However, the current satellite cloud classification methods generally analyze the threshold change in a single pixel and do not consider the relationship between the surrounding pixels. The classification development relies heavily on human recourses and does not fully utilize the data-driven advantages of computer models. Here, a new intelligent cloud classification method based on the U-Net network (CLP-CNN) is developed to obtain more accurate, higher frequency, and larger coverage cloud classification products. The experimental results show that the CLP-CNN network can complete a cloud classification task of 800 x 800 pixels in 0.9 s. The classification area covers most of China, and the classification task only needs to use the original L1-level data, which can meet the requirements of a real-time operation. With the Himawari-8 CLTYPE product and the CloudSat 2B-CLDCLASS product as the test comparison target, the CLP-CNN network results match the Himawari-8 product highly, by 84.4%. The probability of detection (POD) is greater than 0.83 for clear skies, deep-convection, and Cirrus-Stratus type clouds. The probability of detection (POD) and accuracy are improved compared with other deep learning methods.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Global Sea Surface pH Based on Massive Underway Data and Machine Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Seawater pH is a direct proxy of ocean acidification, and monitoring the global pH distribution and long-term series changes is critical to understanding the changes and responses of the marine ecology and environment under climate change. Owing to the lack of sufficient global-scale pH data and the complex relationship between seawater pH and related environmental variables, generating time-series products of satellite-derived global sea surface pH poses a great challenge. In this study, we solved the problem of the lack of sufficient data for pH algorithm development by using the massive underway sea surface carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCO(2)) dataset to structure a large data volume of near in situ pH based on carbonate calculation between underway pCO(2) and calculated total alkalinity from sea surface salinity and relevant parameters. The remote sensing inversion model of pH was then constructed through this massive pH training dataset and machine learning methods. After several tests of machine learning methods and groups of input parameters, we chose the random forest model with longitude, latitude, sea surface temperature (SST), chlorophyll a (Chla), and Mixed layer depth (MLD) as model inputs with the best performance of correlation coefficient (R-2 = 0.96) and root mean squared error (RMSE = 0.008) in the training set and R-2 = 0.83 (RMSE = 0.017) in the testing set. The sensitivity analysis of the error variation induced by the uncertainty of SST and Chla (SST <= +/- 0.5 degrees C and Chla <= +/- 20%; RMSESST <= 0.011 and RMSEChla <= 0.009) indicated that our sea surface pH model had good robustness. Monthly average global sea surface pH products from 2004 to 2019 with a spatial resolution of 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees were produced based on the satellite-derived SST and Chla products and modeled MLD dataset. The pH model and products were validated using another independent station-measured pH dataset from the Global Ocean Data Analysis Project (GLODAP), showing good performance. With the time-series pH products, refined interannual variability and seasonal variability were presented, and trends of pH decline were found globally. Our study provides a new method of directly using remote sensing to invert pH instead of indirect calculation based on the construction of massive underway calculated pH data, which would be made useful by comparing it with satellite-derived pCO(2) products to understand the carbonate system change and the ocean ecological environments responding to the global change.

TI  - Parcel-Level Mapping of Horticultural Crop Orchards in Complex Mountain Areas Using VHR and Time-Series Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and reliable farmland crop mapping is an important foundation for relevant departments to carry out agricultural management, crop planting structure adjustment and ecological assessment. The current crop identification work mainly focuses on conventional crops, and there are few studies on parcel-level mapping of horticultural crops in complex mountainous areas. Using Miaohou Town, China, as the research area, we developed a parcel-level method for the precise mapping of horticultural crops in complex mountainous areas using very-high-resolution (VHR) optical images and Sentinel-2 optical time-series images. First, based on the VHR images with a spatial resolution of 0.55 m, the complex mountainous areas were divided into subregions with their own independent characteristics according to a zoning and hierarchical strategy. The parcels in the different study areas were then divided into plain, greenhouse, slope and terrace parcels according to their corresponding parcel characteristics. The edge-based model RCF and texture-based model DABNet were subsequently used to extract the parcels according to the characteristics of different regions. Then, Sentinel-2 images were used to construct the time-series characteristics of different crops, and an LSTM algorithm was used to classify crop types. We then designed a parcel filling strategy to determine the categories of parcels based on the classification results of the time-series data, and accurate parcel-level mapping of a horticultural crop orchard in a complex mountainous area was finally achieved. Based on visual inspection, this method appears to effectively extract farmland parcels from VHR images of complex mountainous areas. The classification accuracy reached 93.01%, and the Kappa coefficient was 0.9015. This method thus serves as a methodological reference for parcel-level horticultural crop mapping and can be applied to the development of local precision agriculture.

TI  - Pre-Seismic Temporal Integrated Anomalies from Multiparametric Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pre-seismic anomalies have the potential to indicate imminent strong earthquakes in the short to medium terms. However, an improved understanding of the statistical significance between anomalies and earthquakes is required to develop operational forecasting systems. We developed a temporal integrated anomaly (TIA) method to obtain the temporal trends of multiparametric anomalies derived from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) product before earthquakes. A total of 169 global earthquakes that occurred from 2006 to 2020 and had magnitudes of >= 7.0 and focal depths of <= 70 km were used to test this new method in a retrospective manner. In addition, 169 synthetic earthquakes were randomly generated to demonstrate the suppression capacity of the TIA method for false alarms. We identified four different TIA trends according to the temporal characteristics of positive and negative TIAs. Long-term correlation analyses show that the recognition ability was 12.4-28.4% higher for true earthquakes than for synthetic earthquakes (i.e., higher than that of a random guess). Incorporating 2-5 kinds of TIAs offered the best chance of recognizing imminent shocks, highlighting the importance of multiparameter anomalies. Although the TIA trend characteristics before the earthquakes were not unique, we identified certain unexplained pre-seismic phenomena within the remote sensing data. The results provide new insight into the relationships between pre-seismic anomalies and earthquakes; moreover, the recognition ability of the proposed approach exceeds that of random guessing.

TI  - Accounting for Almond Crop Water Use under Different Irrigation Regimes with a Two-Source Energy Balance Model and Copernicus-Based Inputs
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accounting for water use in agricultural fields is of vital importance for the future prospects for enhancing water use efficiency. Remote sensing techniques, based on modelling surface energy fluxes, such as the two-source energy balance (TSEB), were used to estimate actual evapotranspiration (ETa) on the basis of shortwave and thermal data. The lack of high temporal and spatial resolution of satellite thermal infrared (TIR) missions has led to new approaches to obtain higher spatial resolution images with a high revisit time. These new approaches take advantage of the high spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 (10-20 m), and the high revisit time of Sentinel-3 (daily). The use of the TSEB model with sharpened temperature (TSEBS2+S3) has recently been applied and validated in several study sites. However, none of these studies has applied it in heterogeneous row crops under different water status conditions within the same orchard. This study assessed the TSEBS2+S3 modelling approach to account for almond crop water use under four different irrigation regimes and over four consecutive growing seasons (2017-2020). The energy fluxes were validated with an eddy covariance system and also compared with a soil water balance model. The former reported errors of 90 W/m(2) and 87 W/m(2) for the sensible (H) and latent heat flux (LE), respectively. The comparison of ETa with the soil water balance model showed a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) ranging from 0.6 to 2.5 mm/day. Differences in cumulative ETa between the irrigation treatments were estimated, with maximum differences obtained in 2019 of 20% to 13% less in the most water-limited treatment compared to the most well-watered one. Therefore, this study demonstrates the feasibility of using the TSEBS2+S3 for monitoring ETa in almond trees under different water regimes.

TI  - Tocqueville's paradoxical formulation of secularization in America and the new worldview of the crisis of philosophy in the modernity
T2  - EIKASIA-REVISTA DE FILOSOFIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The present article aims to analyze the paradoxical situation presented by the secularization in America reconstructed by Tocqueville. Bearing this postulate in mind, we will show the rupture that is established with respect to the Enlightenment on the issue of secularization, in order to discover a new variant of the crisis of philosophy that remains linked to the new organizational structure of modern democratic societies. Likewise, we will show how Tocqueville's liberal profile shows itself to be superior to the Eurocentric versions on the issue of the crisis of philosophy, insofar as its devaluation does not come solely from methodological anomalies, but from the change in intellectual authority brought about by secularization. to empower public opinion. For this reason, we will finally proceed to show to what extent the novelty of the paradox of secularization in America reconstructed by Tocqueville defines the crisis of philosophy as a matter of the future by virtue of the series of unpublished problems that it demands to satisfy.

TI  - Interpretation of the backscattering coefficient for distinct Indian lakes using Sentinel-1 SAR imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF INDIAN GEOPHYSICAL UNION
M3  - Article
AB  - Active Microwave Remote Sensing (MWRS) is used to monitor the ecological imbalances in the lake. The MWRS uses the C- band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensor to transmit a vertically polarized signal and either receive it in vertically or horizontally polarized (VV or VH) form. The SAR sensor records the interaction of its transmitted signal with surface water in the form of the backscattering coefficient (sigma 0), which is the monitoring parameter. In the present work, 14 distinct surface water of lakes are monitored with the SAR data from Sentinel -1. All downloaded Sentinel-1 SAR datasets are for the post-monsoon month i.e., October 2021. Pre-processing and image processing of the Sentinel-1 SAR dataset were performed for the retrieval of the maximum, minimum, and mean sigma 0 values in VV and VH polarization for the distinct lakes. The comparative study of maximum and minimum sigma 0 for the VV and VH polarization shows that the VV polarization mode is more sensitive to surface water changes. The maximum and minimum mean s0 values in the VV polarization mode among the distinct lakes are found to be -17.08 dB and -24.18 dB, respectively. The present work analyzes the sigma 0 values for these lakes and provides a new light on the causes in their fluctuations.

TI  - Classification of Wetland Vegetation Based on NDVI Time Series from the HLS Dataset
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural wetlands are intrinsically heterogeneous and typically composed of a mosaic of ecosystem patches with different vegetation types. Hydrological and biogeochemical processes in wetlands vary strongly among these ecosystem patches. To date, most remote sensing classification approaches for wetland vegetation either rely on coarse images that cannot capture the spatial variability of wetland vegetation or rely on very-high-resolution multi-spectral images that are detailed but very sporadic in time (less than once per year). This study aimed to use NDVI time series, generated from NASA's HLS dataset, to classify vegetation patches. We demonstrate our approach at a temperate, coastal lake, estuarine marsh. To classify vegetation patches, a standard time series library of the four land-cover patch types was built from referencing specific locations that were identified as "pure" pixels. These were identified using a single-time high-resolution image. We calculated the distance between the HLS-NDVI time series at each pixel and the "pure"-pixel standards for each land-cover type. The resulting true-positive classified rate was >73% for all patch types other than water lily. The classification accuracy was higher in pixels of a more uniform composition. A set of vegetation maps was created for the years 2016 to 2020 at our research site to identify the vegetation changes at the site as it is affected by rapid water elevation increases in Lake Erie. Our results reveal how changes in water elevation have changed the patch distribution in significant ways, leading to the local extinction of cattail by 2019 and a continuous increase in the area cover of water lily patches.

TI  - Functional Evaluation of Digital Soil Hydraulic Property Maps through Comparison of Simulated and Remotely Sensed Maize Canopy Cover
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil maps can usefully serve in data scarce regions, for example for yield (gap) assessments using a crop simulation model. The soil property estimates' contribution to inaccuracy and uncertainty can be functionally evaluated by comparing model results using the estimates as input against independent observations. We conducted a functional evaluation of digital maps of soil hydraulic properties of the Zambezi River Basin using a crop growth model AquaCrop. AquaCrop was run, alimented with local meteorological data, and with soil hydraulic properties derived from the digital maps of digital soil mapping (DSM) techniques, as opposed to estimations from the widely used Saxton and Rawls pedotransfer functions. The two simulated time series of canopy cover (CC) (AquaCrop-CC-DSM and AquaCrop-CC-Saxton), which were compared against canopy cover data derived from the remotely sensed Leaf Area Index (LAI) from the MODIS archive (MODIS-CC). A pairwise comparison of the time series resulted in a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.07 and a co-efficient of determination (R-2) of 0.93 for AquaCrop-CC-DSM versus MODIS-CC, and an RMSE of 0.08 and R-2 of 0.88 for AquaCrop-CC-Saxton versus MODIS-CC. In dry years, the AquaCrop-CCDSM deviated less from the MODIS-CC than the AquaCrop-CC-Saxton (p < 0.001), although this difference was not significant in wet years. The functional evaluation showed that soil hydraulic property estimates based on digital soil mapping outperformed those based on Saxton and Rawls when used for simulating crop growth in dry years in the Zambezi River Basin. This study also shows the value of conducting a functional evaluation of estimated (static) soil hydraulic properties in terms of dynamic model output.

TI  - Avoiding unnecessary intraoperative sentinel lymph node frozen section biopsy of patients with early breast cancer
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL TREATMENT AND RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: After the publication of the ACOSOG (American College of Surgeons Oncology Group) Z0011 trial, the rate of axillary lymph node dissection has reduced. Thus, the need for intraoperative frozen section biopsy of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) has become controversial. We identified patients for whom intraoperative SLN frozen section biopsy could be omitted and found that frozen section biopsy rate can be reduced. Methods: We reviewed the records of patients with tumors <= 5 cm in diameter who underwent breast-conserving surgery between January 2013 and December 2019 at Seoul St. Mary's Hospital. Clinicopathological and imaging characteristics were compared according to number of positive SLNs (0-2 SLNs positive vs. >_3 SLNs positive). Results: A total of 1,983 patients were included in this study. Thirty-two patients (1.6%) had at least 3 positive SLNs. Patients with >_3 positive SLNs had significantly larger tumors and were more frequently high-grade tumors (P < 0.001 and P = 0.002, respectively). Identification of suspicious lymph nodes on imaging studies was also associated with the presence of >_3 positive SLNs (hazard ratio, 11.54; 95% confidence interval, 4.42-30.10). All patients with none or only 1 suspicious lymph node on any imaging modality (n = 647, 32.6%) had 0-2 positive SLNs. Also, among patients with clinical T1-stage tumors and at least 2 suspicious lymph nodes on only 1 imaging modality (n = 514, 25.9%), only 2 cases had >_3 Conclusion: We found that intraoperative SLN frozen biopsy could be omitted in patients using tumor size and axillary lymph node status on imaging modality.

TI  - Vertical Ground Displacements and Its Impact on Erosion along the Karachi Coastline, Pakistan
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study employed remote sensing (optical and synthetic aperture radar) and data analysis techniques to quantify vertical ground displacements and assess their contribution to coastline erosion. To provide evidence from Pakistan, we selected the coast of Karachi-a mega-city located along the dynamic coastline of the Indus River Delta-which has been experiencing severe coastal erosion during the last few decades. Observations from the C-band Envisat/ASAR and Sentinel-1A sensors over the 2004-2010 and 2014-2016 periods, respectively, enabled us to study vertical ground displacements in the study area, providing a long-term assessment during 2004-2016. Results suggest that some areas along the Karachi coastline are subsiding at comparable rates to or even much higher than the relative sea-level rise (SLR, similar to 1.9 mm/yr), which may amplify the rates of relative SLR in coming years, along with accelerating coastal erosion. Various parts of the study area along the coast are unstable and undergoing displacement. Landsat images from 1989 to 2018 (10-year temporal resolution) were further used to examine the state of coastline erosion using three statistical approaches (i.e., End Point Rate (EPR), Linear Regression Rate (LRR), and Least Median of Squares (LMS)). While the erosion underlaid the majority of the eastern sections of the study area, the ground displacements were spatially heterogeneous across the study area and along the coastline. Erosion rates of similar to 2.4 m/yr spatially corresponded with ground displacement rates of up to similar to-1.4 cm/yr, but not all the coastline segments with high annual mean erosion rates were associated with local mean subsidence. The causes of ground displacements and coastline erosion were analyzed, and results were interpreted by integrating spatial ancillary information. Results indicate that rapid urbanization, construction on reclaimed land, coastline erosion favoring seawater intrusion, failed drainage/sewerage networks, and soil liquefaction are contributing to the site-specific variations in the land displacement in Karachi.

T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Kherson, Mykolaiv, Odesa, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts, being adjusted to the coasts of the Black and Azov Seas, are located in the steppe zone and constitute the southern region of Ukraine. The environmental parameters and health indicators of the population of the region are sensitive to the impact of natural (e.g., climate change) and anthropogenic processes. An analysis of satellite remote sensing data (NOAA NDVI time series) for the assessment of vegetation condition demonstrates an increase in frequency and duration of drought events in the region during the last few decades. It may have a relation to climate change processes. Data analysis of local meteorological observations over the past 100 years proved alterations of some bioclimatic indexes. The Equivalent Effective Temperature (I-EET) increases in winter and summer (due to the increasing repeatability of high anomalous temperatures) and remains stable in spring and autumn seasons. The increasing number and variability of climate anomalies can provoke an increase in cardiovascular and some other diseases in the local population. At the same time, an analysis of the statistical data of health indicators of the population (such as morbidity of digestion, breathing, and the endocrine and circulatory systems) shows a tendency to decrease morbidity (contrary to the indicators of the mountain regions' population, which have higher values of life expectancy). Interrelations between environmental, climate change, and population health indicators in the Black Sea region are being discussed.

TI  - Improving Jakarta's Katulampa Barrage Extreme Water Level Prediction Using Satellite-Based Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Networks
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Jakarta, the capital region of Indonesia, is experiencing recurring floods, with the most extensive recording loss as high as 350 million dollars. Katulampa Barrage's observation of the Upper Ciliwung River plays a central role in reducing the risk of flooding in Jakarta, especially flowing through the Ciliwung River. The peak flow measured in the barrage would travel 13-14 h to the heart of the city, providing adequate time for the government officials and the residents to prepare for the flood risk. However, Jakarta is continually pressed by the population growth, averaging 1.27% in the past 20 years. The constant growth of Jakarta's population continually develops slums in increasingly inconvenient locations, including the riverbanks, increasing vulnerability to floods. This situation necessitates a more advanced early warning system that could provide a longer forecasting lead time. Satellite remote sensing data propose a promising utility to extend the prediction lead time of extreme events. In the case of this study, Sadewa data is used to predict the water level of Katulampa Barrage using long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks (RNN). The results show that the model could predict Katulampa Water Level accurately. The model presents a potential for implementation and additional lead time to increase flood mitigation preparedness.

TI  - Predicting Grape Sugar Content under Quality Attributes Using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index Data and Automated Machine Learning
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wine grapes need frequent monitoring to achieve high yields and quality. Non-destructive methods, such as proximal and remote sensing, are commonly used to estimate crop yield and quality characteristics, and spectral vegetation indices (VIs) are often used to present site-specific information. Analysis of laboratory samples is the most popular method for determining the quality characteristics of grapes, although it is time-consuming and expensive. In recent years, several machine learning-based methods have been developed to predict crop quality. Although these techniques require the extensive involvement of experts, automated machine learning (AutoML) offers the possibility to improve this task, saving time and resources. In this paper, we propose an innovative approach for robust prediction of grape quality attributes by combining open-source AutoML techniques and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data for vineyards obtained from four different platforms-two proximal vehicle-mounted canopy reflectance sensors, orthomosaics from UAV images and Sentinel-2 remote sensing imagery-during the 2019 and 2020 growing seasons. We investigated AutoML, extending our earlier work on manually fine-tuned machine learning methods. Results of the two approaches using Ordinary Least Square (OLS), Theil-Sen and Huber regression models and tree-based methods were compared. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD) were included in the analysis and different combinations of sensors and data collected over two growing seasons were investigated. Results showed promising performance of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and Spectrosense+ GPS data in predicting grape sugars, especially in mid to late season with full canopy growth. Regression models with both manually fine-tuned ML (R-2 = 0.61) and AutoML (R-2 = 0.65) provided similar results, with the latter slightly improved for both 2019 and 2020. When combining multiple sensors and growth stages per year, the coefficient of determination R-2 improved even more averaging 0.66 for the best-fitting regressions. Also, when considering combinations of sensors and growth stages across both cropping seasons, UAV and Spectrosense+ GPS, as well as Veraison and Flowering, each had the highest average R-2 values. These performances are consistent with previous work on machine learning algorithms that were manually fine-tuned. These results suggest that AutoML has greater long-term performance potential. To increase the efficiency of crop quality prediction, a balance must be struck between manual expert work and AutoML.

TI  - Combining Area-Based and Individual Tree Metrics for Improving Merchantable and Non-Merchantable Wood Volume Estimates in Coastal Douglas-Fir Forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest management practices can increase climate change mitigation potential through applications focused on carbon budgets. One such application involves utilizing non-merchantable material (i.e., logging residues typically piled and burned) for bio-energy. However, limited remote sensing data is available for estimating wood residues until after timber has been harvested, at which point recovery of residual wood is of little financial interest. This research utilizes a hybrid method to develop models that provide pre-harvest estimates of the amount of merchantable and non-merchantable material that would result from harvesting and investigates the scalability and transferability of such measures to the harvest block level. Models were trained using 38 plots across two sites dominated by Douglas-fir, then expanded to ten harvest blocks, and transferred to eight blocks from two sites without training data before being compared against multiple independent block-level estimates. Model results showed root mean square errors of 35% and 38% for merchantable and non-merchantable volumes, respectively. Merchantable volume estimates in blocks with training had average absolute differences from the harvest scale (9-34%) similar to transferred blocks without training (15-20%). Non-merchantable model results were also similar in both trained and transferred harvest blocks, with the pre-harvest model results having lower differences from the post-harvest geospatial versus field surveys. The results from this study show promise for hybrid methods to improve estimates of merchantable wood volume compared to conventional forest cover data approaches, and provide the ability to predict non-merchantable volumes within the range of accuracy of post-harvest residue survey methods.

TI  - Loss of Coastal Wetlands in Lake Burullus, Egypt: A GIS and Remote-Sensing Study
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake Burullus is the second largest lake at the northern edge of the Nile Delta, Egypt, and has been recognized as an internationally significant wetland that provides a habitat for migrating birds, fish, herpetofauna, and mammals. However, the lake is experiencing severe human impacts including drainage and conversion to agricultural lands and fish farms. The primary goal of this study was to use multispectral, moderate-spatial-resolution (30 m(2)) Landsat satellite imagery to assess marsh loss in Lake Burullus, Egypt, in the last 35 years (1985-2020). Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analyses (ISODATA) unsupervised techniques were applied to the Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager-Thermal Infrared Sensor (OLI-TIRS) satellite images for classification of the Lake Burullus area into four main land-use classes: water, marsh, unvegetated land surfaces (roads, paths, sand sheets and dunes), and agricultural lands and fish farms. The overall classification accuracy was estimated to be 96% and the Kappa index was 0.95. Our results indicated that there is a substantial loss (44.8% loss) in the marsh aerial coverage between 1985 and 2020. The drainage and conversion of wetlands into agricultural lands and/or fish farms is concentrated primarily in the western and southern part of the lake where the surface area of the agricultural lands and/or fish farms doubled (103.2% increase) between 2000 and 2020. We recommend that land-use-policy makers and environmental government agencies raise public awareness among the local communities of Lake Burullus of the economic and environmental consequences of the alarming loss of marshland, which will likely have adverse effects on water quality and cause a reduction in the invaluable wetland-ecosystem services.

TI  - Improved Clear Sky Model from In Situ Observations and Spatial Distribution of Aerosol Optical Depth for Satellite-Derived Solar Irradiance over the Korean Peninsula
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In solar resource assessment, the climatological environment of the target area is objectively quantified by the cloudiness or clear sky index, which is defined as the ratio of global horizontal irradiance to clear sky solar insolation. The clear sky model calculates incoming solar irradiance on the ground surface considering several atmospheric parameters such as water vapor and aerosol optical depth. This study investigated the importance of aerosol optical depth for deriving clear sky irradiance in radiative transfer models and examined its viability in a universal or community model for public use. The evaluation was conducted based on ground observations at the Korea Institute of Energy Research (KIER) station from January to December 2021. The original simulation was performed using the monthly mean of aerosol optical depth obtained from the Aerosol Robotic Network station; the mean absolute error was 29.9 W m(-2). When the daily mean of in situ observations at KIER was incorporated into the clear sky model, the mean absolute error was reduced to 9.7 W m(-2). Our results confirm that the clear sky model using gridded datasets of aerosol optical depth is suitable for use as a universal or community model.

TI  - Characterizing Time-Series Roving Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining Activities in Indonesia Using Sentinel-1 Data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid growth of roving mining camps has negatively influenced their surrounding environment. Although artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) is a major source of gold production, the mining activities and their activeness are not well revealed owing to their informal, illegal, and unregulated characteristics. This study characterizes the transformations of roving camp-type ASGM (R-C-ASGM) activities in Central of Katingan Regency, Central Kalimantan Province, Indonesia, from 2015 to 2021 using remotely sensed data, such as the time-series Sentinel-1 dataset. The results show that the growth of active R-C-ASGM sites was identified at the center of the Galangan mining region with expansions to the northwest part along the Kalanaman River, especially in 2021. Hence, these approaches identify the transformations of roving mining activities and their active or nonactive status even in tropical regions experiencing frequent heavy traffic rainstorms. They provide significant information on the socioenvironmental risks possibly caused at local and regional levels. Our results also inform the design of timely interventions suited to local conditions for strengthening environmental governance.

TI  - Investigation of Long-Term Roving Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining Activities Using Time-Series Sentinel-1 and Global Surface Water Datasets
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) is a significant source of gold production globally despite the sector being informal and illegal. The rapid increase in the number of roving mining camps has negatively impacted the surrounding environment; however, the formation and transformation of roving mining camps have not been well studied. This study investigated the long-term trends and significant hotspots of roving camp-type ASGM (R-C-ASGM) in Katingain Regency, Central Kalimantan Province, Indonesia, from 1988 to 2020 using remotely sensed data, including Sentinel-1 time-series, global surface water (GSW), and world landcover datasets. Results show that several active R-C-ASGM sites existed in the Galangan and Kalanaman areas in 2017/2018. According to the GSW dataset, the Galangan area was estimated to be formed earlier, whereas the Kalanaman areas were recently formed and were associated with the Kalanaman river expansion. Notably, the center of Galangan was still a significant R-C-ASGM hotspot. The findings of this study broaden our understanding of R-C-ASGM transformation and identify significant R-C-ASGM hotspots over a long period. This study contributes to the development of timely and appropriate interventions for strengthening environmental governance.

TI  - Climate Change in Southeast Benin and Its Influences on the Spatio-Temporal Dynamic of Forests, Benin, West Africa
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of anthropogenic activities on the spatiotemporal dynamics of the forest of Dogo-Ketou has been studied in relation to climate change observed in southeastern Benin. Especially, this study has detected the changes in climate parameters in southeast Benin from 1954 to 2016 and in forestland use from 1986 to 2018. A climatic break was detected, and the annual and monthly rainfall and temperature averages, the rainfall indexes, the concentration of precipitation, the number of rainy days according to the World Meteorological Organization and the bioclimatic aridity indexes were assessed. A GIS analysis was also performed based on Landsat images from 1986, 2000 and 2018 to detect the dynamic of land use and land cover of the classified forest of Dogo-Ketou. Excel 2016, R-x64 4.1.2, Rclimdex(301), Khronostat(1.01) and ArcGIS were used. The rainfall series showed a break in 1969. The segment from 1954 to 1968 was a period of excess rainfall with an average of 1420.46 mm/year. The segment from 1969 to 2016 was a rainfall deficit period with a reduction of 12 to 37% of rainy days and an increase of dry days for 21.4 days/year. In this last segment, southeast Benin experienced trends of its climate towards a sub-arid and arid climate. The agglomerations and bare soil of the forest of Dogo-Ketou increased to an area almost double the size between 1986 and 2018. The tree and shrub savannas gained in space from 12.1% in 2000 to 38.9% in 2018 and the dense forest and wooded savannas regressed by 52.6% in 1986 to 36.1% in 2000 then to 4.3% of the forest area in 2018. The subequatorial climate of southeastern Benin is gradually evolving towards a dry climate. The dense forest in this area is also gradually disappearing, giving way to savannas. This transformation towards the savannas was due to anthropogenic actions whose effects were strongly accentuated by climate change in this part of Benin and West Africa.

TI  - Spatial-spectral feature deep extraction based on a multichannel grouping fusion module for multispectral image compression
T2  - JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the continuous improvement of spatial and spectral resolution, the application of multispectral images has greatly increased in remote sensing. However, the amount of image data also increases sharply, which brings great pressure to data storage and transmission. To solve this issue, we propose an end-to-end image compression scheme according to spatial- spectral feature extraction, which can be implemented by a spatial-spectral memory unit (SSMU). Furthermore, to improve the feature extraction capability of this deep network, the multichannel grouping fusion module is adopted to reconstruct and fuse the image features. In the encoder of the proposed compression scheme, the SSMU first extracts spatial-spectral features along the spatial direction and the spectral direction, and the multichannel grouping fusion module extracts the spatial and spectral features of different levels by recombination and fusion of band features of multispectral images. Then, the extracted deep spatial and spectral features are compressed by downsampling. Next, the quantizer and entropy coding convert the data into a compressed bitstream. In the decoder, a reverse process is used to restore the original images. The experiments take the multispectral images of Landsat 8 and WorldView3 as the datasets to verify the superiority of our method and compare it with JPEG2000, 3D-SPIHT, and the CNN-based methods. The results show that the proposed method outperforms the JPEG2000, 3D-SPIHT, and CNN-based methods in PSNR, spectral similarity, and spectral angle mapping metrics at different bit rates.

TI  - Air Quality in Two Northern Greek Cities Revealed by Their Tropospheric NO<sub>2</sub> Levels
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we aim to show the capabilities, benefits, as well as restrictions, of three different air quality-related information sources, namely the Sentinel-5Precursor TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) space-born observations, the Multi-Axis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) ground-based measurements and the LOng Term Ozone Simulation-EURopean Operational Smog (LOTOS-EUROS) chemical transport modelling system simulations. The tropospheric NO2 concentrations between 2018 and 2021 are discussed as air quality indicators for the Greek cities of Thessaloniki and Ioannina. Each dataset was analysed in an autonomous manner and, without disregarding their differences, the common air quality picture that they provide is revealed. All three systems report a clear seasonal pattern, with high NO2 levels during wintertime and lower NO2 levels during summertime, reflecting the importance of photochemistry in the abatement of this air pollutant. The spatial patterns of the NO2 load, obtained by both space-born observations and model simulations, show the undeniable variability of the NO2 load within the urban agglomerations. Furthermore, a clear diurnal variability is clearly identified by the ground-based measurements, as well as a Sunday minimum NO2 load effect, alongside the rest of the sources of air quality information. Within their individual strengths and limitations, the space-borne observations, the ground-based measurements, and the chemical transport modelling simulations demonstrate unequivocally their ability to report on the air quality situation in urban locations.

T2  - CURRENT ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Primary vaginal cancer is a rare gynecologic malignancy. Given the rarity of the disease, standardized approaches to management are limited, and a great variety of therapeutic conditions are endorsed. This paper reviews advances in surgical approaches, radiation, chemoradiation, and immunotherapy. Advances in surgical management including the increasing use of laparoscopic and endoscopic approaches, as well as the novel techniques in vaginal reconstruction, are reviewed. Concurrent chemoradiation remains a mainstay of treatment for vaginal cancer and has improved local control of disease and overall survival. Additionally, with metastatic disease or situations where toxicity from CCRT is unacceptable, systemic therapies including immunotherapy approaches are reviewed.

TI  - "Satark": Landslide Prediction System over Western Ghats of India
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Mountains on the west coast of India are known as the Western Ghat (WG). The WG region has a landslide (LS) susceptibility index of four and is prone to LSs in the monsoon season due to rainfall activity. The LS study focuses on the area between 15.5-20.5 degrees N, 72.5-77.0 degrees E in the Maharashtra state. A catalog of 115 LS events in the study area has been prepared by collecting LS data for 17 years (2000-2016) from various sources. The area from the windward to the leeward side of the WG mountains is divided into three regions: (1) the windward region (72.5-73.4 degrees E) (90 km width), (2) the immediate lee side (ILS) (73.40-74.20 degrees E) (80 km width), and (3) distant lee side (DLS) (74.2-77.0 degrees E) (280 km width). The Center for Citizen Science (CCS), Pune, India, developed the LS-predicting model "Satark" using data from satellites, the India Meteorological Department weather forecasts, radar products, synoptic conditions, and atmospheric sounding data from the Wyoming site for inferring conditions for a hydraulic jump on the WG. The model validation for the 5 years (2017-2021) showed a reasonably good Heidke skill score of 0.44. The model showed 76.5% success in LS prediction 1 day in advance. It is the first attempt of this kind in the Indian region.

TI  - Variation of ionospheric plasma density during the annular solar eclipse on December 26, 2019
T2  - ASTROPHYSICS AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The annular solar eclipse of the previous decade that occurred on December 26, 2019, was mostly visible from most Asian countries, including India. In this manuscript, we present the variation of ionospheric plasma density profiles at different heights during the eclipse and non-eclipse days. We use both the ground- and space-based instruments to study the depletion in the electron density profile in the ionospheric D and F layers. We use the International GNSS Service (IGS)/Global Positioning System (GPS) stations and Swarm satellites outcomes to compute ionospheric Total Electron Content (TEC). We choose the IGS stations either on the path of the annularity or in the close vicinity of the annularity belt. For the first kind, we choose two IGS stations, GUUG in Guam island near the Western Pacific and CNMR in the Northern Mariana islands. We choose two Indian stations, IISC in Bangalore and HYDE in Hyderabad, that are close to the annularity belt. We observe similar to 20-40% depletion in the diurnal profile of TEC, as estimated from the IGS stations. This depletion is validated by a NovAtel GPS station-6 instrument situated at Hyderabad. Significant depletion in the spatio-temporal profile of TEC and electron density profile as computed from Swarm satellite data. The depletion in TEC is also validated by NASA's CDAWEB archive using Global Ionospheric Map (GIM). We try to estimate the TEC in the F layer and the electron density in the D layer using a numerical model. We compute the solar obscuration percentage by the geometrical configuration of the Sun and Moon. For TEC we use the solar irradiation model and calculate the delay of the maximum depletion compared to the maximum obscuration. To investigate the effects of the eclipse at the lower ionospheric heights (68-88 km), we use the GPI ion-chemistry model and observe depletion in the electron density profiles of around similar to 58-73% for all the locations. We observe that the time between the maximum depletion in the electron density and the maximum obscuration decreases with increasing height, and it gets the minimum value at an altitude of 84 km. All methods give consistent outcomes with depletion of plasma density that corroborates the effects of the solar eclipse on the Earth's ionosphere.

TI  - State of the Vietnamese Coast-Assessing Three Decades (1986 to 2021) of Coastline Dynamics Using the Landsat Archive
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vietnam's 3260 km coastline is densely populated, experiences rapid urban and economic growth, and faces at the same time a high risk of coastal hazards. Satellite archives provide a free and powerful opportunity for long-term area-wide monitoring of the coastal zone. This paper presents an automated analysis of coastline dynamics from 1986 to 2021 for Vietnam's entire coastal zone using the Landsat archive. The proposed method is implemented within the cloud-computing platform Google Earth Engine to only involve publicly and globally available datasets and tools. We generated annual coastline composites representing the mean-high water level and extracted sub-pixel coastlines. We further quantified coastline change rates along shore-perpendicular transects, revealing that half of Vietnam's coast did not experience significant change, while the remaining half is classified as erosional (27.7%) and accretional (27.1%). A hotspot analysis shows that coastal segments with the highest change rates are concentrated in the low-lying deltas of the Mekong River in the south and the Red River in the north. Hotspots with the highest accretion rates of up to +47 m/year are mainly associated with the construction of artificial coastlines, while hotspots with the highest erosion rates of -28 m/year may be related to natural sediment redistribution and human activity.

TI  - The Identitarian movement and fashwave music: The nostalgia and anger of the new far right in Denmark
T2  - POPULAR MUSIC
M3  - Article
AB  - Through perspectives from the sociology of emotions and multimodality as an analytical tool, this article analyses the cultural aspects of the Identitarian movement through the case of the Danish Generation Identit AE r (GI) and its online videos. The analysis shows that the group shares an understanding of societal problems and emotions of nostalgia and anger connected to this worldview and demonstrates that the group's use of fashwave music style fits its worldview and emotions. Furthermore, the article argues that the coded language associated with fashwave music is part of what defines the community of GI and that the music binds its members to a collective consciousness. Therefore, this article presents an analysis of the cultural style of fashwave, an important contribution to the study of the broader cultural and social ecology of newer far-right groups and milieus, such as the Identitarian movement.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Geomorphodiversity Linked to Biodiversity-Part III: Traits, Processes and Remote Sensing Characteristics
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Remote sensing (RS) enables a cost-effective, extensive, continuous and standardized monitoring of traits and trait variations of geomorphology and its processes, from the local to the continental scale. To implement and better understand RS techniques and the spectral indicators derived from them in the monitoring of geomorphology, this paper presents a new perspective for the definition and recording of five characteristics of geomorphodiversity with RS, namely: geomorphic genesis diversity, geomorphic trait diversity, geomorphic structural diversity, geomorphic taxonomic diversity, and geomorphic functional diversity. In this respect, geomorphic trait diversity is the cornerstone and is essential for recording the other four characteristics using RS technologies. All five characteristics are discussed in detail in this paper and reinforced with numerous examples from various RS technologies. Methods for classifying the five characteristics of geomorphodiversity using RS, as well as the constraints of monitoring the diversity of geomorphology using RS, are discussed. RS-aided techniques that can be used for monitoring geomorphodiversity in regimes with changing land-use intensity are presented. Further, new approaches of geomorphic traits that enable the monitoring of geomorphodiversity through the valorisation of RS data from multiple missions are discussed as well as the ecosystem integrity approach. Likewise, the approach of monitoring the five characteristics of geomorphodiversity recording with RS is discussed, as are existing approaches for recording spectral geomorhic traits/ trait variation approach and indicators, along with approaches for assessing geomorphodiversity. It is shown that there is no comparable approach with which to define and record the five characteristics of geomorphodiversity using only RS data in the literature. Finally, the importance of the digitization process and the use of data science for research in the field of geomorphology in the 21st century is elucidated and discussed.

TI  - Need to restage Korean melanoma patients following publication of the 8th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging manual
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY VENEREOLOGY & LEPROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The tumor, nodes and metastasis (TNM) classification and stage grouping have been updated in the 8th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) melanoma staging manual. However, restaging all the previous cases are not recommended.Aims: The aims of the study were to investigate the necessity of restaging Korean melanoma patients staged by the previous edition of the AJCC manual.Methods: Differences in the staging criteria of the 7th and 8th editions of the AJCC manual were identified. The staging of 276 primary melanomas from January 2011 to December 2018 was classified by both 7th and 8th editions of the manual and their differences were compared.Results: Staging by 7th and 8th edition of the AJCC manual differed in 64 cases (23.2%). The pathological prognostic staging changed in 35 (12.7%), and 29 (10.5%) had changes in only TNM classification but not the pathological staging. None of the patients needed additional sentinel lymph node biopsy or systemic treatment as a result of restaging. Additional counseling was needed for the patients, because melanoma-specific survival was increased in the 8th edition.Limitations: This is a retrospective study with relatively small number of patients at a single tertiary center in Korea.Conclusion: Assessment of the need for additional sentinel lymph node biopsy or systemic treatment is recommended because of the latest changes in the AJCC melanoma staging manual. Although the restaging of previously staged melanomas is not significantly needed in our patients, still the differences in TNM classification and/or pathological prognostic staging suggest the need to separately recognize the patients previously staged by 7th edition and recently staged by 8th edition. Careful counseling about melanoma-specific survival is needed for Asian patients.

TI  - Surface urban heat island in South Korea's new towns with different urban planning
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A new town is strategically built within a short period compared to naturally developed cities. It is considered an appropriate study area for analyzing the urban climate problems such as surface urban heat islands (SUHIs) that is differently generated according to urban planning and development. In this study, we suggest comprehensive method for determining and comparing changes in surface UHI distribution during 1989-2048 in two new towns with different urban planning. First, a substantial increase in built-up areas was observed from 1989 (< 5%) to 2018 (> 40%) in both new towns. However, SUHI phenomenon-increasing patterns were different of about 12.25% depending on urban planning and urban morphology. Results also showed the importance of vertical and horizontal structures which can have a great influence on SUHI intensity and accordingly, the difference in SUHI distribution between two new towns was confirmed. Moreover, without effective mitigation, the built-up area in both new towns is estimated to increase to approximately 60%, and the SUHI intensity in most areas to increase by 4 degrees C in 2048. In addition, the spread and intensification of the SUHI phenomenon are predicted to be greater due to the characteristics of the building structure and the active urban expansion. Thus, these results combined with architectural assessment models can improve the understanding of thermal environmental impacts of urbanization and provide directions for sustainable urban development and renovation.

TI  - Mortality Salience Effects of Critical Incidents - A Systematic Literature Review and Research Agenda
T2  - OMEGA-JOURNAL OF DEATH AND DYING
M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Critical incidents (CI) trigger acute stress reactions and psychological trauma because of direct or vicarious exposure. These events include natural disasters, wars, terrorist attacks and pandemics, and usually result in deaths and serious physical injuries. Their life-threatening nature makes them reasonable candidates to induce mortality salience (MS). The current review aims to consolidate Terror Management Theory (TMT) research using CIs as MS. A systematic literature review was conducted. Overall, 74 articles with 113 studies were included. Through this review, strong support for MS effects of CI has been found. Consistent with TMT, CIs tend to trigger worldview defence, self-esteem enhancement and relationship seeking. CIs have also been found to impact negatively on individual well-being and organisational health. Recommendations specific to crisis interventions and well-being will be discussed. The review concludes with potential future research directions to strengthen and expand empirical knowledge in CI salience.

TI  - Challenges in Scaling Up Greenhouse Gas Fluxes: Experience From the UK Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Feedbacks Program
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The role of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in global climate change is now well recognized and there is a clear need to measure emissions and verify the efficacy of mitigation measures. To this end, reliable estimates are needed of the GHG balance at the national scale and over long time periods, but these estimates are difficult to make accurately. Because measurement techniques are generally restricted to relatively small spatial and temporal scales, there is a fundamental problem in translating these into long-term estimates on a regional scale. The key challenge lies in spatial and temporal upscaling of short-term, point observations to estimate large-scale annual totals, and quantify the uncertainty associated with this upscaling. Here, we review some approaches to this problem and synthesize the work in the recent UK Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Feedbacks Program, which was designed to identify and address these challenges. Approaches to the scaling problem included: instrumentation developments which mean that near-continuous data sets can be produced with larger spatial coverage; geostatistical methods which address the problem of extrapolating to larger domains, using spatial information in the data; more rigorous statistical methods which characterize the uncertainty in extrapolating to longer time scales; analytical approaches to estimating model aggregation error; enhanced estimates of C flux measurement error; and novel uses of remote sensing data to calibrate process models for generating probabilistic regional C flux estimates.

TI  - Assessment of VIIRS on the Identification of Harmful Algal Bloom Types in the Coasts of the East China Sea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) data were systematically evaluated and used to detect harmful algal bloom (HAB) and classify algal bloom types in coasts of the East China Sea covered by optically complex and sediment-rich waters. First, the accuracy and spectral characteristics of VIIRS retrieved normalized water-leaving radiance or the equivalent remote sensing reflectance from September 2019 to October 2020 that were validated by the long-term observation data acquired from an offshore platform and underway measurements from a cruise in the Changjiang Estuary and adjacent East China Sea. These data were evaluated by comparing them with data from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer. The bands of 486, 551, and 671 nm provided much higher quality than those of 410 and 443 nm and were more suitable for HAB detection. Secondly, the performance of four HAB detection algorithms were compared. The Ratio of Algal Bloom (RAB) algorithm is probably more suitable for HAB detection in the study area. Importantly, although RAB was also verified to be applicable for the detection of different kinds of HAB (Prorocentrum donghaiense, diatoms, Ceratium furca, and Akashiwo sanguinea), the capability of VIIRS in the classification of those algal species was limited by the lack of the critical band near 531 nm.

TI  - Maize Yield Estimation in Intercropped Smallholder Fields Using Satellite Data in Southern Malawi
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite data provide high potential for estimating crop yield, which is crucial to understanding determinants of yield gaps and therefore improving food production, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) regions. However, accurate assessment of crop yield and its spatial variation is challenging in SSA because of small field sizes, widespread intercropping practices, and inadequate field observations. This study aimed to firstly evaluate the potential of satellite data in estimating maize yield in intercropped smallholder fields and secondly assess how factors such as satellite data spatial and temporal resolution, within-field variability, field size, harvest index and intercropping practices affect model performance. Having collected in situ data (field size, yield, intercrops occurrence, harvest index, and leaf area index), statistical models were developed to predict yield from multisource satellite data (i.e., Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope). Model accuracy and residuals were assessed against the above factors. Among 150 investigated fields, our study found that nearly half were intercropped with legumes, with an average plot size of 0.17 ha. Despite mixed pixels resulting from intercrops, the model based on the Sentinel-2 red-edge vegetation index (VI) could estimate maize yield with moderate accuracy (R-2 = 0.51, nRMSE = 19.95%), while higher spatial resolution satellite data (e.g., PlanetScope 3 m) only showed a marginal improvement in performance (R-2 = 0.52, nRMSE = 19.95%). Seasonal peak VI values provided better accuracy than seasonal mean/median VI, suggesting peak VI values may capture the signal of the dominant upper maize foliage layer and may be less impacted by understory intercrop effects. Still, intercropping practice reduces model accuracy, as the model residuals are lower in fields with pure maize (1 t/ha) compared to intercropped fields (1.3 t/ha). This study provides a reference for operational maize yield estimation in intercropped smallholder fields, using free satellite data in Southern Malawi. It also highlights the difficulties of estimating yield in intercropped fields using satellite imagery, and stresses the importance of sufficient satellite observations for monitoring intercropping practices in SSA.

TI  - An Integrated Model of Summer and Winter for Chlorophyll-a Retrieval in the Pearl River Estuary Based on Hyperspectral Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll-a (Chla) is an important parameter for water quality. For remote sensing-based methods for the measurement of Chla, in-situ hyperspectral data is crucial for building retrieval models. In the Pearl River Estuary, we used 61 groups of in-situ hyperspectral data and corresponding Chla concentrations collected in July and December 2020 to build a Chla retrieval model that takes the two different seasons and the turbidity of water into consideration. The following results were obtained. (1) Based on the pre-processing techniques for hyperspectral data, it was shown that the first-derivative of 680 nm is the optimal band for the estimation of Chla in the Pearl River Estuary, with R-2 > 0.8 and MAPE of 26.03%. (2) To overcome the spectral resolution problem in satellite image retrieval, based on the simulated reflectance from the Sentinel-2 satellite and the shape of the discrete spectral curve, we constructed a multispectral model using the slope difference index method, which reached a R-2 of 0.78 and MAPE of 35.21% and can integrate the summer and winter data. (3) The slope difference method applied to the Sentinel-2 image shows better performance than the red-NIR ratio method. Therefore, the method proposed in this paper is practicable for Chla monitoring of coastal waters based on both in-situ data and images.

TI  - A Dataset of Overshooting Cloud Top from 12-Year CloudSat/CALIOP Joint Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A strong convective storm is a disastrous weather system with a small spatio-temporal scale. It often occurs suddenly and can cause huge disasters. Thus, it is necessary to improve the forecast accuracy of strong convective storms. Overshooting cloud top (OT) is the product of strong updrafts in convective storms, which can penetrate the tropopause and enter the lower stratosphere. OT is closely related to severe weather and can influence water vapor transport and the material exchange between the troposphere and stratosphere. Therefore, the timely detection of OT can help improve the accuracy of forecasting. In this study, we develop a new objective OT detection algorithm based on geostationary satellite observations from 2006 to 2017. The accuracy of the new algorithm in identifying OT is verified by manually comparing it with the radar echo images and the cloud images of MODIS 250 m. Then, the OT is statistically analyzed in a long time series. It is found that OT events are mainly concentrated in equatorial and low latitude regions, with higher frequency in summer. There are obvious differences between OT events on land and sea. Additionally, this dataset also reveals the close connection between the seasonal shift of OT and the seasonal average precipitation distribution around the globe. This study provides a scientific basis for determining the geographical characteristics of OT frequency and explores the application of this OT objective detection algorithm in the operational forecast of strong convective weather. We hope this study can benefit OT monitoring in operational weather forecasting.

TI  - Simulation of Land-Use Spatiotemporal Changes under Ecological Quality Constraints: The Case of the Wuhan Urban Agglomeration Area, China, over 2020-2030
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Human activities coupled with land-use change pose a threat to the regional ecological environment. Therefore, it is essential to determine the future land-use structure and spatial layout for ecological protection and sustainable development. Land use simulations based on traditional scenarios do not fully consider ecological protection, leading to urban sprawl. Timely and dynamic monitoring of ecological status and change is vital to managing and protecting urban ecology and sustainable development. Remote sensing indices, including greenness, humidity, dryness, and heat, are calculated annually. This method compensates for data loss and difficulty in stitching remote sensing ecological indices over large-scale areas and long time-series. Herein, a framework is developed by integrating the four above-mentioned indices for a rapid, large-scale prediction of land use/cover that incorporates the protection of high ecological quality zone (HEQZ) land. The Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform is used to build a comprehensive HEQZ map of the Wuhan Urban Agglomeration Area (WUAA). Two scenarios are considered: Ecological protection (EP) based on HEQZ and natural growth (NG) without spatial ecological constraints. Land use/cover in the WUAA is predicted over 2020-2030, using the patch-generating land use simulation (PLUS) model. The results show that: (1) the HEQZ area covers 21,456 km(2), accounting for 24% of the WUAA, and is mainly distributed in the Xianning, Huangshi, and Xiantao regions. Construction land has the highest growth rate (5.2%) under the NG scenario. The cropland area decreases by 3.2%, followed by woodlands (0.62%). (2) By delineating the HEQZ, woodlands, rivers, lakes, and wetlands are well protected; construction land displays a downward trend based on the EP scenario with the HEQZ, and the simulated construction land in 2030 is located outside the HEQZ. (3) Image processing based on GEE cloud computing can ameliorate the difficulties of remote sensing data (i.e., missing data, cloudiness, chromatic aberration, and time inconsistency). The results of this study can provide essential scientific guidance for territorial spatial planning under the premise of ecological security.

TI  - Convective Entrainment Rate over the Tibetan Plateau and Its Adjacent Regions in the Boreal Summer Using SNPP-VIIRS
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The entrainment rate (lambda) is difficult to estimate, and its uncertainties cause a significant error in convection parameterization and precipitation simulation, especially over the Tibetan Plateau, where observations are scarce. The lambda over the Tibetan Plateau, and its adjacent regions, is estimated for the first time using five-year satellite data and a reanalysis dataset. The lambda and cloud base environmental relative humidity (RH) decrease with an increase in terrain height. Quantitatively, the correlation between lambda and RH changes from positive at low terrain heights to negative at high terrain heights, and the underlying mechanisms are here interpreted. When the terrain height is below 1 km, large RH decreases the difference in moist static energy (MSE) between the clouds and the environment and increases lambda. When the terrain height is above 1 km, the correlation between lambda and RH is related to the difference between MSE turning point and cloud base, because of decreases in specific humidity near the surface with increasing terrain height. These results enhance the theoretical understanding of the factors affecting lambda and pave the way for improving the parameterization of lambda.

TI  - Examining Adolescent Tennis Participation in Contemporary China Using an Ecological Framework
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Physical activity and sport participation behaviors in children and adolescents are consistently shaped by surrounding ecological systems. Accumulating evidence highlights individual, family, peer, school and teacher, and macroenvironment elements such as policies that affect unstructured physical activity choices in youth populations. However, the reason for participation has not been fully interpreted from the perspective of the youth themselves, especially those from an Asian cultural background. In our study, we aimed to better understand the self-identified reasons for adolescents' participation in non-organized or spontaneous tennis practice in contemporary China. Twenty-six adolescents and informants were recruited in mainland China and participated in semi-structured interviews to provide thick descriptions of their continued tennis participation behaviors. Data were coded and analyzed via NVivo 12. Four themes emerged: (a) Individual characteristics and self-interpretations of tennis culture; (b) microsystems mediating adolescents' tennis participation; (c) barriers and obstacles impacting tennis participation; and (d) policies and macroenvironments. Adolescent tennis participation is a result of the integration effect of the sociocultural and ecological factors dominated by multifaceted ecological systems. As a particular vision of their physical activity experiences, adolescents' interpretation of tennis and their broader worldview has been continuously reshaped by concurrent sport and educational policies.

TI  - Localized Downscaling of Urban Land Surface Temperature-A Case Study in Beijing, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution land surface temperature (LST) data are essential for fine-scale urban thermal environment studies. Urban LST downscaling studies mostly remain focused on only two-dimensional (2-D) data, and neglect the impact of three-dimensional (3-D) surface structure on LST. In addition, the choice of window size is also important for LST downscaling over heterogeneous surfaces. In this study, we downscaled Landsat-LST using localized and stepwise approaches in a random forest model (RF). In addition, both 2- and 3-D building morphologies were included. Our results show that: (1) The performances of a local moving window and stepwise downscaling are dependent on the extent of surface heterogeneity. For mixed surfaces, a localized window performed better than the global window, and a stepwise approach performed better than a single-step approach. However, for monotonous surfaces (e.g., urban impervious surfaces), the global window performed better than a localized window; (2) That multi-scale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) could provide a possibility for selection of the optimal moving window. 7 x 7 windows derived from MGWR by the minimum bandwidth of predictors, performed better than other windows (3 x 3, 5 x 5, and 11 x 11) in the Beijing area; (3) That the morphology of buildings has a non-negligible impact and scaling effect on urban LST. When building morphologies were included in downscaling, the performance of the RF model improved. Furthermore, the importance of the sky view factor, building height, and building density was greater at a higher resolution than at a lower resolution.

TI  - The Relationship between Urban Green Space and Urban Expansion Based on Gravity Methods
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban green space, comprising parks, fields, woodlands, and other semi-natural areas, is a fundamental component of urban ecosystems. The determination of the relationship between urban green space and urban sprawl is necessary to understand urbanization and the provision of urban ecosystem services. It has been hypothesized that the center of urban (i.e., population and economic) areas in fast-growing cities would migrate toward urban green space over time. To test this hypothesis, urban expansion and urban green space expansion were examined in five cities in China and five cities in the U.S. that were experiencing high rates of growth. Landsat images of those cities from 2000 to 2017 were combined with annual population and economic data and used to quantify the extent and migration of the urban green space. These data were analyzed using the center of gravity method by Grether and Mathys and circular statistics were used to determine the relationship between urban green space and urban expansion. Eight out of the ten cities showed a divergent pattern, i.e., the population and economic centers moved in a different direction to that of the urban green space. The movement of the mean centers of the urban green spaces in the U.S. cities was more consistent than that of the Chinese cities. Over 18 years, the movement of urban green space and urban expansion in the 10 cities showed a synchronous growth trend; however, the proportion of urban green space in the cities decreased. The urban expansion rate exceeded the population growth rate, which led to problems with an unreasonable urban sprawl that is likely to deplete the provision of ecosystem services in the future. In conclusion, the centrifugal forces of urban green space that lead to the movement of population and economic centers away from green spaces play a larger role in urban change than the centripetal forces that pull these centers toward urban green space.

TI  - Inversion of Nitrogen Concentration in Apple Canopy Based on UAV Hyperspectral Images
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - As the major nutrient affecting crop growth, accurate assessing of nitrogen (N) is crucial to precise agricultural management. Although improvements based on ground and satellite data nitrogen in monitoring crops have been made, the application of these technologies is limited by expensive costs, covering small spatial scales and low spatiotemporal resolution. This study strived to explore an effective approach for inversing and mapping the distributions of the canopy nitrogen concentration (CNC) based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) hyperspectral image data in a typical apple orchard area of China. A Cubert UHD185 imaging spectrometer mounted on a UAV was used to obtain the hyperspectral images of the apple canopy. The range of the apple canopy was determined by the threshold method to eliminate the effect of the background spectrum from bare soil and shadow. We analyzed and screened out the spectral parameters sensitive to CNC, including vegetation indices (VIs), random two-band spectral indices, and red-edge parameters. The partial least squares regression (PLSR) and backpropagation neural network (BPNN) were constructed to inverse CNC based on a single spectral parameter or a combination of multiple spectral parameters. The results show that when the thresholds of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference canopy shadow index (NDCSI) were set to 0.65 and 0.45, respectively, the canopy's CNC range could be effectively identified and extracted, which was more refined than random forest classifier (RFC); the correlation between random two-band spectral indices and nitrogen concentration was stronger than that of other spectral parameters; and the BPNN model based on the combination of random two-band spectral indices and red-edge parameters was the optimal model for accurately retrieving CNC. Its modeling determination coefficient (R-2) and root mean square error (RMSE) were 0.77 and 0.16, respectively; and the validation R-2 and residual predictive deviation (RPD) were 0.75 and 1.92. The findings of this study can provide a theoretical basis and technical support for the large-scale, rapid, and non-destructive monitoring of apple nutritional status.

TI  - Automated Glacier Snow Line Altitude Calculation Method Using Landsat Series Images in the Google Earth Engine Platform
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier snow line altitude (SLA) at the end of the ablation season is an indicator of the equilibrium line altitude (ELA), which is a key parameter for calculating and assessing glacier mass balance. Here, we present an automated algorithm to classify bare ice and snow cover on glaciers using Landsat series images and calculate the minimum annual glacier snow cover ratio (SCR) and maximum SLA for reference glaciers during the 1985-2020 period in Google Earth Engine. The calculated SCR and SLA values are verified using the observed glacier accumulation area ratio (AAR) and ELA. We select 14 reference glaciers from High Mountain Asia (HMA), the Caucasus, the Alps, and Western Canada, which represent four mountainous regions with extensive glacial development in the northern hemisphere. The SLA accuracy is similar to 73%, with a mean uncertainty of +/- 24 m, for 13 of the reference glaciers. Eight of these glaciers yield R-2 > 0.5, and the other five glaciers yield R-2 > 0.3 for their respective SCR-AAR relationships. Furthermore, 10 of these glaciers yield R-2 > 0.5 and the other three glaciers yield R-2 > 0.3 for their respective SLA-ELA relationships, which indicate that the calculated SLA from this algorithm provides a good fit to the ELA observations. However, Careser Glacier yields a poor fit between the SLA calculations and ELA observations owing to tremendous surface area changes during the analyzed time series; this indicates that glacier surface shape changes due to intense ablation will lead to a misclassification of the glacier surface, resulting in deviations between the SLA and ELA. Furthermore, cloud cover, shadows, and the Otsu method limitation will further affect the SLA calculation. The post-2000 SLA values are better than those obtained before 2000 because merging the Landsat series images reduces the temporal resolution, which allows the date of the calculated SLA to be closer to the date of the observed ELA. From a regional perspective, the glaciers in the Caucasus, HMA and the Alps yield better results than those in Western Canada. This algorithm can be applied to large regions, such as HMA, to obtain snow line estimates where manual approaches are exhaustive and/or unfeasible. Furthermore, new optical data, such as that from Sentinel-2, can be incorporated to further improve the algorithm results.

TI  - Application of Gaofen-6 Images in the Downscaling of Land Surface Temperatures
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The coarse resolution of land surface temperatures (LSTs) retrieved from thermal-infrared (TIR) satellite images restricts their usage. One way to improve the resolution of such LSTs is downscaling using high-resolution remote sensing images. Herein, Gaofen-6 (GF-6) and Landsat-8 images were used to obtain original and retrieved LSTs (Landsat-8- and GF-6-retrieved-LSTs) to perform LST downscaling in the Ebinur Lake Watershed. Downscaling model was constructed, and the regression kernel was explored. The results of downscaling LST using the GF-6 normalized difference vegetation index with red-edge band 2, ratio built-up index, normalized difference sand index, and normalized difference water index as multi-remote sensing indices with multiple remote sensing indices with random forest regression method provided optimal downscaling results, with R-2 of 0.836, 0.918, and 0.941, root mean square difference of 1.04 K, 2.06 K, and 1.80 K, and the number of pixels with LST errors between -1 K and +1 K of 87.2%, 76.4%, and 81.9%, respectively. The expression of spatial distribution of 16 m-LST downscaling results corresponded with that of Landsat-8- and GF-6-retrieved-LST, and provided additional details spatial description of LST variations, which was absent in the Landsat-8- and GF-6-retrieved LSTs. The results of downscaling LST could satisfy the application requirements of LST spatial resolution.

TI  - A Novel Efficient Method for Land Cover Classification in Fragmented Agricultural Landscapes Using Sentinel Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Updated and accurate land cover maps are essential and crucial for sustainable crop production and efficient land management. However, accurate and efficient land cover mapping is still a challenge for agricultural regions with complicated landscapes. This study proposed a novel spectral-phenological based land cover classification (SPLC) method to identify the land cover for fragmented agricultural landscapes, with less requirement of ground truth data. The SPLC method integrated a pixel-based support vector machine (SVM) algorithm for cropland and various non-cropland classification, and a phenology-based automatic decision tree algorithm for identification of various crop types. It was then tested and applied in two typical case areas (i.e., Jiyuan in the upstream and Yonglian in the downstream) of Hetao Irrigation District (Hetao) in the upper Yellow River basin (YRB), northwest China. The field survey sampling data and the regional visual interpretation maps were jointly used to evaluate the accuracy of land cover classification. Results indicated that stable phenological rules can be established for crop identification even with complex planting patterns, and the SPLC method performed well in land cover mapping in case areas. Four high-accuracy land cover maps were produced for Jiyuan in 2020 and 2021, Yonglian in 2021, and Hetao in 2021. The overall accuracies (OA) can reach 0.90-0.94 based on evaluation with abundant ground truth data, and land cover maps agreed well with the visual interpretation maps in space. Overall, the case application validated the applicability and efficiency of the SPLC method in land cover mapping for regions with fragmented agricultural landscapes, and also implied the potential use in other similar regions.

TI  - Filtering Photon Cloud Data in Forested Areas Based on Elliptical Distance Parameters and Machine Learning Approach
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) was successfully launched. Due to its small spot size, multibeam configuration, high sampling rate, and strong immunity to terrain slopes, it has been regarded as a powerful tool for forest resources surveying and managing. However, the ICESat-2 photon cloud data contain considerable background photons, which discretely distribute in the background space of signal photons. Therefore, it is necessary to filter these noise photons. In this study, photons are divided into three categories: signal photons, noise photons far away from signal photons, and noise photons adjacent to signal photons. Based on the existing research, forward and backward elliptical distances were used to express the spatial relationship between two photons, and backward local density (BLD) was used to describe the density distribution of the photons. However, the single statistical parameter cannot clearly distinguish three types of photon cloud. Therefore, forward local density (FLD) and neighboring forward local density difference (NFLDD) also were defined to describe the density distribution of the photons. Finally, by combining the support vector machine (SVM), the above three density parameters were used to classify the photons by signal and noise photons. The proposed method was validated with photon cloud data acquired by the Simulated Advanced Terrain Laser Altimeter System (MATLAS), the Multiple Altimeter Beam Experimental Lidar (MABEL), and the ICESat-2 systems over different forested areas. The results demonstrated that the proposed method can well remove the noise photons and retain the signal photons without depending on any statistical assumptions or thresholds. The comprehensive accuracy of the three test sites was 0.99, 0.98, and 0.99, respectively, which was higher than those of the existing method. In addition, the total errors corresponding to the three test sites were about 0.4%, 0.5%, and 1.0% respectively, which were lower than those of the existing method.

TI  - Identification of Cultivated Land Quality Grade Using Fused Multi-Source Data and Multi-Temporal Crop Remote Sensing Information
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To explore the fast, accurate, and efficient remote sensing identification method of cultivated land quality, this study took Shandong Province as the study area, and used measured data to carry out the soil quality evaluation based on conventional GIS. On this basis, MODIS sequence images were used as remote sensing data sources, and multi-source data such as topography, meteorology, and statistical yearbook were fused. Then, according to the Pressure-State-Response framework, we constructed three kinds of characteristic indicators through distinguishing crop rotation types and fusing remote sensing data. Finally, the soil quality grade was identified by the random forest method, and the accuracy analysis was carried out. The results showed that the NDVI peak values of double-season crops are in mid-April and mid-August, and one-season crops are in mid-August. Through evaluation, soil quality was divided into three categories, with six grades. Through principal component analysis, each soil status indicator contains two to three principal components, and each principal component contains five to eight temporal crop remote sensing information. After distinguishing crop rotation types and fusing remote sensing images, the identification accuracy of soil quality is significantly improved. The overall accuracy is 79.18%, 86.12%, and 93.65%, and the Kappa coefficient is 0.66, 0.77, and 0.90, respectively. This research developed an automatic identification method for cultivated land quality grade, and it proved that distinguishing crop rotation types and fusing multi-temporal crop remote sensing information are effective ways to improve identification accuracy.

TI  - Mapping and Spatial Variation of Seagrasses in Xincun, Hainan Province, China, Based on Satellite Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Seagrass is an important structural and functional component of the global marine ecosystem and is of high value for its ecological services. This paper took Xincun Bay (including Xincun Harbor and Li'an Harbor) of Hainan Province as the study area, combined ground truth data, and adopted two methods to map seagrass in 2020 using Chinese GF2 satellite images: maximum-likelihood and object-oriented classification. Sentinel-2 images from 2016 to 2020 were used to extract information on seagrass distribution changes. The following conclusions were obtained. (1) Based on GF2 imagery, both the classical maximum likelihood classification (MLC) method and the object-based image analysis (OBIA) method can effectively extract seagrass information, and OBIA can also portray the overall condition of seagrass patches. (2) The total seagrass area in the study area in 2020 was about 395 hectares, most of which was distributed in Xincun Harbor. The southern coast of Xincun Harbor is an important area where seagrass is concentrated over about 228 hectares in a strip-like continuous distribution along the coastline. (3) The distribution of seagrasses in the study area showed a significant decaying trend from 2016 to 2020. The total area of seagrass decreased by 79.224 ha during the five years from 2016 to 2020, with a decay rate of 16.458%. This study is the first on the comprehensive monitoring of seagrass in Xincun Bay using satellite remote sensing images, and comprises the first use of GF2 data in seagrass research, aiming to provide a reference for remote sensing monitoring of seagrass in the South China Sea.

TI  - Three Types of Typhoon-Induced Upwellings Enhance Coastal Algal Blooms: A Case Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite data show that typhoon Chan-hom did trigger an algal bloom several days after passing by the East China Sea. To investigate dynamic connections between this enhanced chlorophyll-a and phosphate-rich Kuroshio subsurface water (KSSW), we set up a fine-resolution coupled physical-biological model, which effectively reproduced the oceanic conditions during this typhoon. Furthermore, we released a passive tracer along a zonal transect northeast of Taiwan. The modeled surface tracer variations along the coast of Zhejiang agreed very well with satellite data and chlorophyll-a changes in the biological model. The lowest structural similarity index between chlorophyll-a and KSSW was 0.77. Model results along a coastal section imply that typhoon Chan-hom induced additional upwellings and enhanced vertical mixing, leading to more KSSW outcropping. Through horizontal dynamic diagnostic and vertical velocity decomposition, we distinguished three types of dynamical mechanisms for the upward motions. At first, the linear wind Ekman effect existed around the coastal areas and led to intense Ekman pumping. Second, a pronounced nonlinear effect led to upwellings, and spectrum analysis revealed that this nonlinearity consisted of high-frequency near-inertial waves and low-frequency coastal shelf waves. At last, an eddy field remained after the typhoon, continuously supplying nutrients upward to the surface layer by eddy-induced Ekman pumping. This study reveals that these mechanisms may be general on the continental shelf, where typhoons can pump phosphate-rich bottom water into the upper layer and enhance primary productivity there. The results also prove typhoon-induced nonlinear wave motions on the continental shelf contribute to the outcrop of nutrients.

TI  - Full Convolution Neural Network Combined with Contextual Feature Representation for Cropland Extraction from High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The quantity and quality of cropland are the key to ensuring the sustainable development of national agriculture. Remote sensing technology can accurately and timely detect the surface information, and objectively reflect the state and changes of the ground objects. Using high-resolution remote sensing images to accurately extract cropland is the basic task of precision agriculture. The traditional model of cropland semantic segmentation based on the deep learning network is to down-sample high-resolution feature maps to low resolution, and then restore from low-resolution feature maps to high-resolution ideas; that is, obtain low-resolution feature maps through a network, and then recover to high resolution by up-sampling or deconvolution. This will bring about the loss of features, and the segmented image will be more fragmented, without very clear and smooth boundaries. A new methodology for the effective and accurate semantic segmentation cropland of high spatial resolution remote sensing images is presented in this paper. First, a multi-temporal sub-meter cropland sample dataset is automatically constructed based on the prior result data. Then, a fully convolutional neural network combined with contextual feature representation (HRNet-CFR) is improved to complete the extraction of cropland. Finally, the initial semantic segmentation results are optimized by the morphological post-processing approach, and the broken spots are ablated to obtain the internal homogeneous cropland. The proposed method has been validated on the Jilin-1 data and Gaofen Image Dataset (GID) public datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that it outperforms the state-of-the-art method in cropland extraction accuracy. We selected the comparison of Deeplabv3+ and UPerNet methods in GID. The overall accuracy of our approach is 92.03%, which is 3.4% higher than Deeplabv3+ and 5.12% higher than UperNet.

TI  - Multi-Temporal Satellite Image Composites in Google Earth Engine for Improved Landslide Visibility: A Case Study of a Glacial Landscape
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Regional early warning systems for landslides rely on historic data to forecast future events and to verify and improve alarms. However, databases of landslide events are often spatially biased towards roads or other infrastructure, with few reported in remote areas. In this study, we demonstrate how Google Earth Engine can be used to create multi-temporal change detection image composites with freely available Sentinel-1 and -2 satellite images, in order to improve landslide visibility and facilitate landslide detection. First, multispectral Sentinel-2 images were used to map landslides triggered by a summer rainstorm in Jolster (Norway), based on changes in the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) between pre- and post-event images. Pre- and post-event multi-temporal images were then created by reducing across all available images within one month before and after the landslide events, from which final change detection image composites were produced. We used the mean of backscatter intensity in co- (VV) and cross-polarisations (VH) for Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data and maximum NDVI for Sentinel-2. The NDVI-based mapping increased the number of registered events from 14 to 120, while spatial bias was decreased, from 100% of events located within 500 m of a road to 30% close to roads in the new inventory. Of the 120 landslides, 43% were also detectable in the multi-temporal SAR image composite in VV polarisation, while only the east-facing landslides were clearly visible in VH. Noise, from clouds and agriculture in Sentinel-2, and speckle in Sentinel-1, was reduced using the multi-temporal composite approaches, improving landslide visibility without compromising spatial resolution. Our results indicate that manual or automated landslide detection could be significantly improved with multi-temporal image composites using freely available earth observation images and Google Earth Engine, with valuable potential for improving spatial bias in landslide inventories. Using the multi-temporal satellite image composites, we observed significant improvements in landslide visibility in Jolster, compared with conventional bi-temporal change detection methods, and applied this for the first time using VV-polarised SAR data. The GEE scripts allow this procedure to be quickly repeated in new areas, which can be helpful for reducing spatial bias in landslide databases.

TI  - Yield Stability Analysis in Maize Hybrids of Southwest China under Genotype by Environment Interaction Using GGE Biplot
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Selecting superior genotypes across different environments is vital for varietal release, crop planting, and commercial use. Therefore, the objectives of this research were to appraise the performance of hybrids approved in recent years in diverse environments, and recommend high-yielding and stable genotypes for wider adaptation. Fourteen single cross maize hybrid genotypes (G), including a check, were implemented across ten environments (E) in two crop seasons (2020 and 2021). The combined analysis of variance revealed that G, E, and their interactive (GEI) significantly (p < 0.01) affected the grain yield. Moreover, the mean grain yield ranged from 9333 kg ha(-1) for HH-2 (2021) to 13,195 kg ha(-1) for LD-18 (2020). The "which won where" GGE biplot revealed the existence of mega environments with their own best hybrids (LD-18 and LD-29 in 2020; LD-18, LD-19, and YY-1506 in 2021). The "mean vs. stable" GGE biplot suggested that LD-18 and ZY-811, with highest/middle productive and high stability across 10 environments, were closest to the ideal genotype. Furthermore, the "discriminating power vs. representativeness" GGE biplot showed that Xuanwei, Yanshan, Gengma, and Shiling were the most the ideal test environments for hybrid selecting, based on their discriminative ability and representativeness. Therefore, the GGE biplot analysis allowed for an efficient selection of high-yielding and stable maize hybrids to guide ecological planting and commercial use.

TI  - Assessing the Relationship between Freshwater Flux and Sea Surface Salinity
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Exploring the relationship between evaporation (E)-minus-precipitation (P) and sea surface salinity (SSS) is vital for understanding global hydrological cycle changes and investigating the salinity budget. This study quantifies the uncertainty in the relationship between E - P and SSS based on satellite data over the 50 degrees S-50 degrees N ocean from 2012 to 2017 in 140 sets of combinations of E, P and SSS. We find that the uncertainty (10%) in the variability of freshwater flux (FWF) over 2012-2017 is smaller than that in SSS (15%). The difference in the combination of sets of "E-P-SSS" products can lead to the 10% difference in RMSD and 25% difference in area-weighted mean correlation coefficients between SSS tendency and FWF. There is a 24.1 similar to 58% area over the global ocean with a significant (p value < 0.05) positive correlation between the FWF and SSS tendency derived from satellite products. The seasonal EMP and SSS tendencies show larger correlation coefficients and lower RMSDs over most sets compared with those on nonseasonal time scales. Large uncertainty in the FWF-SSS tendency relation associated with spread among products prevents the use of one combination of E, P and SSS from satellite-based products for salinity budget analysis.

TI  - Analysis of Spatiotemporal Heterogeneity of Glacier Mass Balance on the Northern and Southern Slopes of the Central Tianshan Mountains, China
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier mass balance can visually indicate the degree of glacier response to climate change. The mountain glaciers are an essential source of recharge for rivers in arid regions and play a vital role in maintaining regional ecological stability and production life. This paper drives a spatially distributed degree-day model using multi-source remote sensing data such as MOD11C3 and TRMM3B43 to simulate the mass balance in the Tianshan Mountains' south and north slope basins. The spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the mass balance was compared and attributed using a Geographical detector. The results show that: (1) The glaciers in the north and south basins are mainly distributed at an altitude of 3900-4300 m, and the total glacier area accounts for 85.71%. The number of less than 1 km(2) glaciers is the most in the whole region. (2) During the study period, the glaciers in the north and south basins were negative (-465.95 mm w.e.) an entire interannual change rate was -28.36 mm w.e./a. The overall trend of ablation can be divided into two stages: from 2000 to 2010a, the persistence increased, and from 2010 to 2016a, the volatility decreased. (3) In the attribution of mass balance, the factors affecting glacier mass balance can be divided into two parts: climate and topography. The cumulative contribution rate of climate factors in Kaidu is nearly 20% higher than that of topographic factors, but the contribution rate of climate factors in Manas is only 7.3% higher. Therefore, the change of glacier mass balance in the Kaidu river basin is more driven by climate factors, while the glacier mass balance in the Manas river basin is more affected by the combination of climate and topographic factors. (4) The climate accumulation is the dominant factor in the Manas river basin (69.55%); for the ablation area, the Kaidu river basin is dominated by climate (70.85%), and the Manas river basin is dominated by topographic factors (54.11%). Due to the driving force of climate and topographic factors and the different coupling modes, glacier mass balance's spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the north and south slope basins is caused. This study contributes to analyzing the mechanism of regional changes in the glacier mass balance. It provides a scientific basis for investigating the characteristics of water resource changes and water resource regulation in the north and south slope basins of the Tianshan Mountains.

TI  - Comparison of Machine Learning Methods Applied on Multi-Source Medium-Resolution Satellite Images for Chinese Pine (<i>Pinus tabulaeformis</i>) Extraction on Google Earth Engine
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Chinese pine has tremendous applications in many fields. Mapping the distribution of Chinese pine is of great importance for government decision-making and forest management. In order to extract Chinese pine on a large scale, efficient algorithms and open remote-sensing datasets are needed. It is widely believed that machine learning algorithms and medium-resolution remote-sensing datasets can work well for this purpose. Unfortunately, their performance for Chinese pine extraction has remained unclear until now. Therefore, this study aims to explore the ability of the different machine learning algorithms and open remote-sensing datasets for Chinese pine extraction over large areas on Google Earth Engine (GEE). So, based on the combination of three typical machine learning algorithms, namely deep neural network (DNN), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and three open medium-resolution remote-sensing datasets, namely Sentinel-2, Gaofen-1, and Landsat-8 OLI, 27 models are constructed and GEE, with its powerful computing ability, is used. The main findings are as follows: (1) DNN has the highest accuracy for Chinese pine extraction, followed by SVM and RF; DNN is more sensitive to spatial geometric information, while SVM and RF algorithms are more sensitive to spectral information. (2) Spectral indexes are helpful for improving the extraction accuracy of Chinese pine. The extraction accuracy by using Gaofen-1 dataset increases 7.6% after adding spectral indexes, while the accuracies by using Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 datasets increase 1.8% and 1.9% after adding spectral indexes, respectively. (3) The extraction accuracy by using DNN and Sentinel-2 dataset with spectral indexes is the highest, with an overall accuracy of 94.4%. (4) The area of Chinese pine is 153.73 km(2), accounting for 5.06% of the administrative area of Karaqin Banner, and it is convenient to extract Chinese pine on a large scale by using GEE.

TI  - QUantitative and Automatic Atmospheric Correction (QUAAC): Application and Validation
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The difficulty of atmospheric correction based on a radiative transfer model lies in the acquisition of synchronized atmospheric parameters, especially the aerosol optical depth (AOD). At the moment, there is no fully automatic and high-efficiency atmospheric correction method to make full use of the advantages of geostationary meteorological satellites in large-scale and efficient atmospheric monitoring. Therefore, a QUantitative and Automatic Atmospheric Correction (QUAAC) method is proposed which can efficiently correct high-spatial-resolution (HSR) satellite images. QUAAC uses the atmospheric aerosol products of geostationary satellites to match the synchronized AOD according to the temporal and spatial information of HSR satellite images. This method solves the problem that the AOD is difficult to obtain or the accuracy is not high enough to meet the demand of atmospheric correction. By using the obtained atmospheric parameters, atmospheric correction is performed to obtain the surface reflectance (SR). The whole process can achieve fully automatic operation without manual intervention. After QUAAC applied to Gaofen-2 (GF-2) HSR satellite and Himawari-8 (H-8) geostationary satellite, the results show that the effect of QUAAC correction is slightly better than that of the Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hypercubes (FLAASH) correction, and the QUAAC-corrected surface spectral curves have good coherence to that of the synchronously measured by field experiments.

TI  - Regional Evapotranspiration Estimation by the Improved MOD16-sm Model and Its Application in Central China
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is a key component of the hydrological cycle, but traditional monitoring approaches are always based on measurements, which cannot satisfy the requirements of research on a regional scale. Hence, ET estimation by remote sensing is essential. MOD16 is a remote-sensing model based on the P-M equation and has good applicability. However, it describes soil moisture indirectly by RH, etc., which may cause uncertainties in ET estimating, so this study attempts to utilize the NDWI as a supplement to soil moisture information and makes improvements on the MOD16 model (with the resultant new model being named MOD16-sm). Specific work includes two aspects: one is model verification through making comparisons between ET estimates and measurements, and the other is a model application effect test analyzing the spatiotemporal characteristics of ET and exploring how ET responds to climate and land-use changes. Model verification indicated that the accuracy of the improved MOD16-sm model increased, with a higher R-2 of 0.71, a lower RMSE 0.9 mm, and a lower MAE 0.91 mm, and that the improved MOD16-sm model was convincing. The application effect test of the MOD16-sm model showed that the average relative change rate of annual ET was 1.7%, showing an upward trend, and areas with growth trends of ET also had high vegetation coverage. As for the impacts of climate and land-use changes on ET, ET was positively correlated with precipitation, whereas it had no relevant correlation with air temperature in most areas, and the ET of all land-use types displayed significant increasing trends resulting from climate change. The application effect test demonstrated that ET estimates by the improved MOD16-sm model were reasonable.

TI  - Planetary cloud tracking
T2  - EXPERIMENTS IN FLUIDS
M3  - Review
AB  - From a perspective of experimental fluid mechanics, this review describes cloud-tracking methods to extract high-resolution velocity fields from publically available images of planets (such as Jupiter, Saturn and Earth) obtained from ground-based and space-based observations. These methods include manual tracking, correlation image velocimetry (CIV) and optical flow method (OFM) that have been applied to various images of planets. The relevant issues such as image navigation, image registration and metric conversion are also discussed. The accuracy of the open-source cloud-tracking algorithms is evaluated based on simulated cloud images of Jupiter's Great Red Spot (GRS). As an example, the application of cloud tracking to the GRS cloud images obtained from NASA's space flight missions is discussed, progressively revealing the complex flow structures of the GRS. Although the cloud images of Jupiter and Saturn are mainly used in this paper, the cloud tracking methods are also applicable to satellite cloud images of Earth. As an extra example, OFM is applied to the satellite infrared images of Typhoon Rai to extract the flow structure of Rai's top layer. This review tries to open a window for experimental fluid dynamicists to explore intriguing planetary flows based on cloud images of planets.[GRAPHICS].

TI  - Evaluating Vertical Accuracies of Open-Source Digital Elevation Models over Multiple Sites in China Using GPS Control Points
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital elevation models (DEMs) are widely used across a range of fields. Several open-source global DEMs have been released, including the advanced land observing satellite world 3D 30 m DEM (AW3D30DEM), advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer global DEM (ASTER GDEM), shuttle radar topography mission DEM (SRTMDEM), and TerraSAR-X for digital elevation measurement (TanDEM-X). ASTER and SRTM are the most widely used DEMs, while the newer models AW3D30DEM and TanDEM-X are becoming increasingly popular. Many studies have evaluated the qualities of these DEMs; however, few multi-regional studies have been conducted in China. To comprehensively and systematically evaluate the qualities of these DEMs in China, the vertical accuracies of AW3D, ASTER, STRM (all 30 m), and TanDEM-X (90 m) were tested across 16 regions in China. Using high-precision global positioning system control points for reference, error values were determined by subtracting these reference values from corresponding global DEM elevation values. As the study only covered flat areas (slope < 5 degrees), slope was treated as a controlled variable. After assessing the impacts of the slope aspect and land cover type, variations in vertical accuracy were examined with respect to longitude and latitude. Overall, TanDEM-X exhibited the highest stability and accuracy, AW3D30 and SRTM also performed well, while ASTER exhibited the worst accuracy. The DEMs showed relationships with the slope aspect and land cover type, assuming that slope had no influence on vertical accuracy. In general, vertical accuracy in high latitudes was slightly better than that in low latitudes, and no evident variations were observed with respect to longitude. This study is the first to conduct DEM analysis across many regions in China from open sources. Since most of the users rely on public domain DEM datasets, this work contributes to their analysis in academic and engineering fields.

TI  - Optimum Phenological Phases for Deciduous Species Recognition: A Case Study on <i>Quercus acutissima</i> and <i>Robinia pseudoacacia</i> in Mount Tai
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tree species recognition is important for remote-sensing mapping and dynamic monitoring of forest resource. However, the complex phenological cycle poses a challenge to remote-sensing recognition of deciduous tree species in mountainous areas, and the selection of temporal phase is particularly important to improve recognition accuracy. Multispectral images of Ziyuan-1 02C (ZY-1 02C) and Ziyuan-3 (ZY-3) at three phenological phases of spring, autumn and winter (12 May, 29 September and 7 December, recorded as T5-12, T9-29 and T12-7) are selected to optimize sensitive spectral indices. Support vector machine (SVM) and maximum likelihood model (MLE) are constructed to explore the optimum phase of recognizing on Quercus acutissima (O. acutissima ) and Robinia pseudoacacia (R. pseudoacacia) in Mount Tai. The results showed the average spectral reflection intensity of O. acutissima was higher than that of R. pseudoacacia Compared to other phenological periods, the most significant spectral differences between O. acutissima and R. pseudoacacia were found in the spring (12 May), which was identified as the optimum phenological phase. Band 4 is the most sensitive band in all the three phases for the tree species recognition. Moreover, the overall recognition accuracy of deciduous tree species on 12 May reached 89.25%, which was significantly higher than the other two phases. On 12 May, the recognition accuracies of SVM based on sensitive spectral indices of up to 93.59% for O. acutissima and 85.44% for R. pseudoacacia, were higher overall than that of the MLE. Sensitive spectral indices introduced were shown to significantly improve the recognition accuracy for tree species over a single sensitive band. The study is expected to facilitate the precise recognition and forestry management on Mount Tai.

TI  - Asymmetric Interseismic Strain across the Western Altyn Tagh Fault from InSAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As the northern boundary of the Tibetan Plateau, the long Altyn Tagh fault (ATF) controls the regional tectonic environment, and the study of its long-term fault slip rate is key to understanding the tectonic evolution and deformation of the northern Tibetan Plateau. In this paper, we measure the fault slip rate of the western segment of the ATF using InSAR observations between 2015 to 2020. The Multi-Temporal Interferometric InSAR analysis is applied to obtain the two-dimensional fault-parallel and vertical displacement fields. The spatially dense InSAR observations clearly illustrate the asymmetrical pattern of displacement fields across the fault. Constrained by our InSAR observations, the fault slip rate and locking depth of the western segment of the ATF are inverted using four different models in a Bayesian framework. The two-layer viscoelastic model incorporating lateral heterogeneity of rheology in the lower crust indicates that the fault slip rate of the western ATF is estimated to be 9.8 +/- 1.1 mm/yr (at 83.8 degrees E across the ATF) and 8.6 +/- 1.1 mm/yr (at 85.1 degrees E), respectively, and the locking depth is 15.8 +/- 4.3 km and 14.8 +/- 4.9 km. Our new estimates generally agree with the previous estimates of fault slip rate constrained by GPS observations. We conclude that the contrast between the thickness of the elastic layer and the shear modulus of the Tibetan plateau and the Tarim basin jointly contribute to the asymmetric interseismic strain accumulation on the ATF.

TI  - Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data for Lake Change Detection in Xinjiang, China
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake water resources in arid areas play an important role in regional resource and environmental management. Therefore, to master the dynamic changes in lake water resources in arid areas, the laser altimetry satellite and land resource satellite were used to interpret the changes in water level and the areas of alpine lakes and non-alpine lakes. The dynamic changes in the lake and their relationship with glacial meltwater, precipitation, and runoff of the lake basin were analyzed using the unary linear regression equation, the ratio of glacier area to lake area (G-L ratio), and the ratio of lake basin area to lake area (supply coefficient). The results were as follows: the changes in alpine lakes were closely related to the supply coefficient (basin/lake area ratio) but weakly related to the G-L ratio (glacier/lake area ratio). In addition, the spatial pattern of lake change was consistent with that of climate change. There was a strong correlation between the lake, precipitation, and temperature during the snowmelt period. Thus, it can be seen that the changes in the lake were caused by precipitation, glacial melt, snowmelt, and other multi-factors. Therefore, this study on the changes in water resources in different types of lakes and their influencing factors provides data support for water resources managers to evaluate the health and sustainable utilization of the ecological environment.

TI  - Improvement of VHR Satellite Image Geometry with High Resolution Elevation Models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The number of high and very high resolution (VHR) optical satellite sensors, as well as the number of medium resolution satellites is continuously growing. However, not all high-resolution optical satellite imaging cameras have a sufficient and stable calibration in time. Due to their high agility in rotation, a quick change in viewing direction can lead to satellite attitude oscillation, causing image distortions and thus affecting image geometry and geo-positioning accuracy. This paper presents an approach based on re-projection of regularly distributed 3D ground points from object in image space, to detect and estimate the periodic distortions of Pleiades tri-stereo imagery caused by satellite attitude oscillations. For this, a hilly region was selected as a test site. Consequently, we describe a complete processing pipeline for computing the systematic height errors (deformations, waves) of the satellite-based digital elevation model by using a Lidar high resolution terrain model. Ground points with fixed positions, but with two elevations (actual and corrected) are then re-projected to the satellite images with the aid of the Rational Polynomial Coefficients (RPCs) provided with the imagery. Therefore, image corrections (displacements) are determined by computing the differences between the distinct positions of corresponding points in image space. Our experimental results in Allentsteig (Lower Austria) show that the systematic height errors of satellite-based elevation models cannot be compensated with an usual or even high number of Ground Control Points (GCPs) for RPC bias correction, due to insufficiently known image orientations. In comparison to a reference Lidar Digital Terrain Model (DTM), the computed elevation models show undulation effects with a maximum height difference of 0.88 m in along-track direction. With the proposed method, image distortions in-track direction with amplitudes of less than 0.15 pixels were detected. After applying the periodic distortion compensation to all three images, the systematic elevation discrepancies from the derived elevation models were successfully removed and the overall accuracy in open areas improved by 33% in the RMSE. Additionally, we show that a coarser resolution reference elevation model (AW3D30) is not feasible for improving the geometry of the Pleiades tri-stereo satellite imagery.

T2  - CURRENT ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - (1) Background: The purpose of the study was a retrospective, comparative assessment of complications of the surgical sentinel node biopsy (SNB) procedure in breast cancer using the radiotracer method and the SentiMag (R) method on groups of patients after 3.5 years of use. (2) Methods: The material was a group of 345 patients with primary surgical breast cancer who underwent the SNB procedure with the use of a radiotracer in combination with wide local excision (WLE), simple amputation (SA) with SNB and an independent SNB procedure in the period from May 2018 to January 2021 in the Department of Oncological Surgery. Of the patients who were monitored in the Hospital Outpatient Clinic, 300 were enrolled. The analyzed group was compared in terms of the occurrence of the same complications with the group of 303 patients also operated on in our center in the period from January 2014 to September 2017, in which SN identification was performed using the SentiMag (R) method. (3) Results: The most common complications found were sensation disorders in the arm, which occurred in 16 (14.1%) patients using the radiotracer method, SentiMag (R)-11 (9.9%). By comparing the complication rate between the methods with the radiotracer (n = 300) and SentiMag (R) (n = 303), no significant differences were found. (4) Conclusions: Sentinel node (SN) identification using the radiotracer method and the SentiMag (R) method are comparable diagnostic methods in breast cancer, with a low risk of complications.

TI  - Ambiguity of Divine and Royal Portraiture and the Hiyawan Image of Kingship: Political Identity through the Monuments of cINEKoY and KARATEPE
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF OVERSEAS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper examines the content of the cINEKoY and KARATEPE Inscriptions, the selection of scripts on the monuments, and the choices of iconography on the two statues of the Storm God. These monuments represent a regionally and temporally specific practice of representation that ambiguously blends elements of divine and royal imagery into a new form, while taking a similar approach to the semiotics of rulership as the Neo-Assyrian kings. The combined elements of the monuments suggest a unique cultural strategy in which the agency of the ruler is blended with that of the Storm God, exemplifying the specific worldview of Iron Age Cilicia that informed their composition. The rulers who created these monuments sought to assert their political identity through the combination of the figural representations, the visuality of the scripts, and the content of the inscriptions; the two monuments illustrate a drastic change in the political agenda of the kingdom of Hiyawa, reflecting a shift in power among opposing political factions. These identities also contain a sense of intentional ambiguity, as the various elements do not immediately support the same message, but rather work together to propagate a multifaceted message of military prowess, commercial interconnectedness, and royal legitimacy and kingship.

TI  - Using Remote Sensing Data and Species-Environmental Matching Model to Predict the Potential Distribution of Grassland Rodents in the Northern China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An increase in grassland rodent pests in China has seriously affected grassland ecological environments and the development of husbandry. Here, we used remote sensing data and a species-environmental matching model to predict the potential spatial distribution of the five major rodent pest species (Microtus, Citellus, Myospalax, Meriones, Ochotona) in northern China, and examined how the predicted suitability of the area depends on environmental variables. The results were consistent and significant, better than random, and close to optimal. Meriones and Microtus had the largest areas of High Suitability and Moderate Suitability with regard to environmental conditions. The combination analysis of areas of Moderate Suitability and High Suitability showed that for 66% of the total area, conditions were suitable for just one rodent species, while conditions suitable for two and three kinds of rodents accounted for 31% and 3%, respectively. Altitude, land surface temperature in winter (November, December, February) and summer (May, June, July), vegetation cover in summer (July, August), and precipitation from spring to summer (April, May, June) determined the spatial distribution of grassland rodents. Our findings provide a powerful and useful methodological tool for tracking the five major rodent pest species in northern China and for future management measures to ensure grassland ecological environment security.

TI  - Extraction of Agricultural Fields via DASFNet with Dual Attention Mechanism and Multi-scale Feature Fusion in South Xinjiang, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural fields are essential in providing human beings with paramount food and other materials. Quick and accurate identification of agricultural fields from the remote sensing images is a crucial task in digital and precision agriculture. Deep learning methods have the advantages of fast and accurate image segmentation, especially for extracting the agricultural fields from remote sensing images. This paper proposed a deep neural network with a dual attention mechanism and a multi-scale feature fusion (Dual Attention and Scale Fusion Network, DASFNet) to extract the cropland from a GaoFen-2 (GF-2) image of 2017 in Alar, south Xinjiang, China. First, we constructed an agricultural field segmentation dataset from the GF-2 image. Next, seven evaluation indices were selected to assess the extraction accuracy, including the location shift, to reveal the spatial relationship and facilitate a better evaluation. Finally, we proposed DASFNet incorporating three ameliorated and novel deep learning modules with the dual attention mechanism and multi-scale feature fusion methods. The comparison of these modules indicated their effects and advantages. Compared with different segmentation convolutional neural networks, DASFNet achieved the best testing accuracy in extracting fields with an F1-score of 0.9017, an intersection over a union of 0.8932, a Kappa coefficient of 0.8869, and a location shift of 1.1752 pixels. Agricultural fields can be extracted automatedly and accurately using DASFNet, which reduces the manual record of the agricultural field information and is conducive to further farmland surveys, protection, and management.

TI  - Multi-Time Scale Analysis of Urbanization in Urban Thermal Environment in Major Function-Oriented Zones at Landsat-Scale: A Case Study of Hefei City, China
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization and increasing demand for natural resources and land have affected the urban thermal environment. This is an important hot topic in urban climate research. In this study, we obtained multi-time scale land surface temperatures (LST) at the Landsat scale in Hefei, China, from 2011 to 2020. The evolution of the surface urban heat island (SUHI) was analyzed, and the contribution index (CI), urban thermal field variation index (UTFVI), and landscape pattern were evaluated to analyze the thermal environment mechanism of a major function-oriented zone (MFOZ). In addition, we explored the role and mechanism of different MFOZs in a thermal environment. Our results show that the multi-time scale differences in the SUHI were obvious, with the phenomenon of heat islands being concentrated in the main city zone. There are significant multi-time scale differences in the CI of different landscapes under the MFOZ. The UTFVI analysis of the MFOZ shows that the livability of the cities in the core optimization zone (COZ) and modern urbanization and industrialization cluster development zone (IDZ) is poor. MFOZ planning moderately alleviated the urban thermal environment of the entire study area, especially in the agricultural development zone (ADZ) and ecological conservation zone (ECZ). This study can guide the planning of the MFOZ and guide decision-makers in selecting governance zones when planning policies or dividing the key restoration areas of the thermal environment.

TI  - Performance and Uncertainty of Satellite-Derived Bathymetry Empirical Approaches in an Energetic Coastal Environment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives of this study are to evaluate the performance of different satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) empirical models developed for multispectral satellite mission applications and to propose an uncertainty model based on inferential statistics. The study site is the Arcachon Bay inlet (France). A dataset composed of 450,837 echosounder data points and 89 Sentinel-2 A/B and Landsat-8 images acquired from 2013 to 2020, is generated to test and validate SDB and uncertainty models for various contrasting optical conditions. Results show that water column optical properties are characterized by a high spatio-temporal variability controlled by hydrodynamics and seasonal conditions. The best performance and highest robustness are found for the cluster-based approach using a green band log-linear regression model. A total of 80 satellite images can be exploited to calibrate SDB models, providing average values of root mean square error and maximum bathymetry of 0.53 m and 7.3 m, respectively. The uncertainty model, developed to extrapolate information beyond the calibration dataset, is based on a multi-scene approach. The sensitivity of the model to the optical variability not explained by the calibration dataset is demonstrated but represents a risk of error of less than 5%. Finally, the uncertainty model applied to a diachronic analysis definitively demonstrates the interest in SDB maps for a better understanding of morphodynamic evolutions of large-scale and complex coastal systems.

TI  - Tetraspanin CD9 Expression Predicts Sentinel Node Status in Patients with Cutaneous Melanoma
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The tetraspanin CD9 is considered a metastasis suppressor in many cancers, however its role is highly debated. Currently, little is known about CD9 prognostic value in cutaneous melanoma. Our aim was to analyse CD9 expression in melanocytic nevi and primary cutaneous melanomas through immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence approaches to determine its correlation with invasiveness and metastatic potential. CD9 displayed homogeneous staining in all melanocytic nevi. In contrast, it showed a complete loss of reactivity in all thin melanomas. Interestingly, CD9 was re-expressed in 46% of intermediate and thick melanomas in small tumor clusters predominantly located at sites of invasion near or inside the blood or lymphatic vessels. The most notable finding is that all CD9 stained melanomas presented sentinel node positivity. Additionally, a direct association between CD9 expression and presence of distant metastasis was reported. Finally, we confirm that CD9 expression is consistent with an early protective role against tumorigenesis, however, our data endorse in melanoma a specific function of CD9 in vascular dissemination during late tumor progression. The presence of CD9 hotspots could be essential for melanoma cell invasion in lymphatic and endothelial vessels. CD9 could be a valid prognostic factor for lymph node metastasis risk.

TI  - Aerosol Optical Thickness Retrieval in Presence of Cloud: Application to S3A/SLSTR Observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Combined Inversion of Surface and AeRosols (CISAR) algorithm for the joint retrieval of surface and aerosol single scattering properties has been further developed in order to extend the retrieval to clouds and overcome the need for an external cloud mask. Pixels located in the transition zone between pure cloud and pure aerosol are often discarded by both aerosol and cloud algorithms, despite being essential for studying aerosol-cloud interactions, which still represent the largest source of uncertainty in climate predictions. The proposed approach aims at filling this gap and deepening the understanding of aerosol properties in cloudy environments. The new CISAR version is applied to Sentinel-3A/SLSTR observations and evaluated against different satellite products and ground measurements. The spatial coverage is greatly improved with respect to algorithms processing only pixels flagged as clear sky by the SLSTR cloud mask. The continuous retrieval of aerosol properties without any safety zone around clouds opens new possibilities for studying aerosol properties in cloudy environments.

TI  - ECDNet: A bilateral lightweight cloud detection network for remote sensing images
T2  - PATTERN RECOGNITION
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud detection is one of the critical tasks in remote sensing image pre-processing and it has attracted extensive research interest. In recent years, deep neural networks based cloud detection methods have surpassed the traditional methods (threshold-based methods and conventional machine learning-based methods). However, current approaches mainly focus on improving detection accuracy. The computation complexity and large model size are ignored. To tackle this problem, we propose a lightweight deep learning cloud detection model: Efficient Cloud Detection Network (ECDNet). This model is based on the encoder-decoder structure. In the encoder, a two-path architecture is proposed to extract the spatial and semantic information concurrently. One pathway is the detail branch. It is designed to capture low-level detail spatial features with only a few parameters. The other pathway is the semantic branch, which is mainly for capturing context features. In the semantic branch, a proposed dense pyramid module (DPM) is designed for multi-scale contextual information extraction. The number of parameters and calculations in DPM is greatly reduced by features reusing. Besides, a FusionBlock is developed to merge these two kinds of information. Then the extreme lightweight decoder recovers the cloud mask to the same scale as the input image step by step. To improve performance, boost loss is introduced without inference cost increment. We evaluate the proposed method on two public datasets: LandSat8 and MODIS. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed ECDNet achieves comparable accuracy as the state-of-art cloud detection methods, and meantime has a much smaller model size and less computation burden.

TI  - Mapping Fire Susceptibility in the Brazilian Amazon Forests Using Multitemporal Remote Sensing and Time-Varying Unsupervised Anomaly Detection
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The economic and environmental impacts of wildfires have leveraged the development of new technologies to prevent and reduce the occurrence of these devastating events. Indeed, identifying and mapping fire-susceptible areas arise as critical tasks, not only to pave the way for rapid responses to attenuate the fire spreading, but also to support emergency evacuation plans for the families affected by fire-related tragedies. Aiming at simultaneously mapping and measuring the risk of fires in the forest areas of Brazil's Amazon, in this paper we combine multitemporal remote sensing, derivative spectral indices, and anomaly detection into a fully unsupervised methodology. We focus our analysis on recent forest fire events that occurred in the Brazilian Amazon by exploring multitemporal images acquired by both Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager and Modis sensors. We experimentally confirm that the current methodology is capable of predicting fire outbreaks immediately at posterior instants, which attests to the operational performance and applicability of our approach to preventing and mitigating the impact of fires in Brazilian forest regions.

TI  - Thaw Settlement Monitoring and Active Layer Thickness Retrieval Using Time Series COSMO-SkyMed Imagery in Iqaluit Airport
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Thaw consolidation of degrading permafrost is a serious hazard to the safety and operation of infrastructure. Monitoring thermal changes in the active layer (AL), the proportion of the soil above permafrost that thaws and freezes periodically, is critical to understanding the conditions of the top layer above the permafrost and regulating the construction, operation, and maintenance of facilities. However, this is a very challenging task using ground-based methods such as ground-penetrating radar (GPR) or temperature sensors. This study explores the integration of interferometric measurements from high-resolution X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images and volumetric water content (VWC) data from SoilGrids to quantify detailed spatial variations in active layer thickness (ALT) in Iqaluit, the territorial capital of Nunavut in Canada. A total of 21 SAR images from COSMO Sky-Med (CSK) were first analyzed using the freely connected network interferometric synthetic aperture radar (FCNInSAR) method to map spatial and temporal variations in ground surface subsidence in the study area. Subsequently, we built an ALT retrieval model by introducing the thaw settlement coefficient, which takes soil properties and saturation state into account. The subsidence measurements from InSAR were then integrated with VWC extracted from the SoilGrids database to estimate changes in ALT. For validation, we conducted a comparison between estimated ALTs and in situ measurements in the airport sector. The InSAR survey identifies several sites of ground deformation at Iqaluit, subsiding at rates exceeding 80 mm/year. The subsidence rate changes along the runway coincide with frost cracks and ice-wedge furrows. The obtained ALTs, ranging from 0 to 5 m, vary significantly in different sediments. Maximum ALTs are found for rock areas, while shallow ALTs are distributed in the till blanket (Tb), the intertidal (Mi) sediments, and the alluvial flood plain (Afp) sediment units. The intersection of taxiway and runway has an AL thicker than other parts in the glaciomarine deltaic (GMd) sediments. Our study suggests that combining high-resolution SAR imagery with VWC data can provide more comprehensive ALT knowledge for hazard prevention and infrastructure operation in the permafrost zone.

TI  - Most Commonly-Consumed Food Items by Food Group, and by Province, in China: Implications for Diet Quality Monitoring
T2  - NUTRIENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Dietary quality is of great significance to human health at all country income levels. However, low-cost and simple methods for population-level assessment and monitoring of diet quality are scarce. Within these contexts, our study aimed to identify the sentinel foods nationally and by province of 29 food groups to adapt the diet quality questionnaire (DQQ) for China, and validate the effectiveness of the DQQ using data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS). The DQQ is a rapid dietary assessment tool with qualitative and quantitative analysis to determine appropriate sentinel foods to represent each of 29 food groups. Dietary data of 13,076 participants aged 15 years or older were obtained from wave 2011 of CHNS, and each food and non-alcoholic beverage was grouped into 29 food groups of the DQQ. The data were analyzed to determine the most commonly consumed food items in each food group, nationally and in each province. Key informant interviews of 25 individuals familiar with diets in diverse provinces were also conducted to identify food items that may be more common in specific provinces. China's DQQ was finalized based on identification of sentinel foods from the key informant interviews, and initial national results of the quantitative data. Consumption of sentinel foods accounted for over 95% of people who consumed any food item in each food group, at national levels and in all provinces for almost all food groups, indicating the reliability of the sentinel food approach. Food-group consumption data can be obtained through DQQ to analyze dietary diversity as well as compliance with WHO global dietary guidance on healthy diets, providing a low-burden, food-group-based and simple method for China to evaluate diet quality at the whole population level.

TI  - Photometric study of semi-detached eclipsing binary TW Cas based on TESS photometry
T2  - NEW ASTRONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - TW Cas is an eclipsing binary that contains B-type and solar-like components with an orbital period of 1.42832665 d and mass ratio of 0.4873. The semi-detached configuration makes it a key goal for understanding Algol-type eclipsing binaries evolution. However, the physical parameters and evolutionary state of TW Cas are still unknown. W-D differential correction program was employed to give orbital parameters and configuration and extend our knowledge of TW Cas evolution. We present light curves and 64 eclipsing times observed by Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) telescope. Photometric analyses of the TESS light curve suggest that TW Cas is a semi-detached system where the less massive component is filling its critical Roche lobe, and a large dark spot is found on the polar of the less massive one. By using all light minima times, it is detected that the O - C curve shows an upward parabolic change while a cyclic oscillation is superimposed with an amplitude of 0.024585 days and a period of 113.41 yr. The upward parabolic change may indicate a long-term increase of the orbital period at a rate of 1.41 x 10(-7) days yr(-1), which reveals a rapid mass transfer between the components. The cyclic oscillation might result from the light-travel-time effect owing to the presence of a third body. The semi-detached configuration that less mass component fills its Roche lobe, together with the long-term increase of orbital period and the presence of a large dark spot on the less massive component indicates that TW Ca is at a critical stage of evolution after a mass ratio inversion.

TI  - Long-Term (2017-2020) Aerosol Optical Depth Observations in Hohhot City in Mongolian Plateau and the Impacts from Different Types of Aerosol
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements for 2017-2020 in urban Hohhot of the Mongolian plateau, a transition zone between the depopulated zone and East Asian urban agglomeration, were analyzed for the first time. Results show that annual AOD(500) and angstrom ngstrom exponent alpha(440-675) were 0.36 +/- 0.09 and 1.11 +/- 0.16 (2017), 0.41 +/- 0.12 and 0.90 +/- 0.28 (2018), 0.38 +/- 0.09 and 1.13 +/- 0.24 (2019), 0.38 +/- 0.12 and 1.17 +/- 0.22 (2020), respectively, representing a slightly polluted level with a mixed type of coarse dust aerosol and a fine urban/industrial aerosol. Throughout the year, depopulated-zone continental air flows predominated in Hohhot (i.e., NW-quadrant wind), accounting for 82.12% (spring), 74.54% (summer), 63.61% (autumn), and 100% (winter). The clean and strong NW-quadrant air flows induced by the south movement of a Siberian anticyclone resulted in a low 500-nm AOD of 0.30 +/- 0.29, 0.20 +/- 0.15, 0.24 +/- 0.29, and 0.13 +/- 0.08 from spring to winter. Meanwhile, the local emissions from Hohhot city, as well as anthropogenic urban/industrial aerosols transported by southern and western air masses, originating from southern urban agglomeration and western industrial cities (Baotou, Wuhai, etc.), contributed to the highest aerosol loading, with significant transformation rates of the secondary aerosols Sulfate-Nitrate-Ammonium (SNA) of 47.45%, 57.39%, 49.88%, and 45.16-47.36% in PM2.5 for each season. The extinction fraction of fine aerosols under these anthropogenic trajectories can be as high as 80%, and the largest fine aerosol size was around 0.2-0.25 mu m. Dust aerosols were suspending in urban Hohhot all year, although at different levels for different seasons, and the extinction fraction of dust aerosol during sandstorms was generally higher than 70%.

TI  - Time-series maps reveal widespread change in plant functional type cover across Arctic and boreal Alaska and Yukon
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Widespread changes in the distribution and abundance of plant functional types (PFTs) are occurring in Arctic and boreal ecosystems due to the intensification of disturbances, such as fire, and climate-driven vegetation dynamics, such as tundra shrub expansion. To understand how these changes affect boreal and tundra ecosystems, we need to first quantify change for multiple PFTs across recent years. While landscape patches are generally composed of a mixture of PFTs, most previous moderate resolution (30 m) remote sensing analyses have mapped vegetation distribution and change within land cover categories that are based on the dominant PFT; or else the continuous distribution of one or a few PFTs, but for a single point in time. Here we map a 35 year time-series (1985-2020) of top cover (TC) for seven PFTs across a 1.77 x 10(6) km(2) study area in northern and central Alaska and northwestern Canada. We improve on previous methods of detecting vegetation change by modeling TC, a continuous measure of plant abundance. The PFTs collectively include all vascular plants within the study area as well as light macrolichens, a nonvascular class of high importance to caribou management. We identified net increases in deciduous shrubs (66 x 10(3) km(2)), evergreen shrubs (20 x 10(3) km(2)), broadleaf trees (17 x 10(3) km(2)), and conifer trees (16 x 10(3) km(2)), and net decreases in graminoids (-40 x 10(3) km(2)) and light macrolichens (-13 x 10(3) km(2)) over the full map area, with similar patterns across Arctic, oroarctic, and boreal bioclimatic zones. Model performance was assessed using spatially blocked, nested five-fold cross-validation with overall root mean square errors ranging from 8.3% to 19.0%. Most net change occurred as succession or plant expansion within areas undisturbed by recent fire, though PFT TC change also clearly resulted from fire disturbance. These maps have important applications for assessment of surface energy budgets, permafrost changes, nutrient cycling, and wildlife management and movement analysis.

TI  - Framing the Pandemic: An Examination of How WHO Guidelines Turned into Jain Religious Practices
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper identifies and examines a Jain narrative that frames Jain tenets as being in line with some of the most impactful COVID-19 measures. It demonstrates how during the early stages of the pandemic (i.e., mid-March 2020 to January 2021), some Jains drew parallels between various Jain principles and the WHO guidelines, finding agreement, for instance, between the muhpatti ("face cloth") and the public face mask and the dig-vrata (a Jain vow of restraint) and social distancing. This paper shows how some also viewed several unintentional consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic (such as not being able to go shopping during the lockdown) as being in line with Jain practices (here the practice of aparigraha or non-possessiveness). By means of an analysis of two Jain writings on the WHO guidelines, I demonstrate how some Jains framed several COVID-19 measures within a distinctive Jain worldview. I argue that the equation of Jain practices with the WHO guidelines should be understood within the ongoing universalization and scientization of Jainism, processes that present Jainism as a universal and scientific solution to global disasters, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - Cropping Patterns of Annual Crops: A Remote Sensing Review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Cropping patterns are defined as the sequence and spatial arrangement of annual crops on a piece of land. Knowledge of cropping patterns is crucial for crop production and land-use intensity. While cropping patterns are related to crop production and land use intensity, they are rarely reported in agricultural statistics, especially those relating to small farms in developing countries. Remote sensing has enabled mapping cropping patterns by monitoring crops' spatial and temporal dynamics. In this paper, we reviewed remote sensing studies of single, sequential and intercropping patterns of annual crops practiced at local and regional scales. A total of 90 studies were selected from 753 publications based on their cropping pattern types and relevance to the scope of this review. The review found that despite the increase in single cropping pattern studies due to the Sentinel missions, studies on intercropping patterns are rare, suggesting that mapping intercropping is still challenging. More so, microwave remote sensing for mapping intercropping has not been fully explored. Given the complexities in mapping intercropping, our review highlights how less frequently used vegetation indices (VIs) that benefit from red-edge and SWIR spectral bands may improve intercropping mapping.

TI  - Biomarkers Associated with Lymph Nodal Metastasis in Endometrioid Endometrial Carcinoma
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary In endometrial cancer, lymph node invasion assessed through surgical lymphadenectomy or sentinel lymph node biopsy is a determinant factor for the prognosis and planification of adjuvant treatment. Those surgical procedures are associated with short- and long-term complications. Recent advances in molecular characterization of endometrial cancer have provided important insights into the biological nature of tumors but have not improved the pre-operative prediction of LND. This study is a description of the transcriptomic landscape associated with lymph node metastases in endometroid endometrial carcinomas. A 54-genes expression signature was generated at analysis of the primary tumor. Differential gene expression was found between patients with and without lymph node metastasis, with an 87% accuracy. Our findings provide a basis for the development of a gene expression-based signature that can be used to pre-operatively select patients for whom surgical assessment of lymph node status is of little value, and, consequently, an unfavorable risk-benefit balance. Introduction. Lymph node metastasis is determinant in the prognosis and treatment of endometrioid endometrial cancer (EEC) but the risk-benefit balance of surgical lymph node staging remains controversial. Objective. Describe the pathways associated with lymph node metastases in EEC detected by whole RNA sequencing. Methods. RNA-sequencing was performed on a retrospective series of 30 non-metastatic EEC. N+ and N- patients were matched for tumoral size, tumoral grade and myometrial invasion. Results. Twenty-eight EECs were analyzable (16 N+ and 12 N-). Bioinformatics Unsupervised analysis revealed three patterns of expression, enriched in N+, mix of N+/N- and enriched in N-, respectively. The cluster with only N+ patient overexpressed extra cellular matrix, epithelial to mesenchymal and smooth muscle contraction pathways with respect to the N- profile. Differential expression analysis between N+ and N- was used to generate a 54-genes signature with an 87% accuracy. Conclusion. RNA-expression analysis provides a basis to develop a gene expression-based signature that could pre-operatively predict lymph node invasion.

TI  - Should Endometrial Cancer Treatment Be Centralized?
T2  - BIOLOGY-BASEL
M3  - Review
AB  - Simple Summary Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most frequent cancer of the female genital tract in Western and emerging countries. It is commonly thought to be easy to treat as it is usually diagnosed at an early stage, and hysterectomy with bilateral adnexectomy alone is the only treatment required. The progressive replacement of systematic lymphadenectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy has also fostered this erroneous belief. In fact, if mistreated, EC has a high lethality due to its poor response to chemotherapy in the cases of advanced stage and recurrence. In this paper we reviewed the literature to understand whether the treatment of EC should be reserved for gynecologic oncologists and whether treatment of EC patients should be centralized in high-volume hospitals. We also evaluated the contribution of other specialists involved in the diagnostic and therapeutic pathways of EC. Finally, we suggest a possible network to treat EC patients to ensure effective staging and treatment. Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common malignancy of the female genital tract in Western and emerging countries. In 2012, new cancer cases numbered 319,605, and 76,160 cancer deaths were diagnosed worldwide. ECs are usually diagnosed after menopause; 70% of ECs are diagnosed at an early stage with a favorable prognosis and a 5-year overall survival rate of 77%. On the contrary, women with advanced or recurrent disease have extremely poor outcomes because they show a low response rate to conventional chemotherapy. EC is generally considered easy to treat, although it presents a 5-year mortality of 25%. Though the guidelines (GLs) recommend treatment in specialized centers by physicians specializing in gynecologic oncology, most women are managed by general gynecologists, resulting in differences and discrepancies in clinical management. In this paper we reviewed the literature with the aim of highlighting where the treatment of EC patients requires gynecologic oncologists, as suggested by the GLs. Moreover, we sought to identify the causes of the lack of GL adherence, suggesting useful changes to ensure adequate treatment for all EC patients.

TI  - Forecasting of Built-Up Land Expansion in a Desert Urban Environment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, socioeconomic transformation and social modernisation in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states have led to tremendous changes in lifestyle and, subsequently, expansion of urban settlements. This accelerated growth is pronounced not only across vegetated coasts, plains, and mountains, but also in desert cities. Nevertheless, spatial simulation and prediction of desert urban patterns has received little attention, including in Oman. While most urban settlements in Oman are located in desert environments, research exploring and monitoring this type of urban growth is rare in the scientific literature. This research focuses on analysing and predicting land use-land cover (LULC) changes across the desert city of Ibri in Oman. A methodology was employed involving integrating the multilayer perceptron (MLP) and Markov chain (MC) techniques to forecast spatiotemporal LULC dynamics and map urban growth patterns. The inputs were three Landsat images from 2010 and 2020, and a series of covariate layers based on transforms of elevation, slope, population settlements, urban centres, and points of interest that proxy the driving forces of change. The findings indicated that the observed LULC changes were predominantly rapid across the city during 2010 to 2020, transforming desert, bare land, and vegetation into built-up areas. The forecast showed that area of land conversion from desert to urban would be 5666 ha during the next two decades and 7751 ha by 2050. Similarly, vacant land is expected to contribute large areas to urban expansion (2370 ha by 2040, and 3266 ha by 2050), although desert cities confront numerous environmental challenges, including water scarcity, shrinking vegetation cover, and being converted into residential land. Massive urban expansion has consequences for biodiversity and natural ecosystems-particularly in green areas, which are expected to decline by approximately 107 ha by 2040 (i.e., 10%) and 166 ha by 2050. The outcomes of this research provide fundamental guidance for decision-makers and planners in Oman and elsewhere to effectively monitor and manage desert urban dynamics and sustainable desert cities.

TI  - Detection of Tree Decline (<i>Pinus pinaster</i> Aiton) in European Forests Using Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Moderate-resolution satellite imagery is essential to detect conifer tree decline on a regional scale and address the threat caused by pinewood nematode (PWN), (Bursaphelenchus xylophilus. This is a quarantine organism responsible for pine wilt disease (PWD), which has caused substantial ecological and economic losses in the maritime pine (Pinus pinaster) forests of Portugal. This study describes the first instance of a pre-operational algorithm applied to Sentinel-2 imagery to detect PWD-compatible decline in maritime pine. The Random Forest model relied on a pre-wilting and an in-season image, calibrated with data from a 24-month long field campaign enhanced with Worldview-3 data and the analysis of biological samples (hyperspectral reflectance, pigment quantification in needles, and PWN identification). Independent validation results attested to the good performance of the model with an overall accuracy of 95%, particularly when decline affects more than 30% of the 100 m(2) pixel of Sentinel-2. Spectral angle mapper applied to hyperspectral measurements suggested that PWN infection cannot be separated from other drivers of decline in the visible-near infrared domain. Our algorithm can be employed to detect regional decline trends and inform subsequent aerial and field surveys, to further investigate decline hotspots.

TI  - Binding indocyanine green to human serum albumin potentially enhances the detection of sentinel lymph nodes. An initial step for facilitating the detection of first-station nodes in penile and other urological cancers
T2  - ARCHIVES OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Surgical oncology strives to remove the primary cancer tumor together with its local lymphatic tissue. One of the techniques improving the staging of lymph nodes is sentinel node biopsy. The most common agent used in SNB is indocyanine green (ICG). Indocyanine green is characterized by its high affinity for human serum albumin (HSA). In practice, the visualization of the sentinel node is enhanced by attaching a relatively large carrier to the ICG molecule. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the covalent linking of ICG to a nanocolloid would extend the time of detection of the dye as it binds to HSA, assessed by fluorescence measurements in vitro. Material and methods: The influence of the molar concentration of ICG on its ability to form a complex with HSA was investigated. The dye luminescence was measured, with an increasing amount of dye in the presence of a constant concentration of HSA. The stability of the ICG:HSA complex was also investigated. Results: The binding of ICG and human protein in a solution ratio of 3 : 1 made it possible to detect the ICG luminescence with better and prolonged visibility. In the case of the two lowest ratios, complex formation was not observed. The use of ICG bound to a nanocolloid based on human serum albumin increases the luminescence of the HSA : ICG complex up to 98%. Conclusions: Properly selected proportions of human albumin protein and ICH allowed higher and longer luminescence to be achieved. Nevertheless, further studies are necessary to establish the optimal concentration ratio.

TI  - Direct and Legacy Effects of Spring Temperature Anomalies on Seasonal Productivity in Northern Ecosystems
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Warmer or cooler spring in northern high latitudes will, for the most part, directly impact gross primary productivity (GPP) of ecosystems, but also carry consequences for the upcoming seasonal GPP. Spatiotemporal patterns of these legacy effects are still largely unknown but important for improving our understanding of how plant phenology is associated with vegetation dynamics. In this study, impacts of spring temperature anomalies on spring, summer and autumn GPP were investigated, and the dominant drivers of summer and autumn GPP including air temperature, vapor pressure deficit and soil moisture have been explored for northern ecosystems (>30 degrees N). Three remote sensing products of seasonal GPP (GOSIF-GPP, NIRv-GPP and FluxSat-GPP) over 2001-2018, all based on a spatial resolution of 0.05 degrees, were employed. Our results indicate that legacy effects from spring temperature are most pronounced in summer, where they have stimulating effects on the Arctic ecosystem productivity. Spring warming likely lessens the harsh climatic constraints that govern the Arctic tundra and extends the growing season length. Further south, legacy effects are mainly negative. This strengthens the hypothesis that enhanced vegetation growth in spring will increase plant water demand and stress in summer and autumn. Soil moisture is the dominant control of summer GPP in temperate regions. However, the dominant meteorological variables controlling vegetation growth may differ depending on the GPP products, highlighting the need to address uncertainties among different methods of estimating GPP.

TI  - A New Orbiting Deployable System for Small Satellite Observations for Ecology and Earth Observation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we present several study cases focused on marine, oceanographic, and atmospheric environments, which would greatly benefit from the use of a deployable system for small satellite observations. As opposed to the large standard ones, small satellites have become an effective and affordable alternative access to space, owing to their lower costs, innovative design and technology, and higher revisiting times, when launched in a constellation configuration. One of the biggest challenges is created by the small satellite instrumentation working in the visible (VIS), infrared (IR), and microwave (MW) spectral ranges, for which the resolution of the acquired data depends on the physical dimension of the telescope and the antenna collecting the signal. In this respect, a deployable payload, fitting the limited size and mass imposed by the small satellite architecture, once unfolded in space, can reach performances similar to those of larger satellites. In this study, we show how ecology and Earth Observations can benefit from data acquired by small satellites, and how they can be further improved thanks to deployable payloads. We focus on DORA-Deployable Optics for Remote sensing Applications-in the VIS to TIR spectral range, and on a planned application in the MW spectral range, and we carry out a radiometric analysis to verify its performances for Earth Observation studies.

TI  - Formation of acoustic nonlinear structures in non-Maxwellian trapping plasmas
T2  - PHYSICS OF FLUIDS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, expressions of number densities for electron trapping for generalized (r, q), kappa, and Cairns distribution functions, respectively, are reported using the approach adopted by Landau and Lifshitz for Maxwellian trapping of electrons. For illustrative purposes, dispersive and dissipative equations for ion-acoustic waves are obtained in the presence of non-Maxwellian trapped electrons in the small amplitude limit. The solutions of the modified dispersive and dissipative nonlinear equations are reported, and a graphical analysis is given to present a detailed comparison of non-Maxwellian and Maxwellian trapping. The results presented here, to the best of authors' knowledge, are a first attempt of this kind. It is expected that the present investigation will unravel new horizons for future research and encourage the researchers to search for the nonlinear structures presented in this paper in the satellite data.

TI  - Detection of Aseismic Slip and Poroelastic Reservoir Deformation at the North Brawley Geothermal Field From 2009 to 2019
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The North Brawley Geothermal Field, located within the Brawley Seismic Zone of Southern California, presents a case study for understanding seismic hazards linked to fluid injection and geothermal energy extraction. An earthquake swarm near the geothermal field in 2012 included two earthquakes with magnitudes greater than 5 and was potentially preceded by a years-long aseismic slip transient. To better understand ground deformation around the geothermal field, including its evolution with time and its physical mechanisms, we analyze deformation before, during, and after the swarm using ground- and satellite-based geodetic techniques between 2009 and 2019. We integrate observations from GNSS, Sentinel-1, TerraSAR-X, UAVSAR, and leveling surveys into a single deformation history. Modeling of this new collection of observations at the North Brawley Geothermal Field provides evidence for 80% more pre-swarm aseismic slip than previously recognized from 2009 to 2012. During the 2012 Brawley swarm, our geodetic slip inversions closely match the results of seismic waveform inversions from the swarm events. After the 2012 swarm, surface deformation is dominated by poroelastic deformation of a shallow fluid reservoir at <1 km depth rather than fault slip. The deformation history and seismicity catalogs at North Brawley suggest a cessation of fault-related slip during the similar to 7 years after the 2012 earthquake swarm.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine trends, characteristics, and oncologic outcomes of sentinel lymph node biopsy for early endometrial cancer. METHODS: This observational study queried the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program by examining 83,139 women with endometrial cancer who underwent primary hysterectomy with nodal evaluation for T1 disease from 2003 to 2018. Primary outcome measures were the temporal trends in utilization of sentinel lymph node biopsy and patient characteristics associated with sentinel lymph node biopsy use, assessed by multivariable binary logistic regression models. Secondary outcome measure was endometrial cancer-specific mortality associated with sentinel lymph node biopsy, assessed by propensity score inverse probability of treatment weighting. RESULTS: The utilization of sentinel lymph node biopsy increased from 0.2 to 29.7% from 2005 to 2018 (P<.001). The uptake was higher for women with endometrioid (0.3-31.6% between 2005 and 2018) compared with nonendometrioid (0.6-21.0% between 2006 and 2018) histologic subtypes (both P<.001). In a multivariable analysis, more recent year surgery, endometrioid histology, well-differentiated tumors, T1a disease, and smaller tumor size were independently associated with sentinel lymph node biopsy use (P<.05). Performance of sentinel lymph node biopsy was not associated with increased endometrial cancer-specific mortality compared with lymphadenectomy for endometrioid tumors (subdistribution hazard ratio [HR] 0.96, 95% CI 0.82-1.13) or nonendometrioid tumors (subdistribution HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.69-1.04). For low-risk endometrial cancer, the increase in sentinel lymph node biopsy resulted in a 15.3 percentage-point (1.4-fold) increase in surgical nodal evaluation by 2018 (expected vs observed rates, 37.8 vs 53.1%). CONCLUSION: The landscape of surgical nodal evaluation is shifting from lymphadenectomy to sentinel lymph node biopsy for early endometrial cancer in the United States, with no indication of a negative effect on cancer-specific survival.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Monitoring of Atmospheric Pollutants Using Earth Observation Sentinel 5P TROPOMI Data: Impact of Stubble Burning a Case Study
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The problems of atmospheric pollutants are causing significant concern across the globe and in India. The aggravated level of atmospheric pollutants in the surrounding environment poses serious threats to normal living conditions by deteriorating air quality and causing adverse health impacts. Pollutant concentration increases during harvesting seasons of Kharif/Rabi due to stubble burning and is aggravated by other points or mobile sources. The present study is intended to monitor the spatio-temporal variation of the major atmospheric pollutants using Sentinel-5P TROPOMI data through cloud computing. Land Use/Land Cover (LULC-categorization or classification of human activities and natural coverage on the landscape) was utilised to extract the agricultural area in the study site. It involves the cloud computing of MOD64A1 (MODIS Burned monthly gridded data) and Sentinel-5P TROPOMI (S5P Tropomi) data for major atmospheric pollutants, such as CH4, NO2, SOX, CO, aerosol, and HCHO. The burned area output provided information regarding the stubble burning period, which has seen post-harvesting agricultural residue burning after Kharif crop harvesting (i.e., rice from April to June) and Rabi crop harvesting (i.e., wheat from September to November). The long duration of stubble burning is due to variation in farmers' harvesting and burning stubble/biomass remains in the field for successive crops. This period was used as criteria for considering the cloud computing of the Sentinel-5P TROPOMI data for atmospheric pollutants concentration in the study site. The results showed a significant increase in CH4, SO2, SOX, CO, and aerosol concentration during the AMJ months (stubble burning of Rabi crops) and OND months (stubble burning of Kharif crops) of each year. The results are validated with the ground control station data for PM2.5/PM10. and patterns of precipitation and temperature-gridded datasets. The trajectory frequency for air mass movement using the HYSPLIT model showed that the highest frequency and concentration were observed during OND months, followed by the AMJ months of each year (2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021). This study supports the role and robustness of Earth observation Sentinel-5P TROPOMI to monitor and evaluate air quality and pollutants distribution.

TI  - Assessing the Performance of Multi-Resolution Satellite SAR Images for Post-Earthquake Damage Detection and Mapping Aimed at Emergency Response Management
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing availability of satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images is opening new opportunities for operational support to predictive maintenance and emergency actions. With the purpose of investigating the performances of SAR images characterized by different geometric resolutions for post-earthquake damage detection and mapping, we analyzed three SAR image datasets (Sentinel-1, COSMO-SkyMed Spotlight, and COSMO-SkyMed StripMap) available in Norcia (Central Italy) that were severely affected by a strong seismic sequence in 2016. By applying the amplitude and the coherent change detection processing tools, we compared pairs of images with equivalent features collected before and after the main shock on 30 October 2016 (at 06:40, UTC). Results were compared against each other and then measured against the findings of post-earthquake field surveys for damage assessment, performed by the Italian National Fire and Rescue Service (Corpo Nazionale dei Vigili del Fuoco-CNVVF). Thanks to the interesting and very rare opportunity to have pre-event COSMO-SkyMed Spotlight images, we determined that 1 x 1-m nominal geometric resolutions can provide very detailed single-building damage mapping, while COSMO-SkyMed StripMap HIMAGE images at 3 x 3-m resolutions return relatively good detections of damaged buildings; and, the Sentinel-1 images did not allow acquiring information on single buildings-they simply provided approximate identifications of the most severely damaged sectors. The main outcomes of the performance investigation we carried out in this work can be exploited considering the exponentially growing satellite market in terms of revisit time and image resolution.

T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To identify factors associated with better or poorer self-reported health status in New Zealand military Veterans. Design A cross-sectional survey. Participants The participants of interest were the 3874 currently serving Veterans who had been deployed to a conflict zone, but all Veterans were eligible to participate. Study variables The EQ-5D-5L, asking about problems across five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain or discomfort and anxiety or depression), with five levels of severity (eg, no, slight, moderate, severe or extreme problems), also containing a Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-VAS) to self-assess health state, scaled from 0 (worst) to 100 (best) imagined health. Hypothetical relationships with better health were positive social support, sleep and psychological flexibility; with poorer health, post-traumatic stress, exposure to psychological trauma, distress and hazardous drinking. Results The EQ5-D-5L was completed by 1767 Veterans, 1009 serving, a response rate of 26% from that group, 1767 completing the EQ5-D, 1458 who had deployed, 288 who had not and the 21 who did not provide deployment data. Of these, 247 were not used in the analysis due to missing values in one or more variables, leaving 1520 for analysis. A significantly higher proportion of Veterans reported 'any problems' rather than 'no problems' with four EQ-5D dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities and pain or discomfort, but no difference in anxiety or depression. Age, length of service, deployment, psychological flexibility and better sleep quality were associated with higher EQ-VAS scores; distress with lower EQ-VAS scores. Conclusion In this sample of New Zealand Veterans, psychological flexibility and good sleep are associated with better self-rated health, and distress and poor sleep with diminished health. These factors might be used as sentinel health indicators in assessing Veteran health status, and cognitive-behavioural therapy encompassing these domains may be useful in improving the health of New Zealand Veterans.

TI  - Community Co-Design of Regional Actions for Children's Nutritional Health Combining Indigenous Knowledge and Systems Thinking
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Children's nutrition is highly influenced by community-level deprivation and socioeconomic inequalities and the health outcomes associated, such as childhood obesity, continue to widen. Systems Thinking using community-based system dynamics (CBSD) approaches can build community capacity, develop new knowledge and increase commitments to health improvement at the community level. We applied the formal structure and resources of a Group Model Building (GMB) approach, embedded within an Indigenous worldview to engage a high deprivation, high Indigenous population regional community in New Zealand to improve children's nutrition. Three GMB workshops were held and the youth and adult participants created two systems map of the drivers and feedback loops of poor nutrition in the community. Maori Indigenous knowledge (matauranga) and approaches (tikanga) were prioritized to ensure cultural safety of participants and to encourage identification of interventions that take into account social and cultural environmental factors. While the adult-constructed map focused more on the influence of societal factors such as cost of housing, financial literacy in communities, and social security, the youth-constructed map placed more emphasis on individual-environment factors such as the influence of marketing by the fast-food industry and mental wellbeing. Ten prioritized community-proposed interventions such as increasing cultural connections in schools, are presented with the feasibility and likely impact for change of each intervention rated by community leaders. The combination of community-based system dynamics methods of group model building and a matauranga Maori worldview is a novel Indigenous systems approach that engages participants and highlights cultural and family issues in the systems maps, acknowledging the ongoing impact of historical colonization in our communities.

TI  - Mapping Grassland Classes Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle and MODIS NDVI Data for Temperate Grassland in Inner Mongolia, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Grassland classification is crucial for grassland management. One commonly used method utilizes remote sensing vegetation indices (VIs) to map grassland classes at various scales. However, most grassland classifications were conducted as case studies in a small area due to lack of field data sources. At a small scale, classification is reliable; however, great uncertainty emerges when extended to other areas. In this study, large amounts of field observations (more than 30,000 aerial photos) were obtained using unmanned aerial vehicle photography in Inner Mongolia, China, during the peak period of grassland growth in 2018 and 2019. Then, four machine learning classification algorithms were constructed based on characteristic indices of MODIS NDVI in the growing season to map grassland classes of Inner Mongolia. Finally, the spatial distribution and temporal variation of temperate grassland classes were analyzed. Results showed that: (1) Among all characteristic indices, the maximum, average, and sum of MODIS NDVI from July to September during 2015 to 2019 greatly affected grassland classification. (2) The random forest method exhibited the best performance with overall accuracy and kappa coefficient being 72.17% and 0.62, respectively. (3) Compared with the grassland class mapped in the 1980s, 30.98% of grassland classes have been transformed. Our study provides a technological basis for effective and accurate classification of the temperate steppe class and a theoretical foundation for sustainable development and restoration of the temperate steppe ecosystem.

TI  - Remote sensing estimation of green macroalgae <i>Ulva pertusa</i> based on unmanned aerial vehicle and satellite image
T2  - Journal of Tropical Oceanography
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite images are valuable data sources for monitoring floating green macroalgae on the sea surface. However, there are large errors in green macroalgae coverage derived on mixed pixels. It is thus important to solve the problem of sub-pixel coverage of green macroalgae, for precise monitoring of benthic green macroalgae in coastal area. In this paper, retrieval models were established to link sub-pixel coverage of green macroalgae with vegetation indexes and reflectance of characteristic bands by analyzing spectral characteristics of green macroalgae from the Landsat images, based on the results of green macroalgae coverage derived from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The results show excellent linear relationships between the reflectance of blue, green, and red bands and the sub-pixel coverage of green macroalgae, and the reflectance decreases monotonically with increasing sub-pixel coverage. These three models were verified, and the results show that the model based on the reflectance of green band was more accuracy than the other indexes or index combination, with the highest coefficient of determination (R-2), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean relative error (MRE) values of 0.92, 0.07, and 10.85%, respectively. Hence, we provide a model that can estimate the sub-pixel coverage of green macroalgae, and realize the precise monitoring of the coverage of green macroalgae extracted from Landsat images.

TI  - Scale-Specific Prediction of Topsoil Organic Carbon Contents Using Terrain Attributes and SCMaP Soil Reflectance Composites
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a growing need for an area-wide knowledge of SOC contents in agricultural soils at the field scale for food security and monitoring long-term changes related to soil health and climate change. In Germany, SOC maps are mostly available with a spatial resolution of 250 m to 1 km(2). The nationwide availability of both digital elevation models at various spatial resolutions and multi-temporal satellite imagery enables the derivation of multi-scale terrain attributes and (here: Landsat-based) multi-temporal soil reflectance composites (SRC) as explanatory variables. In the example of a Bavarian test of about 8000 km(2), relations between 220 SOC content samples as well as different aggregation levels of the explanatory variables were analyzed for their scale-specific predictive power. The aggregation levels were generated by applying a region-growing segmentation procedure, and the SOC content prediction was realized by the Random Forest algorithm. In doing so, established approaches of (geographic) object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) and machine learning were combined. The modeling results revealed scale-specific differences. Compared to terrain attributes, the use of SRC parameters leads to a significant model improvement at field-related scale levels. The joint use of both terrain attributes and SRC parameters resulted in further model improvements. The best modeling variant is characterized by an accuracy of R-2 = 0.84 and RMSE = 1.99.

TI  - Weighted Single-Step Genome-Wide Association Study Uncovers Known and Novel Candidate Genomic Regions for Milk Production Traits and Somatic Cell Score in Valle del Belice Dairy Sheep
T2  - ANIMALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Milk production is the most economically crucial dairy sheep trait and constitutes the major genetic enhancement purpose via selective breeding. Also, mastitis is one of the most frequently encountered diseases, having a significant impact on animal welfare, milk yield, and quality. The aim of this study was to identify genomic region(s) associated with the milk production traits and somatic cell score (SCS) in Valle del Belice sheep using single-step genome-wide association (ssGWA) and genotyping data from medium density SNP panels. We identified several genomic regions (OAR1, OAR2, OAR3, OAR4, OAR6, OAR9, and OAR25) and candidate genes implicated in milk production traits and SCS. Our findings offer new insights into the genetic basis of milk production traits and SCS in dairy sheep. The objective of this study was to uncover genomic regions explaining a substantial proportion of the genetic variance in milk production traits and somatic cell score in a Valle del Belice dairy sheep. Weighted single-step genome-wide association studies (WssGWAS) were conducted for milk yield (MY), fat yield (FY), fat percentage (FAT%), protein yield (PY), protein percentage (PROT%), and somatic cell score (SCS). In addition, our aim was also to identify candidate genes within genomic regions that explained the highest proportions of genetic variance. Overall, the full pedigree consists of 5534 animals, of which 1813 ewes had milk data (15,008 records), and 481 ewes were genotyped with a 50 K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array. The effects of markers and the genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) of the animals were obtained by five iterations of WssGBLUP. We considered the top 10 genomic regions in terms of their explained genomic variants as candidate window regions for each trait. The results showed that top ranked genomic windows (1 Mb windows) explained 3.49, 4.04, 5.37, 4.09, 3.80, and 5.24% of the genetic variances for MY, FY, FAT%, PY, PROT%, and total SCS, respectively. Among the candidate genes found, some known associations were confirmed, while several novel candidate genes were also revealed, including PPARGC1A, LYPLA1, LEP, and MYH9 for MY; CACNA1C, PTPN1, ROBO2, CHRM3, and ERCC6 for FY and FAT%; PCSK5 and ANGPT1 for PY and PROT%; and IL26, IFNG, PEX26, NEGR1, LAP3, and MED28 for SCS. These findings increase our understanding of the genetic architecture of six examined traits and provide guidance for subsequent genetic improvement through genome selection.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Sediment Discharge in Rivers Using Sentinel-2 Images and Machine-Learning Algorithms
T2  - HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatio-temporal dynamism of sediment discharge (Q(s)) in rivers is influenced by various natural and anthropogenic factors. Unfortunately, most rivers are only monitored at a limited number of stations or not gauged at all. Therefore, this study aims to provide a remote-sensing-based alternative for Q(s) monitoring. The at-a-station hydraulic geometry (AHG) power-law method was compared to the at-many-stations hydraulic geometry (AMHG) method; in addition, a novel AHG machine-learning (ML) method was introduced to estimate water discharge at three gauging stations in the Tisza (Szeged and Algyo) and Maros (Mako) Rivers in Hungary. The surface reflectance of Sentinel-2 images was correlated to in situ suspended sediment concentration (SSC) by support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), and combined algorithms. The best performing water discharge and SSC models were employed to estimate the Q(s). Our novel AHG ML method gave the best estimations of water discharge (Szeged: R-2 = 0.87; Algyo: R-2 = 0.75; Mako: R-2 = 0.61). Furthermore, the RF (R-2 = 0.9) and combined models (R-2 = 0.82) showed the best SSC estimations for the Maros and Tisza Rivers. The highest Q(s) were detected during floods; however, there is usually a clockwise hysteresis between the SSC and water discharge, especially in the Tisza River.

TI  - Towards Retrieving Reliable Ocean Surface Currents in the Coastal Zone From the Sentinel-1 Doppler Shift Observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent developments on calibration and partitioning of the signal between the wave and current contributions significantly improve the accuracy of geophysical retrievals from Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar-based Doppler shift measurements in the open ocean. In this study, we revise the Sentinel-1B Interferometric Wide products acquired from December 2017 to January 2018 along the coastal zone of northern Norway. We find that the satellite attitude is responsible for 30% of the variation in the Doppler shift observations, while the antenna pattern can describe an additional 15%. The residual variation after recalibration is about 3.8 Hz, corresponding to 0.21-0.15 m/s radial velocity (RVL) depending on the incidence angle. Using recalibrated Sentinel-1 observations, collocated with near-surface wind from MetCoOp-Ensemble Prediction System and sea state from MyWaveWAM, we develop an empirical function (CDOP3SiX) for estimating the sea-state-induced Doppler shift. CDOP3SiX improves the accuracy of sea state contribution estimates under mixed wind fetch conditions and demonstrates that the Norwegian Coastal Current can be detected in the Sentinel-1 derived ocean surface current RVL maps. Moreover, two anticyclonic mesoscale eddies with radial velocities of about 0.5 m/s are detected. The surface current patterns are consistent with the collocated sea surface temperature observations. The Doppler shift observations from Sentinel-1 can therefore be used to study ocean surface currents in the coastal zone with a 1.5 km spatial resolution.

TI  - Religion and Help-Seeking: Theological Conservatism and Preferences for Mental Health Assistance
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Religious affiliation and attendance have been shown to affect various facets of mental health, including the willingness to seek mental health assistance; however, little is known about how theological beliefs influence people's assessments of religious and secular mental health assistance options. Prior research using theological conservatism (beliefs about scripture, sin, and salvation) has conceptualized this perspective as being a schema in which the dimensions operate in tandem. Nonetheless, given the personalized nature of mental health, this study has conceptualized this perspective as three interrelated, but distinctly different dimensions of a religious belief system. Using data from the NORC General Social Survey's (GSS) 2006 and 2018 waves (N = 2563), this study enlists a fruitful but underutilized approach to gauging perceptions of mental health assistance through the use of situational vignettes that prompt survey respondent appraisals of different sets of circumstances and various possible solutions. This study finds some support for the hypothesis that predicted theological conservatism would be associated with a more favorable view of religious support for mental health as opposed to secular sources of assistance; there was also considerable support for the hypothesis that the salvation dimension of this worldview would exhibit an influence apart from the scripture and sin dimensions. This investigation sheds light on an understudied facet of religion in relation to receptivity toward distinctive forms of mental health treatment and highlights potential directions for future research.

TI  - Improving Heterogeneous Forest Height Maps by Integrating GEDI-Based Forest Height Information in a Multi-Sensor Mapping Process
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests are one of the key elements in ecological transition policies in Europe. Sustainable forest management is needed in order to optimise wood harvesting, while preserving carbon storage, biodiversity and other ecological functions. Forest managers and public bodies need improved and cost-effective forest monitoring tools. Research studies have been carried out to assess the use of optical and radar images for producing forest height or biomass maps. The main limitations are the quantity, quality and representativeness of the reference data for model training. The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) mission (full waveform LiDAR on board the International Space Station) has provided an unprecedented number of forest canopy height samples from 2019. These samples could be used to improve reference datasets. This paper aims to present and validate a method for estimating forest dominant height from open access optical and radar satellite images (Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2), and then to assess the use of GEDI samples to replace field height measurements in model calibration. Our approach combines satellite image features and dominant height measurements, or GEDI metrics, in a Support Vector Machine regression algorithm, with a feature selection process. The method is tested on mixed uneven-aged broadleaved and coniferous forests in France. Using dominant height measurements for model training, the cross-validation shows 7.3 to 11.6% relative Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) depending on the forest class. When using GEDI height metrics instead of field measurements for model training, errors increase to 12.8-16.7% relative RMSE. This level of error remains satisfactory; the use of GEDI could allow the production of dominant height maps on large areas with better sample representativeness. Future work will focus on confirming these results on new study sites, improving the filtering and processing of GEDI data, and producing height maps at regional or national scale. The resulting maps will help forest managers and public bodies to optimise forest resource inventories, as well as allow scientists to integrate these cartographic data into climate models.

TI  - Mangrove Forests in Ecuador: A Two-Decade Analysis
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves are one of the most important ecosystems especially due to the services they provide, but in contrast are one of the most threatened by human activities at a global level. In Ecuador, mangrove forests are currently fragile and threatened due to the great anthropic pressure, which has largely reduced the area they occupy. However, there is already evidence that certain actions are contributing both to their conservation and the recovery of the lost mangrove area. In this study, we assessed the multitemporal dynamics of changes in mangrove cover in four coastal provinces of the country over a period of 20 years (1998-2018) based on remote sensing data analyzed using GIS tools. Our results showed that the area affected by mangrove forest destruction reached its maximum during the 1998-2010 period, when 4.56% (194.57 km(2)) of the mangrove forest was lost. This situation especially affected the provinces of El Oro and Guayas. The main cause for the loss of mangrove cover was the expansion of shrimp farms, followed by agriculture and construction. However, a slight recovery of similar to 2.9% has been observed, although loss remains constant. Mangrove ecosystem conservation policies, mainly applied to zones within protected areas; the establishment of use and custody agreements and the halt of shrimp farm expansion; the development of mangrove forests on areas with sediment deposits; and natural mangrove recovery processes are key factors for mangrove restoration. These results suggest that it is possible to continue restoring mangrove cover and thus maintain some of the main ecosystem services they provide for the benefit of humans.

The availability of freely accessible satellite data of relatively high spatial and temporal resolutions offers an unprecedented opportunity for wide-area land use and land cover (LULC) mapping, including tree crop (e.g., mango; Mangifera indica L.) detection. We evaluated the utility of combining Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) derived variables (n = 81) for mapping mango orchard occurrence in Zimbabwe using machine learning classifiers, i.e., support vector machine and random forest. Field data were collected on mango orchards and other LULC classes. Fewer variables were selected from 'All' combined S1 and S2 variables using three commonly utilized variable selection methods, i.e., relief filter, guided regularized random forest, and variance inflation factor. Several classification experiments (n = 8) were conducted using 60% of field datasets and combinations of 'All' and fewer selected variables and were compared using the remaining 40% of the field dataset and the area underclass approach. The results showed that a combination of random forest and relief filter selected variables outperformed (F1 score > 70%) all other variable combination experiments. Notwithstanding, the differences among the mapping results were not significant (p <= 0.05). Specifically, the mapping accuracy of the mango orchards was more than 80% for each of the eight classification experiments. Results revealed that mango orchards occupied approximately 18% of the spatial extent of the study area. The S1 variables were constantly selected compared with the S2-derived variables across the three variable selection approaches used in this study. It is concluded that the use of multi-modal satellite imagery and robust machine learning classifiers can accurately detect mango orchards and other LULC classes in semi-arid environments. The results can be used for guiding and upscaling biological control options for managing mango insect pests such as the devastating invasive fruit fly Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel) (Diptera: Tephritidae).

TI  - Why succinate? Physiological regulation by a mitochondrial coenzyme Q sentinel
T2  - NATURE CHEMICAL BIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Metabolites once considered solely in catabolism or anabolism turn out to have key regulatory functions. Among these, the citric acid cycle intermediate succinate stands out owing to its multiple roles in disparate pathways, its dramatic concentration changes and its selective cell release. Here we propose that succinate has evolved as a signaling modality because its concentration reflects the coenzyme Q (CoQ) pool redox state, a central redox couple confined to the mitochondrial inner membrane. This connection is of general importance because CoQ redox state integrates three bioenergetic parameters: mitochondrial electron supply, oxygen tension and ATP demand. Succinate, by equilibrating with the CoQ pool, enables the status of this central bioenergetic parameter to be communicated from mitochondria to the rest of the cell, into the circulation and to other cells. The logic of this form of regulation explains many emerging roles of succinate in biology, and suggests future research questions.

TI  - A Systematic Literature Review on Crop Yield Prediction with Deep Learning and Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Deep learning has emerged as a potential tool for crop yield prediction, allowing the model to automatically extract features and learn from the datasets. Meanwhile, smart farming technology enables the farmers to achieve maximum crop yield by extracting essential parameters of crop growth. This systematic literature review highlights the existing research gaps in a particular area of deep learning methodologies and guides us in analyzing the impact of vegetation indices and environmental factors on crop yield. To achieve the aims of this study, prior studies from 2012 to 2022 from various databases are collected and analyzed. The study focuses on the advantages of using deep learning in crop yield prediction, the suitable remote sensing technology based on the data acquisition requirements, and the various features that influence crop yield prediction. This study finds that Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are the most widely used deep learning approaches for crop yield prediction. The commonly used remote sensing technology is satellite remote sensing technology-in particular, the use of the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Findings show that vegetation indices are the most used feature for crop yield prediction. However, it is also observed that the most used features in the literature do not always work for all the approaches. The main challenges of using deep learning approaches and remote sensing for crop yield prediction are how to improve the working model for better accuracy, the practical implication of the model for providing accurate information about crop yield to agriculturalists, growers, and policymakers, and the issue with the black box property.

TI  - Determining the Influence of Long Term Urban Growth on Surface Urban Heat Islands Using Local Climate Zones and Intensity Analysis Techniques
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban growth, typified by conversion from natural to built-up impervious surfaces, is known to cause warming and associated adverse impacts. Local climate zones present a standardized technique for evaluating the implications of urban land use and surface changes on temperatures of the overlying atmosphere. In this study, long term changes in local climate zones of the Bulawayo metropolitan city were used to assess the influence of the city's growth on its thermal characteristics. The zones were mapped using the World Urban Database and Access Portal Tool (WUDAPT) procedure while Landsat data were used to determine temporal changes. Data were divided into 1990 to 2005 and 2005 to 2020 temporal splits and intensity analysis used to characterize transformation patterns at each interval. Results indicated that growth of the built local climate zones (LCZ) in Bulawayo was faster in the 1990 to 2005 interval than the 2005 to 2020. Transition level intensity analysis showed that growth of built local climate zones was more prevalent in areas with water, low plants and dense forest LCZ in both intervals. There was a westward growth of light weight low rise built LCZ category than eastern direction, which could be attributed to high land value in the latter. Low plants land cover type experienced a large expansion of light weight low rise buildings than the compact low rise, water, and open low-rise areas. The reduction of dense forest was mainly linked to active expansion of low plants in the 2005 to 2020 interval, symbolizing increased deforestation and vegetation clearance. In Bulawayo's growth, areas where built-up LCZs invade vegetation and wetlands have increased anthropogenic warming (i.e., Surface Urban Heat Island intensities) in the city. This study demonstrates the value of LCZs in among others creating a global urban land use land cover database and assessing the influence of urban growth pattern on urban thermal characteristics.

TI  - PM2.5 Air Pollution Prediction through Deep Learning Using Multisource Meteorological, Wildfire, and Heat Data
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Air pollution is a lethal global threat. To mitigate the effects of air pollution, we must first understand it, find its patterns and correlations, and predict it in advance. Air pollution is highly dependent on spatial and temporal correlations of prior meteorological, wildfire, and pollution structures. We use the advanced deep predictive Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) model paired with the cutting-edge Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) architecture to predict spatiotemporal hourly PM2.5 across the Los Angeles area over time. Our deep-learning model does not use atmospheric physics or chemical mechanism data, but rather multisource imagery and sensor data. We use high-resolution remote-sensing satellite imagery from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument onboard the NASA Terra+Aqua satellites and remote-sensing data from the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), a multispectral imaging spectrometer onboard the Sentinel-5P satellite. We use the highly correlated Fire Radiative Power data product from the MODIS instrument which provides valuable information about the radiant heat output and effects of wildfires on atmospheric air pollutants. The input data we use in our deep-learning model is representative of the major sources of ground-level PM2.5 and thus we can predict hourly PM2.5 at unparalleled accuracies. Our RMSE and NRMSE scores over various site locations and predictive time frames show significant improvement over existing research in predicting PM2.5 using spatiotemporal deep predictive algorithms.

TI  - Impacts of Surface Water on Windborne Lead Dispersion from the Zinc Plant Leach Residue in Kabwe, Zambia
T2  - MINERALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Effects of the water content of ground surface on windborne lead (Pb) dispersion from the zinc (Zn) leach residue site at the Kabwe mine, Zambia, were simulated. The Pb-bearing Zn plant leach residue site was selected as the source of the dispersion, and water conditions of the surface of the source were evaluated by the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) under the actual weather conditions in the year 2019. The MNDWI was calculated based on Sentinel-2 datasets, which were acquired in the year 2019. The index was used for monitoring the surface condition of the source necessary for simulating Pb dispersion, because the higher surface water content reduces the intensity of windborne source. The results showed that the wind speeds and directions had huge impacts on Pb dispersion when the MNDWI had negative values, and that the dispersion was inhibited when the MNDWI had positive values. These indicate that the water content of the surface is sensitive to dispersion, and that MNDWI is an effective parameter that expresses the source strength.

TI  - Evaluation of Bacterial Perpetuation Assays and Plant Biomolecules Antimicrobial Activity against Cotton Blight Bacterium <i>Xanthomonas citri</i> subsp. <i>malvacearum</i>; An Alternative Source for Food Production and Protection
T2  - PLANTS-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) is a global cash crop which has gained importance in earning foreign exchange for each country. Bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonascitri subsp. malvacearum (Xcm) has been a seriousdisease in Pakistan's cotton belt on multiple occasions. Bacterium was isolated and identified through various biochemical and diagnostic tests wherehypersensitivity reaction, Gram staining, KOH (potassium hydroxide), catalase, starch hydrolysis, lecithinase and Tween 80 hydrolysis tests confirmed bacterium as Gram-negative and plant pathogenic. Xcm perpetuation assays wereevaluated on various cotton varieties under glasshouse conditions in completely randomized design by three different methods, wherein the scratch method proved to be the best upon CIM-496 and showed 83.33% disease incidence as compared with the other two methods, where Bt-3701 responded with 53.33% incidence via the spray gun method, and 50% with the water splash method on CIM-616, as compared with the control. Similarly, for disease severity percentage, Bt-3701 was pragmatic with 47.21% through scratch method, whereas, in the spray gun method, 45.51% disease severity was noted upon Bt-802, and 31.27% was calculated on Cyto-179 through the water splash method. Owing to the unique antibacterial properties of aqueous plant extracts, the poison food technique showed Aloe vera, Mentha piperita, Syzygiumcumini and Azadirachta indica with 17.77, 29.33, 18.33 and 20.22 bacterial colonies counted on nutrient agarmedium petri plate, respectively, as compared with the control. Measurement of the inhibition zone by disk diffusion technique showed Mentha piperita, Syzygiumcumini, Citrus limon, Moringa oleifera and Sy zy gium aromaticum to present the most promising results by calculating the maximum diameter of the inhibition zone, viz., 8.58, 8.55, 8.52, 8.49 and 8.41 (mm), respectively, at the highest tested concentration (75 ppm, parts per million) compared with the control. It is probable that the decoction's interaction with the pathogen population on the host plant will need to be considered in future experiments. However, at this moment, more research into the effective management of cotton bacterial blight by plant extracts in terms of concentration determination and development of biopesticides will provide future avenues to avoid environmental pollution.

T2  - REVISTA CONRADO
M3  - Article
AB  - Constitutionalization of indigenous justice in Ecuador and several Latin American countries is considered a paradigmatic achievement of indigenous cultures. This indigenous odyssey has undergone several processes that reveal the fundamental pillars that support it, which in short are three: The first is the history of the indigenous struggles to vindicate themselves in their territories seized by conquest and colonization; The second is the pressure exerted by international instruments on countries to include regulations favorable to indigenous rights; and The third and least studied is the philosophy underlying the indigenous worldview, which gives reason and meaning to their being, living and acting in all areas of their lives. Hence, the humanizing paradigm of contemporary law that seeks to link an almost invisible philosophy and replaced by the philosophy of the West, but which remains latent in the communes and indigenous communities.

TI  - Land Use and Land Cover Mapping Using Sentinel-2, Landsat-8 Satellite Images, and Google Earth Engine: A Comparison of Two Composition Methods
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and real-time land use/land cover (LULC) maps are important to provide precise information for dynamic monitoring, planning, and management of the Earth. With the advent of cloud computing platforms, time series feature extraction techniques, and machine learning classifiers, new opportunities are arising in more accurate and large-scale LULC mapping. In this study, we aimed at finding out how two composition methods and spectral-temporal metrics extracted from satellite time series can affect the ability of a machine learning classifier to produce accurate LULC maps. We used the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform to create cloud-free Sentinel-2 (S-2) and Landsat-8 (L-8) time series over the Tehran Province (Iran) as of 2020. Two composition methods, namely, seasonal composites and percentiles metrics, were used to define four datasets based on satellite time series, vegetation indices, and topographic layers. The random forest classifier was used in LULC classification and for identifying the most important variables. Accuracy assessment results showed that the S-2 outperformed the L-8 spectral-temporal metrics at the overall and class level. Moreover, the comparison of composition methods indicated that seasonal composites outperformed percentile metrics in both S-2 and L-8 time series. At the class level, the improved performance of seasonal composites was related to their ability to provide better information about the phenological variation of different LULC classes. Finally, we conclude that this methodology can produce LULC maps based on cloud computing GEE in an accurate and fast way and can be used in large-scale LULC mapping.

TI  - Hybrid Methodology Using Sentinel-1/Sentinel-2 for Soil Moisture Estimation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is an essential parameter for a better understanding of water processes in the soil-vegetation-atmosphere continuum. Satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is well suited for monitoring water content at fine spatial resolutions on the order of 1 km or higher. Several methodologies are often considered in the inversion of SAR signals: machine learning techniques, such as neural networks, empirical models and change detection methods. In this study, we propose two hybrid methodologies by improving a change detection approach with vegetation consideration or by combining a change detection approach together with a neural network algorithm. The methodology is based on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data with the use of numerous metrics, including vertical-vertical (VV) and vertical-horizontal (VH) polarization radar signals, the classical change detection surface soil moisture (SSM) index I-ssm, radar incidence angle, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) optical index, and the VH/VV ratio. Those approaches are tested using in situ data from the ISMN (International Soil Moisture Network) with observations covering different climatic contexts. The results show an improvement in soil moisture estimations using the hybrid algorithms, in particular the change detection with the neural network one, for which the correlation increases by 54% and 33% with respect to that of the neural network or change detection alone, respectively.

TI  - Embodying Morality in Management Theory and Practice: A Buddhist Perspective
T2  - JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SPIRITUALITY & RELIGION
M3  - Article
AB  - This article explores the interactions among ethics, spirituality, and business management from a Buddhist perspective. In recent decades, scholars have made substantial contributions to reintroduce spirituality into business ethics and Buddhist values to business management. This paper argues that some core Buddhist concepts and practices could uniquely contribute to identifying moral agency and responsibility, and addressing the practical challenges related to business ethics in a market economy. This article attempts to dissect the Buddhist worldview, as proclaimed through the three marks of phenomenal existence: 1) impermanence, 2) suffering, and 3) non-self, and evaluate its relevance to the theories and practices of business ethics. The significance of this worldview in contemporary society is further explored through the lens of epistemology, ontology, soteriology, and a six "I"s strategy. Two case studies are presented to illustrate possible frameworks of moral decision-making inspired by Buddhist ethics.

T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Coxsackievirus A6 (CVA6) emerged as the most common enterovirus of seasonal outbreaks of hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD). We investigated CVA6 genetic diversity among the clinical phenotypes reported in the paediatric population during sentinel surveillance in France between 2010 and 2018. CVA6 infection was confirmed in 981 children (mean age 1.52 years [IQR 1.17-2.72]) of whom 564 (58%) were males. Atypical HFMD was reported in 705 (72%) children, followed by typical HFMD in 214 (22%) and herpangina in 57 (6%) children. Throat specimens of 245 children were processed with a target-enrichment new-generation sequencing approach, which generated 213 complete CVA6 genomes. The genomes grouped within the D1 and D3 clades (phylogeny inferred with the P1 genomic region). In total, 201 genomes were classified among the recombinant forms (RFs) A, B, F, G, H, and N, and 12 genomes were assigned to 5 previously unreported RFs (R-V). The most frequent RFs were A (58%), H (19%), G (6.1%), and F (5.2%). The yearly number of RFs ranged between 1 (in 2012 and 2013) and 6 (2018). The worldwide CVA6 epidemic transmission began between 2005 and 2007, which coincided with the global spread of the recombinant subclade D3/RF-A.

TI  - On the Evaluation of Both Spatial and Temporal Performance of Distributed Hydrological Models Using Remote Sensing Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evaluating the spatial and temporal model performance of distributed hydrological models is necessary to ensure that the simulated spatial and temporal patterns are meaningful. In recent years, spatial and temporal remote sensing data have been increasingly used for model performance evaluation. Previous studies, however, have focused on either the temporal or spatial model performance evaluation. In addition, temporal (or spatial) model performance evaluation is often conducted in a spatially (or temporally) lumped approach. Here, we evaluated (1) the temporal model performance evaluation in a spatially distributed approach (spatiotemporal) and (2) the spatial model performance in a temporally distributed approach (temporospatial). We further demonstrated that both spatiotemporal and temporospatial model performance evaluations are necessary since they provide different aspects of the model performance. For this, a case study was developed using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for the Upper Baitarani catchment in India, and the spatiotemporal and temporospatial model performance was evaluated against three different remotely based actual evapotranspiration (ETa) products (MOD16 A2, SSEBop, and TerraClimate). The results showed that an increase in the spatiotemporal model performance would not necessarily lead to an increase in the temporospatial model performance and vice versa, depending on the evaluation statistics. Overall, this study has highlighted the necessity of a joint spatiotemporal and temporospatial model performance evaluation to understand/improve spatial and temporal model behavior/performance.

TI  - Boundary Layer via Multifractal Mass Conductivity through Remote Sensing Data in Atmospheric Dynamics
T2  - FRACTAL AND FRACTIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In this manuscript, multifractal theories of motion based on scale relativity theory are considered in the description of atmospheric dynamics. It is shown that these theories have the potential to highlight nondimensional mass conduction laws that describe the propagation of atmospheric entities. Then, using special operational procedures and harmonic mappings, these equations can be rewritten and simplified for their plotting and analysis to be performed. The inhomogeneity of these conduction phenomena is analyzed, and it is found that it can fluctuate and increase at certain fractal dimensions, leading to the conclusion that certain atmospheric structures and phenomena of either atmospheric transmission or stability can be explained by atmospheric fractal dimension inversions. Finally, this hypothesis is verified using ceilometer data throughout the atmospheric profiles.

TI  - Developing a Guideline of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle's Acquisition Geometry for Landslide Mapping and Monitoring
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data and techniques are widely used for monitoring and managing natural or man-made disasters, due to their timeliness and their satisfactory accuracy. A key stage in disaster research is the detailed and precise mapping of an affected area. The current work examines the relationship that may exist between the acquisition geometry of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) campaigns and the topographic characteristics of an investigated area, toward landslide mapping and monitoring that is as accurate as possible. In fact, this work, concerning the systematic research of the acquisition geometry of UAV flights over multiple active landslides, is conducted for the first time and is focused on creating a guideline for any researcher trying to follow the UAV photogrammetric survey during landslide mapping and monitoring. In particular, UAV flights were executed over landslide areas with different characteristics (land cover, slope, etc.) and the collected data from each area were classified into three groups depending on UAV acquisition geometry, i.e., nadir imagery, oblique imagery, and an integration of nadir and oblique imagery. High-resolution orthophotos and Digital Surface Models (DSMs) emerged from the processing of the UAV imagery of each group through structure-from-motion photogrammetry (SfM). Accuracy assessment was carried out using quantitative and qualitative comparative approaches, such as root mean square error calculation, length comparison, and mean center estimation. The evaluation of the results revealed that there is a strong relationship between UAV acquisition geometry and landslide characteristics, which is evident in the accuracy of the generated photogrammetric products (orthophotos, DSMs). In addition, it was proved that the synergistic processing of nadir and oblique imagery increased overall centimeter accuracy.

TI  - An assessment of land degradation and its effects on geomorphology using LADA model: a case study of Ilam Province, west of Iran
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land degradation is an environmental issue and it is described as the decrease of land stability. The available definitions of land degradation, methods to measure it, and the pertinent measures are diverse and controversial. Desertification and land degradation in Iran are serious issues and need assessment and survey to realize a stable land management in different regions of the country. The land degradation assessment in dryland (LADA) project has been initiated by the FAO over the past few years. The project is an attempt to introduce a set of standard methods and instructions to assess land degradation processes, the factors, and the effects with participation of local communities and users. The main objective of the present study is to assess land degradation and the effects on development and geomorphological forms in the west of Iran (Ilam Province) using LADA model. To do this, MODIS spectroradiometer (MOD13Q1 (250 m) NDVI) was used to examine trends of vegetation changes. In addition, LANDSET 7 & 8 data were used to assess change trend of surface water resources and salinity (BI, SI). The data provided by piezometer stations were used to examine change trend of groundwater resources and soil sample and measure EC and PH of the soil from 2000 to 2017. The results showed that land degradation has been expanding from the west to the east all over the region under study in terms of NDVI plant coverage during the time period under study. As illustrated by the images, vegetation degradation was more severe in the west and southwest of the region under study in sub-basins West/East Abbas Plane, Mosian, and Chenaneh, in the west of the region and sub-basins Abdanan, Dehloran, Mehran, and Salehabad in 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2017. Vegetation in these areas is low at all times. The change slope, change slope significance, 8-year predication of change trend, and vegetation change difference indices supported the findings. While changes in the surface water resources have been increasing with a slight slope due to construction of dams in the region, these changes have had no effect on preventing and controlling land degradation in the region, since these resources have been affected by the land degradation on the far west strip. Moreover, in terms of the groundwater resources level, out of 76 piezometric well, 49 well with negative water level changes and 27 well with positive water level changes were identified. This means that all the well with declining water level was on the west strip (sub-basins Mosian, Abdanan, Dehloran, and Mehran). However, ascending wells are mostly concentrated in in the sub-basins east and west of Dasht Abbas-i.e., the southwest of the region under study. The ascending water levels in these wells can be explained by expansion of Karkhe water grid and less demand for the ground water in the region. Salinity and brightness indices assessments and soil lab results showed the lands with maximum salinity index and 100% soil degradation were at the west strip of the region or the west and south of Ilam Province (Mehran, Mosian, Abdanan, West/East Dasht Abbas, and Moulab). Eventually, land degradation and its effects on formation of geomorphological forms in the region were examined. The results revealed that land degradation in the west and southwest strip of the region, where the degradation is critical, has created specific geomorphological forms such as gully erosion.

TI  - Assessing the Performance of WRF Model in Simulating Heavy Precipitation Events over East Africa Using Satellite-Based Precipitation Product
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the capability of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to simulate seven different heavy precipitation (PRE) events that occurred across East Africa in the summer of 2020. The WRF model outputs were evaluated against high-resolution satellite-based observations, which were obtained from prior evaluations of several satellite observations with 30 stations' data. The synoptic conditions accompanying the events were also investigated to determine the conditions that are conducive to heavy PRE. The verification of the WRF output was carried out using the area-related root mean square error (RMSE)-based fuzzy method. This method quantifies the similarity of PRE intensity distribution between forecast and observation at different spatial scales. The results showed that the WRF model reproduced the heavy PRE with PRE magnitudes ranging from 6 to >30 mm/day. The spatial pattern from the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Cloud Classification-Climate Data Record (PERSIANN-CCS-CDR) was close to that of the WRF output. The area-related RMSE with respect to observation showed that the error in the model tended to reduce as the spatial scale increased for all the events. The WRF and high-resolution satellite data had an obvious advantage when validating the heavy PRE events in 2020. This study demonstrated that WRF may be used for forecasting heavy PRE events over East Africa when high resolutions and subsequent simulation setups are used.

TI  - Hospital-Onset Bloodstream Infections Caused by Eight Sentinel Bacteria: A Nationwide Study in Israel, 2018-2019
T2  - MICROORGANISMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Nationwide studies on hospital-onset bloodstream infections (HO-BSIs) are scarce. To describe incidence, mortality and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) of HO-BSI caused by eight sentinel bacteria in Israel, we used laboratory-based BSI surveillance data from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2019. All hospitals reported positive blood cultures growing Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium. We calculated HO-BSI incidence and 14-day, 30-day and 1-year mortality in adults. We performed multivariable logistic regression to identify predictors of 30-day mortality. The study included 6752 HO-BSI events: K. pneumoniae (1659, 22.1%), E. coli (1491, 19.8%), S. aureus (1315, 17.5%), P. aeruginosa (1175, 15.6%), E. faecalis (778, 10.4%), A. baumannii (654, 8.7%), E. faecium (405, 5.4%) and S. pneumoniae (43, 0.6%). Overall incidence was 2.84/1000 admissions (95% CI: 2.77-2.91) and 6.88/10,000 patient-days (95% CI: 6.72-7.05). AMR isolates accounted for 44.2% of events. Fourteen-day, thirty-day and one-year mortality were 30.6% (95% CI: 28.5%-32.8%), 40.2% (95% CI: 38.2%-42.1%) and 66.5% (95% CI: 64.7%-68.3%), respectively. Organisms with highest risk for 30-day mortality (compared with E. coli) were A. baumannii (OR 2.85; 95% CI: 2.3-3.55), E. faecium (OR 2.16; 95% CI: 1.66-2.79) and S. pneumoniae (OR 2.36; 95% CI: 1.21-4.59). Mortality was higher in AMR isolates (OR 1.57; 95% CI: 1.4-1.77). This study highlights the incidence, associated high mortality and important role of antibiotic resistance in HO-BSI.

TI  - Ocean Color Remote Sensing of Suspended Sediments along a Continuum from Rivers to River Plumes: Concentration, Transport, Fluxes and Dynamics
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the capability of high and medium spatial resolution ocean color satellite data to monitor the transport of suspended particulate matter (SPM) along a continuum from river to river mouth to river plume. An existing switching algorithm combining the use of green, red and near-infrared satellite wavebands was improved to retrieve SPM concentrations over the very wide range (from 1 to more than 1000 g.m(-3)) encountered over such a continuum. The method was applied to time series of OLI, MSI, and MODIS satellite data. Satisfactory validation results were obtained even at the river gauging station. The river liquid discharge is not only related to the SPM concentration at the gauging station and at the river mouth, but also to the turbid plume area and SPM mass estimated within the surface of the plume. The overall results highlight the potential of combined field and ocean color satellite observations to monitor the transport and fluxes of SPM discharged by rivers into the coastal ocean.

TI  - The foraging behavior of nonbreeding Adelie penguins in the western Antarctic Peninsula during the breeding season
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on marine predator at-sea distributions is key to understanding ecosystem and community dynamics and an important component of spatial management frameworks that aim to identify regions important for conservation. Tracking data from seabirds are widely used to define priority areas for conservation, but such data are often restricted to the breeding population. This also applies to penguins in Antarctica, where identification of important habitat for nonbreeders has received limited attention. Nonbreeding penguins are expected to have larger foraging distributions than breeding conspecifics, which may alter their interactions with physical environmental factors, conspecifics, other marine predators, and threats. We studied the movement behavior of nonbreeding Adelie penguins tracked during the 2016/2017 breeding season at King George Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica. We quantify how nonbreeding penguins' horizontal moment behavior varies in relation to environmental conditions and assess the extent of spatial overlap in the foraging ranges of nonbreeders and breeders, which were tracked over several years. Nonbreeders increased their prey search and area-restricted foraging behavior as sea surface temperature and bottom depths decreased, and in response to increasing sea ice concentration. Nonbreeders tended to transit (high directional movement) over the relatively deep Central Basin of the Bransfield Strait. The majority of foraging behavior occurred within the colder, Weddell Sea-sourced water of the Antarctic Coastal Current (incubation) and in the Weddell Sea (creche). The utilization distributions of breeders and nonbreeders overlapped in the central Bransfield Strait. Spatial segregation was greater during the creche stage of breeding compared to incubation and brood, because chick provisioning still constrained the foraging range of breeders to a scale of a few tens of kilometers, while nonbreeders commenced with premolt foraging trips into the Weddell Sea. Our results show that breeding and nonbreeding penguins may not be impacted similarly by local environmental variability, given that their spatial and temporal scales of foraging differ during some part of the austral summer. Our study highlights the need to account for different life history stages when characterizing foraging behavior of marine predator populations. This is particularly important for "sentinel" species monitored as part of marine conservation and ecosystem-based management programs.

TI  - Land Cover Change Detection and Subsistence Farming Dynamics in the Fringes of Mount Elgon National Park, Uganda from 1978-2020
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Analyzing the dominant forms and extent of land cover changes in the Mount Elgon region is important for tracking conservation efforts and sustainable land management. Mount Elgon's rugged terrain limits the monitoring of these changes over large areas. This study used multitemporal satellite imagery to analyze and quantify the land cover changes in the upper Manafwa watershed of Mount Elgon, for 42 years covering an area of 320 km(2). The study employed remote sensing techniques, geographic information systems, and software to map land cover changes over four decades (1978, 1988, 2001, 2010, and 2020). The maximum likelihood classifier and post-classification comparison technique were used in land cover classification and change detection analysis. The results showed a positive percentage change (gain) in planted forest (3966%), built-up (890%), agriculture (186%), and tropical high forest low-stocked (119%) and a negative percentage change (loss) in shrubs (-81%), bushland (-68%), tropical high forest well-stocked (-50%), grassland (-44%), and bare and sparsely vegetated surfaces (-14%) in the period of 1978-2020. The observed changes were concentrated mainly at the peripheries of the Mount Elgon National Park. The increase in population and rising demand for agricultural land were major driving factors. However, regreening as a restoration effort has led to an increase in land area for planted forests, attributed to an improvement in conservation-related activities jointly implemented by the concerned stakeholders and native communities. These findings revealed the spatial and temporal land cover changes in the upper Manafwa watershed. The results could enhance restoration and conservation efforts when coupled with studies on associated drivers of these changes and the use of very-high-resolution remote sensing on areas where encroachment is visible in the park.

TI  - Knowledge and seroprevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi in dogs from Valledupar (Colombia)
T2  - REVISTA MVZ CORDOBA
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. Determine the seroprevalence of IgG antibodies against Trypanosome cruzi in dogs in the city of Valledupar, department of Cesar in Colombia, as a possible Chagas disease sentinel species. Materials and methods. An awareness talk was given and a survey applied to participants regarding knowledge of Chagas disease, previously standardized by the Instituto National de Salud (INS - Colombia). A total of 80 dog samples were tested using an ELISA recombinant Chagatest v3.0. Sample reading was done using an ELISA strip reader Stat Fax 303 Plus and statistical analyses were done with SPSS v.22.0. Results. Data captured by 66 surveys indicates 37.88% of people relate the insect vector and the symptoms with the pathology; most of the surveyed performed vector control at home (cleaning, fumigation). Of the 80 samples evaluated, 95% were negative and 5% positive. No significant association was found between the variables breed, sex and age, and seropositivity to T. cruzi. Conclusions. Identification of seropositive samples in dogs represents an important epidemiological indicator for the Caribbean region and the department of Cesar. Implementation of strategies to strengthen interinstitutional alliances for disease monitoring are recommended, including the use of dogs as sentinel species. This is the first report of seroprevalence of T. cruzi in dogs in Valledupar, Colombia and is expected to increase the knowledge on the behavior of the infection in domestic reservoirs of the region.

TI  - PRESENCE OF AN ENDANGERED ENDEMIC PRIMATE IN AN EVER-CHANGING LANDSCAPE IN THE EASTERN PLAINS OF COLOMBIA
T2  - ACTA BIOLOGICA COLOMBIANA
M3  - Article
AB  - Plecturocebus ornatus is an endemic vulnerable species due to its population decline and its restricted range within the Eastern Plains of Colombia. This region is affected by deforestation as a result of legal and illegal economic activities. The aim of this work was to analyze the presence and abundance of P. ornatus during a period of urban and livestock production expansion (1986-2019) in Villavicencio, Colombia. This municipality is the most affected by land-use changes associated with regional economic development and represents 3.4 % of P. ornatus distribution???s area. The analysis was performed using satellite images Landsat 4 and 8, with V-Late in ArcGIS 10.5 to describe landscape structure, and P. ornatus occurrence records, obtained through field observations and the Global Biological Information Facility. Densities were calculated for each fragment based on total individuals observed by transect. A generalized lineal model was used to evaluate the effects of patch-scale, landscape-scale and other variables on P. ornatus abundance. By 1986 the rural and peri-urban areas of Villavicencio were already a transformed landscape. During the analyzed period, landscape was predominantly made up of disconnected linear fragments with a secondary humid forest cover. Around 82.1 % of the fragments with P. ornatus records are threatened by urbanization and only 50 % are in protected areas. Densities varied from 0.00 to 7.26 ind/ha (0.00???726.82 ind/km2). Abundance of P. ornatus was highly influenced by landscape-scale variables related with landscape connectivity, as well as fragment area and number of other primate species. Therefore, the implementation of restoration measures that increase landscape connectivity and habitat availability is proposed, as well as more control over environmental land-use planning, to contribute to the conservation of P. ornatus in urban areas.

TI  - Open Surgery including Lymphadenectomy without Adjuvant Therapy for Uterine-Confined Intermediate- and High-Risk Endometrioid Endometrial Carcinoma
T2  - CURRENT ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Minimally invasive surgery may not be an appropriate surgical approach in intermediate- and high-risk endometrial carcinoma, even though adjuvant therapy is given. The objective of this study was to evaluate the results of open surgery including lymphadenectomy without adjuvant therapy in patients with uterine-confined intermediate- and high-risk endometrioid endometrial carcinoma. Two hundred fifty-six patients with uterine-confined endometrioid endometrial carcinoma were treated with open surgery, including pelvic with or without para-aortic lymphadenectomy. Of the 81 patients with uterine-confined intermediate- or high-risk disease, 77 were treated with systematic lymphadenectomy without adjuvant therapy. Seven patients developed recurrence, comprising 5.5% (3/55) and 18.2% (4/22) of the intermediate- and high-risk patients, respectively. The time to recurrence was 1-66 months. The sites of recurrence were the vaginal apex (n = 2), lung (n = 2), vaginal sidewall (n = 1), pelvic lymph nodes (n = 1), and para-aortic to supraclavicular nodes (n = 1). Of these, five patients were alive without disease after salvage treatment, but two understaged high-risk patients died of disease. The five-year disease-specific survival rates of intermediate- and high-risk patients were 100% and 90%, respectively. The present study indicated that patients with uterine-confined intermediate- and high-risk endometrioid endometrial carcinoma had excellent survival when treated with open surgery, including lymphadenectomy alone. The safety of omitting adjuvant therapy should be evaluated in prospective randomized trials comparing open surgery with minimally invasive surgery.

The adopted technique employs an InSAR processing chain that exploits a stack of Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images using a small baseline multitemporal approach. Interferograms with small temporal baselines are first selected, then their network is optimized and reduced to eliminate noisy data, in order to mitigate the effect of decorrelation sources related to seasonal phenomena, i.e., snow and vegetation growth, and to the radar acquisition geometry. The atmospheric disturbance is mitigated using a spatio-temporal filter based on the nonequispaced fast Fourier transform. The estimated displacement maps and time series show the effect of both linear and impulsive ground motion and are validated against global navigation satellite system (GNSS) measurements. In this context, a significant threat to the built environment is represented by seismic tremors triggered by underground mining activities, which are analyzed using the proposed method to integrate the information gathered by in situ seismometer devices.

TI  - Differences in psychological distress, resilience and cognitive emotional regulation strategies in adults during the Coronavirus pandemic: A cross-cultural study of Poland and Spain
T2  - ANALES DE PSICOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. The objective of this cross-cultural study was to ana-lyze the differences in resilience, cognitive emotion regulation strategies (CERS), as well as psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic between Poland and Spain. Method. An online survey was conducted on a sample of 1,182 adults. A MANOVA analysis was carried out to examine the differences in the studied variables between these countries. This was followed by MANCOVA analysis to control for gender and age. Linear re-gression analyses segmented by country were conducted in order to identi-fy psychological distress prediction models. Results. Polish population was characterized by higher levels of anxiety, less resilience and more maladap-tive CERS during the lockdown. Spanish population was more affected by stress but used more adaptable CERS and was more resilient. Age and fe-male gender appeared as risk factors of psychological distress in Spain. The psychological distress prediction models were found to be different be-tween both countries: adaptive CERS was predictive only in Spain, and re-silience was predictive only in Poland. Conclusions. This study could guide in initiatives for the promotion of psychological well-being as a way to pre -vent psychopathological disorders during the pandemic.

TI  - A Self-Attentive Hybrid Coding Network for 3D Change Detection in High-Resolution Optical Stereo Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Real-time monitoring of urban building development provides a basis for urban planning and management. Remote sensing change detection is a key technology for achieving this goal. Intelligent change detection based on deep learning of remote sensing images is a current focus of research. However, most methods only use unimodal remote sensing data and ignore vertical features, leading to incomplete characterization, poor detection of small targets, and false detections and omissions. To solve these problems, we propose a multi-path self-attentive hybrid coding network model (MAHNet) that fuses high-resolution remote sensing images and digital surface models (DSMs) for 3D change detection of urban buildings. We use stereo images from the Gaofen-7 (GF-7) stereo mapping satellite as the data source. In the encoding stage, we propose a multi-path hybrid encoder, which is a structure that can efficiently perform multi-dimensional feature mining of multimodal data. In the deep feature fusion link, a dual self-attentive fusion structure is designed that can improve the deep feature fusion and characterization of multimodal data. In the decoding stage, a dense skip-connection decoder is designed that can fuse multi-scale features flexibly and reduce spatial information losses in small-change regions in the down-sampling process, while enhancing feature utilization and propagation efficiency. Experimental results show that MAHNet achieves accurate pixel-level change detection in complex urban scenes with an overall accuracy of 97.44% and F1-score of 92.59%, thereby outperforming other methods of change detection.

TI  - Characteristics of Greening along Altitudinal Gradients on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau Based on Time-Series Landsat Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) is ecologically fragile and is especially sensitive to climate change. Previous studies have shown that the vegetation on the QTP is undergoing overall greening with variations along altitudinal gradients. However, the mechanisms that cause the differences in the spatiotemporal patterns of vegetation greening among different types of terrain and vegetation have not received sufficient attention. Therefore, in this study, we used a Landsat NDVI time-series for the period 1992-2020 and climate data to observe the effects of terrain and vegetation types on the spatiotemporal patterns in vegetation greening on the QTP and to analyze the factors driving this greening using the geographical detector and the velocity of the vertical movement of vegetation greenness isolines. The results showed the following: (1) The vertical movement of the vegetation greenness isolines was affected by the temperature and precipitation at all elevations. The precipitation had a more substantial effect than the temperature below 3000 m. In contrast, above 3000 m, the temperature had a greater effect than the precipitation. (2) The velocity of the vertical movement of the vegetation greenness isolines of woody plants was higher than that of herbaceous plants. (3) The influence of slope on the vertical movement of vegetation greenness isolines was more significant than that of the aspect. The results of this study provided details of the spatiotemporal differences in vegetation greening between different types of terrain and vegetation at a 30-m scale as well as of the underlying factors driving this greening. These results will help to support ecological protection policies on the QTP.

TI  - Surface Soil Moisture Retrieval Using Sentinel-1 SAR Data for Crop Planning in Kosi River Basin of North Bihar
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface Soil Moisture (SSM) is a key factor for understanding the physical process between the land surface and atmosphere. With the advancement of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) technology and backscattering models, retrieval of SSM over the land surface at higher spatial resolution became effective and accurate. This study examines the potential of C-band Sentinel-1 SAR data to derive SSM in a dry season (February 2020) over bare soil and vegetated agricultural fields in the Kosi River Basin (KRB) in North Bihar. Field campaigns were conducted simultaneously with Sentinel-1A acquisition date, and measurements comprised 54 in-situ sampling plots for the top of the soil (0-7.6 cm depth) using time-domain reflectometry (TDR-300). The modified Dubois model was employed to estimate relative soil permittivity from the backscatter values (sigma degrees) of VV polarization. With the help of Topp's model, volumetric SSM (m(3)/m(3)) was derived for all areas with normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) less than 0.4 that majorly covered bare land or sparse vegetation. The key findings demonstrated that model-derived SSM was well correlated with the in-situ SSM with the coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.77 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.06 m(3)/m(3). The spatial distribution of SSM ranged from 0.05 to 0.5 m(3)/m(3) over the KRB, and the highest moisture was found in the Kosi Megafan. The modified Dubois model was effective in providing SSM from Sentinel-1A data in bare soil and agricultural fields and, thus, supporting use in hydrological, meteorological and crop planning applications.

TI  - The Evaluation of Spectral Vegetation Indexes and Redundancy Reduction on the Accuracy of Crop Type Detection
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge about crop type distribution is valuable information for effective management of agricultural productivity, food security estimation, and natural resources protection. Algorithms for automatic crop type detection have great potential to positively influence these aspects as well as speed up the process of crop type mapping in larger areas. In the presented study, we used 14 Sentinel-2 images to calculate 12 widely used spectral vegetation indices. Further, to evaluate the effect of reduced dimensionality on the accuracy of crop type mapping, we utilized principal component analysis (PCA). For this purpose, random forest (RF)-supervised classifications were tested for each index separately, as well as for the combinations of various indices and the four initial PCA components. Additionally, for each RF classification feature importance was assessed, which enabled identification of the most relevant period of the year for the differentiation of crop types. We used 34.6% of the ground truth field data to train the classifier and calculate various accuracy measures such as the overall accuracy (OA) or Kappa index. The study showed a high effectiveness of the Modified Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index (MCARI) (OA = 86%, Kappa = 0.81), Normalized Difference Index 45 (NDI45) (OA = 85%, Kappa = 0.81), and Weighted Difference Vegetation Index (WDVI) (OA = 85%, Kappa = 0.80) in crop type mapping. However, utilization of all of them together did not increase the classification accuracy (OA = 78%, Kappa = 0.72). Additionally, the application of the initial three components of PCA allowed us to achieve an OA of 78% and Kappa of 0.72, which was unfortunately lower than the single-index classification (e.g., based on only NDVI45). This shows that dimensionality reductions did not increase the classification accuracy. Moreover, feature importance from RF indicated that images captured from June and July are the most relevant for differentiating crop types. This shows that this period of the year is crucial to effectively differentiate crop types and should be undeniably used in crop type mapping.

TI  - AdaBoosted Extra Trees Classifier for Object-Based Multispectral Image Classification of Urban Fringe Area
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMAGE AND GRAPHICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the past decade, it is proven that satellite image classification using an object-based technique is better than the standard pixel-based technique. With the increasing need for classifying multispectral satellite images for urban planning, the accuracy of the classification becomes a significant performance parameter. Object-based classification (OBC) is a technique in which group of pixels having similar spectral properties, called objects, are generated using image segmentation and then these objects are classified based on their attributes. In this paper, the combination of a multiclass AdaBoost algorithm with extra trees classifier (ETC) is proposed with higher prediction accuracy for the OBC of the urban fringe area. The performance of the AdaBoost algorithm is found to be better in terms of classification accuracy than benchmarked SVM and RF classifiers for OBC. These classification methods were applied to IRS-R2 LISS IV data. The AdaBoosted extra trees classifier (ABETC) has demonstrated the highest accuracy with overall accuracy (OA) of 88.47% and a kappa coefficient of 0.85. The computational time of the ABETC is found to be much smaller than the RF algorithm. In detail, the sensitivity of the classifiers was investigated using stratified random sampling with various sample sizes.

TI  - Monitoring the Impact of Large Transport Infrastructure on Land Use and Environment Using Deep Learning and Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale infrastructure, such as China-Europe Railway Express (CER-Express), which connects countries and regions across Asia and Europe, has a potentially profound effect on land use, as evidenced by changes in land cover along the railway. To ensure sustainable development of such infrastructure and appropriate land administration, effective ways to monitor and assess its impact need to be developed. Remote sensing based on publicly available satellite imagery represents an obvious choice. In the study presented here, we employ a state-of-the-art deep-learning-based approach to automatically detect different types of land cover based on multispectral Sentinel-2 imagery. We then use these data to conduct and present a study of the changes in land use in two geopolitically diverse regions of interest (in Serbia and China and with and without CER-Express infrastructure) for the period of the last three years. Our results show that the standard image-patch-based land cover classification approaches suffer a significant drop in performance in our target scenario in which each pixel needs to be assigned a cove class, but still, validate the applicability of the proposed approach as a remote sensing tool to support the sustainable development of large infrastructure. We discuss the technical limitations of the proposed approach in detail and potential ways in which it can be improved.

TI  - Vegetation in Arid Areas of the Loess Plateau Showed More Sensitivity of Water-Use Efficiency to Seasonal Drought
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Studying the impact of regional or seasonal drought on vegetation water-use efficiency (WUE) can identify an effective theoretical basis by which vegetation can cope with future climate change. Based on remote sensing data and climate grid data, in this study, we calculated the ecosystem WUE and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), analyzed the temporal and spatial divergence of seasonal drought and WUE, and explored the relationship between WUE and seasonal drought in the Loess Plateau. The results indicate that from 2001 to 2019, the humidity in spring and summer on the Loess Plateau shows an increasing trend, and the aridity in fall also shows an increasing trend. Averaged over four seasons, WUE presents distribution characteristics of "high in the southeast and low in the northwest", with the highest WUE in summer. However, the geological distribution of the sensitivity of WUE to seasonal drought was significantly different. Spring drought increased WUE, whereas summer drought led to a decrease in WUE. When fall drought was less severe, the WUE increased; WUE response to winter SPEI was negative, but the sensitivity did not change with variation of drought degree. The sensitivity of WUE to the magnitude of seasonal drought was affected by regional dry and wet conditions. A clear seasonal divergence was found in four climate regions, along with increased drought intensity, and the sensitivity of WUE to drought magnitude in arid areas was generally higher than that in semi-arid, semi-humid areas, or humid areas. With this study, we deeply explored how ecosystems deal with the water supply strategy of seasonal drought, which is of great significance in the understanding of the coupling relationship between the carbon-water cycle and climate change.

TI  - Soya Yield Prediction on a Within-Field Scale Using Machine Learning Models Trained on Sentinel-2 and Soil Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Agriculture is the backbone and the main sector of the industry for many countries in the world. Assessing crop yields is key to optimising on-field decisions and defining sustainable agricultural strategies. Remote sensing applications have greatly enhanced our ability to monitor and manage farming operation. The main objective of this research was to evaluate machine learning system for within-field soya yield prediction trained on Sentinel-2 multispectral images and soil parameters. Multispectral images used in the study came from ESA's Sentinel-2 satellites. A total of 3 cloud-free Sentinel-2 multispectral images per year from specific periods of vegetation were used to obtain the time-series necessary for crop yield prediction. Yield monitor data were collected in three crop seasons (2018, 2019 and 2020) from a number of farms located in Upper Austria. The ground-truth database consisted of information about the location of the fields and crop yield monitor data on 411 ha of farmland. A novel method, namely the Polygon-Pixel Interpolation, for optimal fitting yield monitor data with satellite images is introduced. Several machine learning algorithms, such as Multiple Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, Stochastic Gradient Descent and Random Forest, were compared for their performance in soya yield prediction. Among the tested machine learning algorithms, Stochastic Gradient Descent regression model performed better than the others, with a mean absolute error of 4.36 kg/pixel (0.436 t/ha) and a correlation coefficient of 0.83%.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Patterns and Dominant Factors of Urban Particulate Matter Islands: New Evidence from 240 Cities in China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - With rapid urbanization and industrialization, PM2.5 pollution exerts a significant negative impact on the urban eco-environment and on residents' health. Previous studies have demonstrated that cities in China are characterized by urban particulate matter island (UPI) phenomena, i.e., higher PM2.5 concentrations are observed in urban areas than in rural settings. How, though, nature and socioeconomic environments interact to influence UPI intensities is a question that still awaits a general explanation. To fill this knowledge gap, this study investigates spatiotemporal variations in UPI effects with respect to different climatic settings and city sizes in 240 cities in China from 2000 to 2015 using remotely sensed data and explores the effective mechanism of human-environmental factors on UPI dynamics based upon the Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) model. In particular, a conceptual framework that considers natural environments, technology, population, and economics is proposed to explore the factors influencing UPIs. The results show (1) that about 70% of the cities in China selected exhibited UPI effects from 2000 to 2015. In addition, UPI intensities and the number of UPI-related cities decreased over time. It is noteworthy that PM2.5 pollution shifted from urban to rural areas. (2) Elevation was the most efficient driving factor of UPI variations, followed by precipitation, population density, NDVI, per capita GDP, and PM2.5 emission per unit GDP. (3) Climatic backgrounds and city sizes influenced the compositions and performance of dominant factors regarding UPI phenomena. This study provides valuable a reference for PM2.5 pollution mitigation in cities experiencing global climate change and rapid urbanization and thus can help sustainable urban developments.

TI  - Flood Risk and Exposure: The Case of the Tajuna Valley (Madrid, Spain)
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper aims to update the exposure to flood risk in a catchment area of the Community of Madrid (Spain) linked to primary sector activities, albeit affected by the urban expansion of the capital. This research starts with the updating of the flood inventory, encompassing episodes documented between 1629 and 2020. The inadequate occupation of the territory means that floods continue to cause significant damage nowadays. It is worth highlighting the two recent floods (2019) that occurred just 15 days apart and caused serious damage to several towns in the basin. The areas at risk of flooding are obtained from the National Floodplain Mapping System, and the maximum and minimum floodable volume in the sector of the Tajuna River basin with the highest exposure to flooding has been calculated. The Sentinel 2 image in false colour (RGB bands 11-2-3, 11-8-3 and 12-11-8) and its transformation to colour properties (Intensity, Hue and Saturation) has made it possible to determine the extension of the riparian vegetation and the irrigated crops located in the alluvial plain. The SPOT 6 image with higher spatial resolution has allowed us to update the mapping of buildings located in areas at risk of flooding. Finally, based on cadastral data, a detailed cartography of built-up areas in areas at risk of flooding is provided. They affect buildings built mainly between the 1960s and 1990s, although the most recent buildings are built on agricultural land in the alluvial plain, even though current regulations prevent the occupation of these lands.

TI  - How to map soil sealing, land take and impervious surfaces? A systematic review
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Soil degradation is one of the main environmental issues within the international agendas on sustainability and climate adaptation. Among degradation processes, soil sealing represents the major threat, as ecosystem services dramatically decrease or are even nullified. The increasing use of big open data from satellites combined with AI algorithms are making geodata mining and mapping techniques essential to quantify soil sealing. Different keywords are adopted to define the phenomenon. However, at present, review articles presenting the state-of-the-art on mapping soil sealing by including the most common definitions are currently not available. Hence, we analyzed: (a) impervious surface, (b) soil sealing, (c) land take, (d) soil consumption, (e) land consumption. We provide a systematic review of remote sensing platforms and methodologies to map and to classify soil sealing, by highlighting: (a) definitions; (b) relationships among study areas, scales, platforms, resolutions, and classification methodologies; (c) emerging trends and policy implications. We performed a systematic search on Scopus (from 2000 to 2020), identifying 1277 papers; 392 focused on mapping soil sealing. 'Impervious surface' is the dominant definition. The phenomenon is more studied by the USA, China and Italy and, 'soil sealing' is recently more adopted in EU. Most studies focuses on mapping soil sealing at urban scale. We found Landsat are the most adopted platforms; they are frequently used for multi-temporal analyses. Eleven methodologies were identified: automatic classifications are the most adopted, dominated by pixel/sub-pixel-based approaches; other methods include Band Ratios, Supervised, OBIA, ANN. The majority of mapping analyses are performed on 30 m resolution in areas of 1000-10 000 km(2). Landsat images are less used for smaller areas. In conclusion, as study area size increases, a decrease in image resolution with the use of more completely automatic classification methodologies is recorded. However, most studies focuses on comparing classification techniques rather than supporting policy making for sustainable urban planning. Thus, we encourage to fill the gap by developing approaches that applicable to international policies.

TI  - Using Optical Water-Type Classification in Data-Poor Water Quality Assessment: A Case Study in the Torres Strait
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - For many years, local communities have expressed concerns that turbid plume waters from the Fly River in Papua New Guinea may potentially deliver mine-derived contaminants to the Torres Strait, an ecologically and culturally unique area north of the Australian mainland. Information on suspended sediment transport and turbidity patterns are needed in this data-limited region to identify and manage downstream ecosystems that may be at risk of exposure from the Fly River runoff. This study used MODIS satellite time series and a colour-classification approach to map optical water types around the data-poor Gulf of Papua and Torres Strait region. The satellite data were supported by field data, including salinity and suspended sediment measurements, and used together in qualitative water quality assessments to evaluate the habitats that are likely exposed to Fly River discharge and/or derived sediments. It showed that the Fly River influence in the Torres Strait region is largely limited to the north-east corner of the Torres Strait. The drivers of turbidity vary between locations, and it is impossible to fully separate direct riverine plume influence from wave and tidally driven sediment resuspension in the satellite maps. However, results indicate that coastal habitats located as far east as Bramble Cay and west to Boigu Island are located in an area that is most likely exposed to the Fly River discharge within the region, directly or through sediment resuspension. The area that is the most likely exposed is a relatively small proportion of the Torres Strait region, but encompasses habitats of high ecological importance, including coral reefs and seagrass meadows. Satellite data showed that the period of highest risk of exposure was during the south-east trade wind season and complemented recent model simulations in the region over larger spatial and temporal frames. This study did not evaluate transboundary pollution or the ecological impact on local marine resources, but other recent studies suggest it is likely to be limited. However, this study did provide long-term, extensive but qualitative, baseline information needed to inform future ecological risk mapping and to support decision making about management priorities in the region. This is important for ensuring the protection of the Torres Strait ecosystems, given their importance to Torres Strait communities and turtle and dugong populations, and the Torres Strait's connectivity with the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.

TI  - Water Turbidity Determination by a Satellite Imagery-Based Mathematical Equation for the Chao Phraya River
T2  - Environment and Natural Resources Journal
M3  - Article
AB  - Turbidity is a standard water quality parameter that indicates its optical property in scattering light along the column containing suspended particles. The satellite imagery information of Sentinel-2 and the Chao Phraya River turbidity data from December 2016 to February 2021 was applied to develop a mathematical equation for turbidity determination. This practical and straightforward approach eliminates some constraints of traditional laboratory analysis, which is labour-intensive and time-consuming in monitoring the entire river. Four studied steps were implemented: data pre-processing, correlating analysis of numerical turbidity and satellite image reflectance, developing the mathematic equations for turbidity estimation, and its validation of use. Four different bands (B2, B3, B4, and B8) and three selection methods were investigated; single-band, combination band, and ratio band. The obtained results depicted that the reflectance of B4 in the single-band process promoted the highest correlation with turbidity compared to the others. The reflectance in visible wavelengths increased when the turbidity of river water increased, particularly B4. The mathematical power equation was a more suitable function for evaluating turbidity than linear regression, quadratic, and exponential functions. A similar concentration was obtained for measured and estimated turbidity in the validation. This finding demonstrated the potential application of remotely sensed data to estimate river water turbidity with high capability and accuracy that adequately supports spatial data continuity acquisition.

TI  - Evaluation of supervised classification methods for the estimation of spatiotemporal changes in the Merchan and Telecom paramos, Colombia
T2  - BOLETIN DE GEOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years there has been significant progress in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and the development of supervised classification methods, but until now these had not been used to accurately calculate the surface extent of paramos in sectors of the Eastern Cordillera of Colombia. Furthermore, these methods had not been used to estimate the distance between the boundaries of these moors and major geological features. For this reason, in the present research, five different supervised classification methods were evaluated, with the purpose of determining which of them has a higher resolution in order to reproduce the extension and surface distribution of the paramos of Merchan and Telecom in Saboya, Boyaca, belonging to the Merchan - Iguaque complex in the Eastern Cordillera of Colombia. For this purpose, satellite images of the study area by Landsat 8 for the year 2018 were chosen and classified into some algorithms based on Machine Learning (SVM, RF, DT, BC and ANN). To establish the accuracy and reliability of the classification data of the terrain features, the Kappa Index was calculated, which allowed determining that the most accurate method for this case was Random Forest. In addition, since the boundaries of the moorlands coincide with geological structures or contacts between formations, the distance between the edge of the moorlands and these features was estimated. The results obtained in this research are considered as an important input for future multitemporal analysis as in landscape metrics, which serve as a tool for the development and decision making in the management of natural resources, biodiversity, provision of ecosystem services, as in the land use planning for the municipality of Saboya-Boyaca.

TI  - Evaluation and comparison of the earth observing sensors in land cover/land use studies using machine learning algorithms
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid transformation of land cover/land use (LCLU) is a strong indication of global environmental change. In order to monitor LCLU through maps, a significant dataset and robust technique are necessary. Thus, the primary objective of the current research is to evaluate and compare the efficiency of several notable satellite sensors including Landsat-8 (L-8), Sentinel-2 (S-2), Sentinel-1 (S-1), combined Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 (S-1-2), LISS III (L-3), and LISS IV (L-4) for LCLU mapping applying random forest (RF), logit boost (LB), stochastic gradient boosting (SGB), artificial neural network (ANN), and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) models. For this purpose, 300 samples for each of the six LCLU classes have been selected based on field survey and high resolution Cartosat-3 images. The classification accuracy namely producer accuracy (PA), user accuracy (UA), overall accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficient have been calculated from the confusion matrix of the applied models. This results show the highest accuracy has been derived from the integration of S-1-2 datasets followed by S-2, L-8, L-3, L-4, and S1. On the other hand, LB model is the most consistent and efficient in comparison with other models for all the datasets. Regarding importance of variable, SWIR band is repeatedly the most crucial factor while blue band is the least significant variable. From this comparative assessment of sensors, it has been found that high spatial and spectral resolutions along with combination of satellite datasets are required to get better accuracy rather than only high spatial resolution in regional scale mapping. The present study strongly advocates the use of combined S-1-2 data together with the application of LB model for LCLU classification.

TI  - A Model-Based Temperature Adjustment Scheme for Wintertime Sea-Ice Production Retrievals from MODIS
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of the wintertime sea-ice production in Arctic polynyas is an important requirement for estimations of the dense water formation, which drives vertical mixing in the upper ocean. Satellite-based techniques incorporating relatively high resolution thermal-infrared data from MODIS in combination with atmospheric reanalysis data have proven to be a strong tool to monitor large and regularly forming polynyas and to resolve narrow thin-ice areas (i.e., leads) along the shelf-breaks and across the entire Arctic Ocean. However, the selection of the atmospheric data sets has a large influence on derived polynya characteristics due to their impact on the calculation of the heat loss to the atmosphere, which is determined by the local thin-ice thickness. In order to overcome this methodical ambiguity, we present a MODIS-assisted temperature adjustment (MATA) algorithm that yields corrections of the 2 m air temperature and hence decreases differences between the atmospheric input data sets. The adjustment algorithm is based on atmospheric model simulations. We focus on the Laptev Sea region for detailed case studies on the developed algorithm and present time series of polynya characteristics in the winter season 2019/2020. It shows that the application of the empirically derived correction decreases the difference between different utilized atmospheric products significantly from 49% to 23%. Additional filter strategies are applied that aim at increasing the capability to include leads in the quasi-daily and persistence-filtered thin-ice thickness composites. More generally, the winter of 2019/2020 features high polynya activity in the eastern Arctic and less activity in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, presumably as a result of the particularly strong polar vortex in early 2020.

TI  - Distinguishing Algal Blooms from Aquatic Vegetation in Chinese Lakes Using Sentinel 2 Image
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Algal blooms frequently occur in numerous lakes in China, risking human health and the environment. In contrast, aquatic vegetation contributes to water purification. Due to the similar spectral characteristics shared by algal and aquatic vegetation, both are hardly distinguishable in remote sensing imaging, especially in turbid water bodies. To address this challenge, this study constructed a method to effectively extract algal blooms and aquatic vegetation from the turbid water bodies using Sentinel 2 images with high spatial resolution. Our results showed that the accuracy of the extraction of vegetation information could reach 96.1%. Since this method combined the vegetation extraction results from multiple indices, it effectively tackled the mis-extraction when only the Floating Algae Index (FAI) or the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is used in water with high turbidity. By combining the image time series information with the natural phenological characteristics of the aquatic vegetation and algal blooms, an improved Vegetation Presence Frequency (VPF) was developed. It effectively distinguished algal blooms and aquatic vegetation without actual measurement data. Based on the above method and process, the information of algal blooms and aquatic vegetation was sufficiently distinguished in five typical lakes in China (Lake Hulun, Lake Hongze, Lake Chaohu, Lake Taihu, and Lake Dianchi), and the spatial distribution was reasonably mapped. The overall identification accuracy of aquatic vegetation and algal blooms using the improved VPF ranged 71.8-84.3%. The spatial transferability test of the method in the independent lakes with the various optical properties indicated the prospects of its application in other turbid water bodies. This study should provide strong methodological and theoretical support for future monitoring of algal blooms in turbid water bodies with vigorous aquatic vegetation, especially in the absence of actual measurement data. This should have practical relevance for water environment management and governance departments.

TI  - Impacts of Assimilating CYGNSS Satellite Ocean-Surface Wind on Prediction of Landfalling Hurricanes with the HWRF Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines the impacts of assimilating ocean-surface winds derived from the NASA Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) on improving the short-range numerical simulations and forecasts of landfalling hurricanes using the NCEP operational Hurricane Weather Research and Forecasting (HWRF) model. A series of data assimilation experiments are performed using HWRF and a Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI)-based hybrid 3-dimensional ensemble-variational (3DEnVar) data assimilation system. The influence of CYGNSS data on hurricane forecasts is compared with that of Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) wind products that have already been assimilated into the HWRF forecast system in a series of assimilation experiments. The effects of different versions of CYGNSS data (V2.1 vs. V3.0) on hurricane forecasts are evaluated. The results indicate that CYGNSS ocean-surface wind can lead to improved numerical simulations and forecasts of hurricane track and intensity, asymmetric wind structure, and precipitation. The impacts of CYGNSS on hurricane forecasts are comparable and complementary to the operational use of ASCAT satellite data products. The dependence of the relative impacts of different versions of CYGNSS data on optimal thinning distances is evident.

TI  - Characterising the Land Surface Phenology of Middle Eastern Countries Using Moderate Resolution Landsat Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global change impacts including climate change, increased CO2 and nitrogen deposition can be determined through a more precise characterisation of Land Surface Phenology (LSP) parameters. In addition, accurate estimation of LSP dates is being increasingly used in applications such as mapping vegetation types, yield forecasting, and irrigation management. However, there has not been any attempt to characterise Middle East vegetation phenology at the fine spatial resolution appropriate for such applications. Remote-sensing based approaches have proved to be a useful tool in such regions since access is restricted in some areas due to security issues and their inter-annual vegetation phenology parameters vary considerably because of high uncertainty in rainfall. This study aims to establish for the first time a comprehensive characterisation of the vegetation phenological characteristics of the major vegetation types in the Middle East at a fine spatial resolution of 30 m using Landsat Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series data over a temporal range of 20 years (2000-2020). Overall, a progressive pattern in phenophases was observed from low to high latitude. The earliest start of the season was concentrated in the central and east of the region associated mainly with grassland and cultivated land, while the significantly delayed end of the season was mainly distributed in northern Turkey and Iran corresponding to the forest, resulting in the prolonged length of the season in the study area. There was a significant positive correlation between LSP parameters and latitude, which indicates a delay in the start of the season of 4.83 days (R-2 = 0.86, p < 0.001) and a delay in the end of the season of 6.54 days (R-2 = 0.83, p < 0.001) per degree of latitude increase. In addition, we have discussed the advantages of fine resolution LSP parameters over the available coarse datasets and showed how such outputs can improve many applications in the region. This study shows the potential of Landsat data to quantify the LSP of major land cover types in heterogeneous landscapes of the Middle East which enhances our understanding of the spatial-temporal dynamics of vegetation dynamics in arid and semi-arid settings in the world.

TI  - Preliminary Evaluation of FY-3E Microwave Temperature Sounder Performance Based on Observation Minus Simulation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The FY-3E satellite was successfully launched on 5 July 2021 and carries on board the Microwave Temperature Sounder-III (MWTS-III). In this study, the biases of MWTS-III data with respect to simulations are analyzed according to the instrument field of view and location latitude over the Pacific region. The cloud liquid water path (CLWP) over oceans is retrieved from two new window channels at 23.8 and 31.4 GHz and is used for detecting the clouds-affected microwave sounding data. The absolute bias between the observed and simulated brightness temperature (O-B) under the clear sky point is, in general, less than 2.0 K, depending on the MWTS-III channel. The standard deviations of O-B in most channels are less 1.0 K, but they are 1-1.5 K in channels 1-4 and 17. The average and the standard deviation of O-B from the channels 1-10 shows an obvious symmetrical variation with FOV. The evaluation results all indicate good prospects for the assimilation application of FY-3E microwave sounding data.

TI  - Atmosphere and Terrain Coupling Simulation Framework for High-Resolution Visible-Thermal Spectral Imaging over Heterogeneous Land Surface
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Realistic modeling of high-resolution earth radiation signals in the visible-thermal spectral domain remains difficult, due to the complex radiation interdependence induced by the heterogeneous and rugged features of land surface. To find the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency for image simulation, this paper established a unified simulation framework for the entire visible-thermal spectral domain, based on the energy balance between solar-reflected and thermal radiation components over rugged surfaces. Considering the joint contributions of atmospheric and topographic adjacency effects, three spatial-spectral convolution kernels were uniformly designed to quantify the topographic irradiance, the trapping effect, and the atmospheric adjacency effect. Radiation signal simulation was implemented in three forms: land surface temperature (LST), bottom of atmosphere (BOA) radiance, and top of atmosphere (TOA) radiance. The accuracy was validated with onboard data from China's Gaofen-5 visual and infrared multispectral sensor (VIMS) over rugged desert. The simulation results demonstrate that the root mean square of relative deviations between the simulated and onboard TOA radiance are related to terrain, as 3-17% and 6-38% for the summer and winter scene, respectively. The evaluation of radiance components indicates the utility of the simulation framework to quantify the uncertainty associated with atmosphere and terrain coupling effects, in the sensor design and operation stages.

T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Primary productivity in the ocean plays a major role in the global carbon cycle. To estimate its changes through geological time, different sedimentary proxies are used. However, the relative weights of the various processes driving the sedimentary accumulation of organic matter are not fully constrained or represent the flux of specific algal classes. Here, we compare sea-surface chlorophyll-a (SSchla) abundance estimated from remote sensing data over the last 20 years with the sedimentary concentration of its derivatives (i.e., chlorin) on a suite of 140 core-top sediments from different biogeochemical regions. We estimate with field data that only 0.33% of SSchla in tropical and subtropical regions is transferred to surface sediments in the form of chlorin. Despite the small fraction of chlorin that arrive to the sea-floor, the sedimentary spatial distribution of chlorin is driven primarily by SSchla concentration in high and moderate productivity locations (SSchla > 0.20 mg center dot m(-3)). Our calibration paves the way for the use of chlorin as quantitative proxies of primary productivity in paleoreconstructions and cautions on their use in low primary productivity settings.

TI  - A Climatology of Mesoscale Convective Systems in Northwest Mexico during the North American Monsoon
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCS) may vary greatly with respect to their morphology, propagation mechanism, intensity, and under which synoptic-scale conditions as a function of topographic complexity. In this study, we develop a long-term climatology of MCS during the North American Monsoon focusing on MCS morphology, lifecycle, and intensity as well as possible propagation mechanisms. We employ an MCS tracking and classification technique based on 23 years (1995 to 2017) of GOES IR satellite data. MCS intensity is also gauged with 7 years (2011 to 2017) of Vaisala GLD360 lightning data and, finally, monthly and interannual variability in synoptic conditions are examined with ERA5 reanalysis data. Our results based on 1594 identified MCS reveal that 98% are morphologically classified as Persistent Elongated Convective Systems. During the 23 summers (June through September) observed, the number of MCS varied considerably, averaging 70 MCS with minimum of 41 and maximum of 94. MCS typically have an average duration of around 8 h +/- with a 2 h standard deviation. Propagation speeds, estimated with Hovmoller diagrams in addition to MCS centroid initial and final position, vary slightly depending on the trajectory. A notable result suggests that MCS propagation speeds are more consistent density currents or cold pools and not gravity waves nor steering-level winds. The results of this study could also provide a dataset for examining larger-scale controls on MCS frequency in addition to assesing convective parameterization and convective-resolving models in regions of complex topography.

We applied a combination of Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) algorithms by segmentation, classification, and thresholding rules to extract the snow, water, vegetation, and non-vegetation land covers. For validation, the Maximum Snow Depths (MSDs) were collected at three local snow observation sites (namely Three Mile Dam, Spencer Creek, and Deep Creek) from 1984 to 2020. Multiple Landsat 5, 7, and 8 imageries extracted daily MSDs. The process was followed by applying an Estimation Scale Parameter (ESP) tool to build the local variance (LV) of object heterogeneity for each satellite scene. By matching the required segmentation parameters, the optimal separation step of the image objects was weighted for each of the image bands and the Digital Elevation Model (DEM). In the classification stage, a few land cover classes were initially assigned, and three different indices-Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI), Surface Water Index (SWI), and a Normalized Differential Snow Index (NDSI)-were created. These indices were used to adjust a few classification thresholds and ruleset functions. The resulting MSDs in all snow observation sites proves noticeable reduction trends during the study period. The SCA classified maps, with an overall accuracy of nearly 0.96, reveal non-significant trends, although with considerable fluctuations over the past 37 years. The variations concentrate in the north and south-east directions, to some extent with a similar pattern each year. Although the long-term changes in SCA are not significant, since 2006, the pattern of maximum values has decreased, with fewer fluctuations in wet and dry episodes. A preliminary analysis of climate drivers' influences on MSD and SCA variability has also been performed. A dynamic indexing OBIA indicated that continuous processing of satellite images is an effective method of obtaining accurate spatial-temporal SCA information, which is critical for managing water resources and other geo-environmental investigations.

TI  - Critical Review of the Sentinel Lymph Node Surgery in Malignant Melanoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF DRUGS IN DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Malignant melanoma is one of the most aggressive solid tumors but has low morbidity if treated at an early stage. Over the past decade, the advent of targeted therapy and immunotherapy have productively enriched the treatment options for advanced melanomas and further improved the prognosis. The treatment of melanoma is a rapidly evolving field. In patients with sentinel lymph node (SLN)-positive (SLN+) melanoma, the role of complete lymph node dissection (CLND) is still a matter of debate. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a staging procedure for melanoma that is routinely offered to patients with tumor thickness >= 1 mm or >= 0.8 mm with additional risk factors and is widely accepted as an important diagnostic and prognostic tool, since SLN+ patients can receive adjuvant targeted treatment or immunotherapy. Currently, the role of CLND has largely been replaced by often recommended adjuvant therapies since their approval. This article provides an overview of sentinel lymph-node surgery in cutaneous melanoma.

TI  - Dynamic Harvest Index Estimation of Winter Wheat Based on UAV Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Considering Crop Aboveground Biomass Change and the Grain Filling Process
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The crop harvest index (HI) is of great significance for research on the application of crop variety breeding, crop growth simulation, crop management in precision agriculture and crop yield estimation, among other topics. To obtain spatial information on the crop dynamic HI (D-HI), taking winter wheat as the research object and fully considering the changes in crop biomass and the grain filling process from the flowering period to the maturity period, the dynamic f(G) (D-f(G)) parameter was estimated as the ratio between the aboveground biomass accumulated in different growth periods, from the flowering stage to the maturity stage, and the aboveground biomass in the corresponding periods. Based on the D-f(G) parameter estimation using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) hyperspectral remote sensing data, a technical method for obtaining spatial information on the winter wheat D-HI was proposed and the accuracy of the proposed method was verified. A correlation analysis was performed between the normalized difference spectral index (NDSI), which was calculated using pairs of any two bands of the UAV hyperspectral spectrum, and the measured D-f(G). Based on this correlation analysis, the center of gravity of the local maximum region of R-2 was used to determine the sensitive band center to accurately estimate D-f(G). On this basis, remote sensing estimation of the D-f(G) was realized by using the NDSI constructed by the sensitive hyperspectral band centers. Finally, based on the D-f(G) remote sensing parameters and the D-HI estimation model, spatial information on the D-HI of winter wheat was accurately obtained. The results revealed five pairs of sensitive hyperspectral band centers (i.e., lambda(476 nm, 508 nm), lambda(444 nm, 644 nm), lambda(608 nm, 788 nm), lambda(724 nm, 784 nm) and lambda(816 nm, 908 nm)) for D-f(G) estimation, and the results of the D-f(G) remote sensing estimation showed high precision. The root mean square error (RMSE) was between 0.0436 and 0.0604, the normalized RMSE (NRMSE) was between 10.31% and 14.27% and the mean relative error (MRE) was between 8.28% and 12.55%. In addition, the D-f(G) parameter estimation, using the NDSI constructed by the above five sensitive remote sensing band centers, yielded highly accurate spatial D-HI information with an RMSE between 0.0429 and 0.0546, an NRMSE between 9.87% and 12.57% and an MRE between 8.33% and 10.90%. The D-HI estimation results based on the hyperspectral sensitive band centers lambda(724 nm, 784 nm) had the highest accuracy, with RMSE, NRMSE and MRE values of 0.0429, 9.87% and 8.33%, respectively. The proposed method of acquiring spatial information on the winter wheat D-HI in this study was shown to be feasible, and it might provide a technical reference toward developing satellite-based indices to monitor large-scale crop HI information.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Evolution of the Urban Thermal Environment Effect and Its Influencing Factors: A Case Study of Beijing, China
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization has led to significant changes in land surface temperature (LST), which in turn affect the urban thermal environment effect and the health of residents. Exploring the causes of the urban thermal environment effect will provide guidance for promoting sustainable urban development. The spatiotemporal evolution of the urban thermal environment effect within the sixth ring road of Beijing was analyzed by inversion of remote sensing data to obtain the LST in 2004, 2009, 2014, and 2019. In addition, based on multivariate spatial data, we applied the standard deviation ellipse (SDE), spatial principal component analysis (PCA), and other methods to analyze and identify the relationships between the urban thermal environment effect and its influencing factors. The results show that from 2004 to 2019, the spatial distribution of urban development and LST within the sixth ring road of Beijing were closely related, the heat island area showed a small increasing trend, and differences in the thermal environment effect between different administrative regions in different periods were obvious. The main factors affecting the urban thermal environment effect were urban construction intensity, vegetation and water bodies, socioeconomic activities, and geomorphology. It is noteworthy that human factors had a greater impact than natural factors. Among them, the positive effect of the normalized difference impervious surface index (NDBBI) and the negative effect of the fractional vegetation cover (FVC) were the most prominent. This study provides theoretical support for mitigating the urban thermal environment effect and promoting sustainable urban development.

TI  - Effect of COVID-19 Movement Control Order Policy on Water Quality Changes in Sungai Langat, Selangor, Malaysia within Distinct Land Use Areas
T2  - SAINS MALAYSIANA
M3  - Article
AB  - For the first time in the 21(st) century, many nations have been forced to conduct a lockdown that restricts their industrial, transportation, and social activities to avoid the extensive COVID-19 spread. Therefore, our study aimed to analyze the status of water quality that was measured by suspended particulate matter (SPM) in Sungai Langat, Selangor, Malaysia using the remote sensing technique. The study was concerned with rivers located in distinct land-use areas such as high-density urban, low-density urban, and agricultural areas. The study period included before and after movement control order (MCO) periods that occurred in February 2020 and February 2021, respectively. The SPM levels in each period were calculated using the remote sensing technique through Landsat-8 OLI images then they were analyzed using statistical analysis. The results of the remote sensing technique showed the highest decrease of SPM levels during the MCO period was observed in Sungai Langat within a high-density urban area (34.1%). Then, the SPM levels in all Sungai Langat raised significantly after the MCO period with the highest change at 31.6%. Rainfall and erosion factors had a significant impact on the SPM level through natural processes but the COVID-19 restriction had a direct impact on the SPM level due to the restriction of industrial and social activities. The suspended activities have made the lower emission compared with before the COVID-19 period in 2019.

TI  - How Much of a Pixel Needs to Burn to Be Detected by Satellites? A Spectral Modeling Experiment Based on Ecosystem Data from Yellowstone National Park, USA
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a simple modeling technique based on linear spectral mixture analysis to assess satellite detectability of sub-pixel burned area. Pixel observations are modeled using a linear combination of pure land covers, called endmembers. We executed an experiment using spectral data from Yellowstone National Park, USA. Using endmember samples from spectral libraries, pixel samples were assessed on burn detectability using the widely used differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR). While individual samples yielded differing results for Landsat 8, Sentinel-2, and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the average park-wide detectability of burned area was consistent across satellites. For the commonly used dNBR threshold of 0.15, the results indicated that detectability is reached when around a quarter of a pixel's area is burned. However, a significant percentage of the modeled burned pixels remained undetectable, especially those with low pre-fire vegetation cover. This has consequences for burned area estimates, as smaller fires in sparsely vegetated terrain may remain undetected in moderate resolution burned area products.

TI  - Using Remote Sensing to Estimate Understorey Biomass in Semi-Arid Woodlands of South-Eastern Australia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring ground layer biomass, and therefore forage availability, is important for managing large, vertebrate herbivore populations for conservation. Remote sensing allows for frequent observations over broad spatial scales, capturing changes in biomass over the landscape and through time. In this study, we explored different satellite-derived vegetation indices (VIs) for their utility in estimating understorey biomass in semi-arid woodlands of south-eastern Australia. Relationships between VIs and understorey biomass data have not been established in these particular semi-arid communities. Managers want to use forage availability to inform cull targets for western grey kangaroos (Macropus fuliginosus), to minimise the risk that browsing poses to regeneration in threatened woodland communities when grass biomass is low. We attempted to develop relationships between VIs and understorey biomass data collected over seven seasons across open and wooded vegetation types. Generalised Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) were used to describe relationships between understorey biomass and VIs. Total understorey biomass (live and dead, all growth forms) was best described using the Tasselled Cap (TC) greenness index. The combined TC brightness and Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI) ranked best for live understorey biomass (all growth forms), and grass (live and dead) biomass was best described by a combination of TC brightness and greenness indices. Models performed best for grass biomass, explaining 70% of variation in external validation when predicting to the same sites in a new season. However, we found empirical relationships were not transferrable to data collected from new sites. Including other variables (soil moisture, tree cover, and dominant understorey growth form) improved model performance when predicting to new sites. Anticipating a drop in forage availability is critical for the management of grazing pressure for woodland regeneration, however, predicting understorey biomass through space and time is a challenge. Whilst remotely sensed VIs are promising as an easily-available source of vegetation information, additional landscape-scale data are required before they can be considered a cost-efficient method of understorey biomass estimation in this semi-arid landscape.

TI  - Monitoring Sand Spit Variability Using Sentinel-2 and Google Earth Engine in a Mediterranean Estuary
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estuarine degradation is a major concern worldwide, and is rapidly increasing due to anthropogenic pressures. The Mediterranean Guadiaro estuary, located in San Roque (Cadiz, Spain), is an example of a highly modified estuary, showing severe negative effects of eutrophication episodes and beach erosion. The migration of its river mouth sand spit causes the closure of the estuary, resulting in serious water quality issues and flora and fauna mortality due to the lack of water renewal. With the aim of studying the Guadiaro estuary throughout a 4-year period (2017-2020), the Sentinel-2 A/B twin satellites of the Copernicus programme were used thanks to their 5-day and 10 m temporal and spatial resolution, respectively. Sea-land mapping was performed using the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, selecting cloud-free Sentinel-2 Level 2A images and computing statistics. Results show a closure trend of the Guadiaro river mouth and no clear sand spit seasonal patterns. The study also reveals the potential of both Sentinel-2 and GEE for estuarine monitoring by means of an optimized processing workflow. This improvement will be useful for coastal management to ensure a continuous and detailed monitoring in the area, contributing to the development of early-warning tools, which can be helpful for supporting an ecosystem-based approach to coastal areas.

TI  - The Use of Sentinel-3/OLCI for Monitoring the Water Quality and Optical Water Types in the Largest Portuguese Reservoir
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Alqueva reservoir is essential for water supply in the Alentejo region (south of Portugal). Satellite data are essential to overcome the temporal and spatial limitations of in situ measurements, ensuring continuous and global water quality monitoring. Data between 2017 and 2020, obtained from OLCI (Ocean and Land Color Instrument) aboard Sentinel-3, were explored. Two different methods were used to assess the water quality in the reservoir: K-means to group reflectance spectra into different optical water types (OWT), and empirical algorithms to estimate water quality parameters. Spatial (in five different areas in the reservoir) and temporal (monthly) variations of OWT and water quality parameters were analyzed, namely, Secchi depth, water turbidity, chlorophyll a, and phycocyanin concentrations. One cluster has been identified representing the typical spectra of the presence of microalgae in the reservoir, mainly between July and October and more intense in the northern region of the Alqueva reservoir. An OWT type representing the area of the reservoir with the highest transparency and lowest chlorophyll a concentration was defined. The methodology proposed is suitable to continuously monitor the water quality of Alqueva reservoir, constituting a useful contribution to a potential early warning system for identification of critical areas corresponding to cyanobacterial algae blooms.

TI  - Beyond Lassa Fever: Systemic and structural barriers to disease detection and response in Sierra Leone
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Author summaryLassa fever (LF) often presents clinically as undifferentiated febrile illness. Lassa Fever cases in Sierra Leone have been falling since the 2014-2016 Ebola epidemic. Data from other LF-endemic countries suggest the drop in case numbers reflects reduced health seeking behaviour or issues within the surveillance, response and health systems. In Sierra Leone, many other diseases present with a similar early clinical picture, including COVID-19, meaning that findings from a case study of LF have wider applicability. There are no recent empirical studies of the functionality of Sierra Leone's disease surveillance and response system. Qualitative analysis of policy documents and primary data collected from within the health system identified multiple challenges including: issues with the LF case definition, approaches to differential diagnosis, specimen transport and the provision of results, and ownership of laboratory data. These issues lead to delays in diagnosis, and potentially worse outcomes for individual patients, as well as affecting the system's ability to respond to outbreak-prone disease.BackgroundLassa fever (LF) often presents clinically as undifferentiated febrile illness. Lassa Fever cases in Sierra Leone have been falling since the 2014-2016 Ebola epidemic. Data from other LF endemic countries suggest that this is not a true reflection of local epidemiological decline, but rather a function of either health seeking behaviour or the health/referral system. In Sierra Leone, many other diseases present with a similar early clinical picture, including COVID-19 and Marburg Disease (which has recently emerged in neighbouring Guinea). This empirical study explores the implementation of health system processes associated with International Health Regulations (IHR) requirements for early detection and timely and effective responses to the spread of febrile disease, through the case study of LF in Sierra Leone. Methodology/Principal findingsThis study used a qualitative approach to analyse local policy and guidance documents, key informant interviews with policy and practice actors, and focus group discussions and in-depth interviews with health care workers (HCWs) and community health workers (CHWs) in Kenema District to examine the ways in which undifferentiated fever surveillance and response policies and processes were implemented in the post-Ebola period. Multiple challenges were identified, including: issues with the LF case definition, approaches to differential diagnosis, specimen transport and the provision of results, and ownership of laboratory data. These issues lead to delays in diagnosis, and potentially worse outcomes for individual patients, as well as affecting the system's ability to respond to outbreak-prone disease. Conclusions/SignificanceIdentification of ways to improve the system requires balancing vertical disease surveillance programmes against other population health needs. Therefore, health system challenges to early identification of LF specifically have implications for the effectiveness of the wider Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) system in Sierra Leone more generally. Sentinel surveillance or improved surveillance at maternity facilities would help improve viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF) surveillance, as well as knowledge of LF epidemiology. Strengthening surveillance for vertical disease programmes, if correctly targeted, could have downstream benefits for COVID-19 surveillance and response as well as the wider health system-and therefore patient outcomes more generally.

TI  - Recognition of the Bare Soil Using Deep Machine Learning Methods to Create Maps of Arable Soil Degradation Based on the Analysis of Multi-Temporal Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The detection of degraded soil distribution areas is an urgent task. It is difficult and very time consuming to solve this problem using ground methods. The modeling of degradation processes based on digital elevation models makes it possible to construct maps of potential degradation, which may differ from the actual spatial distribution of degradation. The use of remote sensing data (RSD) for soil degradation detection is very widespread. Most often, vegetation indices (indicative botany) have been used for this purpose. In this paper, we propose a method for constructing soil maps based on a multi-temporal analysis of the bare soil surface (BSS). It is an alternative method to the use of vegetation indices. The detection of the bare soil surface was carried out using the spectral neighborhood of the soil line (SNSL) technology. For the automatic recognition of BSS on each RSD image, computer vision based on deep machine learning (neural networks) was used. A dataset of 244 BSS distribution masks on 244 Landsat 4, 5, 7, and 8 scenes over 37 years was developed. Half of the dataset was used as a training sample (Landsat path/row 173/028). The other half was used as a test sample (Landsat path/row 174/027). Binary masks were sufficient for recognition. For each RSD pixel, value "1" was set when determining the BSS. In the absence of BSS, value "0" was set. The accuracy of the machine prediction of the presence of BSS was 75%. The detection of degradation was based on the average long-term spectral characteristics of the RED and NIR bands. The coefficient C-mean, which is the distance of the point with the average long-term values of RED and NIR from the origin of the spectral plane RED/NIR, was calculated as an integral characteristic of the mean long-term values. Higher long-term average values of spectral brightness served as indicators of the spread of soil degradation. To test the method of constructing soil degradation maps based on deep machine learning, an acceptance sample of 133 Landsat scenes of path/row 173/026 was used. On the territory of the acceptance sample, ground verifications of the maps of the coefficient C-mean were carried out. Ground verification showed that the values of this coefficient make it possible to estimate the content of organic matter in the plow horizon (R-2 = 0.841) and the thickness of the humus horizon (R-2 = 0.8599). In total, 80 soil pits were analyzed on an area of 649 ha on eight agricultural fields. Type I error (false positive) of degradation detection was 17.5%, and type II error (false negative) was 2.5%. During the determination of the presence of degradation by ground methods, 90% of the ground data coincided with the detection of degradation from RSD. Thus, the quality of machine learning for BSS recognition is sufficient for the construction of soil degradation maps. The SNSL technology allows us to create maps of soil degradation based on the long-term average spectral characteristics of the BSS.

TI  - Optimum Feature and Classifier Selection for Accurate Urban Land Use/Cover Mapping from Very High Resolution Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Feature selection to reduce redundancies for efficient classification is necessary but usually time consuming and challenging. This paper proposed a comprehensive analysis for optimum feature selection and the most efficient classifier for accurate urban area mapping. To this end, 136 multiscale textural features alongside a panchromatic band were initially extracted from WorldView-2, GeoEye-3, and QuickBird satellite images. The wrapper-based and filter-based feature selection were implemented to optimally select the best ten percent of the primary features from the initial feature set. Then, machine leaning algorithms such as artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF) classifiers were utilized to evaluate the efficiency of these selected features and select the most efficient classifier. The achieved optimum feature set was validated using two other images of WorldView-3 and Pleiades. The experiments revealed that RF, particle swarm optimization (PSO), and neighborhood component analysis (NCA) resulted in the most efficient classifier and wrapper-based and filter-based methods, respectively. While ANN and SVM's process time depended on the number of input features, RF was significantly resistant to the criterion. Dissimilarity, contrast, and correlation features played the greatest contributing role in the classification performance among the textural features used in this study. These trials showed that the feature number could be reduced optimally to 14 from 137; these optimally selected features, alongside the RF classifier, can produce an F1-measure of about 0.90 for different images from five very high resolution satellite sensors for various urban geographical landscapes. These results successfully achieve our goal of assisting users by eliminating the task of optimal feature selection and classifier, thereby increasing the efficiency of urban land use/cover classification from very high resolution images. This optimal feature selection can also significantly reduce the high computational load of the feature-engineering phase in the machine and deep learning approaches.

TI  - Impacts of 2020 Beirut Explosion on Port Infrastructure and Nearby Buildings
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - At 18:08 on August 4, 2020, a large explosion occurred at Hangar 12 in the Port of Beirut. The size of the explosion was equivalent to that of an earthquake with a local magnitude (M-L) of 3.3 according to the USGS. As one of the largest nonmilitary explosions to ever impact an urban region, this event provides unprecedented opportunities to document explosion impacts on urban infrastructure. To facilitate this data collection, the Geotechnical Extreme Events Reconnaissance (GEER) Association coordinated a multiagency response directed toward the collection of perishable data of engineering interest. Two main categories of infrastructure systems were impacted: the Port of Beirut and the Beirut building stock. Within the Port, the explosion triggered a quay wall failure and flow slide, and strongly impacted grain silo structures that were in close proximity to Hangar 12. Within the city, historical masonry structures, older reinforced concrete structures, and modern high-rise structures were impacted. Through a combination of in-person inspections and street-view surveys, we collected data on structural performance (including damage to load-bearing elements) and building facades. Performance levels were classified according to procedures applied following earthquakes (for structural performance) and newly proposed procedures (for facades). We describe spatial distributions of these damage types and dependencies on source distance and location-to-explosion direction. We demonstrate that physical damages correlated with damage proxy maps produced by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Earth Observatory of Singapore based on Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellite synthetic aperture radar data, with a stronger correlation with structural damage than with facade damage.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Assessment of Thunderstorms' Effects on Wildfire in Australia in 2017-2020 Using Data from the ISS LIS and MODIS Space-Based Observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of thunderstorms on the wildfire situation in Australia in 2017-2020 was investigated using data from the ISS LIS and MODIS space-based observations. To determine lightning-caused wildfires, a Geographic Information System (GIS) method was carried out, which consisted of a combined investigation of the spatial and temporal distributions of strikes and ignition hotspots. The seasonal variability of thunderstorms and wildfire activity was analyzed. It was established that the maximum seasonal distribution of thunderstorm activity does not coincide with wildfire activity. The interannual changes in strikes were recorded, but this was not revealed for the major vegetation types. Of 120,829 flashes, recorded by the ISS LIS sensor, only 23 flashes could be characterized as lightning-caused wildfire events, i.e., the frequency of lightning ignition was equal to 0.00023 fires/stroke. The lightning ignitions usually took place along the boundary of a thunderstorm, in semiarid areas covered by open scrublands. During the dry Australian period (April-September), very few lightning events were detected by the ISS LIS sensor, while fire activity was quite high. Additionally, it was concluded that the impact of thunderstorms on the fire situation is too small to explain the numerous wildfires during the wet period.

TI  - Impact of Space Environment on Geostationary Meteorological Satellite Data Outage
T2  - SPACE WEATHER-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Impact of space environment changes on geostationary meteorological satellite services, such as data outage, incomplete imagery, or quality degradation were investigated using event logs of Himawari-8 and Meteosat (MET-7 and MET-8) in 2015-2017. The event logs show that such failures were caused by anomalies on spacecraft and in ground system half each. On Himawari-8, a total of 11 incomplete imagery occurred due to spacecraft anomaly, and among them about 45% (5 anomalies) occurred during energetic electron enhancement and about 9% (1 anomaly) occurred during energetic proton enhancement. In cases of Meteosat, a total of 84 service alerts occurred due to spacecraft anomaly, and among them 35% (29 anomalies) occurred during electron enhancement and 7% (6 anomalies) occurred during both proton and electron enhancement. On the basis of statistical analysis, it is found that the probability of spacecraft anomaly occurrence markedly increases when electron fluence exceeds a threshold. The probability of anomaly is less than 10% when the 1-MeV electron fluence is less than 10(4) (/cm(2) sr eV), whereas it increases to more than 20% above the fluence. Thresholds are also found for electron fluences at other energies from 200 keV to 1.5 MeV. This study clarifies that changes in the space environment, particularly electron fluence enhancement affect geostationary meteorological satellite services.

TI  - GIS-Based Modeling for Vegetated Land Fire Prediction in Qaradagh Area, Kurdistan Region, Iraq
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to estimate the susceptibility of fire occurrence in the Qaradagh area of the Iraqi Kurdistan Region, by examining 16 predictive factors. We selected these predictive factors, dependent on analyzing and performing a comprehensive review of about 57 papers related to fire susceptibility. These papers investigate areas with similar environmental conditions to the arid environments as our study area. The 16 factors affecting the fire occurrence are Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), slope gradient, slope aspect, elevation, Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), Topographic Position Index (TPI), distance to roads, distance to rivers, distance to villages, distance to farmland, geology, wind speed, relative humidity, annual temperature, annual precipitation, and Land Use and Land Cover (LULC). To extract fires that occurred between 2015 and 2020, 121 scenes of satellite images (most of them are scenes of Sentinel-2) were used, with the aid of a field survey. In total, 80% of the data (185,394 pixels) were used for the training dataset in the model, and 20% of the data (46,348 pixels) were used for the validation dataset. Conversely, 20% of these data were used for the training dataset in the model, and 80% of the data were used for the validation dataset to check the model's overfitting. We used the logistic regression model to analyze the multi-data sites obtained from the 16 predictive factors, to predict the forest and vegetated lands that suffer from fire. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the curve (AUC) were used to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed models. The AUC value is more than 84.85% in all groups, which shows very high accuracy for both the model and the factors selected for preparing fire zoning maps in the studied area. According to the factor weight results, classes of LULC and wind speed gained the highest weight among all groups. This paper emphasizes that the used approach is useful for monitoring shrubland, grassland, and cropland fires in other similar areas, which are located in the Mediterranean climate zone. Besides, the model can be applied in other regions, taking the local influencing factors into consideration, which contribute to forest fire mitigation and prevention planning. Hence, the mentioned results can be applied to primary warning, fire suppression resource planning, and allocation work. The mentioned results can be used as prior warnings of the outbreak of fires, taking the necessary measures and methods to prevent and extinguish fires.

TI  - Retrieving Mediterranean Sea Surface Salinity Distribution and Interannual Trends from Multi-Sensor Satellite and In Situ Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea surface salinity (SSS) is one of the Essential Climate Variables (ECVs), defined by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS). Salinity is modified by river discharge, land run-off, precipitation, and evaporation, and it is advected by oceanic currents. In turn, ocean circulation, the water cycle, and biogeochemistry are deeply impacted by salinity variations. The Mediterranean Sea represents a hot spot for the variability of salinity. Despite the ever-increasing number of moorings and floating buoys, in situ SSS estimates have low coverage, hindering the monitoring of SSS patterns. Conversely, satellite sensors provide SSS surface data at high spatial and temporal resolution, complementing the sparseness of in situ datasets. Here, we describe a multidimensional optimal interpolation algorithm, specifically configured to provide a new daily SSS dataset at 1/16 degrees grid resolution, covering the entire Mediterranean Sea (Med L4 SSS). The main improvements in this regional algorithm are: the ingestion of satellite SSS estimates from multiple satellite missions (NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), ESA's Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellites), and a new background (first guess), specifically built to improve coastal reconstructions. The multi-sensor Med L4 SSS fields have been validated against independent in situ SSS samples, collected between 2010-2020. They have also been compared with global weekly Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) and Barcelona Expert Centre (BEC) regional products, showing an improved performance. Power spectral density analyses demonstrated that the Med L4 SSS field achieves the highest effective spatial resolution, among all the datasets analysed. Even if the time series is relatively short, a clear interannual trend is found, leading to a marked salinification, mostly occurring in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea.

TI  - The Importance of Agronomic Knowledge for Crop Detection by Sentinel-2 in the CAP Controls Framework: A Possible Rule-Based Classification Approach
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Farmers are supported by European Union (EU) through contributions related to the common agricultural policy (CAP). To obtain grants, farmers have to apply every year according to the national/regional procedure that, presently, relies on the Geo-Spatial Aid Application (GSAA). To ensure the properness of applications, national/regional payment agencies (PA) operate random controls through in-field surveys. EU regulation n. 809/2014 has introduced a new approach to CAP controls based on Copernicus Sentinel-2 (S2) data. These are expected to better address PA checks on the field, suggesting eventual inconsistencies between satellite-based deductions and farmers' declarations. Within this framework, this work proposed a hierarchical (HI) approach to the classification of crops (soya, corn, wheat, rice, and meadow) explicitly aimed at supporting CAP controls in agriculture, with special concerns about the Piemonte Region (NW Italy) agricultural situation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a comparison is made between HI and other, more ordinary approaches. In particular, two algorithms were considered as references: the minimum distance (MD) and the random forest (RF). Tests were operated in a study area located in the southern part of the Vercelli province (Piemonte), which is mainly devoted to agriculture. Training and validation steps were performed for all the classification approaches (HI, MD, RF) using the same ground data. MD and RF were based on S2-derived NDVI image time series (TS) for the 2020 year. Differently, HI was built according to a rule-based approach developing according to the following steps: (a) TS standard deviation analysis in the time domain for meadows mapping; (b) MD classification of winter part of TS in the time domain for wheat detection; (c) MD classification of summer part of TS in the time domain for corn classification; (d) selection of a proper summer multi-spectral image (SMSI) useful for separating rice from soya with MD operated in the spectral domain. To separate crops of interest from other classes, MD-based classifications belonging to HI were thresholded by Otsu's method. Overall accuracy for MD, RF, and HI were found to be 63%, 80%, and 89%, respectively. It is worth remarking that thanks to the SMSI-based approach of HI, a significant improvement was obtained in soya and rice classification.

M3  - Article
M3  - Publication with Expression of Concern
AB  - Urgent water and food security challenges, particularly in continental and boreal regions, need to be addressed by initiatives such as the Horizon 2020-funded project WATer retention and nutrient recycling in soils and streams for improved AGRIcultural production (WATERAGRI). A new methodological framework for the sustainable management of various solutions resilient to climate change has been developed. The results indicate that the effect of the climate scenario is significantly different for peatlands and constructed wetlands. The findings also highlight that remote-sensing-based yield prediction models developed from vegetation indices have the potential to provide quantitative and timely information on crops for large regions or even at the local farm scale. Verification of remotely sensed data is one of the prerequisites for the proper utilization and understanding of data. Research shows that current serious game applications fall short due to challenges such as not clarifying the decision problem, the lack of use of decision quality indicators and limited use of gaming. Overall, WATERAGRI solutions improve water and food security by adapting agriculture to climate change, recycling nutrients and providing educational tools to the farming community. Farmers in small agricultural catchments benefit directly from WATERAGRI, but over the long-term, the general public does as well.

TI  - Same Same but Different? A Quantitative Exploration of Voluntary Sustainability Standards in Agriculture
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Private governance by means of voluntary sustainability standards (VSS) has become ubiquitous, especially for the governance of sustainability issues along global value chains in agriculture. As VSS have multiplied and proliferated, their commonalities and differences are not always easily discernable to value chain participants and their stakeholders. Concurrently, extant research is ambiguous on the degree of harmonization or diversification of standards currently available. Two core aspects have received particular attention: the meaning of sustainability reflected in VSS and the degree of stakeholder inclusion in standard governance. It is the purpose of this study to compare VSS from different types of standard setting initiatives regarding these two core aspects by analyzing their purported sustainability worldview and the inclusiveness of their institutional design. The quantitative exploration covers exemplars offered by inter-governmental organizations, business initiatives, non-governmental organizations as well as multi-stakeholder initiatives. The analysis finds significant ambiguity of sustainability worldviews across the sample, as well as almost universal uptake of design characteristics to enhance inclusiveness irrespective of the type of standard setting initiative. However, there are also significant differences in the way sustainability is understood among VSS offered by different standard setting initiatives.

TI  - Blood Feeding Patterns of <i>Aedes aegypti</i> Populations in Senegal
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aedes aegypti plays an important role in the transmission of several arboviruses of medical importance. The availability of information on the blood-feeding preferences of mosquito vectors is a critical step in the understanding of the transmission of human pathogens and implementation of control strategies. In Senegal, no data currently exist on the feeding pattern of Ae. aegypti in urban areas. To fill this gap, Ae. aegypti blood-fed females were collected in five localities by aspiration and using BG Sentinel 2 traps. Collections were carried out monthly between July and November 2019 inside and outside human dwellings. The origin of the blood meal of Ae. aegypti females were identified by an ELISA technique. A total of 1,710 blood-engorged females were examined and showed that Ae. aegypti preferentially fed on human with 78.6% of the identified blood meals. The other blood meals were from animals including dog, cat, horse, cattle, sheep, and rat. This is the first report on the feeding behavior of Ae. aegypti in urban settings in West Africa. It demonstrated that this species is highly anthropophilic.

TI  - The artistic concept of "The Past" in the foreign prose of I.A. Bunin
T2  - FILOLOGICHESKIE NAUKI-NAUCHNYE DOKLADY VYSSHEI SHKOLY-PHILOLOGICAL SCIENCES-SCIENTIFIC ESSAYS OF HIGHER EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the consideration of the peculiarities of the verbalization of the artistic concept "Old days" in the works of I.A. Bunin of the 1920s-40s. A concept is a verbalized mental formation universal for a given language, realized by a language personality as an invariant value of an associative-semantic field. The artistic concept in the work can be considered both as the embodiment of the foundations of the author's worldview, and as the starting point of the dynamic formation of the text, and as the semantic center of this text. This aesthetic mental construct performs 4 main functions: text-forming, plot-forming, meaning-forming and actually figurative. An example of such a phenomenon is the artistic concept "past" in the prose of I. Bunin of the foreign period of his work. The artistic concept of the "past", unequal to the concept of the "past", is demonstrated as an example of a typical individual author's concept in the artistic picture of the writer's world. It is argued that the artistic concept and the universal concept are two varieties of the concept that have specific features. The content of the "past" is often associated with meanings not only temporal, but also ideological, local, and valuable, and the concept can be represented not only by individual lexemes and word combinations, but also by expanded explicants-sentences and microcontexts, which is characteristic of the artistic concept. The conclusions made by the author demonstrate the significance of the analysis of the artistic concept "Old days" not only for understanding the artistic picture of the world of the late I. Bunin, but also for artistic conceptology in general. The results of the study can be applied to the analysis of the representation of artistic concepts in a literary text.

TI  - Impact of the Dates of Input Image Pairs on Spatio-Temporal Fusion for Time Series with Different Temporal Variation Patterns
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Dense time series of remote sensing images with high spatio-temporal resolution are critical for monitoring land surface dynamics in heterogeneous landscapes. Spatio-temporal fusion is an effective solution to obtaining such time series images. Many spatio-temporal fusion methods have been developed for producing high spatial resolution images at frequent intervals by blending fine spatial images and coarse spatial resolution images. Previous studies have revealed that the accuracy of fused images depends not only on the fusion algorithm, but also on the input image pairs being used. However, the impact of input images dates on the fusion accuracy for time series with different temporal variation patterns remains unknown. In this paper, the impact of input image pairs on the fusion accuracy for monotonic linear change (MLC), monotonic non-linear change (MNLC), and non-monotonic change (NMC) time periods were evaluated, respectively, and the optimal selection strategies of input image dates for different situations were proposed. The 16-day composited NDVI time series (i.e., Collection 6 MODIS NDVI product) were used to present the temporal variation patterns of land surfaces in the study areas. To obtain sufficient observation dates to evaluate the impact of input image pairs on the spatio-temporal fusion accuracy, we utilized the Harmonized Landsat-8 Sentinel-2 (HLS) data. The ESTARFM was selected as the spatio-temporal fusion method for this study. The results show that the impact of input image date on the accuracy of spatio-temporal fusion varies with the temporal variation patterns of the time periods being fused. For the MLC period, the fusion accuracy at the prediction date (PD) is linearly correlated to the time interval between the change date (CD) of the input image and the PD, but the impact of the input image date on the fusion accuracy at the PD is not very significant. For the MNLC period, the fusion accuracy at the PD is non-linearly correlated to the time interval between the CD and the PD, the impact of the time interval between the CD and the PD on the fusion accuracy is more significant for the MNLC than for the MLC periods. Given the similar change of time intervals between the CD and the PD, the increments of R-2 of fusion result for the MNLC is over ten times larger than those for the MLC. For the NMC period, a shorter time interval between the CD and the PD does not lead to higher fusion accuracies. On the contrary, it may lower the fusion accuracy. This study suggests that temporal variation patterns of the data must be taken into account when selecting optimal dates of input images in the fusion model.

TI  - Monitoring and Predicting the Subsidence of Dalian Jinzhou Bay International Airport, China by Integrating InSAR Observation and Terzaghi Consolidation Theory
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Dalian Jinzhou Bay International Airport (DJBIA) is an offshore artificial island airport, where the reclaimed land is prone to uneven land subsidence due to filling consolidation and construction. Monitoring and predicting the subsidence are essential to assist the subsequent subsidence control and ensure the operational safety of DJBIA. However, the accurate monitoring and prediction of reclaimed subsidence for such a wide area under construction are hard and challenging. This paper utilized the Small Baseline Subset Synthetic Aperture Radar (SBAS-InSAR) technology based on Sentinel-1 images from 2017 to 2021 to obtain the subsidence over the land reclamation area of the DJBIA, in which the results from ascending and descending orbit data were compared to verify the reliability of the results. The SBAS-InSAR results reveal that uneven subsidence is continuously occurring, especially on the runway, terminal, and building area of the airport, with the maximum subsidence rate exceeding 100 mm/year. It was found that there is a strong correlation between the subsidence rate and backfilling time. This study provides important information on the reclaimed subsidence for DJBIA and demonstrates a novel method for reclaimed subsidence monitoring and prediction by integrating the advanced InSAR technology and Terzaghi Consolidation Theory modeling. Moreover, based on the Terzaghi consolidation theory and the corresponding geological parameters of the airport, predicted subsidence curves in this area are derived. The comparison between predicted curves and the actual subsidence revealed by InSAR in 2017-2021 is highly consistent, with a similar trend and falling in a range of +/- 25 mm/year, which verifies that the subsidence in this area conforms to Terzaghi Consolidation Theory. Therefore, it can be predicted that in the future, the subsidence rate of the new reclamation area in this region will reach about 80 mm/year +/- 25 mm/year, and the subsidence rate will gradually slow down with the accumulation of reclamation time. The subsidence rate will slow down to about 30 mm/year +/- 25 mm/year after 10 years.

TI  - Sentinel-1 SAR Backscatter Response to Agricultural Drought in The Netherlands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a major natural hazard that impacts agriculture, the environment, and socio-economic conditions. In 2018 and 2019, Europe experienced a severe drought due to below average precipitation and high temperatures. Drought stress affects the moisture content and structure of agricultural crops and can result in lower yields. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) observations are sensitive to the dielectric and geometric characteristics of crops and underlying soils. This study uses data from ESA's Sentinel-1 SAR satellite to investigate the influence of drought stress on major arable crops of the Netherlands, its regional variability and the impact of water management decisions on crop development. Sentinel-1 VV, VH and VH/VV backscatter data are used to quantify the variability in the spatio-temporal dynamics of agricultural crop parcels in response to drought. Results show that VV and VH backscatter values are 1 to 2 dB lower for crop parcels during the 2018 drought compared to values in 2017. In addition, the growth season indicated by the cross-ratio (CR, VH/VV) for maize and onion is shorter during the drought year. Differences due to irrigation restrictions are observed in backscatter response from maize parcels. Lower CR values in 2019 indicate the impact of drought on the start of the growing season. Results demonstrate that Sentinel-1 can detect changes in the seasonal cycle of arable crops in response to agricultural drought.

TI  - The Seasonality of Surface Urban Heat Islands across Climates
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, we investigate how the seasonal hysteresis of the Surface Urban Heat Island Intensity (SUHII) differs across climates and provide a detailed typology of the daytime and nighttime SUHII hysteresis loops. Instead of the typical tropical/dry/temperate/continental grouping, we describe Earth's climate using the Koppen-Geiger system that empirically maps Earth's biome distribution into 30 climate classes. Our thesis is that aggregating multi-city data without considering the biome of each city results in temporal means that fail to reflect the actual SUHII characteristics. This is because the SUHII is a function of both urban and rural features and the phenology of the rural surroundings can differ considerably between cities, even in the same climate zone. Our investigation covers all the densely populated areas of Earth and uses 18 years (2000-2018) of land surface temperature and land cover data from the European Space Agency's Climate Change Initiative. Our findings show that, in addition to concave-up and -down shapes, the seasonal hysteresis of the SUHII also exhibits twisted, flat, and triangle-like patterns. They also suggest that, in wet climates, the daytime SUHII hysteresis is almost universally concave-up, but they paint a more complex picture for cities in dry climates.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Surface Water Dynamics in the Context of Global Change-A Review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Inland surface water is often the most accessible freshwater source. As opposed to groundwater, surface water is replenished in a comparatively quick cycle, which makes this vital resource-if not overexploited-sustainable. From a global perspective, freshwater is plentiful. Still, depending on the region, surface water availability is severely limited. Additionally, climate change and human interventions act as large-scale drivers and cause dramatic changes in established surface water dynamics. Actions have to be taken to secure sustainable water availability and usage. This requires informed decision making based on reliable environmental data. Monitoring inland surface water dynamics is therefore more important than ever. Remote sensing is able to delineate surface water in a number of ways by using optical as well as active and passive microwave sensors. In this review, we look at the proceedings within this discipline by reviewing 233 scientific works. We provide an extensive overview of used sensors, the spatial and temporal resolution of studies, their thematic foci, and their spatial distribution. We observe that a wide array of available sensors and datasets, along with increasing computing capacities, have shaped the field over the last years. Multiple global analysis-ready products are available for investigating surface water area dynamics, but so far none offer high spatial and temporal resolution.

TI  - Village-level landscape succession and its driving mechanism in the agro-pastoral ecotone of Ningxia, China
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - The relationship between human activities and landscape patterns and its regulation are one of the core fields in landscape ecology. The ecological conditions and local cultures of agro-pastoral ecotone are gradually weakening due to environmental fluctuations, land-use characteristics (suitable for both farming and grazing) , and unstable policy. Therefore, protecting and restoring this semi-natural landscape and the resulting biological, ecological and cultural functions are becoming increasingly urgent. Here , by combing remote sensing data with interview survey and geographic investigation, we characterized the landscape changes (1964 to 2019) of Wanjigou Village in Yanchi County of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region , which lay within the agro-pastoral ecotone. We further explored the rules of landscape succession and the underlying natural and social mechanism, as well as the interactions between landscape types. Results showed that Wanjigou Village had been subjected to a succession from the landscape characterized by grassland , arable land and sandy land to that characterized by grassland , shrub land , sandy land and arable land. The change from the competition of landscape function separation to the preliminary integration had formed a definite succession path for grassland-arable land-sandy land-shrub land. The main driving factors were a synthesis of policy, human needs, and environment. Policy often promoted landscape change through large-scale and intensified human activities, while environment promoted landscape succession through internal driving force of ecosystem toward a mutual adaption between landscape and the innate conditions. The driving factors of landscape succession were soil moisture variations caused by the change of soil physical structure, and vegetation change in adapting to new environment. In agro-pastoral ecotone with low resource density , the separation of landscape functions was one of the main reasons for land desertification. The integration and coordination of landscape functions greatly alleviated the situation of ecological deterioration. The critical path to maintain sustainable development of agro-pastoral ecotone was to achieve complementation among landscape types and even integrating with external resources by transforming landscape separation competition into landscape symbiosis.

TI  - Using a Vegetation Index-Based Mixture Model to Estimate Fractional Vegetation Cover Products by Jointly Using Multiple Satellite Data: Method and Feasibility Analysis
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing fractional vegetation cover (FVC) requires both finer-resolution and high-frequency in climate and ecosystem research. The increasing availability of finer-resolution (<= 30 m) remote sensing data makes this possible. However, data from different satellites have large differences in spatial resolution, spectral response function, and so on, making joint use difficult. Herein, we showed that the vegetation index (VI)-based mixture model with the appropriate VI values of pure vegetation (V-v) and bare soil (V-s) from the MODIS BRDF product via the multi-angle VI method (MultiVI) was feasible to estimate FVC with multiple satellite data. Analyses of the spatial resolution and spectral response function differences for MODIS and other satellites including Landsat 8, Chinese GF 1, and ZY 3 predicted that (1) the effect of V-v and V-s downscaling on FVC estimation uncertainty varied from satellite to satellite due to the positioning differences, and (2) after spectral normalization, the uncertainty (RMSDs) for FVC estimation decreased by similar to 2.6% compared with the results without spectral normalization. FVC estimation across multiple satellite data will help to improve the spatiotemporal resolution of FVC products, which is an important development for numerous biophysical applications. Herein, we proved that the VI-based mixture model with V-v and V-s from MultiVI is a strong candidate.

TI  - Vector Surveillance and Pathogen Detection in the Working Areas of Military Working Dogs in Eastern Austria
T2  - PATHOGENS
M3  - Article
AB  - Vector-borne diseases play a major role in human and veterinary medicine worldwide. A previous study detected asymptomatic vector-borne pathogens in military working dogs stationed at a military base in eastern Austria, and a follow-up survey of potential arthropod vectors was conducted in spring 2019 and 2020 in the vicinity of the base to evaluate the presence of vectors and their carrier status for a range of canine and zoonotic pathogens. A total of 1324 ticks (nymphs and adults of Ixodes ricinus, comprising 92.9% of the collected specimens, and adults of Haemaphysalis inermis, a tick previously only rarely described in Austria, Haemaphysalis concinna, and Dermacentor reticulatus) were collected by flagging. In 44.1% (125/284) of all pools (n = 284), one infectious agent was found; in 27.8% (79/284) and in 1.1% (3/284), two and three different agents, respectively, could be identified. Overall, 72.9% of the pools contained at least one pathogen (Borrelia spp., Rickettsia spp., Bartonella spp., and Babesia microti). Borrelia mijamotoi, B. lustinaniae, and B. microti were previously only described in single cases in Austria. Mosquitoes were collected with BG-Sentinel traps monthly during the summer of 2019. A total of 71 individuals from 11 species were collected. No filarioid DNA was detected in the mosquito sample pools, although Dirofilaria repens had been present in the dogs from the military site. In conclusion, vector surveillance should be combined with the surveillance of an exposed population whenever possible to estimate the infection risks for dogs and their handlers.

TI  - A Deep Learning Approach for Meter-Scale Air Quality Estimation in Urban Environments Using Very High-Spatial-Resolution Satellite Imagery
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - High-spatial-resolution air quality (AQ) mapping is important for identifying pollution sources to facilitate local action. Some of the most populated cities in the world are not equipped with the infrastructure required to monitor AQ levels on the ground and must rely on other sources, such as satellite derived estimates, to monitor AQ. Current satellite-data-based models provide AQ mapping on a kilometer scale at best. In this study, we focus on producing hundred-meter-scale AQ maps for urban environments in developed cities. We examined the feasibility of an image-based object-detection analysis approach using very high-spatial-resolution (2.5 m) commercial satellite imagery. We fed the satellite imagery to a deep neural network (DNN) to learn the association between visual urban features and air pollutants. The developed model, which solely uses satellite imagery, was tested and evaluated using both ground monitoring observations and land-use regression modeled PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations over London, Vancouver (BC), Los Angeles, and New York City. The results demonstrate a low error with a total RMSE < 2 mu g/m(3) and highlight the contribution of specific urban features, such as green areas and roads, to continuous hundred-meter-scale AQ estimations. This approach offers promise for scaling to global applications in developed and developing urban environments. Further analysis on domain transferability will enable application of a parsimonious model based merely on satellite images to create hundred-meter-scale AQ maps in developing cities, where current and historical ground data are limited.

TI  - Marked non-compliance with deforestation embargoes in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Advances in monitoring capacity and strengthened law enforcement have helped to reduce deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon since the early 2000s. Embargoes imposed on the use of deforested land are important instruments for deterring deforestation and enabling forest recovery. However, the extent to which landowners respect embargoes in the Brazilian Amazon is unknown. In this study, we evaluated the current recovery status of embargoes due to deforestation imposed between 2008 and 2017 to conduct the first large-scale assessment of compliance with embargo regulations. We observed forest recovery in only 13.1% (+/- 1.1%) of embargoed polygons, while agriculture and pasture activities were maintained in 86.9% (+/- 1.8%) of embargoed polygons. Thus, landowners openly continue to disrespect environmental legislation in the majority of embargoed areas. We attribute the marked non-compliance observed to limited monitoring of embargoed areas, as environmental agents seldom return to verify the status of embargoed lands after they have been imposed. Recent advances in remote sensing provide low-cost ways to monitor compliance and should form the basis of concerted efforts to ensure that the law is observed and that those responsible for illegal deforestation do not benefit from it.

TI  - Analysis of Environmental and Atmospheric Influences in the Use of SAR and Optical Imagery from Sentinel-1, Landsat-8, and Sentinel-2 in the Operational Monitoring of Reservoir Water Level
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, we aim to evaluate the feasibility and operational limitations of using Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data to monitor water levels in the Poco da Cruz reservoir from September 2016-September 2020, in the semi-arid region of northeast Brazil. To segment water/non-water features, SAR backscattering thresholding was carried out via the graphical interpretation of backscatter coefficient histograms. In addition, surrounding environmental effects on SAR polarization thresholds were investigated by applying wavelet analysis, and the Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 normalized difference water index (NDWI) and modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) were used to compare and discuss the SAR results. The assessment of the observed and estimated water levels showed that (i) SAR accuracy was equivalent to that of NDWI/Landsat-8; (ii) optical image accuracy outperformed SAR image accuracy in inlet branches, where the complexity of water features is higher; and (iii) VV polarization outperformed VH polarization. The results confirm that SAR images can be suitable for operational reservoir monitoring, offering a similar accuracy to that of multispectral indices. SAR threshold variations were strongly correlated to the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the soil moisture variations in the reservoir depletion zone, and the prior precipitation quantities, which can be used as a proxy to predict cross-polarization (VH) and co-polarization (VV) thresholds. Our findings may improve the accuracy of the algorithms designed to automate the extraction of water levels using SAR data, either in isolation or combined with multispectral images.

TI  - Statistical characteristics and mechanisms of mesoscale eddies in the North Indian Ocean
T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The statistical characteristics and mechanisms of mesoscale eddies in the North Indian Ocean are investigated by adopting multi-sensor satellite data from 1993 to 2019. In the Arabian Sea (AS), seasonal variation of eddy characteristics is remarkable, while the intraseasonal variability caused by planetary waves is crucial in the Bay of Bengal (BOB). Seasonal variation of the eddy kinetic energy (EKE) is distinct along the west boundary of AS, especially in the Somali Current region. In the BOB, larger EKE occurs at the northwest basin from March to May, to the east of Sri Lanka from June to September, and along the east coast of India from November to December. The wind stress work (WW) is further studied to figure out the direct influence of wind forcing on EKE. The WW exerts positive effects on EKE along the west boundary of AS and in the south of India/Sri Lanka during the two monsoon seasons. Besides, the WW also has impact on EKE along the east coast of India in November and December. Eventually, we investigate the characteristics and the driving mechanisms of long lifespan eddies. In the AS, long lifespan anti-cyclonic eddies (AEs) mainly generate in the Socotra, the West Indian Coastal Current and the East Arabian Current regions, while cyclonic eddies (CEs) are concentrated in the northwest region. In the BOB, long lifespan AEs mostly form near the west of Myanmar, while CEs are accumulated at the north and northwest basin. The instabilities caused by Rossby waves, coastal Kelvin waves, seasonal currents, together with wind stress forcing exert enormous efforts on the generation and evolution of these eddies.

TI  - Sampling Method and Accuracy of Pixel-Scale Surface Reflectance at Dunhuang Site
T2  - LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - A large number of experiments are conducted at Dunhuang national radiometric correction field every year to provide calibration services for earth-observation satellites at home and abroad. However, over several years, there are only few studies regarding the accuracy of the ground spectral sampling scheme when Dunhuang field obtains pixel-scale surface reflectance. To quantitatively evaluate the accuracy of different ground sampling schemes, the best sampling point locations were determined to obtain the surface reflectance at different pixel scales and realize high-precision and high-efficiency operational measurement of Dunhuang field. The accuracy of surface reflectance sampling methods at different pixel scales was analyzed quantitatively using Dunhuang's high-resolution unmanned aerial vehicle data and 2 m panchromatic data from the GF-1 satellite. Based on the results, a five-point system sampling scheme is suggested to obtain pixel-scale surface reflectance from Landsat by preliminarily calibrating a 2 m quadrat within the 150 m national field in Dunhuang. For the pixel-scale resolution of meteorological satellites, the five-point-simulated annealing sampling scheme is suggested to determine the position of the 2 m quadrat in the newly selected 3 km site. In both the cases, a spectrometer is used to measure the five-point system sampling method in each 2 m quadrat.

TI  - Improving Forecast of Severe Oceanic Mesoscale Convective Systems Using FY-4A Lightning Data Assimilation with WRF-FDDA
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) geostationary satellite carries the Lightning Mapping Imager that measures total lightning rate of convective systems from space at high spatial and temporal resolutions. In this study, the performance of FY-4A lightning data assimilation (LDA) on the forecast of non-typhoon oceanic mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) is investigated by using an LDA method implemented in the Weather Research and Forecasting-Four Dimensional Data Assimilation (WRF-FDDA). With the LDA scheme, three-dimensional graupel mixing ratio fields retrieved from the FY-4A lightning data and the corresponding latent heating rates are assimilated into the Weather Research and Forecasting model via nudging terms. Two oceanic MCS cases over the South China Sea were selected to perform the study. The subjective evaluation results demonstrate that most of the oceanic convective cells missed by the control experiments are recovered in the analysis period by assimilating FY-4A lightning data, due to the promoted updrafts by latent-heat nudging, the more accurate and faster simulations of the cold pools, and the associated gust-fronts at the observed lightning locations. The cold pools and gust-fronts generated during the analysis period helped to maintain the development of the MCSs, and reduced the morphology and displacement errors of the simulations in the short-term forecast periods. The quantitative evaluation indicates that the most effective periods of the LDA for simulation enhancement were at the analysis time and the nowcasting (0-2 h forecast) periods.

TI  - A New Method for Direct Measurement of Land Surface Reflectance With UAV-Based Multispectral Cameras
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - At present, the multispectral remote sensing data obtained by UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle), have been widely used in the quantitative monitoring of agriculture, forest, environment and other fields. However, the existing methods of converting the multispectral remote sensing data into land surface reflectance still have some defects, e. g. relying on reference boards, unable to adapt to varying solar illumination conditions, or the obtained results are inaccurate, etc. so they may affect the quantitative application effect of the remote sensing data. In order to solve this problem, a novel methodology for direct measurement of land surface reflectance with the multispectral camera is proposed in this study. The method has strong adaptability, and it can get accurate land surface reflectance even under the condition of variable illumination. The key problem that needs to be solved is how to use irradiance sensors to obtain accurate solar irradiance in a tilted state. A new method was proposed to separate the direct and scattering irradiance with two or more irradiance sensors oriented towards different directions to achieve this objective. Therefore, the digital numbers (DNs) recorded by the multispectral bands can be converted into accurate reflectance with the measured irradiance results. UAV-based remote sensing images obtained on the different dates under different illumination conditions were used to validate the actual effect through the validation scheme designed in this study. The experimental results showed that the maximum MAE (mean absolute error) and standard deviation of five multispectral bands (i.e. blue, green, red, red edge and near infrared) for all reference panels is 3. 34% and 2. 11%, respectively; and the maximum MAE and standard deviation of the three reference panels (i.e. black, gray and white) is 2. 94% and 1. 84%, respectively. Therefore, the proposed method can obtain accurate reflectance results, even under varying solar illumination conditions. It greatly simplifies the reflectance conversion process of UAV-based remote sensing images. The study results are significant to the UAV-based remote sensing system's design and the quantitative application of multispectral remote sensing data.

TI  - Climatological Aspects of Active Fires in Northeastern China and Their Relationship to Land Cover
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Biomass burning (BB) is a driving force for heavy haze in northeastern China (NEC) and shows distinct seasonal features. However, little is known about its climatological aspects, which are important for regional BB management and understanding BB effects on climate and environment. Here, the climatological characteristics of active fires and their dependence on land cover in NEC were studied using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products. Moreover, the influence of meteorological factors on fire activities was explored. The number of fires was found to have increased significantly from 2003 to 2018; and the annual total FRP (FRPtot) showed a generally consistent variation with fire counts. However, the mean fire radiative power for each spot (FRPmean) decreased. Fire activity showed distinctive seasonal variations. Most fires and intense burning events occurred in spring and autumn. Spatially, fires were mainly concentrated in cropland areas in plains, where the frequency of fires increased significantly, especially in spring and autumn. The annual percentage of agricultural fires increased from 34% in 2003 to over 60% after 2008 and the FRPtot of croplands increased from 12% to over 55%. Fires in forests, savannas, and grasslands tended to be associated with higher FRPmean than those in croplands. Analysis indicated that the increasing fire count in NEC is mainly caused by agricultural fires. Although the decreasing FRPmean represents an effective management of BB in recent years, high fire counts and FRPtot in croplands indicate that the crop residue burning cannot be simply banned and a need instead for effective applications. More efforts should be made on clean utilization of straw. The accumulation of dry biomass, high temperature, and low humidity, and weak precipitation are conducive to the fire activities. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of BB in NEC and provides a reference for regional BB management and control.

TI  - Improving Winter Wheat Yield Forecasting Based on Multi-Source Data and Machine Learning
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - To meet the challenges of climate change, population growth, and an increasing food demand, an accurate, timely and dynamic yield estimation of regional and global crop yield is critical to food trade and policy-making. In this study, a machine learning method (Random Forest, RF) was used to estimate winter wheat yield in China from 2014 to 2018 by integrating satellite data, climate data, and geographic information. The results show that the yield estimation accuracy of RF is higher than that of the multiple linear regression method. The yield estimation accuracy can be significantly improved by using climate data and geographic information. According to the model results, the estimation accuracy of winter wheat yield increases dramatically and then flattens out over months; it approached the maximum in March, with R-2 and RMSE reaching 0.87 and 488.59 kg/ha, respectively; this model can achieve a better yield forecasting at a large scale two months in advance.

TI  - How China's Fengyun Satellite Precipitation Product Compares with Other Mainstream Satellite Precipitation Products
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based and reanalysis precipitation estimates are an alternative and important supplement to rain gauge data. However, performance of China's Fengyun (FY) satellite precipitation product and how it compares with other mainstream satellite and reanalysis precipitation products over China remain largely unknown. Here five satellite-based precipitation products (i.e., FY-2 precipitation product, IMERG, GSMaP, CMORPH, and PERSIANN-CDR) and one reanalysis product (i.e., ERA5) are intercompared and evaluated based on in situ daily precipitation measurements over mainland China during 2007-17. Results show that the performance of these precipitation products varies with regions and seasons, with better statistical metrics over wet regions and during warm seasons. The infrared-microwave combined precipitation [i.e., IMERG, GSMaP, and CMORPH, with median KGE (Kling-Gupta efficiency) values of 0.53, 0.52, 0.59, respectively] reveals better performance than the infrared-based only product (i.e., PERSIANN-CDR, with a median KGE of 0.31) and the reanalysis product (i.e., ERA5, with a median KGE of 0.43). IMERG performs well in retrieving precipitation intensity and occurrence over China, while GSMaP performs well in the middle to low reaches of the Yangtze River basin but poorly over sparsely gauged regions, e.g., Xinjiang in northwest China and the Tibetan Plateau. CMORPH performs well over most regions and has a greater ability to detect precipitation events than GSMaP. The FY-2 precipitation product can capture the overall spatial distribution of precipitation in terms of both precipitation intensity and occurrence (median KGE and CSI of 0.54 and 0.55), and shows better performance than other satellite precipitation products in winter and over sparsely gauged regions. Annual precipitation from different products is generally consistent, though underestimation exists in the FY-2 precipitation product during 2015-17. Significance StatementIntercomparison between the FY-2 precipitation product and mainstream precipitation products is valuable to guide applications of satellite precipitation products to China and its subregions. This study illustrates uncertainties in various satellite precipitation products, and could guide optimization of algorithms of precipitation retrieval and data fusion/merging to improve the accuracy and resolution of satellite precipitation products.
