TI  - A Machine Learning-Based Semantic Pattern Matching Model for Remote Sensing Data Registration
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing image registration can benefit from a machine learning method based on the likelihood of predicting semantic spatial position distributions. Semantic segmentation of images has been revolutionized due to the accessibility of high-resolution remote sensing images and the advancement of machine learning techniques. This system captures the semantic distribution location of the matching reference picture, which ML mapped using learning-based algorithms. The affine invariant is utilized to determine the semantic template's barycenter position and the pixel's center, which changes the semantic border alignment problem into a point-to-point matching issue for the machine learning-based semantic pattern matching (ML-SPM) model. The first step examines how various factors such as template radius, training label filling form, or loss function combination affect matching accuracy. In this second step, the matching of sub-images (MSI) images is compared using heatmaps created from the expected similarity between the images' cropped sub-images. Images having radiometric discrepancies are matched with excellent accuracy by the approach. SAR-optical image matching has never been easier, and now even large-scale sceneries can be registered using this approach, which is a significant advance over previous methods. Optical satellite imaging or multi-sensor stereogrammetry can be combined with both forms of data to enhance geolocation.

TI  - Response of model-based cambium phenology and climatic factors to tree growth in the Altai Mountains, Central Asia
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - It is important to study the relationships between tree growth and phenology and climate factors in Central Asia for the sustainable development of forest ecology and the exploration of carbon sink potential in the region in a context of global change. Herein, the process-based Vaganov-Shashkin model was used to simulate tree-ring growth rates, to assess a cambial phenology (start and end of growing season) of larch trees (Larix sibirica) based on three sites located on three different latitudes in the Altai-Sayan Mountains in Central Asia over 1960-2018. It was shown that the principal factor limiting growth rates was temperature in RU (located in southern central Siberia), cambial dynamic was unimodal. In RU site, although the length of growing season did not change significantly over the past 59 years, it was correlated with tree radial growth. Moisture was the principal factor limiting the growth rates of AL and FY (located in Chinese Altai Mountains), and cambium dynamics were bimodal and unimodal, respectively. Temperature and precipitation before the start of the growing season lengthen the growing season, but this did not promote the tree radial growth. In conclusion, we determined that the climate-influenced intra-seasonal growth rate regulated tree growth rather than length of growing season in this area. In this study, the VS-simulation showed high potential develop a long-term reconstruction of cambial phenology in the Altai Mountains, which was conducive to a more comprehensive understanding of the exogenous-endogenous factors effects on tree-ring growth.

TI  - Fusion of SAR and Multi-spectral Time Series for Determination of Water Table Depth and Lake Area in Peatlands
T2  - PFG-JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY REMOTE SENSING AND GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Peatlands as natural carbon sinks have a major impact on the climate balance and should therefore be monitored and protected. The hydrology of the peatland serves as an indicator of the carbon storage capacity. Hence, we investigate the question how suitable different remote sensing data are for monitoring the size of open water surface and the water table depth (WTD) of a peatland ecosystem. Furthermore, we examine the potential of combining remote sensing data for this purpose. We use C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data from Sentinel- 1 and multi-spectral data from Sentinel-2. The radar backscatter sigma(0), the normalized difference water index (NDWI) and the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) are calculated and used for consideration of the WTD and the lake size. For the measurement of the lake size, we implement and investigate the methods: random forest, adaptive thresholding and an analysis according to the Dempster-Shafer theory. Correlations between WTD and the remote sensing data sigma(0) as well as NDWI are investigated. When looking at the individual data sets the results of our case study show that the VH polarized sigma(0) data produces the clearest delineation of the peatland lake. However the adaptive thresholding of the weighted fusion image of sigma(0)-VH, sigma(0)-VV and MNDWI, and the random forest algorithm with all three data sets as input proves to be the most suitable for determining the lake area. The correlation coefficients between sigma(0)/NDWI and WTD vary greatly and lie in ranges of low to moderate correlation.

TI  - High-resolution global maps of tidal flat ecosystems from 1984 to 2019
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Assessments of the status of tidal flats, one of the most extensive coastal ecosystems, have been hampered by a lack of data on their global distribution and change. Here we present globally consistent, spatially-explicit data of the occurrence of tidal flats, defined as sand, rock or mud flats that undergo regular tidal inundation. More than 1.3 million Landsat images were processed to 54 composite metrics for twelve 3-year periods, spanning four decades (1984-1986 to 2017-2019). The composite metrics were used as predictor variables in a machine-learning classification trained with more than 10,000 globally distributed training samples. We assessed accuracy of the classification with 1,348 stratified random samples across the mapped area, which indicated overall map accuracies of 82.2% (80.0-84.3%, 95% confidence interval) and 86.1% (84.2-86.8%, 95% CI) for version 1.1 and 1.2 of the data, respectively. We expect these maps will provide a means to measure and monitor a range of processes that are affecting coastal ecosystems, including the impacts of human population growth and sea level rise.Measurement(s) ecosystem occurrence Technology Type(s) earth observation Sample Characteristic - Environment tidal flats center dot coastal wetlands Sample Characteristic - Location global

TI  - The carbon budget of the managed grasslands of Great Britain - informed by earth observations
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Grasslands cover around two-thirds of the agricultural land area of Great Britain (GB) and are important reservoirs of organic carbon (C). Direct assessments of the C balance of grasslands require continuous monitoring of C pools and fluxes, which is only possible at a small number of experimental sites. By relying on our quantitative understanding of ecosystem C biogeochemistry we develop models of grassland C dynamics and use them to estimate grassland C balance at various scales. Model-based estimation of the C budget of individual fields and across large domains is made complex by the spatial and temporal variability in climate and soil conditions, as well as in livestock grazing, grass cutting and other management activities. In this context, earth observations (EOs) provide subfield-resolution proxy data on the state of grassland canopies, allowing us to infer information about vegetation management, to apply observational constraints to the simulated ecosystems and, thus, to mitigate the effects of model input data uncertainty. Here, we show the potential of model-data fusion (MDF) methods to provide robust analyses of C dynamics in managed grasslands across GB. We combine EO data and biogeochemical modelling by implementing a probabilistic MDF algorithm to (1) assimilate leaf area index (LAI) times series (Sentinel-2); (2) infer defoliation instances (grazing, cutting); and (3) simulate livestock grazing, grass cutting, and C allocation and C exchanges with the atmosphere. The algorithm uses the inferred information on grazing and cutting to drive the model's C removals-and-returns module, according to which approximate to 1/3 of C in grazed biomass returns to the soil as manure (other inputs of manure not considered) and C in cut grass is removed from the system (downstream C emissions not considered). Spatial information on soil C stocks is obtained from the Soil-Grids dataset. The MDF algorithm was applied for 2017-2018 to generate probabilistic estimates of C pools and fluxes at 1855 fields sampled from across GB. The algorithm was able to effectively assimilate the Sentinel-2-based LAI time series (overlap = 80 %, RMSE = 1.1 m(2) m(-2), bias = 0.35 m(2) m(-2)) and predict livestock densities per area that correspond with independent agricultural census-based data (r = 0.68, RMSE = 0.45 LU ha(-1), bias = -0.06 LU ha(-1)). The mean total removed biomass across all simulated fields was 6 (+/- 1.8) t DM ha(-1) yr(-1). The simulated grassland ecosystems were on average C sinks in 2017 and 2018; the net biome exchange (NBE) was -191 +/- 81 (2017) and -49 +/- 69 gC M-2 yr(-1) (2018). Our results show that the 2018 European summer drought reduced the strength of C sinks in GB grasslands and led to a 9-fold increase in the number fields that were annual C sources (NBE > 0) in 2018 (18 % of fields) compared to 2017 (2 % of fields). The field-scale analysis showed that management in the form of timing, intensity and type of defoliation were key determinants of the C balance of managed grasslands, with cut fields acting as weaker C sinks compared to grazed fields. Nevertheless, extreme weather, such as prolonged droughts, can convert grassland C sinks to sources.

TI  - The distribution and movement characteristics of fine particles in an electrostatic precipitator with multi-field synergy
T2  - POWDER TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - An experimental platform was established to study the distribution and motion characteristics of fine particles in an electrostatic precipitator (ESP) with electric, temperature, and particle concentration, multi-field synergistic effect. The fine particle concentrations were tested by measuring reformed ELPI in real-time. For discussion, motion characteristics of fine particles such as trajectory, deposition, re-entrainment and water flushing were analyzed by mechanical modeling, listing up every force acting on the fine particles. The results show that the type and the force order of magnitude of the particle will change correspondingly in different states. The syn-ergistic state is beneficial to the removal of particles in the whole range, especially the particle size of 0.1 ⁓1 mu m, and the maximum removal rate is increased by 15% compared with the wet state. The increasing of Fy (liquid bridge), Fc (particle concentration gradient) and Fth (thermophoresis). increase the removal efficiency of fine particles in synergistic state.

TI  - Along-strike variation in fault structural maturity and seismic moment deficits on the Yushu-Ganzi-Xianshuihe fault system revealed by strain accumulation and regional seismicity
T2  - EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The 900-km-long Yushu-Ganzi-Xianshuihe fault system that separates the Bayan Har and Qiang-tang/Chuandian blocks is a primary tectonic structure in central eastern Tibet. Being one of the world's most seismically active fault systems, it hosted 12 M > 7 earthquakes since the 18th century, and its future seismic risk has been the subject of extensive research over the past two decades. Previous studies have suggested that the western segment of the fault system differs largely from its eastern segment in strain accumulation and release, but the origin of such difference remains unknown. Here we use Sentinel-1 data to produce a complete map of present-day deformation for the entire fault system, in order to explore the along-strike variation in fault slip behaviour. Based on the InSAR deformation map, we solve for fault kinematic parameters including slip rate, locking depth and dip angle using a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo inversion approach. Slip rate on the Dangjiang-Yushu-Ganzi fault is consistently similar to 5-6 mm/yr, only half of that on the Xianshuihe fault. This rate difference originates from nonuniform deformation mechanism within the Bayan Har block, with the western part of the block deforming more rigidly than the eastern part. Both historical and modern earthquake catalogues show that the western fault segment has only recorded M > 7 earthquakes whereas the eastern segment has seen many small-to-moderate ruptures in addition to large earthquakes. These observations imply that the western fault segment may be more structurally mature than the eastern segment, which agrees with the long-term fault propagation as indicated by geochronological data and fault geometrical complexities. We calculate the seismic moment deficits along the fault system and find that several segments, e.g. the Dangjiang fault and the Manigange segment of the Ganzi fault, have accumulated a large seismic moment (equates to an M-w > 7 earthquake) since the last major event.

TI  - Glacier-glacial lake changes and modeling glacial lake outburst flood in Upper Ganga Basin, India
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers in the high-altitude basins of the Himalayan region are retreating and thinning under the influence of climate warming, resulting in the development and formations of numerous lakes of different types. Some of these glacial lakes are potentially dangerous and may burst and cause huge destruction to the property, infrastructure and loss of lives in the low-lying areas. The present study uses multi-temporal satellite data to analyze the changes in glacier and glacial lakes of Upper Ganga Basin (UGB) over a period of 24 years from 1990 to 2014. Furthermore, we evaluated the probable GLOF impacts of the Unnamed Lake (potentially dangerous) at important sites using the hydrodynamic model (HEC-RAS). The results show that the total area of the glaciers in the study area shrunk by 82 +/- 12.7 km(2) over a 24 years of observation period. Glacial lakes, on the other hand, have significantly increased both in terms of number and area from 1990 to 2014. The number of lakes increased by 54 lakes (38.84%), whereas area has increased from 2.92 km(2) in 1990 to 3.12 km(2) in 2014, thus indicating an overall growth of 6.84%. In the worst-case scenario, the breach hydrograph with 75 m breach width (B-w) and 20 min breach formation time (T-f) has been considered for flood routing across the river channel, which gives different peak flood hydrograph and other significant flood wave parameters like water depth, flow velocity and water surface elevation. The resultant flood will arrive at the nearest location (Ghastoli area) located 12 km from the lake site at 1 h and 40 min after the breach initiation with a maximum peak discharge of 1404.56 m(3)/s and maximum flood depth and velocity of 6.64 m and 2.48 m/s respectively. At the last selected location located at a distance of 55 km from the lake outlet, the flood wave potentially inundates the area with in 4 h 10 min after the breach initiation with a maximum peak discharge of 1078.35 m(3)/s and maximum flood depth, velocity of 11.93 m and 4.50 m/s respectively. After the analysis of flood hydrographs at various locations (cross-sections) in the downstream region, it was observed that the peak flood and other flood wave parameters were at its highest at the locations with narrow flood channel, while the intensity of the potential flood decreases as it advances toward the lower area with wide river channel. The elevation and slope of the river bed are also key factors that determine the intensity of the flood at a particular location. This study recommends restricting the built-up along the flood channel and to limit the growth of settlements toward ecological fragile areas to lessen the impacts of the various natural hazards.

TI  - Thermal stress and mutation accumulation increase heat shock protein expression in <i>Daphnia</i>
T2  - EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the short- and long-term consequences of climate change is a major challenge in biology. For aquatic organisms, temperature changes and drought can lead to thermal stress and habitat loss, both of which can ultimately lead to higher mutation rates. Here, we examine the effect of high temperature and mutation accumulation on gene expression at two loci from the heat shock protein (HSP) gene family, HSP60 and HSP90. HSPs have been posited to serve as 'mutational capacitors' given their role as molecular chaperones involved in protein folding and degradation, thus buffering against a wide range of cellular stress and destabilization. We assayed changes in HSP expression across 5 genotypes of Daphnia magna, a sentinel species in ecology and environmental biology, with and without acute exposure to thermal stress and accumulated mutations. Across genotypes, HSP expression increased similar to 6x in response to heat and similar to 4x with mutation accumulation, individually. Both factors simultaneously (lineages with high mutation loads exposed to high heat) increased gene expression similar to 23x-much more than that predicted by an additive model. Our results corroborate suggestions that HSPs can buffer against not only the effects of heat, but also mutations-a combination of factors both likely to increase in a warming world.

TI  - Exploring seasonal diurnal surface temperature variation in cities based on ECOSTRESS data: A local climate zone perspective
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - High urban temperatures affect city livability and may be harmful for inhabitants. Analyzing spatial and temporal differences in surface temperature and the thermal impact of urban morphological heterogeneity can promote strategies to improve the insulation of the urban thermal environment. Therefore, we analyzed the diurnal variation of land surface temperature (LST) and seasonal differences in the Fifth Ring Road area of Beijing from the perspective of the Local Climate Zone (LCZ) using latest ECOSTRESS data. We used ECOSTRESS LST data with a resolution of 70 m to accurately interpret the effects of urban morphology on the local climate. The study area was dominated by the LCZ9 type (sparse low-rise buildings) and natural LCZ types, such as LCZA/B (woodland), LCZD (grassland), and LCZG (water body), mainly including park landscapes. There were significant differences in LST observed in different seasons as well as day and night. During daytime, LST was ranked as follows: summer > spring > autumn > winter. During night-time, it was ranked as follows: summer > autumn > spring > winter. All data indicated that the highest and lowest LST was observed in summer and winter, respectively. LST was consistent with LCZ in terms of spatial distribution. Overall, the LST of each LCZ during daytime was higher than that of night-time during different seasons (except winter), and the average LST of each LCZ during the diurnal period in summer was higher than that of other seasons. The LST of each LCZ during daytime in winter was lower than that of the corresponding night-time, which indicates that it is colder in the daytime during winter. The results presented herein can facilitate improved analysis of spatial and temporal differences in surface temperature in urban areas, leading to the development of strategies aimed at improving livability and public health in cities.

TI  - The possible association between epidemics of hand-foot-and-mouth disease and responsiveness to immunoglobulin therapy in Kawasaki disease
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PEDIATRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundEnterovirus causing hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) has been reported to be associated with the development of Kawasaki disease (KD), whereas the involvement of enterovirus in the clinical course of KD is uncertain. The aim of this study is to investigate the association between the clinical course of KD and HFMD epidemics. MethodsThis study included 108 patients who developed KD during HFMD epidemic seasons (July and August) from 2010 to 2014 and who were initially treated with high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). A mean of >= 5.0 HFMD patients reported weekly from each sentinel medical facility was considered to represent a large HFMD epidemic. We compared the clinical characteristics of KD patients in summers of years with and without large HFMD epidemics. ResultsLarge HFMD epidemics occurred in 2011 and 2013. The number of KD patients in summer was the highest in 2011. The proportion of patients with resistance to the IVIG therapy in summers of years with the large epidemics (14%) was significantly lower than that in summers of other years (31%, P = 0.030), whereas the proportion of patients with coronary artery abnormalities did not differ to a statistically significant extent. The development of KD during large HFMD epidemics was significantly associated with a lower risk of resistance to the IVIG therapy (incidence rate ratio 0.92, P = 0.049). ConclusionPatients developing KD during large HFMD epidemic may have good responsiveness to IVIG. It is important to identify microbes from KD patients to predict responsiveness to IVIG therapy.

TI  - Sustained vegetation greening enhanced ecosystem water-use efficiency in the Loess Plateau of China in recent 20 years
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global vegetation greenness has already been confirmed to increase substantially since the early 1980s, and this phenomenon is extremely heterogeneous in both time and space. The Loess Plateau (LP) serves as an ecological barrier of northern China, where the ecological environment is characterized by exceptional fragility and sensitivity. However, the spatial pattern of vegetation dynamics in both greenness and productivity and their relationship with vegetation ecosystem water-use efficiency (WUE) are still poorly documented, especially in recent 20 years. In this study, the leaf area index (LAI) and gross primary productivity (GPP) were employed to characterize vegetation canopy leaf area and productivity, respectively. The time series data of ecosystem WUE in the LP were obtained by the ratio of GPP and ET during the period of 2000-2018, the dynamic trend of vegetation greenness and productivity in the LP was detected by using a linear fitting and nonlinear method, then, the extent to which the sustained greening in the LP revealed an increase of ecosystem WUE in recent 20 years was quantified. The results showed that sustained vegetation greening and increased GPP elucidated a great improvement in ecosystem WUE in the LP during 2000-2018, in which the sustained greening potentially reveals an increase of ecosystem WUE in > 69.33% regions of the LP in recent 20 years. > 93% regions of the LP have been experiencing a vegetation greening progress derived by both the annually averaged LAI (LAI(AN)) and growing season (April to October) maximum LAI (LAI(GS)). Furthermore, precipitation and soil moisture positively contributed to an interannual increase in ecosystem WUE; however, increasing temperature greatly resulted in a decrease in ecosystem WUE in the LP in recent 20 years. Importantly, this work also implied that ecological water is significantly consumed by the increasing vegetation photosynthesis derived from the significant growth of ET in the LP since the 2000s. These findings implied that the increasing ecological water consumption should be incorporated into indigenized ecosystem process models.

TI  - Change of moraine-dammed glacial lakes and simulation of glacial lake outburst flood in the Yi'ong Zangbo River basin
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) are a serious potential threat to the safety of life and property in downstream areas. In this study, moraine-dammed glacial lakes in the Yi'ong Zangbo River basin were recognized based on Landsat ETM+/TM/OLI images in 2000 and 2019. Also, GLOFs for the Jionglaco, the largest glacial lake in this basin, were simulated using the one-dimensional hydrodynamic model. The results show that the total number and area of moraine-dammed glacial lakes in this basin increased by 10 (10.52%) and 5.49 km(2) (48.24%) from 2000 to 2019, respectively, in which the area of the Jionglaco increased by 3.22 km(2). The peak discharge at the breach outlet for five scenarios with different combinations of breach width (80 and 120 m), depth (2.5 and 5 m), and flood time (1.5 and 3 h) are 489 , 1,327.43, 444.32, 617.47, and 1,570.61 m(3)/s. With the addition of baseflow in the river, the peak discharge at bridge site 15,138.93 km from Jionglaco, is 1,040.89, 1,724.00, 1,024.85, 1,162.25, and 1,990.52 m(3)/s. The combination of baseflow in river and the GLOF discharge results in an increasing peak discharge in the further downstream region. However, the arrival of peak discharge in downstream areas is delayed, which increases the chances of people escaping.

TI  - LabSAR, a one-GCP coregistration tool for SAR-InSAR local analysis in high-mountain regions
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The coregistration of single-look complex (SLC) SAR images for InSAR or offset tracking applications is often performed by using an accurate DEM and precise orbital information. However, in cold regions, such DEMs are rare over high-latitude areas or not up-to-date over fast melting glaciers for instance. To overcome this difficulty, we propose in this article a coregistration method preserving InSAR phase information that only requires a 3D point of reference instead of a full DEM. Developed in a Python toolbox called LabSAR, the proposed method only uses orbital information to coregister the images on the sphere centered on the Earth center passing by the ground control point (GCP). Thanks to the use of the orbital information, the so-called orbital fringes are compensated without having to estimate them. This coregistration method is compared to other approaches in two different types of applications, InSAR and offset tracking, on a PAZ Dual-Pol Temporal Stack covering the Mont Blanc massif (western European Alps). First, InSAR measurements from LabSAR are compared with the results of the Sentinel-1 ESA toolbox (SNAP). The LabSAR interferograms exhibit clearer topographical fringes, with fewer parameters to set. Second, offset tracking based on LabSAR coregistated images is used to measure the displacement of the Bossons glacier. The results are compared with those obtained by a conventional approach developed in the EFIDIR tools. By evaluating the uncertainties of both approaches using displacements over stable areas and the temporal closure error, similar uncertainty values are found. However, velocity values differ between the two approaches, especially in areas where the altitudes are different from the altitude of the reference point. The difference can reach up to 0.06 m/day, which is in the range of the glacier velocity measurement uncertainty given in the literature. The impact of the altitude of the reference point is limited: this single GCP can be chosen at the median altitude of the study area. The error margin on the knowledge of this altitude is 1,000 m, which is sufficient for the altitude to be considered as known for a wide range of study area in the world.

TI  - Semi-supervised thin cloud removal with mutually beneficial guides
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a semi-supervised thin cloud removal framework referred to as mutually beneficial guides. It is featured by two fundamental operations, i.e., (a) beneficial model guide and (b) beneficial objective guide. They are operated in terms of the iterative training of two benefactor networks, i.e., (a) a model benefactor network and (b) an objective benefactor network. The beneficial objective guide benefits the model benefactor network by guiding its training with the cloud removal results of cloudy images given by the objective benefactor network at each iteration. This operation explores the cloudy images whose cloud-free images are unavailable for training, and thus augments the normally insufficient training data for cloud removal in a semi-supervised fashion. The beneficial model guide benefits the objective benefactor network by transferring a historically optimal model benefactor network to it at each iteration. This operation enables the objective benefactor network to provide reliable cloud removal results for training the model benefactor network. Therefore, the two benefactor networks mutually benefit each other from different aspects during the iterative training such that their capabilities of removing clouds are gradually enhanced. Specifically, we construct the benefactor networks in terms of a cross-scale content fusion structure where multi-scale features are fused to the pixel-to-pixel residual processing blocks. The structure is in favor of both coherent and high-resolution cloud removal results. Experiments on both Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A images validate that the framework of mutually beneficial guides outperforms other methods in thin cloud removal. The implementation code of the framework of mutually beneficial guides is available at: https://gitee.com/xuzunxiao/mutually-beneficial-guides.

TI  - Meteorological driving factors effecting the surface area of Ebinur Lake and determining associated trends and shifts
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in lake water resources and regional hydrological processes in response to climate change and human activity necessitates timely and accurate access to lake change information to monitor water cycles and water security. The Ebinur Lake Basin has experienced a serious ecological crisis in recent years, which is majorly due to excess use of its water. Therefore, in this study, we used Ebinur Lake as a research object, and used Geographic Information System and remote sensing technology, Landsat, Sentinel, and MODIS images, the Google Earth Engine platform, and the water body index method to determine the changes in lake area from April to October of 2011-2020. Daily data from the Alashankou and Jinghe meteorological stations from 2011 to 2020 were collected. The center of gravity-geographically and temporally weighted regression model was used to analyze the factors changes in surface area. The results showed obvious spatial and temporal heterogeneities for the surface area. Except for 2016, which had unusual/extreme weather, in the last decade, the lake surface area generally showed a monthly decreasing trend from April to October. When Ebinur Lake is one water body, the surface area ranges between 530 and 560 km(2). We concluded that the spatio-temporal characteristics of Ebinur Lake can be divided into two levels. When the southeast and northwest regions of the lake merge, it represents the largest possible surface area of Ebinur Lake; this was called the "water storage level ". Historically, Ebinur Lake has lost significant amounts of water, and there is no water body connecting the two main parts of the lake (thereby dividing the lake into two areas); this was called "water demand level ". The trajectory of the center of gravity of the lake is linear, with a slope of 45 & DEG; and a direction of northwest to southeast. The lake gravity center has different aggregation states. According to the season, it can be divided into spring gathering and autumn gathering. The variation in the surface area of Ebinur Lake is highly correlated with the meteorological and hydrological variation during the year. The highest correlation was observed between lake surface area and wind speed. This study aimed to supplement other studies that explore the lake annually and provide a reference for future water resources management and planning.

TI  - Effectiveness of six-step complex decongestive therapy for treating upper limb lymphedema after breast cancer surgery
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF CLINICAL CASES
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND Complex decongestive therapy (CDT) is currently recommended as the standard treatment for lymphedema. CDT is a four-step detumescence therapy that can effectively treat upper limb lymphedema after breast cancer surgery, and is considered non-invasive, painless and without side effects. AIM To determine the effectiveness of a six-step CDT involving a foam granule bandage for the treatment of upper extremity lymphedema pressure after breast cancer surgical intervention. METHODS The study included 100 patients with upper extremity lymphedema after breast cancer surgery. The surgical methods were mastectomy plus axillary lymph node dissection and breast preservation plus sentinel lymph node biopsy. The study population was further divided into the experimental group and control group with 50 cases in each group. The control group was given conventional CDT (four-step method), which included skin care, freehand lymphatic drainage, foam granule pressurized bandage, and functional exercise. In the experimental group, a six-step CDT method was applied that involved a foam particle bandage combined with air wave pressure therapy in addition to the four steps of conventional CDT. Patients in both groups were given one course of treatment daily (20 times), and the changes in body moisture and subjective symptoms were measured before and after treatment, preoperatively and 20 times after treatment. RESULTS No statistically significant differences in 50-Hz bioelectrical impedance and extracellular moisture ratio were observed between the two groups before treatment, suggesting comparability of the baseline data. After treatment, the 50-Hz bioelectrical impedance of the experimental group was significantly higher than that in the control group, and the extracellular moisture ratio was significantly lower than that in the control group. A comparison of the differences between the two groups before and after treatment indicated that the treatment effect in the experimental group was better than that in the control group. After 20 treatments, according to subjective evaluations, the tightness and swelling of the limbs in the experimental group were significantly reduced as compared with those in the control group. CONCLUSION The six-step CDT method can effectively reduce lymphedema, promote lymphatic circulation, and alleviate the subjective symptoms of patients, and thereby improve the quality of life and treatment compliance among patients.

TI  - Stringency of COVID-19 Containment Response Policies and Air Quality Changes: A Global Analysis across 1851 Cities
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The COVID-19 containment response policies (CRPs) had a major impact on air quality (AQ). These CRPs have been time-varying and location-specific. So far, despite having numerous studies on the effect of COVID-19 lockdown on AQ, a knowledge gap remains on the association between stringency of CRPs and AQ changes across the world, regions, nations, and cities. Here, we show that globally across 1851 cities (each more than 300 000 people) in 149 countries, after controlling for the impacts of relevant covariates (e.g., meteorology), Sentinel-5P satellite-observed nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels decreased by 4.9% (95% CI: 2.2, 7.6%) during lockdowns following stringent CRPs compared to pre-CRPs. The NO2 levels did not change significantly during moderate CRPs and even increased during mild CRPs by 2.3% (95% CI: 0.7, 4.0%), which was 6.8% (95% CI: 2.0, 12.0%) across Europe and Central Asia, possibly due to population avoidance of public transportation in favor of private transportation. Among 1768 cities implementing stringent CRPs, we observed the most NO2 reduction in more populated and polluted cities. Our results demonstrate that AQ improved when and where stringent COVID-19 CRPs were implemented, changed less under moderate CRPs, and even deteriorated under mild CRPs. These changes were location-, region-, and CRP-specific.

TI  - Exploring machine learning techniques to retrieve sea surface temperatures from passive microwave measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Two machine learning (ML) models are investigated for retrieving sea surface temperature (SST) from passive microwave (PMW) satellite observations from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) and auxiliary data, such as ERA5 reanalysis data. The first model is the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XBG) model and the second is a multilayer perceptron neural network (NN). The performance of the two ML algorithms is compared to that of an existing state-of-the-art regression (RE) retrieval algorithm. The performance of the three algorithms is assessed using independent in situ SSTs from drifting buoys. Overall, the three models have similar biases; 0.01, 0.01 and -0.02 K for the XGB, NN and RE, respectively. The XGB model performs best with respect to standard deviation; 0.36 K. While the NN model performs slightly better than the RE model with respect to standard deviation, 0.50 and 0.55 K, respectively, the RE model is found to be more sensitive to changes in the in situ SST. Moreover, the XGB model is the least sensitive with an overall sensitivity of 0.78, compared to 0.90 for the RE model and 0.88 for the NN model. The good performance of the two ML algorithms compared to the state-of-the-art RE algorithm in this initial study demonstrates that there is a large potential in the use of ML algorithms for the retrieval of SST from PMW satellite observations.

TI  - Satellite remote sensing of particulate matter in the atmosphere of megacities: A case study of Tehran, Iran
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Here, we investigate the annual variations of particulate matter (PM) levels for Tehran megacity during 2018, using ground-based measurements and remotely sensed data, taken from CALIOP space-borne lidar and MODIS-Aqua sensor. Furthermore, the aerosol types of Tehran are determined against three other megacities, namely Delhi, Helsinki and Calgary. Satellite data attest the dust/polluted dust as the dominant aerosol types in Tehran during warm/cold seasons, respectively. The values of particulate depolarization ratio (PDR), particulate color ratio (PCR) and aerosol optical depth (AOD) are calculated along the CALIPSO satellite night-time trajectories over Tehran. This demonstrates that the maximums of PDR and PCR occur during July. The seasonal analyses of vertically averaged PDR and PCR attest that the maximum values take place during summer time, while minimum records belong to the fall season. The correlation analysis emphasizes a sensible conformity between column AOD data (retrieved from MODIS-Aqua sensor) and the PM2.5 concentrations (acquired from ground -based meteorological stations). Besides, PDR is inversely correlated to relative humidity. In this study, the origins of pollutants are envisaged based on PSCF and frequency analysis of back-trajectories for February and July 2018, indicating the main origin of dust arises from Turkmenistan deserts in summer and Iraq/western Iran arid areas during winter.

M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and detailed identification of land cover types is beneficial to the ecological environment and sustainable urban development, yet the extraction of urban land use/land cover (LULC) information with high accuracy is challenged by the high degree of landscape fragmentation. Therefore, this study is based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform and uses the U-Net model combined with spectral image data and SAR data to conduct a LULC classification study of highly heterogeneous urban areas in central China. The results indicated that the overall accuracy of classification result by using the U-Net model and the optimal combination of image features was 95.58%, which was 1.37%, 4.84%, and 7.85% higher than that of random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM) and k- Nearest Neighbor (kNN), respectively. It showed that the U-Net model can effectively extract LULC information and obtain better classification results in urban areas than the machine learning algorithms. The results of this study could provide technical support to improve the accuracy of information extraction in urban areas with fragmented features.

TI  - VLSG-SANet: A feature matching algorithm for remote sensing image registration
T2  - KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Finding a reliable correspondence between two feature point sets efficiently and accurately is the first step in many computer vision applications. It is a crucial prerequisite for many remote sensings, target recognition, and photogrammetry applications. However, in different application scenarios, images may undergo different degrees of deformation, which makes the predefined geometric model no longer appropriate. This article attempts to remove mismatches between the set of assumed matching points. In order to achieve this goal, we propose an effective matching method, called "visualized local structure generation-Siamese attention " network (VLSG-SANet), which transform the task of eliminating mismatching of feature points into a dynamic visual similarity assessment. The VLSG-SANet can generate visual descriptors by using the local structure information about each feature point. We embed the attention module based on the Siamese network for the generated feature descriptors, allowing the network to adjust the descriptors dynamically. In order to prove the robustness and versatility of the VLSG-SANet algorithm, we have performed good experiments on open remote sensing data images and got good experimental results.

TI  - Greenhouses Detection in Guanzhong Plain, Shaanxi, China: Evaluation of Four Classification Methods in Google Earth Engine
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Greenhouses used for agricultural production have been expanding around the world because it significantly increases crop yield. Meanwhile, it brings a series of environmental problems that should be considered in agricultural planning and management. The advent of the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform makes remote sensing image processing more convenient and efficient. It has been widely applied in multiple disciplines, but few studies have investigated the detection of greenhouses. In this research, four different classification methods were applied for comparing their performance in monitoring greenhouses in the Guanzhong Plain, Shaanxi, China using GEE: the Minimum Distance Classifier (MDC), the Support Vector Machine with three kernel functions (linear, SVM-L, polynomial, SVM-P, and radial basis function variations, SVM-R), the Classification and Regression Trees (CART), and the Random Forest (RF). Our results illustrate that these classification techniques' overall accuracy is >84%. The most accurate classification results were obtained by the SVM-R classifier, with an overall accuracy of 94%, followed by the RF and CART classifier, while the MDC performed worst among these four classifiers. These results would be useful for greenhouse extraction in long time series and large-scale areas, which provides solid information for decision-makers and practitioners for agriculture planning and management.

TI  - Study on the land surface cover dynamics of built-up areas and its implication for sustainable urban planning in Hawassa city, Ethiopia
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid and uncontrolled urbanization is one of the drivers responsible for land cover Change dynamics in Ethiopia. In most of the cities and towns of Ethiopia, the proportion of different types of urban land surface cover and trends of change in each are unknown and thus hindering environmentally sustainable urban planning. This study describes different land surface cover types and their dynamics of change, and subsequent influence on the Land Surface Temperature of Hawassa city between 2011 and 2021. The i-Tree canopy and Landsat 5 (TM) and Landsat 8 (OLI) images were used for 2011 and 2021 to analyze the land surface cover and surface temperature change, respectively. The results show that bare soil is the dominant land surface cover type (23.4%), followed by tree canopy cover (21.4%), while impervious roads occupied the smallest land surface area cover (3.4%) along with water bodies (1%). In 10 years most of the land surface cover types increased positively, including tree covers by + 9.8%. The only exceptions were bare soil and herbaceous cover, which decreased drastically by - 34.6% and - 2.8%, respectively. As a result of tree cover increment, the average and maximum Land Surface Temperature showed a declining trend between the two periods. This study shows that increasing tree cover in line with the expansion of urbanization is inversely correlated with the land surface temperature which implies that integrating green coverage along with the built-up area can reduce heatwave in the fast growing urban areas. Therefore, the Hawassa city administration should set tree cover targets to achieve the desired balance between green and grey infrastructure and enhance the climate resilience level of the study area.

TI  - Active versus passive restoration: Forests in the southern Carpathian Mountains as a case study
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Active and passive restoration are both increasingly considered as options for nature recovery, with potential to help address the current climate and biodiversity crises. So far, however, there is little practical information on how to gauge the benefits and limitations of each approach, in terms of their effects on large-scale ecosystem composition, structure, and functioning. To address this knowledge gap, this study used satellite remote sensing to investigate changes in land cover and primary productivity within the forests of the Fagaras Mountains in southern Romania, where large-scale restoration and land abandonment have simultaneously taken place across the past two decades. To our knowledge, this study is the first to contrast the impacts of active and passive restoration within a single landscape on components of ecosystem structure and functioning at such temporal and spatial scales. Results show active restoration activities to be very effective at facilitating the recovery of cleared forests in small parts of the landscapes; but they also highlight substantial areas of natural forest expansion following agricultural abandonment, in line with regional trends. Altogether, our approach clearly illustrates how freely available satellite data can (1) provide vital spatially explicit insights about large-scale and long-term transformations in ecosystem composition, structure and functioning; and (2) help contrast the impacts of restoration approaches on vegetation distribution and dynamics, in ways that complement existing ground-based studies.

TI  - Two-decade dynamics of MODIS-derived Secchi depth in Peninsula Malaysia waters
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Secchi disk depth (Z(sd)) is an essential environmental factor for studying ecosystem dynamics and biogeochemical processes in aquatic environments. Monitoring the long-term changes in water transparency is critical to predict the cascading impacts of climate change on marine ecosystems. We investigated the seasonal and interannual dynamics of Z(sd) in the eastern coast of Peninsula Malaysia (ECPM) and the Straits of Malacca (SoM) using a 21-year time series of MODIS ocean color data. To enable the reliable assessment of Z(sd) and its long-term variability, the performance of existing and regional algorithms was investigated using in-situ optical measurements collected during different monsoon seasons and in various environmental conditions. Our validation results showed that the existing Z(sd) algorithms performed adequately, but exhibited large errors, especially at relatively high Z(sd) values. On the other hand, the regional empirical algorithm based on a direct relationship between remote sensing reflectance and Z(sd) showed significant improvements by reducing the overall bias observed in existing Z(sd) schemes. The results indicated that the monthly climatological Z(sd) over the period 2000-2020 showed distinct patterns in different seasons. The ECPM waters had deeper Z(sd) than SoM waters. Maximum transparency usually occurred during the southwest and spring inter-monsoon and minimum transparency occurred during the northeast monsoon. Long-term seasonal evolution of Z(sd) reveals that widespread and persistent anomalies dominated the ECPM and SoM regions. Interannual trends indicate notable and complex changes in Z(sd) that were probably driven by variability in the ocean-atmosphere dynamics of Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and local environmental conditions. This study highlights the extensive analysis of Z(sd) status and its spatio-temporal pattern from space, which can significantly benefit long-term ocean monitoring efforts in the ECPM and SoM regions.

TI  - A New Methodology for Detection of Fog over the Indian Region using INSAT-3D Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fog estimation from the satellite is crucial as the fog has a significant impact on the road, rail, and air traffic, thereby influencing the economy and human life. To understand and deal with several influence factors, spatially and temporally high-resolution fog information is required. This study has attempted to develop an algorithm for daytime fog retrieval from INSAT-3D Imager data over the Indian region. The operational algorithm for detecting fog using INSAT-3D data provides low stratus cloud and fog as its product. The operational product does not provide any distinction between low stratus clouds and fog. The segregation of fog from low-level stratus clouds is still an open area. This work proposes a methodology to segregate low stratus clouds from fog. The work presents a two-step approach. In the first step, it implements the methodology proposed by Chaurasia and Gohil (2015), for the detection of daytime low stratus clouds/fog using INSAT-3D data, and in the second step, it proposes a methodology to segregate fog from low stratus clouds. The daytime fog retrieval methodology primarily makes use of visible and thermal channels to distinguish fog from high/mid-level clouds, snow, and bright land area. However, the fog and low-level stratus clouds cannot be segregated using only visible and thermal channels, as the top of both fog and low-level stratus appears similar in these two channels. In the present study, an attempt has been made to separate fog from low stratus clouds using a wind threshold. The final segregated fog product from the proposed methodology has been validated with ground observation. The percentage of detection is observed to be 86% with a false alarm of 4% for the season December 2018-January 2019. The fog products with and without wind threshold have also been compared with INSAT-3D operational fog products and MODIS true color composite images. The comparison has shown the robustness of the algorithm in segregating the fog and low-level stratus clouds.

TI  - A downscaling model for derivation of 3-D flood products from VIIRS imagery and SRTM/DEM
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As one of the costliest and most frequent natural disasters, flood is a major threat to human lives and property. Flood forecasting, simulation, and monitoring plays an important role in disaster relief and mitigation. With the support from the JPSS (Joint Polar Satellite System) Proving Ground and Risk Reduction (PGRR) Program, the VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) global 375-m flood products in near real-time, daily composition, and 5-day composition have been developed and derived flood extent represented in water fractions from Suomi-NPP and NOAA-20. The products have shown good quality for the spatial distribution of floodwater. However, the moderate spatial resolution is a limiting factor when obtaining inundation detail. Moreover, no vertical information on the floodwater is included in the products. Based on water's self-leveling nature, it is feasible to construct the vertical structure of floodwater using the VIIRS 375-m water fractions and high-resolution Digital Elevation Model (DEM) such as the 30-m Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM)/ DEM through a downscaling process (Li et al., 2013). With impact factors including topography, land cover, tree cover, river network and watershed, the downscaling process has been integrated into a model called the Downscaling Model. By using the 30-m SRTM/DEM, the model can downscale the VIIRS 375-m floodwater fraction products into 30-m flood extent and water depth products. These products include flood information in both horizontal and vertical directions and thus are called 3-D flood products in this study. This paper presents a comprehensive introduction to the model with the results evaluated against high-resolution satellite images from Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), Sentinel-2, and GeoEye, aerial photos, and river gauge observations. Evaluation results indicate reliable quality and promising performance of the model and the downscaled flood products. A routine system has been set up at the Cooperative Institute for Satellite Studies (CIMSS) at University of Wisconsin-Madison to generate experimental VIIRS downscaled flood extent and water depth products over the Continental USA (CONUS). The routinely generated VIIRS 30-m floodwater depth maps are available at: https://floods.ssec.wisc.edu/?products=VIIRS-3Dflood.

TI  - Genetic parameters and genome-wide association for milk production traits and somatic cell score in different lactation stages of Shanghai Holstein population
T2  - FRONTIERS IN GENETICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the genetic parameters and genetic architectures of six milk production traits in the Shanghai Holstein population. The data used to estimate the genetic parameters consisted of 1,968,589 test-day records for 305,031 primiparous cows. Among the cows with phenotypes, 3,016 cows were genotyped with Illumina Bovine SNP50K BeadChip, GeneSeek Bovine 50K BeadChip, GeneSeek Bovine LD BeadChip v4, GeneSeek Bovine 150K BeadChip, or low-depth whole-genome sequencing. A genome-wide association study was performed to identify quantitative trait loci and genes associated with milk production traits in the Shanghai Holstein population using genotypes imputed to whole-genome sequences and both fixed and random model circulating probability unification and a mixed linear model with rMVP software. Estimated heritabilities (h2) varied from 0.04 to 0.14 for somatic cell score (SCS), 0.07 to 0.22 for fat percentage (FP), 0.09 to 0.27 for milk yield (MY), 0.06 to 0.23 for fat yield (FY), 0.09 to 0.26 for protein yield (PY), and 0.07 to 0.35 for protein percentage (PP), respectively. Within lactation, genetic correlations for SCS, FP, MY, FY, PY, and PP at different stages of lactation estimated in random regression model were ranged from -0.02 to 0.99, 0.18 to 0.99, 0.04 to 0.99, 0.04 to 0.99, 0.01 to 0.99, and 0.33 to 0.99, respectively. The genetic correlations were highest between adjacent DIM but decreased as DIM got further apart. Candidate genes included those related to production traits (DGAT1, MGST1, PTK2, and SCRIB), disease-related (LY6K, COL22A1, TECPR2, and PLCB1), heat stress-related (ITGA9, NDST4, TECPR2, and HSF1), and reproduction-related (7SK and DOCK2) genes. This study has shown that there are differences in the genetic mechanisms of milk production traits at different stages of lactation. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct research on milk production traits at different stages of lactation as different traits. Our results can also provide a theoretical basis for subsequent molecular breeding, especially for the novel genetic loci.

TI  - Lithology classification in semi-arid areas based on vegetation suppression integrating microwave and optical remote sensing images: Duolun county, Inner Mongolia autonomous region, China
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-source remote sensing data can provide abundant Earth observation information for lithology classification and identification, especially in some areas with complex geological conditions where the field geological survey is difficult to carry out. Compared with mountainous areas with large outcrops of rock, the lithology information obtained based on traditional field measurement and single optical remote sensing data in semi-arid areas is greatly limited due to the uneven vegetation coverage. While the combination of microwave and optical remote sensing technologies can effectively improve the integrality and reliability of the obtained lithology information in semi-arid areas. This paper selected Duolun County of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region as the study area, added vegetation suppression for microwave and optical images into the conventional lithology classification process, and integrated Sentinel-1A and Landsat-8 images of the study area to carry out the experiment. The improved water-cloud model with the parameter of vegetation coverage and the method of feature-oriented principal component analysis based on multiple vegetation indices were used to realize the vegetation suppression in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) backscattering images in two polarization modes and multispectral images. The processed SAR backscattering, SAR texture and spectral feature images were used to form seven feature combinations for lithology classification by the maximum likelihood method. The results showed that the proposed lithology classification scheme cannot achieve high-precision classification of all lithologic types, but it was effective in identifying the major lithologies dominated in the Quaternary deposits of the study area. In all feature combinations, the combination of all the three types of features reached the highest classification accuracy, with the overall classification accuracy of 88.60% and the kappa coefficient of 0.75 for five major lithologies. The experimental results fully demonstrated the advantages of integrating microwave and optical remote sensing data in lithology classification in a semi-arid area.

TI  - Improved estimation of fire particulate emissions using a combination of VIIRS and AHI data for Indonesia during 2015-2020
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Smoke aerosol emissions from Indonesian fires frequently cause adverse environmental consequences across southeast Asia. Satellite observations provide us with a great opportunity to monitor such emissions at large scales. However, existing satellite-based estimates of Indonesian fire emissions vary considerably in magnitude, differing by a factor of four. Here, we aim to improve Indonesian fire emissions estimates through improved calculations of fire radiative energy (FRE: time-integrated fire radiative power (FRP)) and smoke aerosol emission coefficients (Ce) using multiple new-generation satellite observations. Specifically, peatland and non-peatland Ce values were derived from FRP and emission rates of smoke aerosols based on Visible Infrared Im-aging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) active fire and aerosol products. FRE was calculated from the diurnal FRP cycle that was reconstructed by fusing cloud-corrected FRP retrievals from the high temporal-resolution Himawari-8 Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) with those from high spatial-resolution VIIRS. Then, fuel type-specific Ce values and fused AHI-VIIRS FRE were used to produce hourly and daily fire emission data from 2015 to 2020 across Indonesia. To evaluate AHI-VIIRS estimates, we generated a reference dataset of total particulate matter (TPM) by computing Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol observation differences from successive Terra and Aqua satellites overpasses over a set of manually-selected smoke plumes. AHI-VIIRS-based fire emissions correlated significantly with the MODIS reference data (r = 0.84; p < 0.001). The inter -annual time series analysis of AHI-VIIRS emissions showed extreme variability (similar to 26 fold), with the greatest amount in 2015 (6.09 Tg) and the least in 2020 (0.23 Tg), during the study period. Mean annual fire emissions distributed across Indonesia's islands were primarily from Kalimantan (43.8%) and Sumatra (41.7%), followed by Sulawesi (5.6%), Java (4.5%), and Papua (4.4%). Additionally, contributions of Indonesian fire emissions from peatland, forest, cropland, and savanna/grassland fuel types were 51.4%, 37.8%, 7.0%, and 3.8%, respectively, during the fire season of the strong 2015 El Nino event. The analysis suggests that the majority of Indonesian fire emissions are very likely associated with large-scale land use conversion from peatland to agriculture, as well as prolonged droughts induced by El Nino events.

TI  - Multi-source and multi-scale data integration for the assessment of the marine environmental status of the Basque Coast (SE Bay of Biscay)
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD, 2008/56/EC), Member States are required to assess the environmental status of marine waters. With the aim to support practitioners in this effort, and guide them in the identification of management solutions, a team of researchers has brought together available information for the Basque coastal zone (SE Bay of Biscay), and assessed the marine environmental status of these waters. To undertake the study, the area was divided into Marine Reporting Units (MRUs), following the MSFD terminology, which had specific areas assigned. The information used for the assessment was obtained from a variety of open sources (i.e., in-situ long-term monitoring data, biological data from annual/ triannual surveys, multibeam echosounder data, satellite data, and had been collected at different spatial scales, from the coastline to offshore, covering the whole Exclusive Economic Zone. A total of 67 indicators were used, covering some ecosystem components: physico-chemistry of sediments and waters, phytoplankton, benthic fauna and flora, fish, birds, mammals, and alien species. The associated data, for 2010 to 2019, were then collated and integrated to assess the environmental status in a holistic way, using NEAT (Nested Environmental status Assessment Tool). The analyses included spatial scenarios (coastline to offshore), as well as filtering by different MSFD descriptors (i.e., biodiversity, alien species, eutrophication, seafloor integrity and contamination). Overall, the Basque coast is in good status, with no clear spatial gradient. But when focusing on specific ecosystem components (e.g., seabirds, mammals, some commercial fish species), it is possible to identify some components in bad status, with scope for improvement through the implementation of management measures. The integrated assessment approach presented and the outputs that are obtained can be used to guide European practitioners in their efforts to prioritize management measures. Furthermore, results are comparable to those reported in official MSFD assessments, confirming the power of the NEAT software.

TI  - Drought and stand susceptibility to attacks by the European spruce bark beetle: A remote sensing approach
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Several time-series analyses have demonstrated that after extreme summer drought bark beetle damage increased. However, studies predicting stand susceptibility over large spatial extents are limited by technical constraints in obtaining detailed, spatially-explicit data on infestation spot occurrence. Using a unique dataset of georeferenced bark beetle infestation data, we tested whether the spatial variation of local growing conditions of forest stands, topography, and landscape variables modified the local occurrence of Ips typographus infestations after a severe hot drought in Central Europe. Bark beetle infestation occurrence depended on soil-related aridity intensity, elevation, slope, and soil conditions. We showed that elevation interacted with growing conditions and topography. At low elevations, spruce forests growing on flat areas and wetter soils were more sensitive to the infestations. On the contrary, forests on steep slopes and soils with low water availability were rarely attacked. At the landscape scale, bark beetle damage increased with host tree cover but decreased with compositional diversity. Our findings are generally consistent with the growth-differentiation balance hypothesis that predicts that trees growing under chronic dry conditions tend to be more resistant against biotic disturbances. Spruce stands at low elevations located in homogeneous landscapes dominated by spruce were those more exposed to bark beetles in the initial phase of a drought-induced outbreak.

TI  - Regulation of emergency granulopoiesis during infection
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - During acute infectious and inflammatory conditions, a large number of neutrophils are in high demand as they are consumed in peripheral organs. The hematopoietic system rapidly responds to the demand by turning from steady state to emergency granulopoiesis to expedite neutrophil generation in the bone marrow (BM). How the hematopoietic system integrates pathogenic and inflammatory stress signals into the molecular cues of emergency granulopoiesis has been the subject of investigations. Recent studies in the field have highlighted emerging concepts, including the direct sensing of pathogens by BM resident or sentinel hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), the crosstalk of HSPCs, endothelial cells, and stromal cells to convert signals to granulopoiesis, and the identification of novel inflammatory molecules, such as C/EBP-beta, ROS, IL-27, IFN-gamma, CXCL1 with direct effects on HSPCs. In this review, we will provide a detailed account of emerging concepts while reassessing well-established cellular and molecular players of emergency granulopoiesis. While providing our views on the discrepant results and theories, we will postulate an updated model of granulopoiesis in the context of health and disease.

AB  - With the gradual declining streamflow gauging stations in many world-rivers, emphasis is given nowadays to develop remote sensing (RS)-based approaches as the next-generation hydrometry for estimating riverine ecological flow regimes (EFR). For constructing EFR based on daily-streamflow data in scantily-gauged reaches, use of RS techniques in narrow flow-width tropical rain-fed rivers is constrained with the non-availability of finer spatial satellite data at daily scale. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel framework that integrates the enhanced spatiotemporal adaptive reflectance fusion (FUS) of the 250 m x 1-day resolution Aqua-MODIS and 30 m x 1-day resolution Landsat satellite-based remote sensing images in the near-infrared region with the machine learning algorithms. These developed frameworks are named as Artificial Neural Network-based ANNFUS, Random Forest Regression-based RFRFUS, and Support Vector Regression-based SVRFUS models, which were tested for daily-scale streamflow estimation in a typical Brahmani River Basin, India. The results reveal that by addressing the linear and nonlinear dynamism between the streamflow and satellite signals, all the developed models could simulate the streamflow very well with the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency>0.8, Kling-Gupta efficiency>0.8, relative root mean square error (rRMSE) of 0.051-0.12, and normalized RMSE of 0.23-0.36. However, for reproducing the high, median, and low streamflow regimes, the SVRFUS model was found to be the best with the NSE>0.85 and KGE>0.8. Conclusively, the proposed approach is found to have the potential to be replicated in other world-river basins to estimate ecological flow regimes at defunct gauging stations facilitating the basin-scale aquatic environmental management.

TI  - Evaluation of the simulated aerosol optical properties over India: COALESCE model inter-comparison of three GCMs with ground and satellite observations
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Within the framework of COALESCE project (Carbonaceous aerosol emissions, source apportionment, and climate im-pacts) initiative, spatio-temporal distribution of aerosol optical properties from three general circulation models are evaluated against aerosol data from satellite observations (MODIS and CALIPSO) and ground-based measurements (AERONET) for the period 2005-2014. The GCMs, NICAM-SPRINTARS (N-S), ECHAM6.3-HAM2.3 (E-H), CAM5.3 (CAM), input with identical emissions from the SMoG-India-v1 emission inventory over India nested in the CEDS global inventory, including all emission sectors except sea salt and soil dust. The annual mean total aerosol optical depth (AOD) averaged over the Indian land region is 0.38, 0.27, and 0.17 from the N-S, CAM, and E-H models respec-tively, while the annual mean value from the MODIS observational dataset is 0.43. Single scattering albedo predicted by E-H is lower compared to CAM and N-S while model predictions of Angstrom exponent are closer to MERRA2 dataset. However, the average total aerosol column burden over Indian landmass simulated by the models is very close and comparable to the reanalysis results. Statistical analysis of AOD between model and AERONET measure-ments at nine sites shows that the root mean square error varies from 0.1 to 0.4 and the index of agreement (average value) is similar to 0.4. The aerosol emission and transport models, methodology for calculation of aerosol optical properties and their mixing states contributes to the diversity in the results from various models. The present study provides an analysis of limitations and uncertainties contributing to the differences between the simulations and observations, and the inter-model diversity.

TI  - Deep edge enhancement-based semantic segmentation network for farmland segmentation with satellite imagery
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The participation of insured smallholders and involvement of related requirements have been emerging and increasing with the popularization and promotion of agricultural insurance. Compared with traditional field surveys, remote sensing and deep learning technologies, with their rapid development in recent years, have provided an automatic and effective means for underwriting control in the agricultural insurance industry. Moreover, "smallholder-wise underwriting " is intensively expected by the local government and insurance companies to ensure precise claim settlements. In this process, farmland segmentation is a crucial and fundamental step for smallholder farmland claim settlements. However, segmentation of smallholder farmland parcels from satellite images remains a challenge, as the ridges and roads between farmland parcels are usually narrow and display confusing characteristics with their neighboring farmlands. This challenge causes undersegmentation on the farmland boundaries, leading to inaccurate and incomplete farmland parcel recognition. In this study, we aim to solve this problem by proposing a novel Deep Edge Enhancement Semantic Segmentation Network to refine parcels' boundary segmentation and improve the closure level of the farmland segmentation. We designed a framework for farmland edge enhancement through pseudo road label generation and model fusion. The proposed network aggregates feature extraction for ridge and road segmentation to improve its performance on farmland parcel recognition. Furthermore, we found that the commonly used image segmentation evaluation metric, such as pixel-wise-based mean Intersection over Union, cannot objectively reflect the effectiveness of the smallholder farmland segmentation. Therefore, we proposed two block-wise farmland evaluation metrics that are consistent with the practical evaluation rules and requirements of farmland segmentation at the parcel level. We implemented experiments in the study area of Jiaxiang County in northern China using the GaoFen-1 4-band multispectral images (red, green, blue, and near-infrared) at a spatial resolution of 2 m. Experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of our method, which outperformed the baseline DeepLabv3+ network.

TI  - The 23 February 2020 Qotur-Ravian earthquake doublet at the Iranian-Turkish border: Seismological and InSAR evidence for escape tectonics
T2  - TECTONOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present the source mechanisms and rupture processes for the damaging 23 February 2020 earthquake doublet of Mw 5.8 and Mw 5.9 that occurred near the Turkish-Iranian border regions of Qotur-Goharan-Mir'-Omar-Ravian (NW Iran), extending towards Saray and Bas, kale (Eastern Turkey), as obtained from seismological waveform analysis and space geodesy imaging. Seismotectonic characteristics of the sequence highlight the role of indentation tectonics developed within regional-scale compressional environment where the Arabian micro-plate collides with the Eurasian plate. Here we report optimal finite-fault slip distribution patterns of the 2020 Qotur-Ravian earthquake doublet revealing complex co-seismic rupture propagation along the fault planes with maximum displacements ranging from 20 to 50 cm, stretching from the hypocentre to the surface. Analysis of aftershocks based on 3.5 months-long seismicity confirms distributed deformation. This energetic earthquake sequence demonstrates the distinct rupture characteristics illuminating differences in seismogenic properties and seismic hazard. Coulomb stress transfer modelling predicts triggering of the second event of Mw 5.9 by the first event of Mw 5.8. The zone of Coulomb stress changes attributed to varying pore pressure linking to geothermal water resources in the region as a driving force, may have an impact on the nucleation of triggered faulting. Evaluation of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data reveals the activated faults with evident co-seismic slip. Specifically, (1) we detected a rare case in earthquake-induced ground deformation where there is overlapping surface deformation due to sequential shallow events located closely in the crust, (2) the initial event ruptured a normal fault located towards W-NW of the latter inferred strike-slip fault and (3) the conjugate system of faults is closely placed at a few km apart. The frequent Sentinel-1 interferograms enhanced our imaging abilities of geometry and kinematics of shallow moderate-size M < 6.0 earthquakes and to trace seismogenic structures in remote and mountainous earthquake prone regions.

TI  - A 2D hydrodynamic model for river flood prediction in a coastal floodplain
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - A two-dimensional (2D) hydrodynamic model is developed for the prediction of the water level in the lower Narmada River and its coastal floodplain passing through the Bharuch city of Gujarat, India. The 2D hydrodynamic model is calibrated for the flood of 2006 with due consideration of upstream (releases from Sardar Sarovar Dam) and downstream (tidal level of the sea) boundary conditions. The resistance coefficient of the floodplain is estimated using Landsat imagery based on the land use land cover pattern. The developed model is validated with independent data from a flood in 2013. The developed model is utilized to predict flood levels for the discharges corresponding to a 100-year return period flood, observed maximum flood and standard project flood of Sardar Sarovar Dam, which is situated upstream of the study area on the Narmada River. The model is further used to study the variation in water levels in the lower Narmada River due to the construction of the proposed Bhadbhut barrage for different gate-opening and embankment scenarios. This will be helpful in determining the height and length of the embankments along the river for flood protection. This is the first study in the lower Narmada River after the completion of the Sardar Sarovar Dam and after reaching its full capacity on September 17, 2019. The methodology proposed in this study for river flood prediction on the coastal floodplain using a 2D hydrodynamic model can be applied to similar geographical conditions.

TI  - Optimal flood susceptibility model based on performance comparisons of LR, EGB, and RF algorithms
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wadi El-Matulla, located in the eastern desert of Egypt, is the most important water basin. The Qift-Qusayr highway (west-east direction) and the Cairo-Aswan eastern desert highway (north-south direction) pass through the watershed. Many urban areas (villages and industrial areas) and agricultural lands are located at the outlet of these basins. In addition, the basin has promising potential for future economic and urban development as it is located within the Golden Triangle (governmental megaproject). The current study investigates flood hazard modeling and its impact on the area. To determine the optimal flood susceptibility mapping algorithm, performance comparisons of three techniques were conducted: logistic regression (LR), extreme gradient boosting (EGB), and random forest (RF). Remote sensing, topographic, geologic, and meteorological data were used with the help of field visits to provide the spatial and inventory database required by the models. The performance and reliability of the predictions of the proposed models were evaluated using five statistical indices: receiver operating characteristic-area under the curve, overall accuracy (OAC), kappa index, root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). The performance of the models showed that the values of ROC (93, 86 and 80%), OAC (88, 82 and 76%), kappa index (0.85, 0.75 and 0.51), RMSE (0.34, 0.42 and 0.49) and MAE (0.12, 0.18 and 0.24) for RF, EGB, and LR, respectively. Based on AUC values, RF and EGB models provide excellent and very good prediction for flood susceptibility. Our results show that RF is the optimal algorithm for flood susceptibility mapping, followed by EGB and LR. Consequently, the predictive power of RF model is quite good and the flood susceptibility map was classified into five classes, namely very low (51.7%), low (23.7%), moderate (16.2%), high (7.1%), and very high (1.3%). Ultimately, the RF model was verified using sentinel-1 imagery for real floods in 2016 and 2021, and it provides good agreement. The optimal model could be useful for decision makers and planners to protect existing facilities and plan future projects in non-flood-prone areas. Accordingly, the most suitable areas for future development need to be distributed mainly in the low and very low flood hazard areas.

TI  - Application of machine learning techniques to simulate the evaporative fraction and its relationship with environmental variables in corn crops
T2  - ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The evaporative fraction (EF) represents an important biophysical parameter reflecting the distribution of surface available energy. In this study, we investigated the daily and seasonal patterns of EF in a multi-year corn cultivation located in southern Italy and evaluated the performance of five machine learning (ML) classes of algorithms: the linear regression (LR), regression tree (RT), support vector machine (SVM), ensembles of tree (ETs) and Gaussian process regression (GPR) to predict the EF at daily time step. The adopted methodology consisted of three main steps that include: (i) selection of the EF predictors; (ii) comparison of the different classes of ML; (iii) application, cross-validation of the selected ML algorithms and comparison with the observed data. Results Our results indicate that SVM and GPR were the best classes of ML at predicting the EF, with a total of four different algorithms: cubic SVM, medium Gaussian SVM, the Matern 5/2 GPR, and the rational quadratic GPR. The comparison between observed and predicted EF in all four algorithms, during the training phase, were within the 95% confidence interval: the R-2 value between observed and predicted EF was 0.76 (RMSE 0.05) for the medium Gaussian SVM, 0.99 (RMSE 0.01) for the rational quadratic GPR, 0.94 (RMSE 0.02) for the Matern 5/2 GPR, and 0.83 (RMSE 0.05) for the cubic SVM algorithms. Similar results were obtained during the testing phase. The results of the cross-validation analysis indicate that the R-2 values obtained between all iterations for each of the four adopted ML algorithms were basically constant, confirming the ability of ML as a tool to predict EF. Conclusion ML algorithms represent a valid alternative able to predict the EF especially when remote sensing data are not available, or the sky conditions are not suitable. The application to different geographical areas, or crops, requires further development of the model based on different data sources of soils, climate, and cropping systems.

TI  - Spatiotemporal changes of ecosystem health and their driving mechanisms in alpine regions on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem health plays a vital role in the development of regional ecological environment. Gannan Plateau, an important water conservation area in the upper reaches of the Yellow River, is located at the northeastern margin of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Due to the importance of the region, understanding the spatiotemporal patterns of the ecosystem health within this region is particularly critical. Previous studies on regional ecosystem health assessment mainly focused on single ecosystem type such as wetland, forest, and grassland, while there are relatively few studies that comprehensively assessed ecosystem health at high-spatial resolution in Gannan alpine areas. In this study, 11 counties and cities in Gannan Tibetan and Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture of the Gansu Province, China were used as the study area. We evaluated the ecosystem health of 154 township units from 2000 to 2020 with methods of Pressure-State-Response model (PSR) and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), using a combination of satellite remote sensing data, social statistics data, meteorological data, and other geospatial data sources. The results showed that overall ecosystems in the southwestern part of the study area exhibited healthier condition than those located in the northeastern part, which is mainly due to the combination of the natural environment and the intensity of human activities in different regions. Over the past 20 years, due to the active implementation of relevant ecological protection and restoration policies by various regional governments and the improvement of the natural environment, the average ecosystem health status of Gannan Plateau has increased by 15.04 %, showing an improving trend in varying degrees or being stable, no declining trend was observed except for a small town. Our results implied that management should take different measures according to the differences of regional ecosystem health level, also pay more attention to areas where the ecosystem health status has not improved.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variation of land use and land cover changes and their impact on land surface temperature: A case of Kutupalong Refugee Camp, Bangladesh
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental degradation can be predicted and managed in a sustainable manner by the perodic analysis of the Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) change pattern, which not only helps to revitalize the environment but also helps to improve future land-use policies. With the Rohingya influx in 2017, the Kutupalong Mega Camp area in Bangladesh is at a severe risk of environmental degradation as the area is experiencing remarkable LULC change. The aim of this research is to illustrate the LULC change in the Kutupalong Mega Camp before and after the refugee influx, as well as its impact on the surrounding environment because of this change. The spatial and temporal variation of the LULC is analyzed from the classified multi-temporal Landsat images for years-2015, 2018, and 2021. The study reveals gradual decrease in forest cover of the area, which is replaced by the increasing human settlements. The study found an inverse relation between the refugee influx and the vegetation cover, where a positive relation to the bare land and settlement exists. The area experienced about ten times increase in human settlements during 2015-2021, which resulted deforestation of surrounding forest cover. Between 2015 to 2021, 74 % of forest cover of the studied area has been cleaned up for newer settlements, with an increase of wetland to meet the needs of increasing refugee population which has made the scenario worse. We also noticed an increase of Land Surface Temperature (LST) within a short period, where the average temperature increase rate is 0.06% during 2015-2018 and 0.01% during 2018-2021. The ecosystem, wild-habitat, and the thermal environment has been disturbed to a great extent due to this drastic change of forest cover mostly by the increasing anthropogenic activities in this area. The study represents the present scenario in comparison to its natural setting just a few years ago, and may serve as a guidance for the concerned authorities and international humanitarian organizations to develop a sustainable, comprehensive, and environment-friendly land management plan in order to protect the surrounding forest-ecology as well as the humanitarian works.

TI  - Hyalocytes in proliferative vitreo-retinal diseases
T2  - EXPERT REVIEW OF OPHTHALMOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction: Hyalocytes are sentinel macrophages residing within the posterior vitreous cortex anterior to the retinal inner limiting membrane (ILM). Following anomalous PVD and vitreoschisis, hyalocytes contribute to paucicellular (vitreo-macular traction syndrome, macular holes) and hypercellular (macular pucker, proliferative vitreo-retinopathy, proliferative diabetic vitreo-retinopathy) diseases.Areas covered: Studies of human tissues employing dark-field, phase, and electron microscopies; immunohistochemistry; and in vivo imaging of human hyalocytes.Expert opinion: Hyalocytes are important in early pathophysiology, stimulating cell migration and proliferation, as well as subsequent membrane contraction and vitreo-retinal traction. Targeting hyalocytes early could mitigate advanced disease. Ultimately, eliminating the role of vitreous and hyalocytes may prevent proliferative vitreo-retinal diseases entirely.

T2  - COASTAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The sea surface temperature estimated by satellites (SSTskin) may facilitate the understanding of processes that affect water quality in semi-enclosed bays. However, the representativeness and certainty of SSTskin in semi-enclosed bays have not been fully investigated. We investigated the SSTskin from MODIS in Tokyo Bay and Ise Bay to test the hypothesis that water-mass structure and proximity to land would affect SSTskin. Results showed that the SSTskin from MODIS in two semi-enclosed bays can be as representative and certain as the data from previous studies in the open ocean. We found that horizontal gradients of water temperature had little effect on the certainty of SSTskin. However, we found that both the representativeness and certainty of satellite-based estimates of SSTskin in semi-enclosed bays were reduced by seasonal and location characteristics. The representativeness and certainty of SSTskin near the mouth of Ise Bay were compromised by the complex vertical structure of water temperature in summer. Because SSTskin may greatly enhance understanding of the processes that affect water quality in semi-enclosed bays, our results indicate that prior validation of SSTskin by comparison with in-situ sea surface temperature (SSTdep) is important.

The present review focused on novel sensitive and specific diagnostic techniques, by searching through online databases like MEDLINE and Scopus up to February 2022.Areas covered: The techniques identified included contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), dosage of fragment 21-1 of cytokeratin 19 (CYFRA 21-1) in lymph node fine needle aspiration washout, sentinel LN biopsy (SNB), and artificial intelligence (Al) - deep learning applied to ultrasonography and computed tomography. These methods displayed widely varying sensitivity and specificity results, ranging from approximately 60-100%. This variability is mainly due to the operator's experience because of the great complexity of execution of these new techniques, which require a long-learning curve.Expert opinion: Despite the appearance of many candidate methods to improve the detection of metastatic lymph nodes, none seem to be clearly superior to the tools currently used in clinical practice and FNA-Tg measurement remains the more accurate tool to detect neck recurrences and CLNM from DTC.

TI  - Evaluation of different crop model-based approaches for variable rate nitrogen fertilization in winter wheat
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Several remote sensing-based methods have been developed to apply site-specific nitrogen (N) fertilization in crops. They consider spatial and temporal variability in the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum to modulate N applications to the actual crop nutrient status and requirements. However, deriving fertilizer N recommendations exclusively from remote proximal and remote sensing data can lead to substantial inaccuracies and new, more complex approaches are needed. Therefore, this study presents an improved approach that integrates crop modelling, proximal sensing and forecasts weather data to manage site-specific N fertilization in winter wheat. This improved approach is based on four successive steps: (1) optimal N supply is estimated through the DSSAT crop model informed with a combination of observed and forecast weather data; (2) actual crop N uptake is estimated using proximal sensing; (3) N prescription maps are created merging crop model and proximal sensing information, considering also the contribution of the soil N mineralisation; (4) N-Variable Rate Application (N-VRA) is implemented in the field. A VRA method based on DSSAT fed with historical weather data and a business-as- usual uniform fertilization were also compared. The methods were implemented in a 23.4 ha field in Northern Italy, cropped to wheat and characterized by large soil variability in texture and organic matter content. Results indicated that the model-based approaches consistently led to higher yields, agronomic efficiencies and gross margins than the uniform N application rate. Furthermore, the proximal sensing-based approach allowed capturing of the spatial variability in crop N uptake and led to a substantial reduction of the spatial variability in yield and protein content. This study grounds the development of web-based software as a friendly tool to optimize the N variable rate application in winter cereals.

TI  - HRNet- and PSPNet-based multiband semantic segmentation of remote sensing images
T2  - NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution remote sensing images have become mainstream remote sensing data, but there is an obvious "salt and pepper phenomenon" in the existing semantic segmentation methods of high-resolution remote sensing images. The purpose of this paper is to propose an improved deep convolutional neural network based on HRNet and PSPNet to segment and realize deep scene analysis and improve the pixel-level semantic segmentation representation of high-resolution remote sensing images. Based on hierarchical multiscale segmentation technology research, the main method is multiband segmentation; the vegetation, buildings, roads, waters and bare land rule sets in the experimental area are established, the classification is extracted, and the category is labeled at each pixel in the image. Using the image classification network structure, different levels of feature vectors can be used to meet the judgment requirements. The HRNet and PSPNet algorithms are used to analyze the scene and obtain the category labels of all pixels in an image. Experiments have shown that artificial intelligence uses the pyramid pooling module in the classification and recognition of CCF satellite images. In the context of integrating different regions, PSPNet affects the region segmentation accuracy. FCN, DeepLab and PSPNet are now the best methods and achieve 98% accuracy. However, the PSPNet object recognition algorithm has better advantages in specific areas. Experiments show that this method has high segmentation accuracy and good generalization ability and can be used in practical engineering.

TI  - Quantifying post-fire shifts in woody-vegetation cover composition in Mediterranean pine forests using Landsat time series and regression-based unmixing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mediterranean forests are highly subjected to fire occurrence. Altered fire regimes resulting from changes in land use and climate may jeopardize their resilience to fire and induce changes in forest composition. Disentangling forest cover composition is therefore critical for understanding post-fire forest recovery dynamics. In this study, we demonstrate how fractional time series of different woody-vegetation types support the analysis of post-fire vegetation recovery in relation to the pre-fire situation for two burned areas in Mediterranean pine forests in Spain. We separately estimated tree, shrub and background (combining herbaceous, soil and rock) cover fractions on an annual basis (1990-2020) using Landsat Spectral-Temporal Metrics (STMs) and a regression-based unmixing approach. Our regression models effectively estimated fractions of the three cover types with Mean Absolute Errors ranging from 8.6% to 13.4% when comparing to a reference dataset derived from high-resolution orthophotos across 6 different years. Slightly overestimations of low cover fractions where found in tree and shrub cover fractions across the study sites. Despite these minor errors, time series of cover fractions revealed characteristic spatio-temporal patterns of different woody-vegetation types for burned and unburned areas. Based on the fractional cover estimates, we derived a Normalized Difference Tree-Shrub Fraction index (NDTSF) to contrast tree cover fraction relative to the shrub cover and map post-fire shifts in composition. Annual maps of NDTSF revealed a high spatial and temporal variability and a general dynamic towards the pre-fire cover composition in 79-80% of burned areas but a shift from tree to shrub dominance in 12.3-15.4% 26 years after fire. Our regression-based unmixing approach advances the analysis of post-fire recovery dynamics, unravelling shifts in forest composition that are of major concern to forest management.

TI  - Evolution of vegetation dynamics and its response to climate in ecologically fragile regions from 1982 to 2020: A case study of the Three Gorges Reservoir area
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - The eco-environment in ecologically fragile regions has received increasing concern due to its vulnerability to climate changes. Determination of vegetation dynamics is a prerequisite for sustainable management of eco-environment evolution due to its vital role in regulating earth system and ecosystem services. China ' s Three Gorges Reservoir area (TGRA), as a typical ecologically fragile region, was selected to explore its vegetation dynamics and response to local climate in different periods (1982-2020) of GZD-TGD (Gezhou Dam-Three Gorges Dam). The 1982-2020 NDVI dataset was obtained by integrating the overlapping period (2001-2015) of GIMMS NDVI and MODIS NDVI. The results demonstrated that TGRA exhibited a generally greening trend in 1982-2020, and the greening rate increased with the implementation of GZD-TGD, particularly in the last 20 years, which greatly promotes the capacity of vegetation carbon sink. At the annual scale, the mitigation of climate warming occurred with GZD-TGD implementation, particularly after the first impoundment of TGD (-0.0114 ?yr(-1)). At the seasonal scale, a certain cooling effect in summer and a warming effect in other seasons (especially in winter) induced by this cascade project were observed, which became more pronounced after the water level reached 175 m. Furthermore, temperature had the most significant positive effect on vegetation dynamics, which increased with GZD-TGD implementation. The driving force of precipitation, VPD (vapor pressure deficit) and sunshine hours was relatively less significant but could not be ignored, with negative contributions from precipitation and VPD and positive contribution from sunshine hours. These findings provide further insights into the effect of climate changes mediated by GZD-TGD on vegetation growth and facilitate the dissection of the complex soil-plant-atmosphere feedback interaction.

TI  - A qualitative study of illness narratives: 'overcoming the monster' master plot for patients with stroke
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THERAPY AND REHABILITATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background/Aims Research that considers illness narrative 'master plots' (common and recognisable story plots related to the experience of illness), as expressed by individuals who have had a stroke, is needed Thus far, the literature has focused on identifying pre-established illness narrative master plots: the restitution, the chaos and the quest narrative. However, these narrative plots represent extreme psychological responses to the experience of illness; other narratives need to be understood in order to most effectively support individuals with stroke. Further research must identify if other master plots exist, and consider the implication of such plots.Methods A narrative methodology was undertaken, contextualised within a social constructivist worldview. A purposive sample of individuals with stroke undertook a single online semi-structured interview. A categorical-form narrative analysis was undertaken in five stages.Results A total of eight individuals were interviewed. Following analysis, six individuals were identified as illustrating experiences related to a master plot termed 'overcoming the monster'. The 'monster' was represented in several ways, which included: a mental health problem or an expression relating to internal feelings; a sense of being isolated from others; a threat to the individual's independence; and a negative interaction or experience related to health care. Individuals identified clear strategies for 'overcoming the monster'. These included: adopting a different way of viewing life; identifying and attaining both big and small goals; persistence and determination in the face of adversity; and giving support to others through activities and receiving support.Conclusions Allied health professionals need to understand the importance of this narrativisation of stroke because research has shown that allied health professionals can stereotype interactions by plots and seek to correct them. Implications of these findings ilustate the importance of understanding the individuals experience, not immediately reacting to a narrative type that may seem to fit, understanding the plot of overcoming the monster varies and may need time to be observed.

TI  - Assessment of land use change in the wetland of Barotse Floodplain, Zambezi River Sub-Basin, Zambia
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - River floodplains such as the Barotse Flood Plain (BFP) in Western Zambia, provide a large number of ecosystem services and economic value for the inhabitants. Yet, in spite of its importance, the Floodplain has been vulnerable to land use change threatening wetland degradation albeit it being a Ramsar Cultural Heritage Site. This study aimed at determining the extent of land use change in the wetland of BFP in the selected years between 1980 and 2020 using Landsat data, then identifying and assessing drivers of land use change using survey data sets. In this study we hypothesized to determine the past and present status and change drivers of unprotected wetlands using a hybrid approach to help guide environment managers on the conservation of wetlands in a holistic manner. It also measured the relationship between drivers of land use change and observed land use changes pattern in the wetland of BFP. The study used an integrated research approach that involved utilizing combined methods of data collection and analysis. Both secondary and primary data sources were used. Primary data was collected using interview schedule, key informants' interviews, Participatory Rural Appraisal and field observations. The Raosoft random sample calculator was used to determine the sample size of heads of households from 9 districts within the margins of Barotse Floodplain. Then, a proportional sample size per district of 270 was calculated. The study found that there was an average land use change of 24.3% and 0.78 annual change rate in the wetland of BFP in the years of 1984, 1996, 2004 and 2015. The land use classes annual change rates between 1984 and 2015 were: forest/woody vegetation (0.32), grassland (0.07), water (0.02), annually flooded land (0.11) and bare land (0.26). The delineated land cover area classes (forest/woody vegetation, grassland, water, annually flooded land and bare land) have been reducing except for bare land that was increasing in areal coverage. Water class had the greatest negative percentage change (decrease) of 0.04 between 1984 and 2015. While the class of bare land class had greatest positive change (increase) of 8.3 percent in the period of 1984 and 2015. It was found that from 1990 to 2016, there was precipitation variation the years between 1981 and 2016 where the lowest was 571.7 mm in 2016, highest 1 579 mm in 2008 and the average amount of rainfall in the same period was 879.5 mm. Therefore, in some years there was excessive rainfall and scant rainfall in other years, which affected hydrology in the wetland and consequently affecting its ecosystem functions. The study found that land use change was driven by climate variability (48.5%), infrastructure development (20.7%), technology (7.8%), demography (18.5%), and agriculture (4.4%) using an integrated approach. Other land use changes such as the construction of a road bridge across the floodplain have contributed to wetland deterioration. The study further found that there was a relationship of 0.266 between driving forces of land use change and observed land use changes pattern. Therefore, the study demonstrated and provided new data that indicated the extent of land use change and its drivers using integrated research approach. The study recommends strategies such as environmental education and land use planning to resolve the problem of land use changes, in order to contribute to sustainable wetland management.

TI  - Two-dimensional structure functions for characterizing convective rolls in the marine atmospheric boundary layer from Sentinel-1 SAR images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We study the shape of convective rolls in the Marine Atmospheric Boundary Layer from Synthetic Aperture Radar images of the ocean. We propose a multiscale analysis with structure functions which allow an easy generalization to analyse high-order statistics and so to finely describe the shape of the rolls. The two main results are 1) second-order structure function characterizes the wavelength and direction of rolls just like correlation or power spectrum do, 2) high-order statistics can be studied with skewness and flatness which characterize the asymmetry and intermittency of rolls, respectively. This is the first time that the asymmetry and intermittency of rolls are shown from radar images of the ocean surface.

TI  - Localized versus wide-ranging effects of the post-Soviet wars in the Caucasus on agricultural abandonment
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wars are frequent and can affect land use substantially, but the effects of wars can vary greatly depending on their characteristics, such as intensity or duration. Furthermore, the spatial scale of the effects can differ. The effects of wars may be localized and thus close to conflict locations if direct mechanisms matter most (e.g., abandonment because active fighting precludes farming), or wide-ranging, e.g., farther away from conflict lo-cations, if indirect mechanisms predominate (e.g., no access to agricultural inputs). Our goal was to quantify how the very different wars in the Caucasus region during post-Soviet times most likely affected agricultural aban-donment at different scales. We analyzed data on conflict locations plus Landsat-derived land-cover data from 1987 to 2015, and applied matching statistics, difference-in-differences estimators, and logistic panel re-gressions. We examined the localized versus wide-ranging effects of the different wars on permanent agricultural abandonment and inferred to direct and indirect mechanisms that may have resulted in agricultural abandon-ment. While permanent agricultural abandonment was overall surprisingly limited across the Caucasus, up to one third of abandonment was most likely related to the wars. Among the wars, the war in Chechnya was by far the most intense and longest, but its effect on abandonment was similar to the less intense and relatively short war in Abkhazia. 47 % and 45 % of agricultural abandonment was related to each war, respectively. The reason was that the effect of the war in Chechnya was more localized, and abandonment occurred near conflict locations, in contrast to Abkhazia, where the effect was wide-ranging and abandonment occurred farther away from conflict locations. In contrast, the war in South Ossetia showed no significant effect on abandonment, and the war in Nagorno-Karabakh had the surprising pattern that abandonment was higher where no war had occurred. For each of the wars, abandonment was predominately related to the nearest conflict locations, but in Abkhazia additional conflict locations within 10 km further increased the probability of abandonment. We infer that the direct mechanisms of the war such as bombing, and active fighting most likely resulted in a localized effect close to conflict locations in Chechnya and in Nagorno-Karabakh. However, in Nagorno-Karabakh subsidies for new settlers after the war, (i.e., a positive wide-ranging effect), potentially reduced the amount of abandonment there. In contrast, negative wide-ranging effects such as refugee movements and post-war restrictions on their return is related to broad-scale abandonment in Abkhazia. In summary, permanent agricultural abandonment was not necessarily higher in a war with a high overall intensity. Instead, the effect of a given war varied in scale, and was related to the relative importance of direct and localized versus indirect and wide-ranging mechanisms, including postwar events and policies, which is likely the case for other wars, too.

TI  - Contribution of 'human induced fires' to forest and savanna land conversion dynamics in the Luki Biosphere Reserve landscape, western Democratic Republic of Congo
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Human-induced fire is one of the most important determinants of forest cover and change in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Yet its impact on forest cover and forest cover change remains unclear, as fires in Africa generally do not spread over very large area. This is particularly the case in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), a region of the world that is still poorly investigated. Here, we propose to study the effect of human-induced fire on land use and land cover change in a protected area of the DRC, i.e. the Luki Biosphere Reserve (LBR). We investigate tree cover changes in and around the reserve between 2002 and 2019 using Landsat 7 ETM+, Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS and MODIS MCD12Q1 images and quantify human induced fires using MODIS MCD64A1 images. The study combines land use and land cover (LULC) change detection analysis of four images, two acquired in 2002 and two acquired in 2019, with multi-temporal assessment of annual burnt area acquired between 2002 and 2019 from MODIS MCD64A1 to assess the role of fire in LULC changes and the sensitivity of different LULC types to fire. The results show a dynamic conversion of primary forest to secondary forest over about 16% of the area, the evolution of savanna to secondary forest over 9.6% (Landsat image) and the replacement of secondary forest by savanna over 8.1% (MODIS image) of the total area of Luki Reserve. Of the total area undergoing land use change, 34.1% (Landsat image) and 35.7% (MODIS image) were caused by fire, which however did not cause a significant LULC change. For the LULC types that experienced fire events, the least stable type was primary forest, which had the lowest stability rate (34.2% and 23% for Landsat and MODIS image analysis, respectively) compared to others. This result illustrates the importance of fire as a driver of primary forest loss and degradation in the region. Despite the high exposure of savannas to fire events, they were not significantly destabilized by fire (stability rates of 86.3 and 97% for Landsat and MODIS analysis, respectively). Future analyses should focus on discriminating between different fire types to better understand the complex relationship between fire and ecosystem conditions.

TI  - Oxidative stress in<i> Physella acuta</i>: An integrative response of exposure to water from two rivers of Atlantic Mexican slope
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Freshwater pollution is a complex mixture of xenobiotics due to the wastewater and the various chemicals routinely applied to agricultural lands that are discharged into water bodies. Xenobiotics can exert damage to the aquatic biota threatening the biodiversity of aquatic ecosystems. The oxidative damage and antioxidant responses have been widely investigated in freshwater organisms, mainly in fish and some invertebrates but in freshwater snails are scarce. This study aimed to assess the oxidative stress exerted by potential toxicity of water from two rivers of the Mexican Atlantic Slope (Tecolutla and Tuxpan rivers) in a freshwater mollusk Physella acuta. Lipid peroxidation level and a battery of antioxidant enzymes (Superoxide dismutase, Catalase and Glutathione peroxidase) were measured in P. acuta. The results are contextualized from an ecological point of view, associating the bioassay results with water quality characteristics. Water samples were obtained from three study sites for each river (in two seasons: Northern wind and dry). Twelve water quality variables were analyzed, and an additional water sample was used to perform a static bioassay for 96 h with snails grown in laboratory. After the exposure, we assessed lipid peroxidation level and the antioxidant responses of P. acuta exposed to water of rivers, and the Integrated Biomarker Response was computed. The highest lipid peroxidation level occurred in organisms exposed to water during the Northern wind season in both rivers. During this season, in the Tecolutla river, the superoxide dismutase activity was able to counteract the lipid peroxidation process, representing an adaptive response. In contrast, in the Tuxpan river, the superoxide dismutase was unable to counteract that process, stimulating CAT and GPx activities. The Integrated Biomarker Response showed that the Tecolutla river had higher values in the upper reaches than the Tuxpan river, showing a decreasing downstream gradient in both seasons. In the Tuxpan river, during the Dry season, the IBR score showed an increasing downstream gradient. During the Northern wind season, the IBR was higher in the upper reaches of both rivers, possibly due to the increased materials transported by runoff from the catchment, which includes a complex mixture of xenobiotics that affects the health of the sentinel species and aquatic biota in general. Based on our results, Physella acuta is proposed as sentinel species.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Prostate Cancer Patients: Results From an Injection Technique Targeting the Index Lesion in the Prostate Gland
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectivesTo determine the accuracy of nodal staging in patients with prostate cancer (PCa) when (99) Tc-m-nanocolloid radiotracer is injected into an index lesion (IL). MethodsThis prospective study was conducted at our institution between June 2016 and October 2020. It included 64 patients with localized PCa with at least a 5% possibility for lymph node involvement in the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center nomogram, suitable for surgical treatment. All patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with IL and were pathologically confirmed. The day before surgery, transrectal ultrasound-guided injection (TRUS) of (99) Tc-m-nanocolloid into the IL was performed. Surgical procedures included radical prostatectomy (RP), sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), and extended pelvic lymphadenectomy (ePLND). Analysis was performed, including histopathological findings of RP, ePLND, and SLNB. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), false negative (FN), false positive (FP), diagnostic yield, and non-diagnostic rate were calculated. ResultsA total of 1,316 lymph nodes were excised, including 1,102 from the ePLND (83.7%) and 214 (16.3%) sentinel lymph nodes (SLN). 26 SLN were dissected outside the ePLND template. The final pathology demonstrated 46 (3.5%) lymph node metastasis, 31 (67.4%) in the SLNB and 15 (32.6%) in the non-SLN ePLND. At the patient level, 18 (28.1%) patients had pN1. With a mean follow-up of 33.1 months, 4/19 (21.1%) pN1 patients had undetectable PSA, and 3/19 (15.8%) had a PSA < 0.1 ng/mL. Lymph node dissection included 20.6 lymph nodes per patient (IQR 15-24.2), with 3.3 SLNB nodes per patient (IQR 2-4.2). PPV and NPV were 100 and 97.8%, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity were 94.4 and 100%, respectively. FN was 5.5% and FP was 4.3%. Diagnostic yields were 95.3% and the non-diagnostic rate was 4.7%. ConclusionRadiotracer injection into the prostate IL offers promising results for staging purposes in cases in which ePLND is considered. Negative SLNB is a predictor of negative ePLND. Patients with a limited burden of nodal metastasis have a significant chance of remaining free of biochemical recurrence at mid-term follow-up.

TI  - Satellite remote sensing of environmental variables can predict acoustic activity of an orthopteran assemblage
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is a promising method for biodiversity assessment, which allows for longer and less intrusive sampling when compared to traditional methods (e.g., collecting specimens), by using sound recordings as the primary data source. Insects have great potential as models for the study and monitoring of acoustic assemblages due to their sensitivity to environmental changes. Nevertheless, ecoacoustic studies focused on insects are still scarce when compared to more charismatic groups. Insects' acoustic activity patterns respond to environmental factors, like temperature, moonlight, and precipitation, but community acoustic perspectives have been barely explored. Here, we provide an example of the usefulness of PAM to track temporal patterns of acoustic activity for a nocturnal assemblage of insects (Orthoptera). We integrate satellite remote sensing and astronomically measured environmental factors at a local scale in an Andean Forest of Colombia and evaluate the acoustic response of orthopterans through automated model detections of their songs for nine weeks (March and April of 2020). We describe the acoustic frequency range and diel period for the calling song of each representative species. Three species overlapped in frequency and diel acoustics but inhabit different strata: canopy, understory, and ground surface level. Based on the acoustic frequency and activity, we identified three trends: (i) both sampled cricket species call at lower frequency for shorter periods of time (dusk); (ii) all sampled katydid species call at higher frequency for longer time periods, including later hours at night; and (iii) the diel acoustic activity span window seems to increase proportionally with dominant acoustic frequency, but further research is required. We also identified a dusk chorus in which all the species sing at the same time. To quantify the acoustic response to environmental factors, we calculated a beta regression with the singing activity as a response variable and moon phase, surface temperature and daily precipitation as explanatory variables. The response to the moon phase was significant for the katydids but not for the crickets, possibly due to differences in diel activity periods. Crickets are active during dusk, thus the effects of moonlight on acoustic activity are negligible. The response to precipitation was significant for the two crickets and not for the katydids, possibly because of higher likelihood of rain interrupting crickets' shorter diel activity period. Our study shows how the local survey of orthopteran acoustic assemblages, with a species taxonomic resolution coupled with remote-sensing environmental measurements can reveal responses to environmental factors. In addition, we demonstrate how satellite data might prove to be a useful alternative source of environmental data for community studies with geographical, financial, or other constraints.

TI  - Using distributed root soil moisture data to enhance the performance of rainfall thresholds for landslide warning
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rainfall-induced landslides are currently one of the most frequent disasters in China. Compared with rainfall, the increase of soil moisture and its continuous infiltration of soil are the direct factors leading to landslides. However, few researches have studied landslide forecasting taking the soil moisture into consideration. In addition, soil moisture data have an important depth attribute. Soil moisture in root zone is difficult to obtain, and the separate comparison of the impact of the root zone and shallow soil moisture on landslide is more scarce. After comparing the commonly used satellite data, this article chose the CLDAS-V2.0 data set as the source of soil moisture with the depths of 0-10 cm and 100-200 cm. One hundred and sixty-six rainfall-induced landslides that occurred in Tongzi and Xishui counties from February to July 2020 were studied. This paper first obtains the effective rainfall that has the strongest correlation with the landslide and then uses the effective rainfall to explore the best combination of rainfall and soil moisture, including separate modeling and joint modeling of rainfall and soil moisture. Then support vector machine, logistic regression and three decision tree models are developed to predict the landslides. The results show that the combined model of rainfall and soil moisture is better than the model that only considers rainfall or soil moisture, and the landslide forecasting accuracy is improved by more than 5%, which is about 30% higher than the traditional ED rainfall threshold method. Landslide prediction model is proposed to be used as a help for urban planning and government decision-making.

TI  - Automated avalanche mapping from SPOT 6/7 satellite imagery with deep learning: results, evaluation, potential and limitations
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatially dense and continuous information on avalanche occurrences is crucial for numerous safety-related applications such as avalanche warning, hazard zoning, hazard mitigation measures, forestry, risk management and numerical simulations. This information is today still collected in a non-systematic way by observers in the field. Current research has explored the application of remote sensing technology to fill this information gap by providing spatially continuous information on avalanche occurrences over large regions. Previous investigations have confirmed the high potential of avalanche mapping from remotely sensed imagery to complement existing databases. Currently, the bottleneck for fast data provision from optical data is the time-consuming manual mapping. In our study we deploy a slightly adapted DeepLabV3+, a state-of-the-art deep learning model, to automatically identify and map avalanches in SPOT 6/7 imagery from 24 January 2018 and 16 January 2019. We relied on 24 778 manually annotated avalanche polygons split into geographically disjointed regions for training, validating and testing. Additionally, we investigate generalization ability by testing our best model configuration on SPOT 6/7 data from 6 January 2018 and comparing it to avalanches we manually annotated for that purpose. To assess the quality of the model results, we investigate the probability of detection (POD), the positive predictive value (PPV) and the F1 score. Additionally, we assessed the reproducibility of manually annotated avalanches in a small subset of our data. We achieved an average POD of 0.610, PPV of 0.668 and an F1 score of 0.625 in our test areas and found an F1 score in the same range for avalanche outlines annotated by different experts. Our model and approach are an important step towards a fast and comprehensive documentation of avalanche periods from optical satellite imagery in the future, complementing existing avalanche databases. This will have a large impact on safety-related applications, making mountain regions safer.

TI  - Improving remote sensing retrieval of global ocean transparency with optical water classification
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ocean water transparency is an important indicator to measure the productivity of marine ecosystems, and it has great impact on phytoplankton biomass and community structure. Secchi disk depth (Zsd) is a traditional measure of water transparency. With the development of satellite remote sensing technology, inversion through empirical model or semi-analytical model has become an effective and efficient means to obtain ocean Zsd. In recent years, ocean parameter inversions based on water classification become an ongoing trend. Jia et al. (2021) constructed a fuzzy-logic optical water type scheme (i.e., U-OWT) for the global oceans and multi satellite sensors, which was a potential water classification template for remote sensing inversion of ocean Zsd. Using U-OWT as the water classification basis, and by collecting 613 global ocean distributed SeaWiFS (Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor) Rrs and Zsd (with the range of 0.3-44.3 m) in-situ matchups, this study explored the optimal Zsd empirical models for each optical water type and each water trophic state respectively. As a result, a class-based Zsd hybrid empirical model (abbreviated as the Zsd-OWT model) was developed, which had relative high inversion accuracy over the entire Zsd range (MAPE = 8.25 %, RMSE = 0.65 m, bias = - 0.03 m). Specifically, the Zsd-OWT model conducted the global empirical inversion for the oligotrophic water classes and the class-based hard fusion empirical inversions for the mesotrophic and the eutrophic water classes. Although the Zsd-OWT model was designed for SeaWiFS sensor, it still has the potential to be migrated to other multispectral sensors with similar band settings.

TI  - Integrating Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 optical imagery with a crop structure dynamics model to track crop condition
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites are delivering data at the spatial resolutions and geographies needed for operational crop monitoring. Of particular interest, Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data in Single Look Complex (SLC) format can be processed to provide polarimetric parameters sensitive to crop development. This study created a Sentinel-1 based SAR vegetation index for canola, calibrated to Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) (SAR(cal)-NDVI) values calculated from Sentinel-2. A Random Forest Regressor (RFR) modelled the SAR(cal)-NDVI, from four selected polarimetric features (degree of linear polarization (DoLP), normalized Shannon entropy (SE), the second eigenvalue of the coherency matrix (l2) and the ellipticity angle (chi)). The coefficient of determination (R-2) between the Sentinel-2 NDVI and the SAR(cal)-NDVI was 0.89. RFR-generated SAR(cal)-NDVI estimates, based on the four SLC generated polarimetric parameters, were then used with a Canopy Structure Dynamics Model (CSDM) and with Growing Degree Days (GDD) to estimate the condition of canola at a daily time step. The SAR(cal)-NDVI time series estimated from the CSDM model was correlated to the ground measured biomass. During the rapid accumulation of biomass from early to mid-season, correlations of the SAR(cal)-NDVI to wet biomass were strong (R-2 of 0.88). Correlations were still significant albeit weaker during pod development and throughout the period of canola senescence (R-2 of 0.42). As climate variability drives uncertainty in the agricultural sector, sensors like the Sentinels can be leveraged to track changes in crop acreages and crop productivity. The next step in this research is to extend to other economically important crops such as corn, soybeans and wheat and test the ability of a Sentinel-1-based vegetation index to inform crop yield estimates.

TI  - Evaluation of alteration zones around Parmagasu copper indication, Kuh Zar, Damghan, Iran, using ASTER satellite data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Parmagasu copper indication is located 100 km southeast of Damghan city, Iran. Copper, gold, Pb, and Fe mineralizations have occurred in the region, in the Eocene trachyandesite-andesite porphyry host rocks. This study attempts to identify alteration zones and their expansions to comprehend the origin of mineralizations and their distribution pattern in the area. The phyllic alteration zone is surrounded by more extensive propylitic alteration. The argillic zone is less widespread than the other alteration zones and overlaps with the phyllic zone. The Band Ratio, Principal Component Analysis, Independent Component Analysis, and Spectral Angle Mapper remarkably identified the alteration zones among the employed methodologies. The validity of the results was proved by field observations, microscopic investigations, and the computed overall accuracy for the outcomes of supervised classification. This investigation confirms the importance of faults in the occurrence of alteration in the Kuh Zar area.

TI  - Are patients receiving recommended bone protection therapy after a non- hip fracture? A retrospective study of the Fracture Liaison Service at Counties Manukau District Health Board
T2  - NEW ZEALAND MEDICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - AIM: To review the Fracture Liaison Service (FLS) recommendations for bone protection therapy and assess treatment implementation in the community. METHOD: All patients screened from 1 January to 31 March 2019 at Counties Manukau District Health Board were evaluated. Exclusion criteria included death within six months following sentinel fracture, and hip fractures, which are studied elsewhere. Patient risk factors assessed included age, gender, type of fracture, history of previous fracture, and dual X-ray absorptiometry scan results if performed. If bone protection therapy was recommended, electronic dispensing records were utilised as a proxy for treatment initiation. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-nine of the 238 patients referred were included. Thirty-seven patients had evidence of a previous fragility fracture, with thirteen patients not on bone protection treatment following their prior fracture. Of the 99 patients in the study recommended bone protection therapy, 31.3% (n=31) did not have this dispensed at six months following written FLS assessment. Three of thirteen patients with a previous fragility fracture and not on bone protection treatment, still did not have this dispensed at six months. CONCLUSION: A high proportion of patients recommended bone protection therapy did not receive this in a timely manner, including patients with a history of repeated fracture.

T2  - PROGRESS IN EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - The Vietnamese Mekong Delta has been devastatingly impacted by climate change coupled with sea level rise and natural hazards. As a result, salinity intrusion has become a pressing issue in the coastal provinces of the Mekong Delta in recent years. This environmental problem has called a great attention from the global scientists as demonstrated by the paper Nguyen et al. (Prog Earth Planet Sci 7:1, 2020. 10.1186/s40645-019-0311-0) "Soil salinity assessment by using an indicator derived from Landsat 8 OLI data: A case study in the Tra Vinh, Mekong Delta, Vietnam" (reached 27 k accesses as of July 31, 2022). Recently, Silvestri et al. (PEPS, 2022) have commented on Nguyen et al. (2020) article with three main points highlighted: (1) Within the coastal portion of the Mekong Delta, extensively ponded due to widespread shrimp farming, about 90% of Landsat 8 pixels are fully or partially covered by water so that Landsat 8 OLI spatial resolution is not suitable to distinguish between ponded and non-ponded areas; (2) The decreased near-infrared (NIR) reflectance ascribed to increased soil salinity is instead due to the presence of water in Landsat 8 mixed pixels; and (3) NIR reflectance is equally reduced independently of whether the water ponding area is salt or freshwater. We appreciate Silvestri et al. (2022) for their correspondence regarding our 2020 article (Nguyen et al. 2020) where we showed the capacity of using freely accessible Landsat 8 OLI image for the rapid soil salinity detection at the top soil layer in the agricultural land that is of valuable information for agricultural activities. We conducted field survey and collected the soil samples during the dry season at different agricultural soil types. Notably, the soil samples were collected at the same time with the satellite passing over the study area. The soil salinity derived from Landsat 8 is in line with the analysis from in situ data and consistent with the findings of previous studies. Importantly, two points are stressed in this reply: (1) The goal of our study is to utilize the freely accessible data source with rapid method of mapping soil salinity to investigate the salinity in the agricultural land, but not in the water body. Therefore, it has been a serious mistake to state that 90% of Landsat 8 pixels are fully or partially covered by water as claimed in Silvestri et al. (2022); and (2) The Tra Vinh Province has recorded the highest salinity level normally in March or April every year when the rainfall exhibits the lowest of the year, and at this time, most of the water in the river/canal is affected by saline intrusion. Thus, it is advised that Silvestri et al. (2022) should use the images acquired in March or April rather than random months.

TI  - Associations of parks, greenness, and blue space with cardiovascular and respiratory disease hospitalization in the US Medicare cohort
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural environments have been linked to decreased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and respiratory disease (RSD) mortality. However, few cohort studies have looked at associations of natural environments with CVD or RSD hospitalization. The aim of this study was to evaluate these associations in a cohort of U.S. Medicare beneficiaries (similar to 63 million individuals). Our open cohort included all fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries (2000-2016), aged >= 65, living in the contiguous U.S. We assessed zip code-level park cover based on the United States Geological Survey Protected Areas Database, average greenness (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, NDVI), and percent blue space cover based on Landsat satellite images. Cox-equivalent Poisson models were used to estimate associations of the exposures with first CVD and RSD hospitalization in the full cohort and among those living in urban zip codes (>= 1000 persons/mile(2)). NDVI was weakly negatively correlated with percent park cover (Spearman rho = -0.23) and not correlated with percent blue space (Spearman rho = 0.00). After adjustment for potential confounders, percent park cover was not associated with CVD or RSD hospitalization in the full or urban population. An IQR (0.27) increase in NDVI was negatively associated with CVD (HR: 0.97, 95%CI: 0.96, 0.97), but not with RSD hospitalization (HR: 0.99, 95%CI: 0.98, 1.00). In urban zip codes, an IQR increase in NDVI was positively associated with RSD hospitalization (HR: 1.02, 95%CI: 1.00, 1.03). In stratified analyses, percent park cover was negatively associated with CVD and RSD hospitalization for Medicaid eligible individuals and individuals living in low socioeconomic status neighborhoods in the urban population. We observed no associations of percent blue space cover with CVD or RSD hospitalization. This study suggests that natural environments may benefit cardiorespiratory health; however, benefits may be limited to certain contexts and certain health outcomes.

M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To determine the cumulative incidence and natural history of axillary web syndrome (AWS) and its related postoperative risk for phys-ical impairments in a cohort of women followed for 5 years post breast cancer surgery.Design: Prospective, longitudinal study.Setting: Academic health center.Participants: Women (N=36) with and without AWS after breast cancer surgery with sentinel node biopsy or axillary lymph node dissection.Interventions: Not applicable.Main Outcome Measures: Participants were assessed for AWS, shoulder goniometric flexion and abduction range of motion, function (Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand), lymphedema (bioimpedance spectroscopy, girth measures, tissue dielectric constant), and pain (visual analog scale) at 2, 4, 12, and 78 weeks and 5 years after breast cancer surgery. Analysis of variance compared range of motion, function, lymphedema, and pain in women identified with AWS with those without AWS across visits. Univariate logistic regression assessed if AWS was a risk factor for physical impairment at 5 years.Results: The cumulative incidence of AWS was 57%. Fifty percent (14/28) of the women who completed all study visits had signs of AWS at 5 years. Abduction active range of motion was significantly lower in women with AWS at 2 and 4 weeks post surgery. AWS was identified as a risk factor for reduced shoulder motion at 5 years. Regardless of AWS, 75% of the women experienced 1 or more upper extremity physical impair-ments at 5 years, which is an increase from 66% at 78 weeks in the same cohort.Conclusions: AWS is associated with reduced shoulder range of motion in the early postoperative time period, can persist for 5 years after breast cancer surgery, and increases the risk of long-term reduced shoulder range of motion. Long-term physical issues are apparent after breast cancer surgery regardless of AWS.

TI  - Enhancing performance of multi-temporal tropical river landform classification through downscaling approaches
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-temporal remote sensing imagery has the potential to classify river landforms to reconstruct the evolutionary trajectory of river morphologies. Whilst open-access archives of high spatial resolution imagery are increasingly available from satellite sensors, such as Sentinel-2, there remains a fundamental challenge of maximising the utility of information in each band whilst maintaining a sufficiently fine resolution to identify landforms. Although image fusion and downscaling methods on Sentinel-2 imagery have been investigated for many years, there is a need to assess their performance for multi-temporal object-based river landform classification. This investigation first compared three downscaling methods: area to point regression kriging (ATPRK), super-resolution based on Sen2Res, and nearest neighbour resampling. We assessed performance of the three downscaling methods by accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score. ATPRK was the optimal downscaling approach, achieving an overall accuracy of 0.861. We successively engaged a set of experiments to determine an optimal training model, exploring single and multi-date scenarios. We find that not only does remote sensing imagery with better quality improve river landform classification performance, but multi-date datasets for establishing machine learning models should be considered for contributing higher classification accuracy. This paper presents a workflow for automated river landform recognition that could be applied to other tropical rivers with similar hydro-geomorphological characteristics.

TI  - Earlier ice loss accelerates lake warming in the Northern Hemisphere
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - How lake temperatures are responding to widespread changes in lake ice remains unclear. Here the authors show the excess lake warming during the ice-off and ice-on month due to earlier ice loss and later ice formation across the Northern Hemisphere.How lake temperatures across large geographic regions are responding to widespread alterations in ice phenology (i.e., the timing of seasonal ice formation and loss) remains unclear. Here, we analyse satellite data and global-scale simulations to investigate the contribution of long-term variations in the seasonality of lake ice to surface water temperature trends across the Northern Hemisphere. Our analysis suggests a widespread excess lake surface warming during the months of ice-off which is, on average, 1.4 times that calculated during the open-water season. This excess warming is influenced predominantly by an 8-day advancement in the average timing of ice break-up from 1979 to 2020. Until the permanent loss of lake ice in the future, excess lake warming may be further amplified due to projected future alterations in lake ice phenology. Excess lake warming will likely alter within-lake physical and biogeochemical processes with numerous implications for lake ecosystems.

TI  - Performance evaluation of pansharpening Sentinel 2A imagery for informal settlement identification by spectral-textural features
T2  - Transactions of the Royal Society of South Africa
M3  - Article
AB  - The diversity of informal settlement morphologies across locales makes their mapping inherently challenging in heterogeneous urban landscapes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of pansharpening techniques on Sentinel 2A data, and textural features, in enhancing informal settlement identification accuracy in a fragmented urban environment. Brovey transform, intensity, hue and saturation transform, Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI), simple mean, and Gram-Schmidt techniques were employed to pansharpen multispectral bands of Sentinel 2A, bands 5, 6, and 7 in the first group, and bands 8A, 11 and 12 in another, using an average of bands 4 and 8 as the panchromatic band. The main objective was to investigate the efficacy of pansharpening Sentinel 2A imagery and texture analysis in automated mapping of morphologically varied informal settlements. An evaluation of the quality of fused images was undertaken through computation of the correlation between the spectral values of the original multispectral and pansharpened image. Grey-level-co-occurrence matrix texture features were extracted from the pansharpened images, and subsequently incorporated in the classification process, using a support vector machine classifier. Our results confirm that the Gram-Schmidt fusion technique yielded the highest informal settlement identification accuracy (F-score 95.2%; overall accuracy 91.8%). The experimental results demonstrated the potential of pansharpening Sentinel 2A, and the added value of image texture for a more nuanced characterisation of informal settlements.

TI  - Daily Ten-ST-GEE: An open access and fully automated 10-m LST downscaling system
T2  - COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In remote sensing applications, data fusion is a combination of satellite images from different sources, aimed to improve the spatial and/or temporal resolution of the final output. This process also named spatial sharpening or spatial downscaling is required in several Land Surface Temperature-based (LST) studies, ranging from water table estimations and urban heating assessments to volcano activity monitoring. In this study, we propose a Google Earth Engine-based (GEE) daily 10-m LST retrieval system, named daily Ten-ST-GEE. It combines both MODIS and Sentinel-2 satellite products and uses the robust least squares statistical approach for data fusion. We validate the daily Ten-ST-GEE against two airborne TIR images over the Hat Creek region, in California, USA with a MAE of 2.27 degrees C. The cross-evaluation over the 1-km MODIS LST and the inter-comparison to the 30-m L8 LST in six different sites across the globe showed very promising results (i.e., average MAE less than 1 degrees C). As the daily Ten-ST-GEE is fully-automated, open-source, user-friendly and freely-accessible, it can be portable to other regions with diverse climatic regimes. This would greatly improve the downscaling initiatives and provide the scientific community with much-needed downscaled LST information.

TI  - Multi scale feature extraction network with machine learning algorithms for water body extraction from remote sensing images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water Body Extraction (WBE) is a challenging task in remote sensing, owing to the complexity of recognizing surface body objects with rich texture, spatial, spectral, temporal, and radiometric features. The use of spectral indices has shown to be successful in separating surface water from its surroundings at the cost of knowledge of appropriate threshold values. In the absence of knowledge on threshold values, extracting the water from remote sensing data is challenging, which is addressed by several Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms. However, the effectiveness of both ML and DL classifications is witnessed from visual features to semantic categories at the cost of distinct recognition between the water body and non-water body features. In this paper, a novel Multi Scale Feature Extraction Network (MSFEN) for extracting the pixel-level features from medium resolution remote sensing images is proposed and used traditional ML classifiers to extract the surface water bodies using pixel-level features extracted by MSFEN. The proposed framework is trained and tested on Linear Imaging Self Scanning Sensor - III (LISS-III) multispectral satellite images over major water reservoirs in Tamilnadu, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, and Odisha. Experimental results indicate that the proposed model MSFEN+SVM provides accurate extraction results by outperforming the existing state-of-the-art models (Fully Convolutional Network (FCN), Unet, SegNet, Multi Scale Convolutional Neural Network (MSCNN), Deepwater Map, Pyramid Scene Parsing Network (PSPNet), Improved PSPNet, Multi-scale Water Extraction Convolutional Neural Network (MWEN) and Multi-Scale Lake Water Extraction Network (MSLWENet) in terms of performance metrics considered.

TI  - Arctic biogeochemical and optical properties of dissolved organic matter across river to sea gradients
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Arctic landscapes are warming and becoming wetter due to changes in precipitation and the timing of snowmelt which consequently alters seasonal runoff and river discharge patterns. These changes in hydrology lead to increased mobilization and transport of terrestrial dissolved organic matter (DOM) to Arctic coastal seas where significant impacts on biogeochemical cycling can occur. Here, we present measurements of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and chromophoric DOM (CDOM) in the Yukon River-to-Bering Sea system and two river plumes on the Alaska North Slope which flow into the Beaufort Sea. Our sampling characterized optical and biogeochemical properties of DOM during high and low river discharge periods for the Yukon River-Bering Sea system. The average DOC concentration at the multiple Yukon River mouths ranged from a high of 10.36 mg C L-1 during the ascending limb of the 2019 freshet (late May), 6.4 mg C L-1 during the descending limb of the 2019 freshet (late June), and a low of 3.86 mg C L-1 during low river discharge in August 2018. CDOM absorption coefficient at 412 nm (a(CDOM)(412)) averaged 8.23 m(-1), 5.07 m(-1), and 1.9 m(-1), respectively. Several approaches to model DOC concentration based on its relationship with CDOM properties demonstrated cross-system seasonal and spatial robustness for these Arctic coastal systems despite spanning an order of magnitude decrease in DOC concentration from the lower Yukon River to the Northern Bering Sea as well as the North Slope systems. "Snapshot" fluxes of DOC and CDOM across the Yukon River Delta to Norton Sound were calculated from our measurements and modeled water fluxes forced with upstream USGS river gauge data. Our findings suggest that during high river flow, DOM reaches the delta largely unaltered by inputs or physical and biogeochemical processing and that the transformations of Yukon River DOM largely occur in the plume. However, during low summer discharge, multiple processes including local precipitation events, microbial decomposition, photochemistry, and likely others can alter the DOM properties within the lower Yukon River and Delta prior to flowing into Norton Sound.

TI  - Dataset about the adoption of winter cover crops at the municipality level for mainland France
T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Winter soil cover by vegetation is associated with multiple benefits, such as increasing soil carbon storage and reducing erosion and nutrient leaching. This dataset provides an esti-mate of winter soil cover before spring-sown crops at mu-nicipality level for mainland France for two years (2018 and 2019). These estimates were obtained through the monitor-ing of all plots with spring-sown crops, declared within the context of the European Common Agricultural Policy. Detec-tion of plots with winter soil cover was achieved through the analysis of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series, computed from Sentinel-2 multispectral images. For this dataset, it was considered that soil cover had to ex-ceed 50% for a plot to be considered as covered by vegeta-tion. Based on the literature, this corresponds to a threshold NDVI value between 0.45 and 0.59. To allow for sensitivity and uncertainty analyses for future studies that may be con-ducted using these data, three estimates of winter soil cover are given: minimum (based on the cultivated area exceeding the upper NDVI threshold of 0.59), maximum (considering the lower NDVI threshold of 0.45) and best estimate (mean NDVI threshold of 0.52). This dataset may be useful primar-ily to researchers working on biogeochemical cycle modeling or to government agencies, as several public policies (such as the Nitrates Directive) aim at developing winter cover crops.(c) 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Evaluating phenological trends of different vegetation types in response to climate change over the Rajmahal Hills in India during 2001-2019
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study employed Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) based Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) dataset to track vegetation phenological trends in response to climate change activity over the Rajmahal Hills in India during 2001-2019. Two key phenological metrics (i.e., start of the season (SOS), and end of the season (EOS)) were estimated, and their long-term trends were studied for each vegetation type. The study findings revealed that the start of season (SOS) generally occurred during late March (Julian day (JD) 81) to early April (JD 97), whilst the end of season (EOS) has been predominantly observed during early March (JD 65) to end of March (JD 81). Furthermore, the SOS and EOS of most vegetation types (except WSV and MF) showed a delaying trend during 2001-2010 at the rate of 0.009-0.29 day year(-1); 0.03-0.33 day year(-1), respectively. Conversely, the SOS and EOS of all the vegetation types (except for MF) showed an advancing trend during 2010-2019 at the rate of 0.06-0.24 day year(-1); 0.17-0.23 day year(-1), respectively. The changes in the trends of SOS and EOS of different vegetation types mainly were perceived due to local climate change activity (changes in precipitation and temperature pattern).

T2  - PROGRESS IN EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Nguyen et al. (Prog Earth Planet Sci 7:1, 2020. ) suggest that Landsat 8 OLI can be used to map and monitor soil salinity in the coastal zone of the Mekong River Delta. The authors use empirical correlations between the near-infrared (NIR) band, or vegetation indexes containing the NIR band, and soil salinity. We show that within the coastal portion of the Mekong Delta, extensively ponded due to widespread shrimp farming, about 90% of Landsat 8 pixels are fully or partially covered by water. We then find that, due to strong NIR radiation absorption, NIR reflectance from ponded pixels decreases linearly with increasing water percentage cover, while no significant correlation is found between reflectance and soil salinity. Through detailed new analyses, we conclude that NIR reflectance attenuation cannot be ascribed to vegetation stress caused by soil salinity, but rather to the presence of water ponds. We also show that a similar behavior exists in ponded freshwater inland areas, confirming that the NIR absorption exerted by water is independent of salinity.

TI  - Review article: Global monitoring of snow water equivalent using high-frequency radar remote sensing
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Review
AB  - Seasonal snow cover is the largest single component of the cryosphere in areal extent, covering an average of 46 x 10(6) km(2) of Earth's surface (31 % of the land area) each year, and is thus an important expression and driver of the Earth's climate. In recent years, Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover has been declining at about the same rate (similar to -13 % per decade) as Arctic summer sea ice. More than one-sixth of the world's population relies on seasonal snowpack and glaciers for a water supply that is likely to decrease this century. Snow is also a critical component of Earth's cold regions' ecosystems, in which wildlife, vegetation, and snow are strongly interconnected. Snow water equivalent (SWE) describes the quantity of water stored as snow on the land surface and is of fundamental importance to water, energy, and geochemical cycles. Quality global SWE estimates are lacking. Given the vast seasonal extent combined with the spatially variable nature of snow distribution at regional and local scales, surface observations are not able to provide sufficient SWE information. Satellite observations presently cannot provide SWE information at the spatial and temporal resolutions required to address science and high-socio-economic-value applications such as water resource management and streamflow forecasting. In this paper, we review the potential contribution of X- and Ku-band syn- thetic aperture radar (S AR) for global monitoring of SWE. SAR can image the surface during both day and night regardless of cloud cover, allowing high-frequency revisit at high spatial resolution as demonstrated by missions such as Sentinel-1. The physical basis for estimating SWE from X- and Ku-band radar measurements at local scales is volume scattering by millimeter-scale snow grains. Inference of global snow properties from SAR requires an interdisciplinary approach based on field observations of snow microstructure, physical snow modeling, electromagnetic theory, and retrieval strategies over a range of scales. New field measurement capabilities have enabled significant advances in understanding snow microstructure such as grain size, density, and layering. We describe radar interactions with snowcovered landscapes, the small but rapidly growing number of field datasets used to evaluate retrieval algorithms, the characterization of snowpack properties using radar measurements, and the refinement of retrieval algorithms via synergy with other microwave remote sensing approaches. This review serves to inform the broader snow research, monitoring, and application communities on progress made in recent decades and sets the stage for a new era in SWE remote sensing from SAR measurements.

TI  - Research on joint inversion of volcanic shortwave infrared emissivity and temperature based on day and night images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to solve the problem of inaccurate emissivity obtained by empirical or experimental measurements in traditional volcanic inversion methods, which leads to the discrepancy between the temperature inversion results and the actual temperature, this paper constructs a joint inversion model of volcanic temperature and emissivity, and solves the volcanic temperature and emissivity simultaneously from the image element scale.In order to obtain the two unknown parameters of volcanic temperature and emissivity simultaneously, the study image element is assumed to be a pure image element and Lambertian body, and based on the blackbody radiation law and energy conservation law, the volcanic radiation energy transfer equation under different irradiance conditions is established and solved jointly. In this paper, the study area is HalemaModified Letter Turned CommaumaModified Letter Turned Commau crater in Hawaii, and the short-wave infrared band of Landsat 8 satellite day and night remote sensing images with an imaging interval of 36 hours are used as the study data, and the temperature and emissivity are calculated using the golden mean and parabolic interpolation method with the same emissivity of the same image element in both scenes and the temperature approximation as the constraints. The results are as follows: the temperature inversion of the study area has a banding phenomenon, the temperature of the lava lake is 800-1050 K and the emissivity is 0.5-0.7; the temperature of the crater surface outside the lava lake is 500-800 K and the emissivity is 0.7-1.0. The inversion results are consistent with the actual situation. The results show that the method can realize the simultaneous inversion of volcanic temperature and emissivity parameters on the image element scale, which provides a new method for the inversion of volcanic temperature and emissivity.

TI  - Spatio-temporal fire detection based on brightness temperature change in Himawari-8 images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The geostationary satellite Himawari-8 has become the primary source for fire remote-sensing detection because of its advantages of high frequency, large width and easy access. To solve the problem of difficulty in small fire detection and with a high omission on Himawari-8 image, a spatio-temporal fire detection (STFD) method based on Himawari-8 image brightness temperature change is proposed. Calculate the mean value difference of brightness temperature between multi-time series images before the target time, and use the least square model to fit the ideal mean value difference of brightness temperature between the target time and the image at the previous time. Then, the difference value of the actual brightness temperature between the target time and the last image time is calculated. The initial brightness temperature change pixels are obtained by the comparative analysis method. Based on the spatial statistical characteristics, the potential fire point is determined by the brightness temperature value ratio of the image, temperature mean and standard temperature deviation. Then, combined with the spatio-temporal context information, the persistent fire points are detected according to the threshold conditions to supplement undetected persistent fires. The results of experiments on the Himawari-8 images in Guizhou, China and southwestern Australia indicate that STFD exhibits superior performance on small fire detection points, and the accuracy is better than the several traditional methods.

T2  - RENEWABLE ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The simulation of solar radiation is of great significance to the sustainable development of energy, engineering, and many other fields. The Himawari series of satellites has the characteristics of high temporal, spatial resolution, which helps to solve the problem of insufficient ground radiation observation in China. However, the accuracy of this data needs to be further improved. Thus, four machine learning models with 13 ground and satellite-based input combinations were used to simulate daily solar radiation. The results showed that the simulation accuracy of the model based on a combination of meteorological data from different sources was significantly improved compared with the model based on single-source data. The RMSE was 32.4% and 44.6% lower than those of the model based on the ground meteorological stations data and the model based on the satellite data, respectively. SVM13 model showed the optimal simulation performance compared with other models, and its RMSE and R2 were 1.732 MJ m(-2) day(-1) and 0.939 in each climate region, respectively. Overall, we conclude that the SVM13 model is the most suitable model, and the model with a complex combination of more meteorological factors as input has higher simulation accuracy than the model with a relatively simple input combination.

TI  - Sentinel-2 Data for Land Use Mapping: Comparing Different Supervised Classifications in Semi-Arid Areas
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping and monitoring land use (LU) changes is one of the most effective ways to understand and manage land transformation. The main objectives of this study were to classify LU using supervised classification methods and to assess the effectiveness of various machine learning methods. The current investigation was conducted in the Nord-Est area of Tunisia, and an optical satellite image covering the study area was acquired from Sentinel-2. For LU mapping, we tested three machine learning models algorithms: Random Forest (RF), K-Dimensional Trees K-Nearest Neighbors (KDTree-KNN) and Minimum Distance Classification (MDC). According to our research, the RF classification provided a better result than other classification models. RF classification exhibited the best values of overall accuracy, kappa, recall, precision and RMSE, with 99.54%, 0.98%, 0.98%, 0.98% and 0.23%, respectively. However, low precision was observed for the MDC method (RMSE = 1.15). The results were more intriguing since they highlighted the value of the bare soil index as a covariate for LU mapping. Our results suggest that Sentinel-2 combined with RF classification is efficient for creating a LU map.

TI  - Cross-Comparison between Sun-Synchronized and Geostationary Satellite-Derived Land Surface Temperature: A Case Study in Hong Kong
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Harmonization of satellite imagery provides a good opportunity for studying land surface temperature (LST) as well as the urban heat island effect. However, it is challenging to use the harmonized data for the study of LST due to the systematic bias between the LSTs from different satellites, which is highly influenced by sensor differences and the compatibility of LST retrieval algorithms. To fill this research gap, this study proposes the comparison of different LST images retrieved from various satellites that focus on Hong Kong, China, by applying diverse retrieval algorithms. LST images generated from Landsat-8 using the mono-window algorithm (MWA(L8)) and split-window algorithm (SWA(L8)) would be compared with the LST estimations from Sentinel-3 SLSTR and Himawari-8 using the split-window algorithm (SWA(S3) and SWA(H8)). Intercomparison will also be performed through segregated groups of different land use classes both during the daytime and nighttime. Results indicate that there is a significant difference among the quantitative distribution of the LST data generated from these three satellites, with average bias of up to -1.80 K when SWA(H8) was compared with MWA(L8), despite having similar spatial patterns of the LST images. The findings also suggest that retrieval algorithms and the dominant land use class in the study area would affect the accuracy of image-fusion techniques. The results from the day and nighttime comparisons revealed that there is a significant difference between day and nighttime LSTs, with nighttime LSTs from different satellite sensors more consistent than the daytime LSTs. This emphasizes the need to incorporate as much night-time LST data as available when predicting or optimizing fine-scale LSTs in the nighttime, so as to minimize the bias. The framework designed by this study will serve as a guideline towards efficient spatial optimization and harmonized use of LSTs when utilizing different satellite images associated with an array of land covers and at different times of the day.

TI  - Introducing ARTMO's Machine-Learning Classification Algorithms Toolbox: Application to Plant-Type Detection in a Semi-Steppe Iranian Landscape
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate plant-type (PT) detection forms an important basis for sustainable land management maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem services. In this sense, Sentinel-2 satellite images of the Copernicus program offer spatial, spectral, temporal, and radiometric characteristics with great potential for mapping and monitoring PTs. In addition, the selection of a best-performing algorithm needs to be considered for obtaining PT classification as accurate as possible . To date, no freely downloadable toolbox exists that brings the diversity of the latest supervised machine-learning classification algorithms (MLCAs) together into a single intuitive user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI). To fill this gap and to facilitate and automate the usage of MLCAs, here we present a novel GUI software package that allows systematically training, validating, and applying pixel-based MLCA models to remote sensing imagery. The so-called MLCA toolbox has been integrated within ARTMO's software framework developed in Matlab which implements most of the state-of-the-art methods in the machine learning community. To demonstrate its utility, we chose a heterogeneous case study scene, a landscape in Southwest Iran to map PTs. In this area, four main PTs were identified, consisting of shrub land, grass land, semi-shrub land, and shrub land-grass land vegetation. Having developed 21 MLCAs using the same training and validation, datasets led to varying accuracy results. Gaussian process classifier (GPC) was validated as the top-performing classifier, with an overall accuracy (OA) of 90%. GPC follows a Laplace approximation to the Gaussian likelihood under the supervised classification framework, emerging as a very competitive alternative to common MLCAs. Random forests resulted in the second-best performance with an OA of 86%. Two other types of ensemble-learning algorithms, i.e., tree-ensemble learning (bagging) and decision tree (with error-correcting output codes), yielded an OA of 83% and 82%, respectively. Following, thirteen classifiers reported OA between 70% and 80%, and the remaining four classifiers reported an OA below 70%. We conclude that GPC substantially outperformed all classifiers, and thus, provides enormous potential for the classification of a diversity of land-cover types. In addition, its probabilistic formulation provides valuable band ranking information, as well as associated predictive variance at a pixel level. Nevertheless, as these are supervised (data-driven) classifiers, performances depend on the entered training data, meaning that an assessment of all MLCAs is crucial for any application. Our analysis demonstrated the efficacy of ARTMO's MLCA toolbox for an automated evaluation of the classifiers and subsequent thematic mapping.

TI  - Land surface temperature assimilation into a soil moisture-temperature model for retrieving farm-scale root zone soil moisture
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermal infrared remote sensing have been extensively applied to estimate global- or regional- extent surface soil moisture. Meanwhile, potentials of the remotely sensed data for farm-scale retrieval of root zone soil moisture (RZSM) as well as estimation of soil hydraulic parameters, have been rarely investigated. Using Ensemble Kalman Filter, we propose a new methodology to assimilate land surface temperature (LST) of both MODIS and LANDSAT-8, into the soil temperature module of HYDRUS-1D model. The main objectives are to estimate soil hydraulic parameters and to retrieve RZSM with high spatiotemporal resolution independent of any in-situ measurements of soil temperature or moisture. However, we consider some modeling scenarios by which we assimilate in-situ measurements of soil moisture into the soil moisture module of the HYDRUS-1D model to provide a reference to compare with results of the LST assimilation scenarios. We apply the proposed methodology to a farm located in Moghan irrigation district, Ardabil province of Iran, which has in-situ soil moisture measurements. Even in the least accurate scenario of ours by which MODIS-LST was assimilated, RMSE varies in the range of 0.012-0.013 cm(3)center dot cm(-3) demonstrated to be superior compared to preceding recent works in the literature of satellite soil moisture retrieval. Moreover, the scenario of assimilating LANDSAT-LST data leads to higher parameter uncertainty compared to the assimilation of solely in-situ soil moisture or MODIS-LST which is related to higher temporal resolution of both in-situ and MODIS data compared to LANDSAT data and the error stems from the algorithm of deriving LANDSAT-LST. Accordingly, our study recommend that assimilation of the satellite-based land surface temperature of both LANDSAT-8 and MODIS are appropriate alternatives for expensive in-situ measurement.

TI  - Land Use and Land Cover Change Analysis of the Baroiyadhala National Park Using Remote Sensing and GIS
T2  - FORESTIST
M3  - Article
AB  - Baroiyadhala National Park is one of the important national parks which protects undisturbed tropical forests. The study analyzes land use and land cover change of this national park from 1978 to 2019 using Landsat MSS, Landsat TM, and Landsat OLI-TIRS images. ERDAS Imagine 2015 and ArcMap 10.4 were used to process five multi-temporal satellite images, and the maximum likelihood classification algorithm was used to derive supervised land use classification. The protected area has been classified into five land use/cover classes which are forest, agriculture, bare land, settlement, and water body. The overall accuracy for the five images ranged from 83% to 90%. According to Landsat imagery analysis, 124.78 ha of forest area changed to barren land and 66.91 ha of area changed to settlement from 1978 to 2019. On the other hand, 174.25 ha of bare land and 79.03 ha of agricultural land changed to forest area from the base year. Overall, 2.79% of forest coverage decreased over the last 41 years. From 1978 to 2019, settlement expanded rapidly from 1.09% to 5.75%. From the image analysis of 2019, forest covered 2057 ha area, agriculture covered 146.69 ha area, bare land covered 299.75 ha area, the settlement covered 168.68 ha area, and water body covered 261.45 ha area. Cross classification approach was performed to monitor the land conversion rate and pattern within the period. The study will provide baseline information to the park managers and decision-makers to take proper initiatives and formulate a management plan.

TI  - Mangrove gain and its implications on carbon stock in Sanquianga National Natural Park in Colombia
T2  - ECOSISTEMAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sanquianga National Natural Park (PNNS) harbors the most extensive mangrove area in the Colombian Pacific and South America. Anthropogenic changes associated with the detour of the Patia River into the Sanquianga River in 1972 converted the estuarine conditions of this protected area into a new and dynamic delta. Uncertainties about the new conditions in the state of mangrove cover and the repercussions on sequestered carbon (C) are unknown. In this study, we determine mangrove cover gains and losses using JERS 1 SAR and ALOS-PALSAR imagery over two periods: 1996-2007 and 2007-2017. Additionally, we estimated aboveground biomass (AGB) and C contents and calculated avoided emissions from deforestation. We found a net increase of 243.97 ha of mangrove cover across 21 years and estimated losses of 122.30 ha, where the mouth of Guacama represents 68.48%. The PNNS recorded an average AGB of 393.15 Ton/ha and an average C of 196.58 Ton C/ha for 2017. Also, we estimated 28 277 944.8 GgCO2eq avoided potential emissions from deforestation. The PNNS is a potential area for developing Blue Carbon projects due to a large amount of carbon stock. Strategies involving monitoring tools and the local communities that depend on this ecosystem are necessary to preserve its coverage and ecosystem services in the future.

TI  - Integrating In Situ and Current Generation Satellite Data for Temporal and Spatial Analysis of Harmful Algal Blooms in the Hartbeespoort Dam, Crocodile River Basin, South Africa
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Hartbeespoort Dam is a discharge point of a catchment that is characterized by urbanization, mining, industrial, and agricultural activities. These activities coupled with fluxes of heavily polluted wastewater from informal settlements, wastewater treatment works, as well as runoff from golf courses have led to the development of recurring harmful algal blooms (HABs). The predominant cyanobacteria scum that is largely covering the Dam water is toxic to fish and poses serious public health risks. Phosphorus is the limiting nutrient in terrestrial aquatic systems and excess concentration in the waters usually results in eutrophication. The productivity level in Hartbeespoort Dam is also a function of total phosphorous (TP) level, showing a positive correlation with chlorophyll-a, an index for phytoplankton which are predominantly HABs in this Dam. Analysis of long-term in situ water quality data (1980-2020) show that TP is not the only driver, changes in surface water temperatures also affect the productivity level, especially, when TP levels are below a threshold of approximately 0.4 mg/L. Chlorophyll-a was retrieved from current generation high resolution satellite (Landsat and Sentinel) at 5-year interval. Standard band ratio-based ocean color model applied to satellite data produced an accuracy of R-2 = 0.86 and RMSE of 5.56 mu g/L. Time series analysis of in situ and satellite data show similar trends including capturing the effect of biocontrol on productivity levels between the late 1980s and the early 1990s, after which productivity increased with an increased flux of TP. Since 2015, the average annual surface temperature in the Dam has decreased leading to the decline in productivity level despite increasing levels of TP. The spatial dynamics of the HABs is a function of the discharges levels of the various rivers draining into the Dam as well as its geometry. Relatively higher concentrations are observed near river discharges and in areas of restricted water circulation.

TI  - Use of Clinical Pathway Simulation and Machine Learning to Identify Key Levers for Maximizing the Benefit of Intravenous Thrombolysis in Acute Stroke
T2  - STROKE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Expert opinion is that about 20% of emergency stroke patients should receive thrombolysis. Currently, 11% to 12% of patients in England and Wales receive thrombolysis, ranging from 2% to 24% between hospitals. The aim of this study was to assess how much variation is due to differences in local patient populations, and how much is due to differences in clinical decision-making and stroke pathway performance, while estimating a realistic target thrombolysis use. Methods: Anonymised data for 246 676 emergency stroke admissions to 132 acute hospitals in England and Wales between 2016 and 2018 was obtained from the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme data. We used machine learning to learn decisions on who to give thrombolysis to at each hospital. We used clinical pathway simulation to model effects of changing pathway performance. Qualitative research was used to assess clinician attitudes to these methods. Three changes were modeled: (1) arrival-to-treatment in 30 minutes, (2) proportion of patients with determined stroke onset times set to at least the national upper quartile, (3) thrombolysis decisions made based on majority vote of a benchmark set of hospitals. Results: Of the modeled changes, any single change was predicted to increase national thrombolysis use from 11.6% to between 12.3% to 14.5% (clinical decision-making having the most effect). Combined, these changes would be expected to increase thrombolysis to 18.3%, but there would still be significant variation between hospitals depending on local patient population. Clinicians engaged well with the modeling, but those from hospitals with lower thrombolysis use were most cautious about the methods. Conclusions: Machine learning and clinical pathway simulation may be applied at scale to national stroke audit data, allowing extended use and analysis of audit data. Stroke thrombolysis rates of at least 18% look achievable in England and Wales, but each hospital should have its own target.

TI  - Comparison of sequential and variational assimilation methods to improve hydrological predictions in snow dominated mountainous catchments
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Snowmelt modeling is vital issue for proper operational flow forecasting systems but still challenging in upstream mountainous basins due to limited observations and associated uncertainties. Data assimilation is a valuable tool to improve model state estimates to improve hydrological forecast. While assimilation of snow has been increasingly implemented in research, particularly using sequential data assimilation methods, less attention has been dedicated to compare different types of assimilation techniques. This study aims at comparing the wellknown Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) sequential data assimilation and the less known Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE) variational assimilation. Initial conditions of the hydrological model states are improved by assimilating in-situ streamflow and remotely sensed snow covered area data into the Hydrologiska Byrans Vattenbalansavdelning (HBV) conceptual rainfall-runoff model.The study is applied to improve runoff predictions over two mountainous basins: one in the uppermost catchment of the Karasu river, in Eastern Turkey, and the second in an alpine basin located in the headwaters of the Genil River in the northern flank of the Sierra Nevada Mountain in Southern Spain. The forecast models are tested in a hindcasting condition, i.e. closed loop environment, which simulates real-time forecasting systems. The results are analyzed using forecast verification metrics. Results showed that streamflow and snow state predictions using MHE outperform the commonly used EnKF based on the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS).

TI  - A High-Precision Water Body Extraction Method Based on Improved Lightweight U-Net
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid, accurate extraction of water body information is critical for water resource management and disaster assessment. Its data foundation was mostly provided by remote sensing images through deep learning methods. However, the methods still require the improvement of recognition accuracy and reduction of model size. As a solution, this paper proposed a new high-precision convolutional neural network for water body extraction. This network's structural design is based on the assumption that the extraction effect of a convolutional neural network is independent from its parameters number, thus the recognition effect could be effectively improved through reasonable adjustment of the network structure according to characteristics of water bodies on high-resolution remote sensing images. It brings two critical improvements. Firstly, the number of downsampling layers was reduced to adapt to the low resolution of remote sensing imagery. Secondly, the bottleneck structure has also been updated to fit the decoder-encoder framework. The improved bottleneck structures were nested to ensure the transmission of water characteristics information in the model. In comparison with the other five commonly used networks, the new network has achieved the best results (average overall accuracy: 98.31%, parameter benefit value: 0.2625), indicating the extremely high practical value of this approach.

TI  - A Fully Unsupervised Machine Learning Framework for Algal Bloom Forecasting in Inland Waters Using MODIS Time Series and Climatic Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Progressively monitoring water quality is crucial, as aquatic contaminants can pose risks to human health and other organisms. Machine learning can support the development of new effective tools for water monitoring, including the detection of algal blooms from remotely sensed image series. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce the Algal Bloom Forecast (ABF) framework, a fully automated framework for algal bloom prediction in inland water bodies. Our approach combines machine learning, time series of remotely sensed products (i.e., Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images), environmental data and spectral indices to build anomaly detection models that can predict the occurrence of algal bloom events in the posterior period. Our assessments focused on the application of the ABF framework equipped with the support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and long short-term memory (LSTM) methods, the outcomes of which were compared through different evaluation metrics such as global accuracy, the kappa coefficient, F1-Score and R-2-Score. Case studies covering the Erie (USA), Chilika (India) and Taihu (China) lakes are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of our learning approach. Based on comprehensive experimental tests, we found that the best algal bloom predictions were achieved by bringing together the ABF design with the RF model.

TI  - The detection and monitoring of pollution caused by gold mining using a vegetation cover index
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explores how a vegetation cover (VC) index can be employed as a pollution warning tool in gold mining areas in the Northwest of Iran. The analysis included the following: (a) the extraction of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) maps from Landsat images in three zones, i.e., mining operations, upstream areas without any exploration, and the downstream area of the mining activities, (b) calculation of the zones' VC, (c) investigation of transformation trends in each pixel of VC time series using the Mann-Kendall trend test, (d) determination of the pixels with significant VC reduction and the significant starting points of the trend using the sequential Mann-Kendall test, (e) assessment of the correlation between the zones with significantly reduced VC, and (f) a correlation test between average monthly and annual climate parameters and VC. Our results indicate that although 51 ha of VC has been demolished around the mining activities areas (i.e., zone 1), an overall upward trend in vegetation with no chemical leakage is observed into the downstream area of the basin (i.e., zone 3). This upward trend can be mostly attributed to the increasing precipitation and decreasing temperature in the study period. The fact that the area downstream of the mine shows that the heap leaching method for gold mining in Andaryan mine is currently not damaging the vegetation, this likely means that there is no leakage to the surrounding environment from the mine. Our results further show that using NDVI in a pixel-based scale and statistical methods has a high potential to quantify the effects of human activities on surface biophysical characteristics.

TI  - On the Determination of the Formation Phases of the Islamic Scientific Paradigm: A Trial Attempt
T2  - BEYTULHIKME-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article proposes a draft framework for the completion of the for-mation of the Islamic scientific paradigm on four aspects be on the point of be -ing worldview (7th cent.-present), scientific society (8-9th cent.), problems (9-10th cent.) and the emergence of the paradigm (10th cent). It proposes a draft framework for completion in phases. In this proposal, the worldview is dynami-cally exists in every phase of the paradigm, not only guiding the research of the scientific community but also forming a functional abstract ground for them. The scientific community forms its locomotive by contributing to the formation of the paradigm with the scientific research it carries on by being powered by the inspiration and guiding suggestions and instructions of its worldview. The problems phase, besides having internal manifestations in the formation process of the paradigm, essentially meets the process that integrates the challenge/crisis situation between the scientific community and the pre-existing paradigm. Fi-nally, this work presents the possibility of talking about the formation of the Islamic scientific paradigm, within the scientific process, under the supervision of the methods (unity) applied by the scientific community clustered around the worldview and the formation-classification-arrangement procedures and after the phase of the problem.

TI  - Modeling Evapotranspiration at Larger Temporal Scales: Effects of Temporal Aggregation and Data Gaps
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) at weekly and monthly time scales is often needed for various applications. When using remote sensing (RS)-based models, this can be achieved either by averaging all the required input variables to the intended time scale and simulating ET using models (input aggregation), or by estimating daily ET from the models and averaging to weekly or monthly ET (output aggregation). It is not clear if both these aggregation approaches yield the same outcome when using RS-based models for the estimation of ET. Another issue in obtaining ET at longer time scales is the lack of enough satellite observations to estimate ET with reasonable accuracy. This study aimed to compare the input and output aggregation approaches to obtain ET at weekly and monthly time scales using three RS ET models, namely, Priestley-Taylor Jet Propulsion Lab (PT-JPL), Soil Plant Atmosphere and Remote Sensing Evapotranspiration (SPARSE), and Surface Temperature Initiated Closure (STIC) models. The study was conducted using in situ data over six sites of different agro-climatic conditions in India, Tunisia, and France. The results indicate that the input aggregation provided relatively better results for monthly and weekly ET values than the output aggregation, having a lower RMSE (1-40%). Further, it was found that at least seven to eight satellite observations per month are required to obtain reliable ET estimate when using RS-based models.

TI  - Radiant Power Patterns Inferred from Remote Sensing Using a Cloud Computing Platform, during the 2021 Fagradalsfjall Eruption, Iceland
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The effusive eruption at Mt. Fagradalsfjall began on 19 March 2021 and it ended a period of about 800 years of volcano dormancy on the Reykjanes Peninsula. To monitor and evaluate power output of the eruption, we compiled in total 254 freely available satellite images from Terra MODIS and Landsat 8 OLI-TIRS via the Google Earth Engine platform over a six-month period. This cloud computing platform offers unique opportunities for remote sensing data collection, processing, analysis, and visualizations at a regional scale with direct access to a multi-petabyte analysis-ready data catalogue. The average radiant power from the lava during this time was 437 MW, with a maximum flux of 3253 MW. The intensity thermal power output of the 2021 Fagradalsfjall (3253 MW) is in marked contrast to radiant power observed at the 2014-2015 Holuhraun Iceland (11956 MW) where, while both eruptions also hosted active lava pools and channel, Holuhraun exhibited a much greater variability in radiant power over the same period of time. We performed Spearman correlation coefficient (SCC). Our results show a positive correlation (0.64) with radiative power from the MODVOLC system, which suggests that both results follow the same general trend. The results provide a unique temporal data set of heat flux, hosted, and processed by a cloud computing platform. This enabled the rapid assessment of eruption evolution via a cloud computing platform which can collect and process time series data within minutes.

TI  - Modulation effects of Cu modification and ligands (oxalate and borohydride) functionalization on Pt d-band center, upper d-band edge, and alloyed PtCe support acidity on semihydrogenation of acetylene
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENERGY CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The modulating effects of Cu modification and oxalate or borohydride ligands functionalization on the structure, catalyst d-band center (ed), upper d-band edge (eu), and acetylene partial hydrogenation of expediently synthesized Ce alloyed Pt supported catalysts were investigated. Firstly, a 5 wt% Pt alloyed Ce was synthesized via flame spray pyrolysis. The PtCe sample was further supported on zeolite Y, ZY, (PtCe/ZY) and copper modified ZY (PtCe/Cu-ZY). Furthermore, the PtCe was supported on two other oxalate and borohydride ligands functionalized copper modified ZY (PtCe/CuX-ZY and PtCe/CuB-ZY, respectively). The high-angle annular darkfield scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF/STEM) data showed a reduction in the PtO average particle size from 2.65 nm in PtCeO2 to average 1.73, 0.64, and 0.30 nm in PtCe/Cu-ZY, PtCe/CuX-ZY, and PtCe/CuB-ZY, which was corroborated by the electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) results wherein nonhomogeneous mixing of elements was seen with segregated Pt clusters in the non-functionalized samples. Conversely, both PtCe/CuX-ZY and PtCe/CuBZY samples showed near-perfect homogeneity with no distinct Pt signals. The measured eu values for PtCe, PtCe/Cu-ZY, PtCe/CuX-ZY, and PtCe/CuB-ZY are +1.85, +0.40, -0.15, and -0.19 eV, respectively. The positive values indicated strong metal-adsorbate bonding typical of large Pt sizes while the negative values indicated weak metal-adsorbate bonding due to highly downsized Pt sizes. The ethylene yield (YC2H4) over the PtCe sample showed depletion as the reaction temperature increased, while it reflected maxima at 120 degrees C with 55.3% YC2H4 over PtCe/ZY. The maxima shifted to 180 degrees C with enhanced YC2H4 of 71.4% in PtCe/Cu-ZY. On the contrary, both PtCe/CuX-ZY and PtCe/CuB-ZY exhibited a monotonous increase in YC2H4 up to the maximum C2H2 conversion with YC2H4 of 81.9% and 92.1% at 180 and 160 degrees C, respectively. These results showed that both the Cu modification and ligands functionalization were highly invaluable to enhance the properties and activities of the semihydrogenation of acetylene (SHA) catalysts.

TI  - Short- and mid-term forecasts of actual evapotranspiration with deep learning
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration is a key component of the hydrologic cycle. Accurate short-, medium-, and long-term forecasts of actual evapotranspiration (ETa) are crucial not only for quantifying the impacts of climate change on the water and energy balance, but also for real-time estimation of crop water demand and irrigation water allocation in agriculture. Despite considerable advances in satellite remote sensing technology and the availability of long ground-measured and remotely sensed ETa timeseries, real-time ETa forecasts are deficient. Applying a state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) approach, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models were employed to nowcast (realtime) and forecast (ahead of time) ETa based on (1) major meteorological and ground-measured (i.e., soil moisture) input variables and (2) long ETa time-series from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectmradiometer (MODIS) onboard of the NASA Aqua satellite. The conventional LSTM and convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) DL models were evaluated for seven distinct climatic zones across the contiguous United States. The employed LSTM and ConvLSTM models were trained and evaluated with data from the National Climate Assessment-Land Data Assimilation System (NCA-LDAS) and with MODIS/Aqua Net Evapotranspiration MYD16A2 product data. The obtained results indicate that when major atmospheric and soil moisture input variables are used for the conventional LSTM models, they yield accurate daily ETa forecasts for short (1, 3, and 7 days) and medium (30 days) time scales, with normalized root mean squared errors (NRMSE) and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies (NSE) of less than 10% and greater than 0.77, respectively. At the watershed scale, the univariate ConvLSTM models yielded accurate weekly spatiotemporal ETa forecasts (mean NRMSE less than 6.4% and NSE greater than 0.66) with higher computational efficiency for various climatic conditions. The employed models enable precise forecasts of both the current and future states of ETa, which is crucial for understanding the impact of climate change on rapidly depleting water resources.

TI  - Evaluation of MODIS, Climate Change Initiative, and CORINE Land Cover Products Based on a Ground Truth Dataset in a Mediterranean Landscape
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover can reflect global environmental changes if their associated transitions are quantitatively and correctly analysed, thus helping to assess the drivers and impacts of climate change and other applied research studies. It is highly important to acquire accurate spatial land cover information to perform multidisciplinary analyses. This work aims at estimating the accuracy of three widely used land cover products, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land cover product (MCD12Q1), the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative land cover (ESA-CCI-LC), and the EU CORINE land cover (CLC), all for the reference year of 2018, by comparing them against a fine resolution land cover dataset created for this study with combined ground surveys and high-resolution Large Scale Orthophotography (LSO 25/2015). Initially, the four datasets had their land cover classes harmonized and all were resampled to the same spatial resolution. The accuracy metrics used to conduct the comparisons were Overall Accuracy, Producer's Accuracy, User's Accuracy, and the Kappa Coefficient. Comparisons with the reference dataset revealed an underestimation of the forested areas class in all three compared products. Further analysis showed that the accuracy metrics were reasonably high for the broad classes (forest vs. non-forest), with an overall accuracy exceeding 70% in all examined products. On the contrary, in the detailed classification (total land cover mapping), the comparison of the reference dataset with the three land cover products highlighted specific weaknesses in the classification results of the three products, showing that CLC depicted more precisely the landscape characteristics than the two other products, since it demonstrated the highest overall accuracy (37.47%), while MODIS and ESA-CCI-LC revealed a percentage that did not exceed 22%.

TI  - Fluorescent Indocyanine Green versus Technetium-99m and Blue Dye for Bilateral SENTinel Lymph Node Detection in Stage I-IIA Cervical Cancer (FluoreSENT): protocol for a non-inferiority study
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Nowadays, two predominant methods for detecting sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in cervical cancer are in use. The most conventional method is a combination of a radiotracer, technetium-99m (Tc-99m) and blue dye. More recently, another method for SLN mapping using indocyanine green (ICG) is becoming widely accepted. ICG is a fluorescent dye, visualised intraoperatively with near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging, providing real-time visual navigation. The presumed advantages of ICG over Tc-99m, that is, being cheaper, non-radioactive and logistically more attractive, are only valuable if its detection rate proves to be at least non-inferior. Before omitting the well-functioning and evidence-based combined approach of Tc-99m and blue dye, we aim to provide prospective evidence on the non-inferiority of ICG with NIR fluorescence imaging. Methods and analysis We initiated a prospective non-inferiority study with a paired comparison of both SLN methods in a single sample of 101 patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IA-IB2 or IIA1 cervical cancer receiving primary surgical treatment. All patients undergo SLN mapping with ICG and NIR fluorescence imaging in adjunct to mapping with Tc-99m (including single photon emission computed tomography with X-ray computed tomography (SPECT/CT)) and blue dye. Surgeons start SLN detection with ICG while being blinded for the preoperative outcome of SPECT/CT to avoid biased detection with ICG. Primary endpoint of this study is bilateral SLN detection rate of both methods (ie, detection of at least one SLN in each hemipelvis). Since we compare strategies for SLN mapping that are already applied in current daily practice for different types of cancer, no additional risks or burdens are expected from these study procedures. Ethics and dissemination The current study is approved by the Medical Ethics Research Committee Utrecht (reference number 21-014). Findings arising from this study will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals, academic conferences and through patient organisations.

TI  - Estimation of the land deformation and aquifer parameters in the Handan plain using multi-temporal InSAR technology
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - The long term overexploitation of confined groundwater in the Handan plain leads to regional subsidence, threatening major infrastructure security. Thus, it is vitally important to investigate the spatiotemporal characteristics of land subsidence and clarify the coupling of deep groundwater change and land subsidence for land subsidence disasters prevention and control. In this study, we apply the multi-temporal InSAR method to detect the spatiotemporal variations of land deformation in the Handan plain with Sentinel-1A data from 2015 to 2019, and analyze the aquifer system response to hydraulic head changes. Seasonal signals in land deformation and head data are isolated by harmonic function to derive the spatially heterogeneous elastic skeletal storativity. Moreover, according to the one-dimensional head change-delayed land deformation model, we estimate the inelastic skeletal storativity and time constant. The results indicate that : (1) The Handan plain is dominated by land subsidence with the maximum rate of 14 cm . a(-1), Comparison between the subsidence and head change suggests that the subsidence is mainly caused by the head drop in aquifers and delayed drainage of water from aquitards. (2) The seasonal fluctuation in head leads to the obviously seasonal deformation, the amplitude of seasonal deformation can reach up to 25 mm, and the peak time ranges from January to March. (3) The values of elastic skeletal storativity range from 1. 51X 10(-3) similar to 4. 05 X 10(-3) that agree well with those derived from pumping tests, the inelastic skeletal storativity is 3. 62 X 10(-2) similar to 4.57 X 10(-2) and the time constant is 0. 47 similar to 0. 77 years. This study demonstrates the potential of using multi-temporal InSAR technology to characterize aquifer parameters and monitor the geological disasters caused by groundwater overexploitation.

TI  - Quantifying the changes in the runoff and its components across the Upper Indus River Basin under climate change
T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The runoff from the Upper Indus River Basin (UIB) is considered vital for sustainable water supply and agriculture. Climate change may alter the runoff and affect the availability of water. This study employs a hydrologic model and the climate projections of fine-resolution Meteorological Research Institute-Atmospheric General Circulation Model (MRI-AGCM) (0.1875 degrees) to assess the impacts of climate change in the future (2075-2099) on the flows in the UIB and its sub-basins. The simulations have shown satisfactory results compared to the observed ones. Furthermore, simulated snow-cover was compared with estimated snow-cover by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). According to the results, meltwater from glaciers contributes to about two-thirds of the annual runoff from the UIB. According to the projections, the future temperature will increase by 5.3 degrees C and annual precipitation will increase by 17% across the UIB. Despite this increase, the annual river flows were projected to decrease by 14% in the future because of depleted glacier melt. Furthermore, the detailed hydrologic responses in selected sub-basins showed different patterns in the future depending on the climate and elevation. In an eastern sub-basin, flows will increase by 58% because of enhanced glacier melt and higher precipitation. Contrarily, two western sub-basins will experience the reduction of the flow by 30-70% because of the glacier retreat.

TI  - Estimating tropical cyclone-induced wind, waves, and surge: A general methodology based on representative tracks
T2  - COASTAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical Cyclones (TCs) are singular storms causing intense wind, large waves, extreme water levels, and heavy rainfall. TCs prove every year to be one of the most destructive natural phenomena worldwide. The quantitative assessment of the hazards resulting from TCs (i.e., flooding and extreme winds) is challenging since satellite data are only available for recent decades, whereas older historical observations are incomplete and less accurate. In addition, long-term prediction through numerical weather forecasting is still limited. This often results in large uncertainties in the definition of TC hazards associated with events with longer return periods or in areas infrequently impacted by TCs. Even when this information is available, for example through statistical sampling of synthetic TC tracks, the numerical modelling of the associated hazards for all the different TC conditions can lead to computational costs which are often infeasible. Several methodologies that overcome the issues of accuracy and computational efficiency currently exist, but these are not generically applicable, and they tend to focus on specific areas only, for example where TCs typically make landfall. The main contribution of this paper is a novel methodology for the estimation and analysis of TC hydro-meteorological conditions and induced hazards. The method is generically applicable and maximizes accuracy while accounting for computational efficiency. Our approach identifies a smaller but representative set of TC tracks (RTCs) that preserves the information about extremes and the frequency of events of the larger population. The method is successfully applied and validated in a case study in the Bay of Bengal, using a set of synthetic TC tracks representing 1000 years of TC climate. For the best-performing configuration, the required number of scenarios and associated computational costs were reduced by 90% while maintaining accuracy in the simulated offshore storm surges, significant wave height, and windspeeds typically within 10% of the prediction based on the original full set of scenarios. This method is globally applicable and greatly improves the efficiency of TC-related hazard estimation, making it particularly valuable for areas with limited historical data.

TI  - Quantifying the effects of human activities and climate variability on runoff changes using variable infiltration capacity model
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Detecting and assessing changes in the hydrologic cycle and its response to a changing environment is essential for maintaining regional ecological security and restoring degraded ecosystems. There is no clear scientific evidence on the effects of human activities and climate variability on runoff and its components in typical arid areas. Therefore, in this study, a heuristic segmentation algorithm, a variable infiltration capacity model (VIC), and remote sensing data to quantify the effects of human activities and climate variability on runoff in the catchment of Lake Ebinur, Xinjiang, China. The results found: (1) The heuristic segmentation algorithm divided the study period into reference period (1964-1985) and two impact periods: I (1986-2000) and II (2001-2017). (2) Cropland and forest land showed an increasing trend, with grassland and barren land accounting for most of the increase. At the same time, the leaf area index (LAI) increased by 0.002 per year during the growing season. (3) Compared with the reference period, runoff depth decreased by 108.80 mm in impact period I due to human activities, but increased by 110.5 mm due to climate variability, resulting in an overall increase in runoff depth of 1.72 mm. Runoff depth increased by 11.10 mm in the impact period II compared to the reference period, with climate variability resulting in an increase of 154.40 mm, but human activities resulted in a decrease of 143.30 mm. Our results shed light on decision-making related to water stress in changing circumstances in arid regions.

TI  - High-Resolution Finite Fault Slip Inversion of the 2019 Ridgecrest Earthquake Using 3D Finite Element Modeling
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2019 Ridgecrest earthquake sequence manifested as one of the most complex fault surface ruptures observed in California in modern times. The M6.4 foreshock and M7.1 mainshock occurred on an intricate network of orthogonal and sub-parallel faults resulting in observable surface displacement and surface rupture captured by geodetic data. Here we present the application of a high-resolution 3D finite element model (FEM) approach to invert for the detailed fault slip of the entire sequence using complex rheology and fused coseismic Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data with Sentinel-1 differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar and pixel offset data. The heterogeneous FEM and the fused geodetic data set of pixel offsets, interferograms, and GNSS data results in our optimal inversion solution. This preferred solution is a complex, high-resolution non-planar slip model of both the M6.4 and M7.1 events that features three main regions of large slip (6.9+ m), with depths ranging from 2 to 10 km. The regions of slip are bounded by the mainshock hypocenter and the mainshock aftershocks and appear to be related to spatially varying rheological properties. We successfully reproduce a localized region of observed subsidence in the northern portion of the primary fault through the inclusion of a curved fault strand with a significant dip-slip component. The curved fault strand is the site of our maximum slip of 7.4 m at a depth of 4.2 km. The results demonstrate a robust fit from a more complete, detailed model for the entire seismogenic zone with reasonable computational cost, providing new insights into the governing rheologic and structural processes.

TI  - Frontier metrics for a process-based understanding of deforestation dynamics
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural expansion into tropical and subtropical forests often leads to major social-ecological trade-offs. Yet, despite ever-more detailed information on where deforestation occurs, how agriculture expands into forests remains unclear, which is hampered by a lack of spatially and temporally detailed reconstruction of agricultural expansion. Here, we developed and mapped a novel set of metrics that quantify agricultural frontier processes at unprecedented spatial and temporal detail. Specifically, we first derived consistent annual time series of land-use/cover to, second, describe archetypical patterns of frontier expansion, pertaining to the speed, the diffusion and activity of deforestation, as well as post-deforestation land use. We exemplify this approach for understanding agricultural frontier expansion across the entire South American Chaco (1.1 million km(2)), a global deforestation hotspot. Our study provides three major insights. First, agricultural expansion has been rampant in the Chaco, with more than 19.3 million ha of woodlands converted between 1985 and 2020, including a surge in deforestation after 2019. Second, land-use trajectories connected to frontier processes have changed in major ways over the 35 year study period we studied, including substantial regional variations. For instance, while ranching expansion drove most of the deforestation in the 1980s and 1990s, cropland expansion dominated during the mid-2000s in Argentina, but not in Paraguay. Similarly, 40% of all areas deforested were initially used for ranching, but later on converted to cropping. Accounting for post-deforestation land-use change is thus needed to properly attribute deforestation and associated environmental impacts, such as carbon emissions or biodiversity loss, to commodities. Finally, we identified major, recurrent frontier types that may be a useful spatial template for land governance to match policies to specific frontier situations. Collectively, our study reveals the diversity of frontier processes and how frontier metrics can capture and structure this diversity to uncover major patterns of human-nature interactions, which can be used to guide spatially-targeted policies.

TI  - Satellite remote sensing of crop water use across the Missouri River Basin for 1986-2018 period
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding historical crop water use (CWU) dynamics is important to improve land and water management. In this study, well-validated (coefficient of determination = 0.91, percent bias = 4%, and percent root mean square error = 11.8%) Landsat-based actual evapotranspiration (ETa) time-series estimations were used to (1) assess summer season CWU (CWU-Su) dynamics, (2) investigate CWU-Su trends over the study period (1986-2018; 33 years) at the regional- and pixel-scales, and (3) attribute CWU-Su driving factors across Missouri River Basin. Spatial variability of the ETa estimations along with the observed bimodal probability density distribution of ETa highlighted a strong relation between land cover and water uses across the basin. The bimodal distribution of ETa also indicated the presence of two major landcovers in the basin. The drier foothill regions in northwestern Missouri River Basin, dominated by grassland/shrubland, showed lower ETa (< 500 mm/year), whereas cropland dominated regions in lower semi-humid basin and forested subbasins exhibited higher ETa (> 600 mm/year). The CWU-Su anomalies revealed the vulnerability of the basin to year-to-year weather conditions. The CWU-Su trend analysis revealed a significant positive trend (p < 0.1) at the regional-scale affecting 30% of basin's cropland pixels. The cropland pixels under positive CWU-Su trend were found to be clustered in the eastern and central Missouri River Basin as a result of the combined effect of increased crop production area, increased crop yields, crop practice shifts to higher biomass crops, and increased irrigated land. The effect of improved irrigation and water management practices on reducing CWU-Su was observed in western Missouri River Basin, which had a stable major crop throughout the study period. Overall, the study highlights the usefulness of Landsat imagery and remote sensing-based ETa modeling approaches in generating historical timeseries ETa maps over a wide range of elevation, vegetation, and climate.

TI  - Quantifying Two-Dimensional Surface Displacements Using High-Resolution Cosmo-SkyMed, TerraSAR-X and Medium-Resolution Sentinel-1 SAR Interferometry: Case Study for the Tengiz Oilfield
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study was aimed at comparing vertical and horizontal surface displacements derived from the Cosmo-SkyMED, TerraSAR-X and Sentinel-1 satellite missions for the detection of oil extraction-induced subsidence in the Tengiz oilfield during 2018-2021. The vertical and horizontal surface displacements were derived using the 2D decomposition of line-of-sight measurements from three satellite missions. Since the TerraSAR-X mission was only available from an ascending track, it was successfully decomposed by combining it with the Cosmo-SkyMED descending track. Vertical displacement velocities derived from 2D Decomposition showed a good agreement in similar ground motion patterns and an average regression coefficient of 0.98. The maximum average vertical subsidence obtained from the three satellite missions was observed to be -57 mm/year. Higher variations and deviations were observed for horizontal displacement velocities in terms of similar ground motion patterns and an average regression coefficient of 0.80. Fifteen wells and three facilities were observed to be located within the subsidence range between -55.6 mm/year and -42 mm/year. The spatial analyses in the present studies allowed us to suspect that the subsidence processes occurring in the Tengiz oilfield are controlled not solely by oil production activities since it was clearly observed from the detected horizontal movements. The natural tectonic factors related to two seismic faults crossing the oilfield, and terrain characteristics forming water flow towards the detected subsidence hotspot, should also be considered as ground deformation accelerating factors. The novelty of the present research for Kazakhstan's Tengiz oilfield is based on the cross-validation of vertical and horizontal surface displacement measurements derived from three radar satellite missions, 2D Decomposition of Cosmo-SkyMED descending and TerraSAR-X ascending line-of-sight measurements and spatial analysis of man-made and natural factors triggering subsidence processes.

TI  - Study on the Establishment of the Gastropod Lymnaea stagnalis (Linne, 1758) as a Bio-sentinel to Monitor the Water Quality of North Algerian Rivers: Case of the El-Malah River.
T2  - Nature Environment and Pollution Technology
M3  - Article
AB  - Biomonitoring is a key solution for assessing the effects and risks of pollutants to preserve the most vulnerable ecosystems, including aquatic ecosystems. This study aims in establishing the gastropod Lymnaea stagnalis, as a sentinel species to assess the water quality of the El-Malah river in the Algerian North-West. Three sites were chosen along the river: upstream (US), midstream (MS), and downstream (DS). The responsiveness of the aquatic snails has been compared using physiological and biological markers: condition index (CI), volumetric condition index (VCI), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), glutathione s-transferase (GST), and catalase (CAT). Additionally, the occurrence of changes in biometric parameters of the specimens has also been treated: shell height (SH), shell thickness (ST) total weight (TW), and the ratio ST/SH. Snails from the site MS reacted in front to the water deterioration with low biometric values (ST 1.28 [plus or minus] 0.17 cm; SH 1.83 [plus or minus] 0.20 cm; TW 2.95 [plus or minus] 0.69 cm), and condition indices values (CI 31.19 [plus or minus] 3.58; VCI 2.09 [plus or minus] 0.53 g.cm-3), thereby signaling smaller individuals compared to the population of site US. Whereas, no specimen was recorded in the site submitted to wastewaters discharge (DS). This indicates that the degradation of the water quality affected the growth and the viability of the snails. Furthermore, a significant induction in the GST activity (88.98 [plus or minus] 10.72 nmol min-1mg-1), and a significant inhibition in the CAT activity (82.85 [plus or minus] 9.49 [mu]mol min-1mg-1) were recorded in the site MS, whereas no statistically significant variation was observed in AChE activity. L. stagnalis demonstrated biological and physiological variability between the studied contrasting sites of the El-Malah River. These results allow us to propose this species as a model in the ecotoxicology of western Algerian freshwaters.

TI  - Within-City Variation in Ambient Carbon Monoxide Concentrations: Leveraging Low-Cost Monitors in a Spatiotemporal Modeling Framework
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Based on human and animal experimental studies, exposure to ambient carbon monoxide (CO) may be associated with cardiovascular disease outcomes, but epidemiological evidence of this link is limited. The number and distribution of ground-level regulatory agency monitors are insufficient to characterize line-scale variations in CO concentrations.OBJECTIVES: To develop a daily, high-resolution ambient CO exposure prediction model at the city scale.METHODS: We developed a CO prediction model in Baltimore, Maryland, based on a spatiotemporal statistical algorithm with regulatory agency monitoring data and measurements from calibrated low-cost gas monitors. We also evaluated the contribution of three novel parameters to model performance: high-resolution meteorological data, satellite remote sensing data, and copollutant (PM2.5, NO2, and NOx) concentrations.RESULTS: The CO model had spatial cross-validation (CV) R2 and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.70 and 0.02 pans per million (ppm), respectively; the model had temporal CV R-2 and RMSE of 0.61 and 0.04 ppm, respectively. The predictions revealed spatially resolved CO hot spots associated with population, traffic, and other nonroad emission sources (e.g., railroads and airport), as well as sharp concentration decreases within short distances from primary roads.DISCUSSION: The three novel parameters did not substantially improve model performance, suggesting that, on its own, our spatiotemporal modeling framework based on geographic features was reliable and robust. As low-cost air monitors become increasingly available, this approach to CO concentration modeling can be generalized to resource-restricted environments to facilitate comprehensive epidemiological research.

TI  - Seasonal forecasting of landfast ice in Foggy Island Bay, Alaska in support of ice road operations
T2  - COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Landfast ice along the Arctic coasts plays an important role in supporting ecosystem services, local communities and offshore activities by industry. Seasonal predictions of landfast ice conditions are generally lacking in current seasonal forecasting products but are needed especially for planning of on-ice activities such as the construction of ice roads. This study focuses on the planned offshore development of Liberty Island where there is a need to generate seasonal forecasts for the construction of ice roads in Foggy Island Bay along the Beaufort Sea coast in northern Alaska. Due to the lack of prior in-situ observations of ice thickness in the region, a combination of newly obtained field measurements, remote sensing data analysis and modeling were employed to produce prototype seasonal forecasts of ice thickness in the landfast ice around Liberty Island. Seasonal forecasts initialized in September and March were built using Climate Forecast System seasonal forecast model data coupled with a single column ice model to forecast ice thickness that capture the start and end of the operational season, respectively. The results showed that the model forecasts had modest skill in capturing the timing of key ice thickness thresholds needed to support vehicle traffic during the start of the season in November-December but very limited skill with end of season and ice breakup forecasts. Much of the forecast skill was improved through bias correction but such improvement was hampered by the lack of long-term observational data in the region. Integration of the observational data and modeling is necessary to begin development of seasonal forecasts in this data sparse region.

TI  - Impact of mining on vegetation cover: A case study of Prestea Huni-Valley municipality
T2  - SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN
M3  - Article
AB  - Land Use Land Cover (LULC) changes are the direct and indirect consequences of human actions to secure essential resources for a successful livelihood. Therefore, it has become essential to analyze such changes for effective management of natural resources and protection of our environment. Anthropogenic factors such as urbanization, mining, and population increase in the Prestea Huni-Valley municipality are causing rapid changes to the land cover. These factors among others are putting a lot of pressure on the vegetation and this has dire consequences on the availability and protection of the vegetative cover. Given this, the study focused on assessing the impact of mining on vegetation cover with a particular focus on Prestea Huni-Valley municipality. Multi-spectral satellite images of the study area from 1986 to 2016 were spatially analyzed to identify the LULC change patterns. Modeling and analysis of these images were performed using IDRISI and R software. Six land cover classes were identified including forest, open vegetation, cultivated areas, bare lands, built-up, and mine sites. The result showed that the forest, open vegetation, and bare areas decreased by 14.59 %, 3.86 %, and 8.36 % respectively whereas cultivated, built up and mines increased by 6.31 %, 3.14 %, and 7.36 % respectively.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

TI  - Decoupling channel count from field of view and spatial resolution in single-sensor imaging systems for fluorescence image-guided surgery
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Significance: Near-infrared fluorescence image-guided surgery is often thought of as a spectral imaging problem where the channel count is the critical parameter, but it should also be thought of as a multiscale imaging problem where the field of view and spatial resolution are similarly important.Aim: Conventional imaging systems based on division-of-focal-plane architectures suffer from a strict relationship between the channel count on one hand and the field of view and spatial resolution on the other, but bioinspired imaging systems that combine stacked photodiode image sensors and long-pass/short-pass filter arrays offer a weaker tradeoff.Approach: In this paper, we explore how the relevant changes to the image sensor and associated image processing routines affect image fidelity during image-guided surgeries for tumor removal in an animal model of breast cancer and nodal mapping in women with breast cancer.Results: We demonstrate that a transition from a conventional imaging system to a bioinspired one, along with optimization of the image processing routines, yields improvements in multiple measures of spectral and textural rendition relevant to surgical decision-making.Conclusions: These results call for a critical examination of the devices and algorithms that underpin image-guided surgery to ensure that surgeons receive high-quality guidance and patients receive high-quality outcomes as these technologies enter clinical practice.

TI  - A Fast Regression-Based Approach to Map Water Status of Pomegranate Orchards with Sentinel 2 Data
T2  - HORTICULTURAE
M3  - Article
AB  - Midday stem water potential (psi(stem)) is an important parameter for monitoring the water status of pomegranate plants and for addressing irrigation management. However, psi(stem) ground surveys are time-consuming and difficult to carry out periodically over vast areas. Remote sensing, specifically Copernicus Sentinel 2 data (S2), offers a promising alternative. S2 data are appropriate for psi(stem) monitoring due to their geometric, temporal and spectral resolutions. To test this hypothesis, two plots were selected within a pomegranate orchard in southern Italy. A pressure chamber was used to collect psi(stem) measurements on four days in summer 2021. Ground data were compared with the temporally closest S2 images with the aim of testing the effectiveness of remotely sensed imagery in estimating and mapping the psi(stem) of pomegranate plants. Regression models were applied with a limited number of ground observations. Despite limited ground observations, the results showed the promising capability of spectral indices (NDVI, NDRE and NDWI) and S2 bands in estimating (MAE approximately equal to 0.10 MPa and NMAE < 10%) psi(stem) readings. To understand the dimensional relationship between S2 geometric resolution and the orchard pattern, predictive models were tested on both native S2 data and on denoised (unmixed) data, revealing that native data are more effective in predicting psi(stem) values.

TI  - Improving Practice Readiness Among Nurse Residents
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONTINUING EDUCATION IN NURSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Recent evidence indicates a mere 8% of new graduate RNs are prepared to make entry-level clinical judgments. Residency programs, designed to overcome the academic-practice gap, lack universal guidelines for content, delivery, structure, and consistent assessment of practice readiness prior to independent practice. Method. Virtual simulation to over-come practice gaps, with pre- and post-assessment of practice readiness prior to independent practice, was implemented in an existing nurse residency program. Results. A 373% improvement in virtual clinical performance scores, as well as reductions in medication errors, sentinel events, and failures to rescue, was noted. These improvements readily translated to practice, as noted in a corresponding decrease in the rate of practice errors during actual clinical performance. Conclusion. Transformed pedagogical technologies and learning methodologies are providing promising interventions to overcome the practice readiness deficit and set the stage for safer practice among new graduate RNs.

TI  - WaterMaskAnalyzer (WMA)-A User-Friendly Tool to Analyze and Visualize Temporal Dynamics of Inland Water Body Extents
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Freely available satellite imagery from the EU Copernicus program can record water surfaces precisely and at high temporal resolution. This paper provides the development status of the open-source demo software "WaterMaskAnalyzer" (WMA) for the determination of water body extents. The application allows simple to use on-demand monitoring of inland water dynamics by the Otsu-thresholding algorithm that automatically classifies water bodies. The tool can answer various hydrological issues related to disaster and water management, nature conservation, or water body monitoring. The first results from investigations of the Sentinel-1 time series in VH polarization show high accuracies with R-2 = 0.824 compared to in situ measurements for the Quitzdorf reservoir in Saxony, Germany. Small or indented-shaped water bodies, as well as those with forested riparian zones, such as the Cranzahl (VH: R-2 = 0.102 and VV: R-2 = 0.251) and Klingenberg reservoirs (VH: R-2 = 0.091 and VV: R-2 = 0.146), only achieve a low R-2 for VV and VH polarization but receive equally low RMSEs of 0.045 km(2) (Cranzahl) and 0.077 km(2) (Klingenberg). By separating out outliers and using correction factors, fast improvements in the accuracies can be expected. For future improvements, alternate classification methods and diverse new ground-truth data lead us to expect the next big step in development.

TI  - The added value of SLN mapping with indocyanine green in low- and intermediate-risk endometrial cancer management: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the SLN detection rate in presumed early stage, low- and intermediate-risk endometrial cancers, the incidence of SLN metastases, and the negative predictive value of SLN mapping performed with indocyanine green (ICG).Methods: A systematic review with meta-analyses was conducted. Study inclusion criteria were A) low- and intermediate-risk endometrial cancer, B) the use of ICG per cervical injection; C) a minimum of twenty included patients per study. To assess the negative predictive value of SLN mapping, D) a subsequent lymphadenectomy was an additional inclusion criterion.Results: Fourteen studies were selected, involving 2,117 patients. The overall and bilateral SLN detection rates were 95.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]=92.4%-97.9%) and 76.5% (95% CI=68.1%-84.0%), respectively. The incidence of SLN metastases was 9.6% (95% CI=5.1%-15.2%) in patients with grade 1-2 endometrial cancer and 11.8% (95% CI=8.1%-16.1%) in patients with grade 1-3 endometrial cancer. The negative predictive value of SLN mapping was 100% (95% CI=98.8%-100%) in studies that included grade 1-2 endometrial cancer and 99.2% (95% CI=97.9%-99.9%) in studies that also included grade 3.Conclusion: SLN mapping with ICG is feasible with a high detection rate and negative predictive value in low- and intermediate-risk endometrial cancers. Given the incidence of SLN metastases is approximately 10% in those patients, SLN mapping may lead to stage shifting with potential therapeutic consequences. Given the high negative predictive value with SLN mapping, routine lymphadenectomy should be omitted in low- and intermediate-risk endometrial cancer.

TI  - <i>KIR PALYKH</i> IS A WATER MONSTER AND A SHAMAN SPIRIT IN THE RELIGIOUS AND MYTHOLOGICAL REPRESENTATIONS OF THE KHAKAS (LATE XIX - MID XX CENTURY)
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-KULTUROLOGIYA I ISKUSSTVOVEDENIE-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES AND ART HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the study is to characterize the image of the clergy in the worldview and rituals of the Khakas. In order to achieve this goal, the following tasks were solved: 1) to conduct an etymological analysis of the term "Kir Palykh"; 2) to identify the significance and role of this being in the sacred practice of the Khakass people.The source base of the research includes folklore and ethnographic materials. Folklore works are epics and myths published in the Khakass language. The excerpts of some of them were first translated into Russian by the author.The chronological framework of the work covers the end of the XIX - middle of the XX centuries, which is determined by the state and possibilities of the source base on the research topic.Leading the study is the principle of historicism, when any cultural phenomenon is considered in the development and taking into account the specific situation. The research methodology is based on historical and ethnographic methods - relic and semantic analysis. As a result of the analysis, the following conclusions can be drawn: 1) in the traditional worldview and folklore of the Khakas, an important place was given to the mythical being kir palykh; 2) an analysis of the etymology of the name and a direct study of its image leads to the conclusion that in the religious and mythological consciousness, kir palykh is endowed with an ichthyomorphic image. She was characterized: a) as a monstrous fish of gigantic size and often identified with a whale; b) the color of the body was designated as "the bay"; c) described in the form of "old / ancient fish", correlated with a certain entity that appeared in the mythical era of the first creation; 3) in the traditional notions of the Khakas and other Turkic peoples of the Sayan-Altai, kir palyh are often identified with the ker yutpa, a fantastic creature with zoomorphic features, and identified with a dragon serpent. The single chthonic nature of these creatures, the common habitat and similar ritual functions contributed to the syncretization of the image of fish and snake; 4) in the religious and mythological representations of the khakas, kir palykh acted as the embodiment of the spirit of the master of water - sug ezi. The designated deity performed one of the most important functions in the traditional ritual of the people; 5) The water lord was directly associated with the shamanic mysteries, including playing a key role in the process of initiation into shamans. Kir palykh herself was one of the strongest tos'es - the spirit helpers of the shaman. Her image was captured in their ritual paraphernalia - tambourines and costume; 6) she was included in the range of views associated with homemade spirits patrons. Her mystical power found its application in traditional medicine.

TI  - A Reproducible and Reusable Pipeline for Segmentation of Geoscientific Imagery
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Segmentation of Earth science imagery is an increasingly common task. Among modern techniques that use Deep Learning, the UNet architecture has been shown to be a reliable for segmenting a range of imagery. We developed software-Segmentation Gym-to implement a data-model pipeline for segmentation of scientific imagery using a family of UNet models. With an existing set of imagery and labels, the software uses a single configuration file that handles data set creation, as well as model setup and model training. Key benefits of this software are (a) the focus on reproducible data set creation and modeling, and (b) the ability for quick model experimentation through changes to a configuration file. Quick experimentation permits researchers to prototype different model architectures, sizes, and adjust common hyperparameters to find a suitable model. We demonstrate the use of the software using a data set of 419 labeled Landsat-8 scenes of coastal environments and compare results across two model architectures, five model sizes, and three loss functions. This demonstration highlights that our software enables rapid, reproducible experimentation to determine optimal hyperparameters for specific data sets and research questions.Plain Language Summary A common task for Earth scientists is to divide a satellite or aerial image into specific classes. For example, an image of the coastline might be assigned certain pixels as being water, beach, and land. In the Deep Learning world, this is called segmentation. We wrote a piece of software that helps researchers train Deep Learning models to do segmentation on all types of imagery. A major problem with making Deep Learning models is dealing with all the choices on which model to use and quickly testing many options. We have designed our code in such a way that it can easily be adjusted, and will work in many applications and for many common types of Earth science image data sets.

TI  - Seasonal Mapping of Irrigated Winter Wheat Traits in Argentina with a Hybrid Retrieval Workflow Using Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth observation offers an unprecedented opportunity to monitor intensively cultivated areas providing key support to assess fertilizer needs and crop water uptake. Routinely, vegetation traits mapping can help farmers to monitor plant development along the crop's phenological cycle, which is particularly relevant for irrigated agricultural areas. The high spatial and temporal resolution of the Sentinel-2 (S2) multispectral instrument leverages the possibility to estimate leaf area index (LAI), canopy chlorophyll content (CCC), and vegetation water content (VWC) from space. Therefore, our study presents a hybrid retrieval workflow combining a physically-based strategy with a machine learning regression algorithm, i.e., Gaussian processes regression, and an active learning technique to estimate LAI, CCC and VWC of irrigated winter wheat. The established hybrid models of the three traits were validated against in-situ data of a wheat campaign in the Bonaerense valley, South of the Buenos Aires Province, Argentina, in the year 2020. We obtained good to highly accurate validation results with LAI: R-2 = 0.92, RMSE = 0.43 m(2) m(-2), CCC: R-2 = 0.80, RMSE = 0.27 g m(-2) and VWC: R-2 = 0.75, RMSE = 416 g m(-2). The retrieval models were also applied to a series of S2 images, producing time series along the seasonal cycle, which reflected the effects of fertilizer and irrigation on crop growth. The associated uncertainties along with the obtained maps underlined the robustness of the hybrid retrieval workflow. We conclude that processing S2 imagery with optimised hybrid models allows accurate space-based crop traits mapping over large irrigated areas and thus can support agricultural management decisions.

TI  - A New Multiple Phenological Spectral Feature for Mapping Winter Wheat
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid and accurate mapping of winter wheat using remote sensing technology is essential for ensuring food security. Most of the existing studies have failed to fully characterize the phenological features of winter wheat in mapping, resulting in low classification accuracy. To this end, this study developed a new multiple phenological spectral feature (Mpsf) and then used the generated new features as input data for a one-class classifier (One-Class Support Vector Machine, OCSVM) to map winter wheat. The main steps in this work are as follows: (1) Identifying key phenological periods. The spectral indices temporal profiles of winter wheat (after cloud masking) were drawn separately using different spectral indices, and the key phenological periods of winter wheat were identified with a priori knowledge of phenology. (2) Composition for a new feature. Composited the spectral features of winter wheat for each key phenological period to generate a new feature. (3) Training using a one-class classifier. The new feature was put into OCSVM for training, and the final winter wheat mapping result in the Beijing region was obtained. The cost of this new winter wheat mapping method is low and the accuracy is high. To verify the accuracy of this study, we compared the Mpsf map with three kinds of reference data, and all of them got good results. In comparison, with ground truth samples from Sentinel-2, the total accuracy was overall higher than 97.9%. The relative error of the 2019 winter wheat mapping result was only 0.51%, compared with the data from the Beijing Bureau of Statistics. In comparison, with an up-to-date available winter wheat-mapping product for Beijing (spatial resolution: 30 m), the Mpsf map has significantly fewer misclassifications. To our knowledge, this study produced one of the highest accuracy winter wheat-mapping products in Beijing for 2018 and 2019 to date. In general, we hope that this work can promote the development of winter wheat mapping and provide a reference for sustainable agricultural development and governmental decision-making.

TI  - Urban Form and Function Optimization for Reducing Carbon Emissions Based on Crowd-Sourced Spatio-Temporal Data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The low-carbon city has become an important global urban development-oriented goal. One important aspect of urban space is low-carbon urban planning, which has a vital role in urban carbon emissions. Which types of urban form and function allocations are conducive to reducing carbon emissions is therefore a key issue. In this study, the Futian and Luohu Districts of Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, China, are taken as an example to investigate this issue. Firstly, a "head/tail" breaks method based on the third fractal theory is adopted to obtain the minimum evaluation parcel of urban space. Then, the Landscape Shape Index (LSI), Fragmentation Index (C), Shannon's Diversity Index (SHDI), and Density of Public Facilities (Den) are used to evaluate the form and function allocation of each parcel. In addition, the CO2 concentration distribution in this study area is acquired from remote sensing satellite data. Finally, the relationships between urban form, function allocation, and CO2 concentration are obtained. The results show that the lower the urban form index or the higher the urban function index, the less the CO2 concentration. To verify this conclusion, three experiments are designed and carried out. In experiment A, the CO2 concentration of the tested area is reduced by 14.31% by decreasing the LSI and C by 6.1% and 9.4%, respectively. In experiment B, the CO2 concentration is reduced by 15.15% by increasing the SHDI and Den by 16.3% and 12.1%, respectively. In experiment C, the CO2 concentration is reduced by 27.72% when the urban form and function are adjusted in the same was as in experiments A and B.

TI  - MANet: A Network Architecture for Remote Sensing Spatiotemporal Fusion Based on Multiscale and Attention Mechanisms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Obtaining high-spatial-high-temporal (HTHS) resolution remote sensing images from a single sensor remains a great challenge due to the cost and technical limitations. Spatiotemporal fusion (STF) technology breaks through the technical limitations of existing sensors and provides a convenient and economical solution for obtaining HTHS resolution images. At present, most STF methods use stacked convolutional layers to extract image features and then obtain fusion images by using a summation strategy. However, these convolution operations may lead to the loss of feature information, and the summation strategy results in poorly fused images due to a lack of consideration of global spatial feature information. To address these issues, this article proposes a STF network architecture based on multiscale and attention mechanisms (MANet). The multiscale mechanism module composed of dilated convolutions is used to extract the detailed features of low-spatial resolution remote sensing images at multiple scales. The channel attention mechanism adaptively adjusts the weights of the feature map channels to retain more temporal and spatial information in the upsampling process, while the non-local attention mechanism adjusts the initial fusion images to obtain more accurate predicted images by calculating the correlation between pixels. We use two datasets with different characteristics to conduct the experiments, and the results prove that the proposed MANet method with fewer parameters obtains better fusion results than the existing machine learning-based and deep learning-based fusion methods.

Knowledge of the changes in the ecological conditions is vital to mitigate the impact of climate change. In this study, we investigated the trend of ecological conditions of the QTP using the remotely sensed ecological index (RSEI), which is the first PCA (principal component analysis) axis of the four indexes derived from the MODIS (Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) images captured in the growing season of 2000-2020. The four indexes, i.e., NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index), heat (land surface temperature, LST), wetness (tasseled cap wetness index, WET) and dryness (normalized difference impervious surface index, NDBSI), were calculated on the Google Earth Engine platform. Using land use cover change (LUCC) data, long-term meteorological records and the supplementary annual livestock production, we explored the drivers of spatiotemporal changes in the RSEI. The results show the following points: (1) the ecological conditions of the QTP have remarkable spatiotemporal variations. There were two ecological degradation periods, one of them occurred in the central region during 2005-2010, mainly attributed to the rising temperatures and decreasing precipitation. The other occurred during 2015-2020, driven primarily by overgrazing in the southwest. From 2000 to 2005, it was a period of rapid ecological restoration in the ecologically fragile northeast region. (2) The contribution rate of pc1 was stable at 60%, while the contribution rate of pc2 remained below 40%, indicating that pc1 demonstrated most of the characteristics of the four indexes. The correlation coefficients between NDVI and WET with pc1 are both positive, while LST and NDBSI have negative correlation coefficients, i.e., negative effects. This is consistent with the actual situation. (3) Overgrazing caused grass degradation in the southwest area of the QTP, which might be the main reason for the poor ecological conditions (i.e., low RSEI value) during 2015-2020. (4) Temperature and precipitation showed an increasing trend during the study period. A warmer and wetter climate is expected to have profound impacts on the ecosystems in QTP and practices should be concentrated on identifying climate-sensitive ecosystem components and designating adaptative options.

TI  - China Data Cube (CDC) for Big Earth Observation Data: Practices and Lessons Learned
T2  - INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In the face of tight natural resources and complex as well as volatile environments, and in order to meet the pressure brought by population growth, we need to overcome a series of challenges. As a new data management paradigm, the Earth Observation Data Cube simplifies the way that users manage and use earth observation data, and provides an analysis-ready form to access big spatiotemporal data, so as to realize the greater potential of earth observation data. Based on the Open Data Cube (ODC) framework, combined with analysis-ready data (ARD) generation technology, the design and implementation of CDC_DLTool, extending the support for data loading and the processing of international and Chinese imagery data covering China, this study eventually constructs the China Data Cube (CDC) framework. In the framework of this CDC grid, this study carried out case studies of water change monitoring based on international satellite imagery data of Landsat 8 in addition to vegetation change monitoring based on Chinese satellite imagery data of GF-1. The experimental results show that, compared with traditional scene-based data organization, the minimum management unit of this framework is a pixel, which makes the unified organization and management of multisource heterogeneous satellite imagery data more convenient and faster.

TI  - Water-temperature controlled deformation patterns in Heifangtai loess terraces revealed by wavelet analysis of InSAR time series and hydrological parameters
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Loess deposits are widely distributed in western and central China. Because loess is wet-collapsible, loess mass is prone to failure after water infiltration. Heifangtai, composed of two adjacent typical loess platforms located in the Loess Plateau beside the Yellow River, has experienced hundreds of landslides in the past few decades. Here, we derived surficial time-series deformation, velocity, and amplitude of seasonality from the Sentinel-1 SAR images acquired from October 2014 to March 2021 in the Heifangtai region and studied their relation with precipitation, temperature, and irrigation applying wavelet analysis. The decomposed velocities show that not only a large amount of along-slope deformation occurred surrounding the terrace but also a significant subsidence in the residential area in the middle of the platform was observed. The high-seasonality areas are distributed along the Yellow River and on the terrace consistent with other water sources, e.g., springs and irrigation, revealing a promotion of a periodic water-involved process on deformation in loess. Through the wavelet analysis, we found that the temperature is almost in phase with the uplift velocity when the temperature is below the freezing point. The precipitation precedes the surface displacement of & SIM;1 to 2 months for water penetration. The comparison between irrigation volumes and averaged displacements suggests that irrigation also plays a role in promoting subsidence from March to October but uplift in winter due to frost heave. We highlight that the retrogressions of the terraces in this region may be accelerated by both natural and anthropogenic factors. Careful monitoring and water management are highly recommended for the safety of local residences and infrastructures.

TI  - Sentinel-1 Shadows Used to Quantify Canopy Loss from Selective Logging in Gabon
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Selective logging is a major cause of forest degradation in the tropics, but its precise scale, location and timing are not known as wide-area, automated remote sensing methods are not yet available at this scale. This limits the abilities of governments to police illegal logging, or monitor (and thus receive payments for) reductions in degradation. Sentinel-1, a C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar satellite mission with a 12-day repeat time across the tropics, is a promising tool for this due to the known appearance of shadows in images where canopy trees are removed. However, previous work has relied on optical satellite data for calibration and validation, which has inherent uncertainties, leaving unanswered questions about the minimum magnitude and area of canopy loss this method can detect. Here, we use a novel bi-temporal LiDAR dataset in a forest degradation experiment in Gabon to show that canopy gaps as small as 0.02 ha (two 10 m x 10 m pixels) can be detected by Sentinel-1. The accuracy of our algorithm was highest when using a timeseries of 50 images over 20 months and no multilooking. With these parameters, canopy gaps in our study site were detected with a false alarm rate of 6.2%, a missed detection rate of 12.2%, and were assigned disturbance dates that were a good qualitative match to logging records. The presence of geolocation errors and false alarms makes this method unsuitable for confirming individual disturbances. However, we found a linear relationship (r(2) = 0.74) between the area of detected Sentinel-1 shadow and LiDAR-based canopy loss at a scale of 1 hectare. By applying our method to three years' worth of imagery over Gabon, we produce the first national scale map of small-magnitude canopy cover loss. We estimate a total gross canopy cover loss of 0.31 Mha, or 1.3% of Gabon's forested area, which is a far larger area of change than shown in currently available forest loss alert systems using Landsat (0.022 Mha) and Sentinel-1 (0.019 Mha). Our results, which are made accessible through Google Earth Engine, suggest that this approach could be used to quantify the magnitude and timing of degradation more widely across tropical forests.

TI  - Integration of Remote Sensing and Offshore Geophysical Data for Monitoring the Short-Term Morphological Evolution of an Active Volcanic Flank: A Case Study from Stromboli Island
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sciara del Fuoco (SdF) collapse scar at Stromboli is an active volcanic area affected by rapid morphological changes due to explosive/effusive eruptions and mass-wasting processes. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the importance of an integrated analysis of multi-temporal remote sensing (photogrammetry, COSMO-SkyMed Synthetic Aperture Radar amplitude image) and marine geophysical data (multibeam and side scan sonar data) to characterize the main morphological, textural, and volumetric changes that occurred along the SdF slope in the 2020-2021 period. The analysis showed the marked erosive potential of the 19 May 2021 pyroclastic density current generated by a crater rim collapse, which mobilized a minimum volume of 44,000 m(3) in the upper Sciara del Fuoco slope and eroded 350,000-400,000 m(3) of material just considering the shallow-water setting. The analysis allowed us also to constrain the main factors controlling the emplacement of different lava flows and overflows during the monitored period. Despite the morphological continuity between the subaerial and submarine slope, textural variations in the SdF primarily depend on different processes and characteristics of the subaerial slope, the coastal area, the nearshore, and "deeper" marine areas.

TI  - Species Distribution Models at Regional Scale: <i>Cymodocea nodosa</i> Seagrasses
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite their ecological and socio-economic importance, seagrasses are often overlooked in comparison with terrestrial ecosystems. In the Canarian archipelago (Spain), Cymodocea nodosa is the best-established species, sustaining the most important marine ecosystem and providing ecosystem services (ES) of great relevance. Nevertheless, we lack accurate and standardized information regarding the distribution of this species and its ES supply. As a first step, the use of species distribution models is proposed. Various machine learning algorithms and ensemble model techniques were considered along with freely available remote sensing data to assess Cymodocea nodosa's potential distribution. In a second step, we used InVEST software to estimate the ES provision by this phanerogam on a regional scale, providing spatially explicit monetary assessments and a habitat degradation characterization due to human impacts. The distribution models presented great predictive capabilities and statistical significance, while the ES estimations were in concordance with previous studies. The proposed methodology is presented as a useful tool for environmental management of important communities sensitive to human activities, such as C. nodosa meadows.

TI  - The Regional Disparity of Urban Spatial Expansion Is Greater than That of Urban Socioeconomic Expansion in China: A New Perspective from Nighttime Light Remotely Sensed Data and Urban Land Datasets
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The regional disparity of urban expansion varies significantly in China's different regions, hindering sustainable socioeconomic development. However, most studies to date have focused on a single aspect of urban expansion, e.g., urban spatial expansion (USS) disparity. This study attempts to define urban expansion from USS and urban socioeconomic expansion (USE) based on nighttime light remotely sensed (NTL) data and urban land datasets. Then, taking China's 241 prefecture-level cities within different provinces as experimental subjects, the Dagum Gini (DG) coefficient and stochastic convergence test are employed to assess the disparity of urban expansion from two different dimensions. The results show that, on the national scale, the regional disparity of USS is always greater than that of USE and has a converging trend. Additionally, regional disparity is the main factor causing the difference between USS and USE, with average contribution rates of 55% and 45%, respectively. The average difference between USS and USE in the eastern region (ER) is greater than 10%, while it is the lowest in the northeastern region (NER) and shows a significant expansion trend in performance convergence with a regression coefficient of 0.0022, followed by the central (CR), eastern, and western (WR) regions. Through the panel unit root test, we found that urban expansion in China in terms of USS and USE has internal random convergence in certain regions under the premise of global random divergence, and there may be differentiation and formation of one or more convergence clubs in the future. Using this novel perspective to define urban expansion, this study quantifies the contributions of USS and USE to regional disparity and provides a scientific basis for governments to implement appropriate approaches to sustainable urban development in different regions.

TI  - Extension and Evaluation of SSC for Removing Wideband RFI in SLC SAR Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR), as a wideband radar system, is easily contaminated by radio frequency interference (RFI), which affects the imaging quality of SAR. The subband spectral cancellation (SSC) method and its modifications utilize the SAR single-look complex (SLC) image to realize RFI extraction and mitigation by subtracting between sub-images, which are robust and efficient for engineering applications. In the past, the traditional SSC was often applied to narrowband interference (NBI) mitigation. However, when it was used for wideband interference (WBI) mitigation, it would cause the mitigated image to lose much of its useful information. In contrast, this paper proposes an improved SSC method based on successive cancellation and data accumulation (SSC-SCDA) for WBI mitigation. First, the fast Fourier transform (FFT) is used to characterize the SAR SLC data in the frequency domain, and the average range spectrum algorithm is used to detect whether there are interference components in the SAR SLC data. Then, according to the carrier frequency and bandwidth of the RFI in the frequency domain, the subbands are divided, and a cancellation strategy is formulated. Finally, based on the successive cancellation and data accumulation technology, WBIs can be removed by using only a small percentage of the clean subbands. Based on the simulated experiments, the interference mitigation performance of the proposed method is analyzed when the interference-to-signal bandwidth ratio (ISBR) varies from 20% to 80% under different signal-to-interference-to-noise ratios (SINR). The experimental results based on WBI-contaminated European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel-1A SAR SLC data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in WBI mitigation.

TI  - Removing InSAR Topography-Dependent Atmospheric Effect Based on Deep Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric effects are among the primary error sources affecting the accuracy of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR). The topography-dependent atmospheric effect is particularly noteworthy in reservoir areas for landslide monitoring utilizing InSAR, which must be effectively corrected to complete the InSAR high-accuracy measurement. This paper proposed a topography-dependent atmospheric correction method based on the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network model combined with topography and spatial data information. We used this proposed approach for the atmospheric correction of the interferometric pairs of Sentinel-1 images in the Baihetan dam. We contrasted the outcomes with those obtained using the generic atmospheric correction online service for InSAR (GACOS) correction and the traditional linear model correction. The results indicated that the MLP neural network model correction reduced the phase standard deviation of the Sentinel-1 interferogram by an average of 64% and nearly eliminated the phase-elevation correlation. Both comparisons outperformed the GACOS correction and the linear model correction. Through two real-world examples, we demonstrated how slopes with displacements, which were previously obscured by a significant topography-dependent atmospheric delay, could be successfully and clearly identified in the interferograms following the correction by the MLP neural network. The topography-dependent atmosphere can be better corrected using the MLP neural network model suggested in this paper. Unlike the previous model, this proposed approach could be adjusted to fit each interferogram, regardless of how much of the topography-dependent atmosphere was present. In order to improve the effectiveness of DInSAR and time-series InSAR solutions, it can be applied immediately to the interferogram to retrieve the effective displacement information that cannot be identified before the correction.

TI  - Assessing FY-3E HIRAS-II Radiance Accuracy Using AHI and MERSI-LL
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The FY-3E/HIRAS-II (Hyperspectral Infrared Atmospheric Sounder-II), as an infrared hyperspectral instrument onboard the world's first early morning polar-orbiting satellite, plays a major role in improving the accuracy and timeliness of global numerical weather predictions. In order to assess its observation quality, the geometrically, temporally, and spatially matched scene homogeneous HIRAS-II hyperspectral observations were convolved to the channels corresponding to the Himawari-8/AHI (Advanced Himawari Imager) and FY-3E/MERSI-LL (Medium-Resolution Spectral Imager) imagers from 15 March to 21 April 2022, and their brightness temperature deviation characteristics were statistically calculated in this paper. The results show that the HIRAS-II in-orbit observed brightness temperatures are slightly warmer than the AHI observations in all the matched AHI channels (long wave infrared channel 8 to channel 16) with a mean brightness temperature bias less than 0.65 K. The bias of the atmospheric absorption channel is slightly larger than that of the window channel. A standard deviation less than 0.31 K and a correlation coefficient higher than 0.98 in all channels means that the quality of the observation is satisfactory. The thresholds chosen for the colocation approximation factors (e.g., observation geometry angle, scene uniformity, observation azimuth, and observation time) for matching the HIRAS-II with AHI contribute little and negligible uncertainty to the bias assessment, so the difference between the two observed radiations is considered to be mainly from the systematic bias of the two-instrument measurement. Compared with MERSI-LL window channel 5, the observations of both instruments are very close, with a mean bias of 0.002 K and a standard deviation of 0.31 K. The mean brightness temperature bias (HIRAS-II minus MERSI-LL) of the MERSI-LL water vapor channel 4 is 0.66 K with a standard deviation of 0.22 K. The mean brightness temperature bias of channel 6 and channel 7 is 0.63 K (the standard deviation is 0.36 K) and 0.5 K (the standard deviation is 0.3 K), respectively. The biases of channel 4 are significantly and positively correlated with the target scene temperature, and the biases of channel 6 and 7 show a U-shaped change with the increase in the scene temperature, and the biases are smallest (close to 0 K) when the scene temperature is between 250 K and 280 K. The statistical characteristics of the HIRAS-II-MERSI-LL difference vary minimally and almost constantly over a period of time, indicating that the performance of the HIRAS-II instrument is stable.

TI  - Multispectral Lightweight Ship Target Detection Algorithm for Sentinel-2 Satellite
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, deep convolutional neural networks have made remarkable progress in visible light ship detection. However, most improve detection performance by improving large network structures, which require strong computer performance. In addition, the visible image is difficult to detect ships in the cloud, fog, sea clutter, night and other complex scenes. In order to solve these problems, this paper proposes a lightweight ship detection algorithm, which integrates the spectral information of Red, Green, Blue and NIR bands from coarse to fine. This paper uses the improved water detection algorithm to extract the ship candidate area from the existing methods that extract the water area by using the water detection algorithm according to the spectral characteristics. To obtain a more accurate candidate area, in this paper, the ships, the thick clouds, cloud, calm sea, five kinds of cluttered sea four bands of pixels in the scene have carried on the statistical analysis. Near-infrared is greater than the threshold as the auxiliary judgment, and in its center for candidate area the size of 32 X 32 slices, and to the maximum inhibition of slice, thus obtained the coarse detection results of the ship. Then constructs a lightweight LSGFNet network for fine identification of ship candidate regions. In the structural design of the network, the spectral features extracted by 1 X 1 convolution and the geometric features extracted by 3 X3 are fused. In order to prevent the "information not flowing" during the fusion of spectral features and geometric features, the channel disruption mechanism in ShuffleNet is introduced in the LSGFNet network, and the model structure is reduced. Compared with the typical lightweight network, it has a better effect and a smaller model. Finally, 1 120 sets of data with 512X 512 and 6014 sets of data with 32X 32 were constructed for rough detection and fine network training using sentinel-2 multi-spectral 10 -meter resolution data. Among them, the recall rate of rough extraction of candidate regions was 98. 99%, and the fine identification network precision was 96. 04%. The overall average precision is 92. 98%. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has high detection efficiency in the complex background of suppressing clouds, sea clutter and other disturbances, the training time is short, and the computer performance demand is low.

TI  - Evaluation of Cotton Defoliation Rate and Establishment of Spray Prescription Map Using Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The site-specific management of cotton fields is necessary for evaluating the growth status of cotton and generating a defoliation prescription map. The traditional assessment method of pests and diseases is based on spot surveys and manual participation, which is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and lacks high-quality results. The RGB and multispectral images acquired by drones equipped with sensors provide the possibility to quickly and accurately obtain the overall data for a field. In this study, we obtained RGB and multispectral remote sensing images to calculate the spectral index of the target area. At the same time, ground survey data were obtained by tracking and investigating the defoliation rate of cotton after spraying. With the help of data analysis methods, such as univariate linear regression, multiple linear regression models, neural network models, etc., a cotton defoliation effect monitoring model based on UAV remote sensing images was constructed. The results show that the BP neural network based on the VARI, VDVI, RSI, NGRDI, NDVI index has an R-2 value of 0.945 and RMSE value of 0.006. The R-2 values of the multiple linear regression model are 0.844 based on the RSI and NGRDI indexes and RSI and VARI indexes. Additionally, based on the model, the cotton defoliation of the whole farmland was evaluated, and the spray prescription map of the UAV sprayer was obtained.

T2  - Journal of Northeast Forestry University
M3  - Article
AB  - To explore the response of habitat quality to land use change, taking Jiajin Mountains Giant Panda Sanctuary (JMGPS) as the research object, four satellite data from 2001, 2009, 2016, and 2021 were selected to analyze the temporal and spatial evolution of land use and its impact on habitat quality of Jiajin Mountains in recent 20 years by using methods such as land change trajectory, and invest model. Results show that : (1) In the track of land-use change, the stable type accounts for 77.99%, the overall fluctuation is slight. The single type accounts for 15.79%, mainly the transfer of cultivated land to forest land and grassland and the occupation of construction land on cultivated land and forest land. The fluctuating type accounts for 4.81%, which is manifested in the alternating change among cultivated land, forest land, grassland, and construction land. (2) The overall fluctuation of habitat quality was slight, the high-grade and more high-grade habitat quality accounted for more than 62%, Spatially it showed a circular distribution characteristic of low in the middle, high around, and low in the periphery. (3)The habitat quality is low in the middle, high around and low in the periphery. The overall habitat quality is high. The change is mainly affected by reducing cultivated land and forest land, and the increase of construction land.

TI  - Multipath Suppressing Method Based on Pseudorange Model Using Modified Teaching-Learning Based Optimization Algorithm
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellites based positioning has been widely applied to many areas in our daily lives and thus become indispensable, which also leads to increasing demand for high-positioning accuracy. In some complex environments (such as dense urban, valley), multipath interference is one of the main error sources deteriorating positioning accuracy, and it is difficult to eliminate via differential techniques due to its uncertainty of occurrence and irrelevance in different instants. To address this problem, we propose a positioning method for global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) by adopting a modified teaching-learning based optimization (TLBO) algorithm after the positioning problem is formulated as an optimization problem. Experiments are conducted by using actual satellite data. The results show that the proposed positioning algorithm outperforms other algorithms, such as particle swarm optimization based positioning algorithm, differential evolution based positioning algorithm, variable projection method, and TLBO algorithm, in terms of accuracy and stability.

TI  - An Analysis of the Optimal Features for Sentinel-1 Oil Spill Datasets Based on an Improved J-M/K-Means Algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid development of world shipping, oil spill accidents such as tanker collisions, illegal sewage discharges, and oil pipeline ruptures occur frequently. As the SAR system expands from single polarization to multipolarization, the Polarmetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (Pol-SAR) system has been widely used in marine oil spill detection. However, in the studies of the oil spill extraction in SAR images, there are some problems that limit large-scale oil spill detection work. As a transition from single-polarized to full-polarized, the dual-polarized system carries some polarization information and can be obtained in large quantities for free, which has become a major breakthrough in solving the problem of large-scale oil spill detection. In order to optimize the multisource features that can be extracted from dual-polarized SAR images, greatly improve the utilization rate of dual-polarized SAR oil spill images under the premise of reducing workload, and ensure the accuracy of marine oil spill extraction, this paper adopts the metric of inter-class separability, the Jeffries-Matusita distance, which improves on the traditional K-means algorithm by focusing on the noise sensitivity defect of the K-means algorithm; the artificial influence of J-M distance in measuring the separability between classes improves the algorithm in three aspects: sample selection, distance calculation, and data evaluation. Finally, using the inter-sample J-M distance of multisource features, the overall accuracy of image segmentation, the F1-score, and the results of correlation analysis between features, three advantageous features and three subdominant features are selected that can be used for marine oil spill detection.

TI  - An enhanced method for estimating snow water equivalent in the central part of the Tibetan Plateau using raster segmentation and eigenvector spatial filtering regression model
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow water equivalent (SWE) is an important factor reflecting the variability of snow. It is important to estimate SWE based on remote sensing data while taking spatial autocorrelation into account. Based on the segmentation method, the relationship between SWE and environmental factors in the central part of the Tibetan Plateau was explored using the eigenvector spatial filtering (ESF) regression model, and the influence of different factors on the SWE was explored. Three sizes of 16 x 16, 24 x 24 and 32 x 32 were selected to segment raster datasets into blocks. The eigenvectors of the spatial adjacency matrix of the segmented size were selected to be added into the model as spatial factors, and the ESF regression model was constructed for each block in parallel. Results show that precipitation has a great influence on SWE, while surface temperature and NDVI have little influence. Air temperature, elevation and surface temperature have completely different effects in different areas. Compared with the ordinary least square (OLS) linear regression model, geographically weighted regression (GWR) model, spatial lag model (SLM) and spatial error model (SEM), ESF model can eliminate spatial autocorrelation with the highest accuracy. As the segmentation size increases, the complexity of ESF model increases, but the accuracy is improved.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variations of Grassland Ecosystem Service Value and Its Influencing Factors in Inner Mongolia, China
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The services provided by grassland ecosystems are important and irreplaceable in maintaining the balance and stability of ecosystems. The spatiotemporal variations of grassland ecosystem service value (ESV) and its influencing factors in Inner Mongolia from 2000 to 2019 were studied in this paper. Based on the socio-economic data, remote sensing data, geographic data, and meteorological data, a dynamic ESV assessment method based on the equivalent factors was used to calculate the grassland ESV for each year. The spatiotemporal dynamic variation and future trend of grassland ESV were studied by coefficient of variation index (CV), Theil-Sen median trend analysis, Mann-Kendall test, and Hurst index, and the Geodetector was used to determine the main factors affecting the distribution of ESV. The results indicated that (1) the annual average grassland ESV of Inner Mongolia was higher in the northeast than in southwest, the average ESV was 2.0794 million CNY/km(2), and the pixels were concentrated from 1 to 3 million CNY/km(2), accounting for 75.46% of the study area; (2) during the study period, the average grassland ESV increased slowly with time at an annual growth rate of 0.2, and the total ESV decreased first and then increased with the change in grassland area; (3) the average volatility was 0.16, and pixels with CV values between 0.1 and 0.2 accounted for 69.2% of the study area, indicating the fluctuation of ESV was relatively stable during the study period; (4) 37.16% of the grassland ESV in Inner Mongolia decreased slightly and 41.77% increased slightly during these years, and the two parts showed opposite trends in the future; and (5) the single factor influencing the spatial distribution of grassland ESV was mainly normalized vegetation index (NDVI) and precipitation, and the multi-factor interactions were NDVI boolean AND slope and NDVI boolean AND precipitation. All influencing factors exhibited a stronger impact through the two-factor interaction. This study can provide reference values for the policymaking of natural resource conservation or restoration.

TI  - An Improved Retrieval Method for <i>Porphyra</i> Cultivation Area Based on Suspended Sediment Concentration
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid expansion of Porphyra farming in China lends considerable urgency to developing a satellite remote sensing retrieval method to monitor its cultivation, in order to promote sustainable economic development and protective utilization of ecosystem-oriented marine natural resources. For medium-resolution satellite imagery such as HY-1C images, pixel-by-pixel techniques are appropriate; however, many factors affect the retrieval accuracy of the Porphyra cultivation area. In coastal regions, Porphyra and suspended sediment radiate a similar spectrum, which inevitably causes errors in the identification of the Porphyra. To improve the overall retrieval accuracy of Porphyra cultivation area from medium-resolution HY-1C images, we considered suspended sediment concentration (SSC) as an independent variable and constructed a new model in conjunction with high-resolution Sentinel-2 satellite images using a linear regression method in Haizhou Bay, China. A comparative analysis was performed with a traditional random forest classification algorithm and pixel-based dichotomy model in different SSC seawater. The results showed that the new model expressed the best ability to supervise Porphyra cultivation area, and its overall relative error and root mean square deviation, whether in area or in validation sample points, were the lowest among the models. The experiment was performed by removing the SSC variable while using the same processes as in the new model, and the results indicate that the SSC played an important role in new model, which is suitable to be applied to coastal seawater containing more suspended sediment, as in the HY-1C coastal zone image. The application of the new model on temporal change in the retrieved results was indirectly verified as effective. This study provides an effective method to exactly extract Porphyra cultivation area in the coastal sea using medium-resolution HY-1C satellite imagery.

TI  - A Review of Forest Fire Combating Efforts, Challenges and Future Directions in Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah, and Sarawak
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Review
AB  - The land surface of Malaysia mostly constitutes forest cover. For decades, forest fires have been one of the nation's most concerning environmental issues. With the advent of machine learning, many studies have been conducted to resolve forest fire issues. However, the findings and results have been very case-specific. Most experiments have focused on particular regions with independent methodology settings, which has hindered the ability of others to reproduce works. Another major challenge is lack of benchmark datasets in this domain, which has made benchmark comparisons almost impossible to conduct. To our best knowledge, no comprehensive review and analysis have been performed to streamline the research direction for forest fires in Malaysia. Hence, this paper was aimed to review all works aimed to combat forest fire issues in Malaysia from 1989 to 2021. With the proliferation of publicly accessible satellite data in recent years, a new direction of utilising big data platforms has been postulated. The merit of this approach is that the methodology and experiments can be reproduced. Thus, it is strongly believed that the findings and analysis shown in this paper will be useful as a baseline to propagate research in this domain.

TI  - Design of an Interface Layer Using CPW between an Array Antenna and TRM in X-Band Radar Systems to Minimize Leakage Fields and Improve Transmission Characteristics
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we propose an interface layer using the coplanar waveguide (CPW) between an array antenna and transmitting receiver modules (TRMs) for X-band military ship radar systems. To improve transmission characteristics, the interface layer with the CPW has three transition parts: Transition part A is between the sub miniature push-on (SMP) connector and the interface layer. Transition part B is the CPW in which the thickness gradually increases. Transition part C is for connecting the interface layer and the antenna. The measured reflection and transmission coefficients of the fabricated interface layer are -22.4 dB and -0.82 dB, respectively. To verify the proposed interface layer, we then apply the layer to a 2 x 2 X-band array antenna and measure the array antenna characteristics, such as reflection coefficients, array antenna gain, and half-power beam widths (HPBWs). The measured reflection coefficient is under -10 dB from 8.6 GHz to 10.2 GHz, and the bore-sight array gain of the 2 x 2 array antenna is 10.5 dBi at 9.5 GHz. In addition, the measured HPBWs under the same conditions are 47.8 degrees and 39.1 degrees in the zx- and zy-planes, respectively. The results demonstrate that the proposed interface layer using the CPW is suitable for X-band radar systems.

TI  - NEURAL NETWORK DETECTION OF POTENTIAL THUNDERSTORM ZONES FROM REMOTE SENSING DATA
T2  - GEOSFERNYE ISSLEDOVANIYA-GEOSPHERE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Convection origination on the territory of Eurasia is noted up to 65-67 degrees north latitudes, as noted in the annual reports on thunderstorm registration by Vaisala. Registration of thunderstorms by geostationary satellites in this territory is difficult. Therefore, the question of using satellite data from polar-orbiting spacecraft to monitor zones of convection development is relevant.The objectives of this study were to develop an architecture of algorithms for detection of atmospheric phenomena based on machine learning and neural networks, creation and training of algorithms for thunderstorm detection using ERA5 reanalysis data and further verification of the obtained algorithms and models on satellite sensing data of the MIRS program complex.The technology of selecting probable zones of thunderstorm development from satellite sensing data is a model of probabilistic detection of the presence or absence of atmospheric phenomena. With the help of calculations, the zones in which the atmospheric parameters more or less correspond to the conditions under which the hydrometeorological phenomena can form are highlighted. Calculations are carried out with the help of machine learning technology and neural networks.The paper presents the architecture of an algorithm for thunderstorm detection based on machine learning and neural network technology. A fully connected neural network is used, where the output signal of each neuron is fed as an input signal to all subsequent neurons. The neural network includes forty input neurons, twenty neurons on the first hidden layer, fifteen neurons on the second hidden layer, and two neurons corresponding to the necessary classification - presence/absence of thunderstorm on the output layer. The activation function on the hidden layers is Rectified linear unit (ReLU), the activation function on the output layer is Softmax. The algorithm was trained on the data of reanalysis ERA5 and verified on the data of satellite sounding of program complex MIRS which uses microwave measurements of AMSU/MHS devices of NOAA series, MetOp and ATMS device of Suomi NPP. Based on the results of the analysis of a number of data that were not involved in the model development and training process for May-October 2019-2020, an accuracy of 84 % was obtained.Additionally, tests were conducted on 109 meteorological stations located within the boundaries of 49.9 degrees-60.35 degrees N and 75.68 degrees-88.67 degrees E. For the periods: April-September 2021, the predictability value indicates that 96 % of the events are successfully classified (presence/absence of thunderstorms).The presented algorithm is dynamic. The learning procedure can be reinitialized when enough data is accumulated. This will allow us to take into account the appearance of new extremes of atmospheric characteristics.The use of the presented algorithm and the results of its calculations is promising as an additional tool for operational work.

TI  - Detection of human pathogenic bacteria in rectal DNA samples from <i>Zalophus californianus</i> in the Gulf of California, Mexico
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Human intrusions into undisturbed wildlife areas greatly contribute to the emergence of infectious diseases. To minimize the impacts of novel emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) on human health, a comprehensive understanding of the microbial species that reside within wildlife species is required. The Gulf of California (GoC) is an example of an undisturbed ecosystem. However, in recent decades, anthropogenic activities within the GoC have increased. Zalophus californianus has been proposed as the main sentinel species in the GoC; hence, an assessment of sea lion bacterial microbiota may reveal hidden risks for human health. We evaluated the presence of potential human pathogenic bacterial species from the gastrointestinal (GI) tracts of wild sea lions through a metabarcoding approach. To comprehensively evaluate this bacterial consortium, we considered the genetic information of six hypervariable regions of 16S rRNA. Potential human pathogenic bacteria were identified down to the species level by integrating the RDP and Pplacer classifier outputs. The combined genetic information from all analyzed regions suggests the presence of at least 44 human pathogenic bacterial species, including Shigella dysenteriae and Bacillus anthracis. Therefore, the risks of EIDs from this area should be not underestimated.

TI  - Belief in a Dangerous World Does Not Explain Substantial Variance in Political Attitudes, But Other World Beliefs Do
T2  - SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PERSONALITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Decades of research suggest a correlation between belief in a dangerous world and political conservatism. However, research relied on a scale that may overemphasize certain types of dangers. Furthermore, few other world beliefs have been investigated, such that fundamental worldview differences between liberals and conservatives remain largely unknown. A preregistered study of nine samples (N = 5,461; mostly US Americans) found a negligible association between a newly improved measure of generalized dangerous world belief and conservatism, and that the original scale emphasized certain dangers more salient to conservatives (e.g., societal decline) over others most salient for liberals (e.g., injustice). Across many measures of political attitudes, other world beliefs-such as beliefs that the world is Hierarchical, Intentional, Just, and Worth Exploring-each explained several times more variance than dangerous world belief. This suggests the relevance of dangerous world belief to political attitudes has been overstated, and examining other world beliefs may yield insights.

TI  - Aetiology and incidence of diarrhoea requiring hospitalisation in children under 5 years of age in 28 low-income and middle-income countries: findings from the Global Pediatric Diarrhea Surveillance network
T2  - BMJ GLOBAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Diarrhoea remains a leading cause of child morbidity and mortality. Systematically collected and analysed data on the aetiology of hospitalised diarrhoea in low-income and middle-income countries are needed to prioritise interventions. Methods We established the Global Pediatric Diarrhea Surveillance network, in which children under 5 years hospitalised with diarrhoea were enrolled at 33 sentinel surveillance hospitals in 28 low-income and middle-income countries. Randomly selected stool specimens were tested by quantitative PCR for 16 causes of diarrhoea. We estimated pathogen-specific attributable burdens of diarrhoeal hospitalisations and deaths. We incorporated country-level incidence to estimate the number of pathogen-specific deaths on a global scale. Results During 2017-2018, 29 502 diarrhoea hospitalisations were enrolled, of which 5465 were randomly selected and tested. Rotavirus was the leading cause of diarrhoea requiring hospitalisation (attributable fraction (AF) 33.3%; 95% CI 27.7 to 40.3), followed by Shigella (9.7%; 95% CI 7.7 to 11.6), norovirus (6.5%; 95% CI 5.4 to 7.6) and adenovirus 40/41 (5.5%; 95% CI 4.4 to 6.7). Rotavirus was the leading cause of hospitalised diarrhoea in all regions except the Americas, where the leading aetiologies were Shigella (19.2%; 95% CI 11.4 to 28.1) and norovirus (22.2%; 95% CI 17.5 to 27.9) in Central and South America, respectively. The proportion of hospitalisations attributable to rotavirus was approximately 50% lower in sites that had introduced rotavirus vaccine (AF 20.8%; 95% CI 18.0 to 24.1) compared with sites that had not (42.1%; 95% CI 33.2 to 53.4). Globally, we estimated 208 009 annual rotavirus-attributable deaths (95% CI 169 561 to 259 216), 62 853 Shigella-attributable deaths (95% CI 48 656 to 78 805), 36 922 adenovirus 40/41-attributable deaths (95% CI 28 469 to 46 672) and 35 914 norovirus-attributable deaths (95% CI 27 258 to 46 516). Conclusions Despite the substantial impact of rotavirus vaccine introduction, rotavirus remained the leading cause of paediatric diarrhoea hospitalisations. Improving the efficacy and coverage of rotavirus vaccination and prioritising interventions against Shigella, norovirus and adenovirus could further reduce diarrhoea morbidity and mortality.

TI  - Data-Driven Random Forest Models for Detecting Volcanic Hot Spots in Sentinel-2 MSI Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Volcanic thermal anomalies are monitored with an increased application of optical satellite sensors to improve the ability to identify renewed volcanic activity. Hotspot detection algorithms adopting a fixed threshold are widely used to detect thermal anomalies with a minimal occurrence of false alerts. However, when used on a global scale, these algorithms miss some subtle thermal anomalies that occur. Analyzing satellite data sources with machine learning (ML) algorithms has been shown to be efficient in extracting volcanic thermal features. Here, a data-driven algorithm is developed in Google Earth Engine (GEE) to map thermal anomalies associated with lava flows that erupted recently at different volcanoes around the world (e.g., Etna, Cumbre Vieja, Geldingadalir, Pacaya, and Stromboli). We used high spatial resolution images acquired by a Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) and a random forest model, which avoids the setting of fixed a priori thresholds. The results indicate that the model achieves better performance than traditional approaches with good generalization capabilities and high sensitivity to less intense volcanic thermal anomalies. We found that this model is sufficiently robust to be successfully used with new eruptive scenes never seen before on a global scale.

AB  - In the acknowledgments to the English translation of "Cosmological deixis and Amerindian perspectivism, " Eduardo Vivieros de Castro (1998: 484) cryptically states that "After this article has reached its present form, I read an essay by Fritz Krause horizontal ellipsis which advances ideas strikingly similar to some developed here. " In this introduction to the first English translation of Krause's "Mask and ancestral figure: The motif of the skin and the principle of form, " I sketch what some of these ideas may be and trace how they were addressed in Viveiros de Castro's later writings. I conclude with a brief survey of some other engagements with Krause's work in Amazonian ethnology and suggest why this article has remained largely ignored in the discipline.

TI  - Impact of Training Set Size and Lead Time on Early Tomato Crop Mapping Accuracy
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating key crop parameters (e.g., phenology, yield prediction) is a prerequisite for optimizing agrifood supply chains through the use of satellite imagery, but requires timely and accurate crop mapping. The moment in the season and the number of training sites used are two main drivers of crop classification performance. The combined effect of these two parameters was analysed for tomato crop classification, through 125 experiments, using the three main machine learning (ML) classifiers (neural network, random forest, and support vector machine) using a response surface methodology (RSM). Crop classification performance between minority (tomato) and majority ('other crops') classes was assessed through two evaluation metrics: Overall Accuracy (OA) and G-Mean (GM), which were calculated on large independent test sets (over 400,000 fields). RSM results demonstrated that lead time and the interaction between the number of majority and minority classes were the two most important drivers for crop classification performance for all three ML classifiers. The results demonstrate the feasibility of preharvest classification of tomato with high performance, and that an RSM-based approach enables the identification of simultaneous effects of several factors on classification performance. SVM achieved the best grading performances across the three ML classifiers, according to both evaluation metrics. SVM reached highest accuracy (0.95 of OA and 0.97 of GM) earlier in the season (low lead time) and with less training sites than the other two classifiers, permitting a reduction in cost and time for ground truth collection through field campaigns.

TI  - Mapping Local Climate Zones in the Urban Environment: The Optimal Combination of Data Source and Classifier
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The novel concept of local climate zones (LCZs) provides a consistent classification framework for studies of the urban thermal environment. However, the development of urban climate science is severely hampered by the lack of high-resolution data to map LCZs. Using Gaofen-6 and Sentinel-1/2 as data sources, this study designed four schemes using convolutional neural network (CNN) and random forest (RF) classifiers, respectively, to demonstrate the potential of high-resolution images in LCZ mapping and evaluate the optimal combination of different data sources and classifiers. The results showed that the combination of GF-6 and CNN (S3) was considered the best LCZ classification scheme for urban areas, with OA and kappa coefficients of 85.9% and 0.842, respectively. The accuracy of urban building categories is above 80%, and the F1 score for each category is the highest, except for LCZ1 and LCZ5, where there is a small amount of confusion. The Sentinel-1/2-based RF classifier (S2) was second only to S3 and superior to the combination of GF-6 and random forest (S1), with OA and kappa coefficients of 64.4% and 0.612, respectively. The Sentinel-1/2 and CNN (S4) combination has the worst classification result, with an OA of only 39.9%. The LCZ classification map based on S3 shows that the urban building categories in Xi'an are mainly distributed within the second ring, while heavy industrial buildings have started to appear in the third ring. The urban periphery is mainly vegetated and bare land. In conclusion, CNN has the best application effect in the LCZ mapping task of high-resolution remote sensing images. In contrast, the random forest algorithm has better robustness in the band-abundant Sentinel data.

TI  - Mismatch between Annual Tree-Ring Width Growth and NDVI Index in Norway Spruce Stands of Central Europe
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Presently, the forests of one of the most economically important tree species in Europe-Norway spruce [Picea abies (L.) Karst.]-have been disrupted and are in rapid decline due to a combination of several natural factors: extreme drought, heatwaves, and secondary damage caused by bark beetle outbreaks. The vulnerability of these forests has increased considerably over the past decade, and remote sensing methods can theoretically improve the identification of endangered forest stands. The main objective was to determine the relationship between remotely sensed characteristics of vegetation (using the normalized difference vegetation index-NDVI) and annual tree-ring growth in 180 trees through precipitation and air temperature. The research was conducted at six research plots in lowland spruce forests (319-425 m a.s.l.) in the central Czech Republic. No significant correlation between NDVI and annual ring width was observed. The primary factor limiting radial growth was lack of precipitation in the growing season; subsequently, spruce trees reacted negatively to air temperatures. A higher correlation with NDVI was observed on sites susceptible to drought, but overall, NDVI and RWI did not show similarities. This result describes that NDVI is a poor indicator for identifying low radial growth in Norway spruce stands on non-native localities in the studied area.

TI  - INTERVIEWS APPLIED IN QUALITATIVE RESEARCH: FROM INTERVIEW APPLICATION TO DATA ANALYSIS
T2  - REVISTA DE GESTAO E PROJETOS
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - The use of interviews to obtain evidence for research is one of the most used strategies when adopting a qualitative approach. The interview allows understanding, from the point of view of one or more interlocutors, the reality of a studied phenomenon. However, the task of planning and conducting good interviews is not easy, although understanding this process is not so complex. Based on this context, this editorial commentary aims to promote a discussion about the process of planning, applying and analyzing interviews in qualitative research. The content shown here directs the reader to an initial understanding of the researcher's worldview, as well as his position in relation to the studied phenomenon. Next, some questions are presented about the preparation of protocols, application of interviews to obtain evidence and data analysis. Finally, we present a preparatory framework that aims to help organize the interview process.

T2  - Biodiversity Journal
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aimed to assess the potential impact of pollution on total lipid levels as well as the response of a lipid peroxidation biomarker, malondialdehyde (MDA) in a sentinel and edible species, Donax trunculus Linnaeus, 1758 (Bivalvia Donacidae). The samples were collected during the major spawning phase (spring) over three months (March, April, May) in year 2021 from two selected sites in the Gulf of Annaba: El Battah (reference site), and Sidi Salem (polluted site). Biochemical analyses showed a significant increase in total lipid levels determined in the mantle of D. trunculus in individuals from El Battah compared to those from Sidi Salem. The highest values are observed during the first two months (March, April), which corresponds to the accumulation of reserves at the beginning of reproduction. The lowest rates are recorded at the end of the breeding season (May) corresponding to the period of emission of gametes which is privileged by the increase in temperature. Sex differ-ences reveal an accumulation of reserves and a greater energy allocation in females compared to males during reproduction. Measurement of MDA indicates an increase in rates recorded in individuals from Sidi Salem compared to those from El Battah. Moreover, sex differences demonstrate a greater response in females compared to males. Overall, the results obtained demonstrated that the Gulf of Annaba is subjected to stress conditions from anthropogenic origin that are more pronounced in the populations of D. trunculus from Sidi Salem, linked to the level of pollution of this site. Thus, D. trunculus appears to be an appropriate sentinel species for the assessment of ecotoxicological risk in the Gulf of Annaba.

TI  - Landslide Identification and Gradation Method Based on Statistical Analysis and Spatial Cluster Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As a type of earth observation technology, interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) is increasingly widely used in the field of geological disaster detection. However, the application of InSAR in low-coherence areas, such as alpine canyon areas and vegetation coverage areas, is subject to considerable limitations. How to accurately identify landslides from InSAR measurement data in these areas remains the subject of several challenges and shortcomings. Based on statistical analysis and spatial cluster analysis, in this paper, we propose an automatic landslide identification and gradation method suitable for low-coherence areas. The proposed method combines the small baseline subset InSAR (SBAS-InSAR) method and the interferogram stacking (stacking-InSAR) method to obtain a deformation map in the study area, using statistical analysis and spatial cluster analysis to extract deformation regions and landslide polygons to propose a landslide screening model (LSM) based on multivariate features to screen landslides and reduce the interference of noise in landslide identification, in addition to proposing a landslide gradation model (LGM) based on signum function to grade the identified landslides and provide support to distinguish landslides with different deformation degrees. The method was applied to landslide identification in the upper section of the Jinsha River basin, and 47 potential landslides were identified, including 15 high-risk landslides and 13 landslides endangering villages. The experimental results show that the proposed method can identify landslides accurately and hierarchically in low-coherence areas, providing support for geological hazard investigation agencies and local departments.

TI  - AN APPROACH TO THE ANALYSIS OF BILATERAL RELATIONS
T2  - MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA I MEZHDUNARODNYE OTNOSHENIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article presents an approach to assessment of how independent an international actor can be from the political point of view. The author formulates a coordinate system composed of four spaces (fields) of social communication. The first one is the space of ideological interaction. In this space, governments have a possibility to manipulate the policies of their counteragents via exploiting psychological sentiments in the short term or fortifying specific worldview attitudes in the long run among the peoples in foreign countries. The second is the space of international norms. Unlike on the national level, the international relations system does not imply an existence of a common decision-making mechanism that serves as a generator of communication norms. Therefore, states use their national might to establish a normative order, which they are trying to fortify by consequently repeating specific actions in the international arena. In the third space, international actors try to integrate their counteragents into a specific type of economic relations that would serve as a determinant of their behavior. Finally, in the security space, the relations of states are defined by their internal understanding of what specific international trends and policies could threaten their own interests of national survival and development. The author concludes that the state of affairs in these four spaces determines the nature of subjectivity (sovereignty) of international actors on the global political stage. Through this lens, their bilateral relations could be classified into one of three types: subject-subject (interdependent), subject-object (unilaterally dependent) or object-object (independent). Therefore, the assessment of the nature of interstate bilateral relations could serve as a good starting point to characterize the whole structure of the international relations system: whether it is functioning in a unipolar, bipolar or multipolar manner. Moreover, the presented methodology could help to evaluate a degree of effectiveness of the foreign policy strategies implementation, since it presents a measurable coordinate system of the state and the structure of international affairs.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping with Indirect Lymphangiography for Canine Mast Cell Tumour
T2  - VETERINARY SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Mast cell tumour (MCT) is a common cutaneous and subcutaneous neoplasia in dogs. Recent studies describe that sentinel lymph node (SLN) assessment is more specific to stage MCT, while regional lymph node (RLN) evaluation is not as specific. SNL is the first site of drainage of a tumour and the first metastatic site in several tumours. The study aims to evaluate the SLN drainage mapping of MCT with indirect lymphography in dogs. The second objective of the study is to compare the SLN to the RLN. Survey radiographs followed by an indirect lymphography were obtained for SLN mapping. Twenty-six dogs with 29 MCTs were included. SLNs were detectable in 26 MCTs and radiographic indirect lymphangiography with Lipiodol was able to detect at least one SLN in 90% of MCTs in dogs. In conclusion, radiographic indirect lymphangiography with Lipiodol is a feasible technique to map SLNs and its draining system in MCTs. The lymph drainage pattern of the MCTs may be different for each MCT and more than one SLN can be involved. Mast cell tumour (MCT) is a common cutaneous and subcutaneous neoplasia in dogs. It can metastasise to lymph nodes (LNs), and this adversely affects the prognosis and treatment. The study aims to evaluate the SLN mapping of MCTs with radiographic indirect lymphography. Dogs that underwent clinical staging were prospectively enrolled. Lipiodol was injected around the MCT or the surgical scar. After 24 h, LNs that picked up contrast were radiographically assessed. Twenty-six dogs with 29 MCTs were included. MCTs were confirmed histologically, while SLNs were evaluated either by cytology and/or histology. SLNs were detectable in 23 dogs with 26 MCTs. Lymphatic vessels were visible in 19 MCTs. In nine MCTs, at least two SLNs picked up contrast. In particular, seven MCTs involved two SLNs, and two MCTs involved three different SLNs. In nine MCTs, at least a SLN was metastatic. This study indicates that the lymph drainage pattern of the MCTs may be different for each MCT, and more than one SLN can be involved. Indirect lymphangiography with Lipiodol allowed the detection of the SLN in 90% of MCTs. This provided clinically relevant information to remove the LN and stage the patient.

TI  - Influence of the Solar Spectra Models on PACO Atmospheric Correction
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The solar irradiance is the source of energy used by passive optical remote sensing to measure the ground reflectance and, from there, derive the ground properties. Therefore, the precise knowledge of the incoming solar irradiance is fundamental for the atmospheric correction (AC) algorithms. These algorithms use the simulation results of a model of the interactions of the atmosphere with the incoming solar irradiance to determine the atmospheric contribution of the remote sensing observations. This study presents the differences in the atmospherically corrected ground reflectance of multi- and hyper-spectral sensors assuming three different solar models: Thuillier 2003, Fontenla 2011 and TSIS-1 HRS. The results show no difference when the solar irradiance model is preserved through the full processing chain. The differences appear when the solar irradiance model used in the atmospheric correction changes, and this difference is larger between some irrradiance models (e.g., TSIS and Thuillier 2003) than for others (e.g., Fontenla 2011 and TSIS).

TI  - Long term follow up of direct oral anticoagulants and warfarin therapy on stroke, with all-cause mortality as a competing risk, in people with atrial fibrillation: Sentinel network database study
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundWe investigated differences in risk of stroke, with all-cause mortality as a competing risk, in people newly diagnosed with atrial fibrillation (AF) who were commenced on either direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) or warfarin treatment.Methods and resultsWe conducted a retrospective cohort study of the Oxford Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) database (a network of 500 English general practices). We compared long term exposure to DOAC (n = 5,168) and warfarin (n = 7,451) in new cases of AF not previously treated with oral anticoagulants. Analyses included: survival analysis, estimating cause specific hazard ratios (CSHR), Fine-Gray analysis for factors affecting cumulative incidence of events occurring over time and a cumulative risk regression with time varying effects.We found no difference in CSHR between stroke 1.08 (0.72-1.63, p = 0.69) and all-cause mortality 0.93 (0.81-1.08, p = 0.37), or between the anticoagulant groups. Fine-Gray analysis produced similar results 1.07 (0.71-1.6 p = 0.75) for stroke and 0.93 (0.8-1.07, p = 0.3) mortality. The cumulative risk of mortality with DOAC was significantly elevated in early follow-up (67 days), with cumulative risk decreasing until 1,537 days and all-cause mortality risk significantly decreased coefficient estimate:: -0.23 (-0.38-0.01, p = 0.001); which persisted over seven years of follow-up.ConclusionsIn this large, contemporary, real world primary care study with longer follow-up, we found no overall difference in the hazard of stroke between warfarin and DOAC treatment for AF. However, there was a significant time-varying effect between anti-coagulant regimen on all-cause mortality, with DOACs showing better survival. This is a key methodological observation for future follow-up studies, and reassuring for patients and health care professionals for longer duration of therapy

TI  - Monitoring Long-Term Spatiotemporal Changes in Iran Surface Waters Using Landsat Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Within water resources management, surface water area (SWA) variation plays a vital role in hydrological processes as well as in agriculture, environmental ecosystems, and ecological processes. The monitoring of long-term spatiotemporal SWA changes is even more critical within highly populated regions that have an arid or semi-arid climate, such as Iran. This paper examined variations in SWA in Iran from 1990 to 2021 using about 18,000 Landsat 5, 7, and 8 satellite images through the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud processing platform. To this end, the performance of twelve water mapping rules (WMRs) within remotely-sensed imagery was also evaluated. Our findings revealed that (1) methods which provide a higher separation (derived from transformed divergence (TD) and Jefferies-Matusita (JM) distances) between the two target classes (water and non-water) result in higher classification accuracy (overall accuracy (OA) and user accuracy (UA) of each class). (2) Near-infrared (NIR)-based WMRs are more accurate than short-wave infrared (SWIR)-based methods for arid regions. (3) The SWA in Iran has an overall downward trend (observed by linear regression (LR) and sequential Mann-Kendall (SQMK) tests). (4) Of the five major water basins, only the Persian Gulf Basin had an upward trend. (5) While temperature has trended upward, the precipitation and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), a measure of the country's greenness, have experienced a downward trend. (6) Precipitation showed the highest correlation with changes in SWA (r = 0.69). (7) Long-term changes in SWA were highly correlated (r = 0.98) with variations in the JRC world water map.

TI  - Fatal Hypernatremic Dehydration in a Term Exclusively Breastfed Newborn
T2  - CHILDREN-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Hypernatremic dehydration in term newborns has steadily increased in incidence with increasing efforts to promote exclusive breastfeeding before hospital discharge, a key metric of the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative. The following report details a case of a term newborn infant who had evidence of poor intake while exclusively breastfeeding during his hospital stay that may not have been recognized by health care providers. The infant was discharged home and was subsequently found by the parents in cardiac arrest 12 h after discharge and was found to have hypernatremic dehydration. Although return of spontaneous circulation was achieved after fluid resuscitation, the infant sustained extensive hypoxic-ischemic brain injury due to cardiovascular collapse. Due to the infant's extremely poor prognosis, life support was withdrawn at 19 days of age and the infant expired. This sentinel case demonstrates multiple pitfalls of current perceptions of normal vs. abnormal newborn feeding behavior, weight loss percentages, elimination patterns, and acceptable clinical thresholds believed to be safe for neonates. Newer data have shown that hypernatremia occurs commonly in healthy, term breastfed newborns at weight loss percentages previously deemed normal by most health professionals and hospital protocols. In-hospital strategies to prevent excessive weight loss and screening for hypernatremia in response to signs of inadequate feeding have the potential to prevent tens of thousands of readmissions for feeding complications a year, as well as hundreds of millions in health care costs.

TI  - Validation of Remote-Sensing Algorithms for Diffuse Attenuation of Downward Irradiance Using BGC-Argo Floats
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimates of the diffuse attenuation coefficient (K-d) at two different wavelengths and band-integrated (PAR) were obtained using different published algorithms developed for open ocean waters spanning in type from explicit-empirical, semi-analytical and implicit-empirical and applied to data from spectral radiometers on board six different satellites (MODIS-Aqua, MODIS-Terra, VIIRS-SNPP, VIIRS-JPSS, OLCI-Sentinel 3A and OLCI-Sentinel 3B). The resultant K(d)s were compared to those inferred from measurements of radiometry from sensors on board autonomous profiling floats (BGC-Argo). Advantages of BGC-Argo measurements compared to ship-based ones include: 1. uniform sampling in time throughout the year, 2. large spatial coverage, and 3. lack of shading by platform. Over 5000 quality-controlled matchups between K(d)s derived from float and from satellite sensors were found with values ranging from 0.01 to 0.67 m(-1). Our results show that although all three algorithm types provided similarly ranging values of K-d to those of the floats, for most sensors, a given algorithm produced statistically different K-d distributions from the two others. Algorithm results diverged the most for low K-d (clearest waters). Algorithm biases were traced to the limitations of the datasets the algorithms were developed and trained with, as well as the neglect of sun angle in some algorithms. This study highlights: 1. the importance of using comprehensive field-based datasets (such as BGC-Argo) for algorithm development, 2. the limitation of using radiative-transfer model simulations only for algorithm development, and 3. the potential for improvement if sun angle is taken into account explicitly to improve empirical K-d algorithms. Recent augmentation of profiling floats with hyper-spectral radiometers should be encouraged as they will provide additional constraints to develop algorithms for upcoming missions such as NASA's PACE and SBG and ESA's CHIME, all of which will include a hyper-spectral radiometer.

TI  - Detection of Water Spread Area Changes in Eutrophic Lake Using Landsat Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Adequate water resource management is essential for fulfilling ecosystem and human needs. Nainital Lake is a popular lake in Uttarakhand State in India, attracting lakhs of tourists annually. Locals also use the lake water for domestic purposes and irrigation. The increasing impact of climate change and over-exploration of water from lakes make their regular monitoring key to implementing effective conservation measures and preventing substantial degradation. In this study, dynamic change in the water spread area of Nainital Lake from 2001 to 2018 has been investigated using the multiband rationing indices, namely normalized difference water index (NDWI), modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI), and water ratio index (WRI). The model has been developed in QGIS 3.4 software. A physical GPS survey of the lake was conducted to check the accuracy of these indices. Furthermore, to determine the trend in water surface area for a studied period, a non-parametric Mann-Kendall test was used. San's slope estimator test determined the magnitude of the trend and total percentage change. The result of the physical survey shows that NDWI was the best method, with an accuracy of 96.94%. Hence, the lake water spread area trend is determined based on calculated NDWI values. The lake water spread area significantly decreased from March to June and July to October at a 5% significance level. The maximum decrease in water spread area has been determined from March to June (7.7%), which was followed by the period July to October (4.67%) and then November to February (2.79%). The study results show that the lake's water spread area decreased sharply for the analyzed period. The study might be helpful for the government, policymakers, and water experts to make plans for reclaiming and restoring Nainital Lake. This study is very helpful in states such as Uttarakhand, where physical mapping is not possible every time due to its tough topography and climate conditions.

TI  - Beyond N Staging in Breast Cancer: Importance of MRI and Ultrasound-based Imaging
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Simple Summary Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer affecting women and metastatic breast cancer is still the leading cause of death from all cancers in women, accounting for about 3.6% of all deaths in women. The N-stage represents the main prognostic factor affecting the rate of recurrence and the therapeutic management so that a correct staging of the axillary lymph node status is fundamental. Since clinical examination of the axillary cavity is associated with a high false negative rate, reaching values of 45%, the role of imaging becomes crucial to obtain an accurate assessment of loco-regional lymph nodes at the time of diagnosis. In this setting, Ultrasound and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) represent two important diagnostic tools. In particular, MRI represents an accurate and reproducible technique, which allows an accurate staging of the "N-stage". The correct N-staging in breast cancer is crucial to tailor treatment and stratify the prognosis. N-staging is based on the number and the localization of suspicious regional nodes on physical examination and/or imaging. Since clinical examination of the axillary cavity is associated with a high false negative rate, imaging modalities play a central role. In the presence of a T1 or T2 tumor and 0-2 suspicious nodes, on imaging at the axillary level I or II, a patient should undergo sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), whereas in the presence of three or more suspicious nodes at the axillary level I or II confirmed by biopsy, they should undergo axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) or neoadjuvant chemotherapy according to a multidisciplinary approach, as well as in the case of internal mammary, supraclavicular, or level III axillary involved lymph nodes. In this scenario, radiological assessment of lymph nodes at the time of diagnosis must be accurate. False positives may preclude a sentinel lymph node in an otherwise eligible woman; in contrast, false negatives may lead to an unnecessary SLNB and the need for a second surgical procedure. In this review, we aim to describe the anatomy of the axilla and breast regional lymph node, and their diagnostic features to discriminate between normal and pathological nodes at Ultrasound (US) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Moreover, the technical aspects, the advantage and limitations of MRI versus US, and the possible future perspectives are also analyzed, through the analysis of the recent literature.

TI  - Evolution of the <i>Ace-1</i> and <i>Gste2</i> Mutations and Their Potential Impact on the Use of Carbamate and Organophosphates in IRS for Controlling <i>Anopheles gambiae s.l</i>., the Major Malaria Mosquito in Senegal
T2  - PATHOGENS
M3  - Article
AB  - Widespread of insecticide resistance amongst the species of the Anopheles gambiae complex continues to threaten vector control in Senegal. In this study, we investigated the presence and evolution of the Ace-1 and Gste2 resistance genes in natural populations of Anopheles gambiae s.l., the main malaria vector in Senegal. Using historical samples collected from ten sentinel health districts, this study focused on three different years (2013, 2017, and 2018) marking the periods of shift between the main public health insecticides families (pyrethroids, carbamates, organophosphates) used in IRS to track back the evolutionary history of the resistance mutations on the Ace-1 and Gste2 loci. The results revealed the presence of four members of the Anopheles gambiae complex, with the predominance of An. arabiensis followed by An. gambiae, An. coluzzii, and An. gambiae - coluzzii hybrids. The Ace-1 mutation was only detected in An. gambiae and An. gambiae - coluzzii hybrids at low frequencies varying between 0.006 and 0.02, while the Gste2 mutation was found in all the species with a frequency ranging between 0.02 and 0.25. The Ace-1 and Gste2 genes were highly diversified with twenty-two and thirty-one different haplotypes, respectively. The neutrality tests on each gene indicated a negative Tajima's D, suggesting the abundance of rare alleles. The presence and spread of the Ace-1 and Gste2 resistance mutations represent a serious threat to of the effectiveness and the sustainability of IRS-based interventions using carbamates or organophosphates to manage the widespread pyrethroids resistance in Senegal. These data are of the highest importance to support the NMCP for evidence-based vector control interventions selection and targeting.

TI  - Slope Deformation Prediction Based on MT-InSAR and Fbprophet for Deep Excavation Section of South-North Water Transfer Project
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the operation and maintenance of the South-North Water Transfer Project, monitoring and predicting the canal slope deformation quickly and efficiently is one of the urgent problems to be solved. To predict the slope deformation of the deep excavated canal section at the head of the canal. We propose a new idea of adopting the joint prediction of MT-InSAR and Fbprophet. Firstly, MT-InSAR monitoring technology was used to invert channel deformation using 88 Sentinel-1A orbit-raising image data with a time baseline from 2017 to 2019. The time-series deformation of nine monitoring points was also extracted, and it was found that the time-series curves of the cumulative deformation of the channel slope showed fluctuations. The Fbprophet algorithm was then used to train the prediction model in Python to predict the channel slope deformation over the next 365 days. Finally, the prediction results were compared with the MT-InSAR monitoring values to analyze the prediction accuracy and applicability of the Fbprophet algorithm for the slope deformation monitoring of the South-North Water Transfer Project. The results show that: the deformation rate of the slope of the deep excavation section is in the range of 10 mm/a to 25 mm/a, the maximum accumulated deformation is about 60 mm, and the slope of the excavation canal shows a lifting phenomenon; among the nine monitoring points, the minimum and maximum predicted values of deformation using the machine learning prediction model trained in this paper were 56 mm and 73 mm, respectively; comparing the predicted and monitored values, their correlation coefficients were 0.998 at the highest and 0.988 at the lowest, and the minimum and maximum values of RMSE (RootMean Square Error) were 0.72 mm and 2.87 mm, respectively. It shows that the prediction model trained by the Fbprophet algorithm in this paper applies to the prediction of slope deformation in the deep excavation section, and our prediction results can provide a data reference for disaster prevention and the sustainable development of the South-North Water Transfer Project.

TI  - Monitoring glaciers in the Chenab basin with SBAS InSAR technology
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Chenab basin is located in northwest India and eastern Pakistan. Glaciers in Chenab basin, as local freshwater resources, are very important to the regional ecological environment and development. At the same time, SBAS InSAR can monitor the deformation of the ground for a long time, the monitoring accuracy can reach mm level, and can obtain the time series change of deformation, whcih provides a new idea and method for glacier detection. In this study, the deformation from SBAS InSAR was combined with glacial area data to study the glacial changes in Chenab Basin. Sentinel-1 and Landsat series images were used to obtain the deformation and change in the area of glaciers by SBAS InSAR and the semi-automated method. The results showed that glaciers in the Chenab basin retreated rapidly, especially in the past ten years. The glacier area decreased by 88.05 km(2) in 1990 similar to 2000 and 118.86 km(2) in 2000 similar to 2010, and the glacier area decreased by 236.01 km(2) in 2010 similar to 2020, which was the largest rate of change of 9.49%. Moreover, glacial deformation decreased in 2020, and the deformation rate ranged from -146.3 mm/a to 119.52 mm/a. Most glaciers had deformation rates between -50 mm/a and 50 mm/a. Influenced by precipitation and temperature, glacial deformation in the Chenab basin started to change in August, the maximum accumulation was 6,828.43 mm, and the minimum ablation was -20,656.41 mm.

TI  - <i>Aedes</i> Mosquito Surveillance Using Ovitraps, Sweep Nets, and Biogent Traps in the City of Yaounde, Cameroon
T2  - INSECTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary The emergence/re-emergence of arboviruses diseases including dengue, chikungunya, and yellow fever is of serious public health concern in Cameroon and vector surveillance is a key component of prevention strategies. Entomological surveys were carried out in and around the city of Yaounde, Cameroon, using different collection methods including ovitraps, Biogent Sentinel traps, and sweep nets to assess Aedes species distribution. Results indicated high infestation level of Aedes species using ovitraps in the city of Yaounde. The situation calls for regular surveillance and control of Aedes population to prevent the sudden occurrence of outbreaks. Arbovirus diseases represent a significant public health problem in Cameroon and vector surveillance is a key component of prevention strategies. However, there is still not enough evidence of the efficacy of different sampling methods used to monitor Aedes mosquito population dynamic in different epidemiological settings. The present study provides data on the evaluation of ovitraps and different adult sampling methods in the city of Yaounde and its close vicinity. Entomological surveys were carried out from February 2020 to March 2021 in two urban (Obili, Mvan), two peri-urban (Simbock, Ahala), and two rural (Lendom, Elig-essomballa) sites in the city of Yaounde. The efficacy of three sampling methods, namely ovitraps, Biogent Sentinel trap, and sweep nets, was evaluated. Different ovitrap indices were used to assess the infestation levels across study sites; a general linear model was used to determine if there are statistical differences between positive ovitraps across ecological zones. A total of 16,264 Aedes mosquitoes were collected during entomological surveys. Ovitraps provided the highest mosquito abundance (15,323; 91.14%) and the highest species diversity. Of the five Aedes species collected, Aedes albopictus (59.74%) was the most commonly recorded in both urban and rural settings. Different Aedes species were collected in the same ovitrap. The ovitrap positivity index was high in all sites and varied from 58.3% in Obili in the urban area to 86.08% in Lendom in the rural area. The egg density index varied from 6.42 in Mvan (urban site) to 13.70 in Lendom (rural area). Adult sampling methods recorded mostly Aedes albopictus. The present study supports high infestation of Aedes species in the city of Yaounde. Ovitraps were highly efficient in detecting Aedes distribution across study sites. The situation calls for regular surveillance and control of Aedes population to prevent sudden occurrence of outbreaks.

TI  - Urban Resilience and Residential Greenery-The Evidence from Poland
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Social distancing and movement restrictions associated with COVID-19 have highlighted the role played by easily accessible greenery at one's own residence, which is of key importance to people's physical and psychological wellbeing. The main focus of this study is to provide insights into residential green areas in Wroclaw, Poland in terms of knowledge, investment, trends and associated issues, as examined from the perspective of the potential to boost urban resilience. Sixty-six representative multi-family construction projects typical of Central European cities were analyzed. The study is divided into three stages: I-pre-construction (selection of locations), II-construction of a housing estate (clearance of vegetation, number of trees planted, use of pro-ecological solutions), and III-post-construction (monitoring of the condition of green areas by means of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and data from Sentinel-2 satellites). The results highlighted the insufficient use of pro-ecological solutions (green roofs, fountains or ponds) and shortage of woody plants in residential green areas. Their implementation should be included in any strategies for Wroclaw's transformation toward a sustainable post-pandemic city. Furthermore, the main findings of the study also revealed an imbalance between the amount of vegetation cleared vs. vegetation planted during construction and unequal access to high-quality greenery for local residents. Although some positive trends in spatial planning were observed compared to previous studies, two construction projects were implemented in floodplains. NDVI analyses indicate the poor condition of residential green areas; moreover, the change in NDVI for the period 2015-2020 attests to the poor standards of vegetation maintenance. The results of this study suggest that the potential of residential green areas for boosting urban resilience has not been fully utilized in Wroclaw. It is highly recommended to implement monitoring of the condition of green areas by means of NDVI and to introduce detailed provisions on the shaping of green estate areas in the Local Development Plans to enhance Wroclaw's resilience. The main findings being presented expand the directions of methods of monitoring residential areas' conditions in terms of applied landscape research and boosting urban resilience.

TI  - Exploring key drivers of forest fires in the Mole National Park of Ghana using geospatial tools
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Ghana's forest and wildlife reserves are depleting at an alarming rate and hence, the Mole National Park which is considered the oldest and largest wildlife protected area in Ghana is no exception. Bush fires are a major contributor to this menace. Fire hotspot prediction and mapping using satellite data provides a better alternative to monitoring and addressing wildfires compared to the observation of smoke emission which is the conventional tool used to detect forest fires in most parts of the country. This study sought to probe into fire incidences within the park using geospatial tools with an emphasis on climatic variables and anthropogenic activities as drivers. The research shows a weak positive correlation for fire counts to climatic variables (temperature and precipitation), giving credence to human-induced factors as majorly responsible while climatic conditions serve as a background catalyst to these fire incidences. Forest fire counts and their associated burnt area statistics between 2002 and 2019 are also presented. To reduce human-induced forest fires, this study recommends several interventions to help manage the challenge of wildfires at the reserve while highlighting the essential role of GIS and remote-sensing tools in monitoring and managing wildfires within protected areas.

TI  - [Classification of forest types in Cuigang Forest Farm based on time series data of Landsat 8].
T2  - Ying yong sheng tai xue bao = The journal of applied ecology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - To explore the practical role of enhanced vegetation index (EVI) time series data in improving the accuracy of forest type recognition could promote the deep application of optical remote sensing data in forest resources investigation and monitoring. With Cuigang Forest Farm of Xinlin Forestry Bureau in Daxing'anling as the object, we constructed six classification schemes, using random forest algorithm with spectral feature, texture feature and EVI time series feature. The data sources were 20-view Landsat 8 OLI time series data from 2014 to 2018, 56 fixed plots data from 2017-2019, and the 2016 Class II survey data. Our aims were to realize the classification of forest types in Cuigang Forest Farm and to evaluate the accuracy of different classification schemes. The results showed the EVI values of Larix gmelinii forest, Betula platyphylla forest, coniferous-broadleaved mixed forest, coniferous mixed forest and broadleaved mixed forest were significantly different in non-growing seasons (36-111 days and 287-367 days), with the EVI value of mixed conifer forest being significantly higher, and that of mixed broadleaf forest being always lower than the other four forest types. In the early growing season (111-143 days), the EVI value of B. platyphylla forest were higher than L. gmelinii forest, which could effectively distinguish the two forests. Among the six classification schemes, spectral feature, texture feature, and EVI time series feature had the highest classification accuracy, with a Kappa of 0.82 and a classification accuracy of 86.1%.

TI  - The Estimation of a Remote Sensing Model of Three-Dimensional Green Space Quantity and Research into Its Cooling Effect in Hohhot, China
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - With the continuous advancement of urbanization, the urban heat island effect has become increasingly prominent. Studying the cooling effect of urban green space can provide direction for improving the comfort of urban residents and reducing the harm caused by the urban heat island. In this paper, the band information was extracted from remote sensing images, and eight vegetation indices were calculated for Hohhot, such as normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) and vegetation coverage (VC). The land surface temperature (LST) was calculated using the split-window algorithm, and the total 3D-GSQ, the three-dimensional green space quantity per unit area (3D-GSQP), and the single plant 3D-GSQ of different tree species were measured on the spot. The relationships between 3D-GSQP and eight vegetation indexes were processed by correlation analysis and regression analysis, and the remote sensing estimation model of 3D-GSQP was established. The correlation between 3D-GSQP and LST was established, and the cooling effect was analyzed in depth. The results indicate that: (1) The contributions to 3D-GSQ types of common tree in the built-up area of Hohhot are (from large to small): Salix babylonica, Populus hopeiensis, Gleditsia sinensis Lam, Salix matsudana, and Saphora japonica; and the 3D-GSQ of single types of shrubs are (from large to small): Amygdalus triloba, syringa oblata, Sorbaria sorbifolia, ligustrum lucidum, and Euonymus alatus. (2) The linear equation with the chlorophyll vegetation index (CVI) as the independent variable is suitable for the parameters of an inversion model for the 3D-GSQP (R-2 = 0.72), and the regression model of the two is: 3D-GSQP = -30.412 + 35.842 x CVI. (3) The 3D-GSQP in the study area is mainly in the range of 0-15.78 m(3)/m(2), and in such range it has an obvious negative relationship (R-2 = -0.73) with LST to the level of 0.01 (unilateral). When the 3D-GSQP increases by 1 m(3)/m(2), the LST decreases by 0.55 degrees C, and this result sufficiently indicates that the urban green has an obvious cooling effect. In the future, in order to improve the living environment of urban residents, in addition to considering the green space area, we should pay more attention to the requirements of the 3D-GSQP index.

TI  - Modeling Actual Evapotranspiration with MSI-Sentinel Images and Machine Learning Algorithms
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The modernization of computational resources and application of artificial intelligence algorithms have led to advancements in studies regarding the evapotranspiration of crops by remote sensing. Therefore, this research proposed the application of machine learning algorithms to estimate the ETrF (Evapotranspiration Fraction) of sugar can crop using the METRIC (Mapping Evapotranspiration at High Resolution with Internalized Calibration) model with data from the Sentinel-2 satellites constellation. In order to achieve this goal, images from the MSI sensor (MultiSpectral Instrument) from the Sentinel-2 and the OLI (Operational Land Imager) and TIRS (Thermal Infrared Sensor) sensors from the Landsat-8 were acquired nearly at the same time between the years 2018 and 2020 for sugar cane crops. Images from OLI and TIR sensors were intended to calculate ETrF through METRIC (target variable), while for the MSI sensor images, the explanatory variables were extracted in two approaches, using 10 m (approach 1) and 20 m (approach 2) spatial resolution. The results showed that the algorithms were able to identify patterns in the MSI sensor data to predict the ETrF of the METRIC model. For approach 1, the best predictions were XgbLinear (R-2 = 0.80; RMSE = 0.15) and XgbTree (R-2 = 0.80; RMSE = 0.15). For approach 2, the algorithm that demonstrated superiority was the XgbLinear (R-2 = 0.91; RMSE = 0.10), respectively. Thus, it became evident that machine learning algorithms, when applied to the MSI sensor, were able to estimate the ETrF in a simpler way than the one that involves energy balance with the thermal band used in the METRIC model.

TI  - Impact of a bloodstream infection stewardship program in hospitalized patients.
T2  - Journal of the Association of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Disease Canada = Journal officiel de l'Association pour la microbiologie medicale et l'infectiologie Canada
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bloodstream infections (BSIs) in hospitalized patients represent sentinel events requiring timely and responsive antimicrobial prescribing. These infections represent an attractive but seldom-evaluated stewardship opportunity.METHODS: Retrospective pre-post study design, with review of patient charts 18 months before and after initiation of a hospital Bloodstream Infection Stewardship Program (BSISP). Pre-intervention, the ward and attending physician were notified of all positive blood cultures. Post-intervention, an infectious disease (ID) pharmacist collaborating with an ID consultant was also notified.RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-six eligible BSIs were identified pre-intervention and 195 post-intervention. The urinary tract was the most common source of infection; most common bloodstream isolates were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and Klebsiella pneumoniae; 71.7% of infections were community acquired. Empiric therapy was not given in 17.3% of cases and inadequate in 16.4% of patients. Therapy was altered on the basis of Gram stain results ('directed therapy') in 54.6% of episodes and was inadequate in 3.5%. Compared to pre-intervention, the post-intervention cohort received directed therapy on average 4.36 hours earlier (p = 0.003), was more likely to receive appropriate definitive therapy (99.0% post versus 79.1% pre, p <0.001), stepped down to oral therapy earlier (6.0 versus 8.0 days, p = 0.031), and received fewer directed prescriptions (214 per 100 cases post versus 260 per 100 cases pre; p = 0.001), including fewer prescriptions of quinolones and clindamycin.CONCLUSIONS: A BSISP could be an effective strategy for improving antimicrobial prescribing in hospitalized patients with a BSI.

TI  - Fast InSAR Time-Series Analysis Method in a Full-Resolution SAR Coordinate System: A Case Study of the Yellow River Delta
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground deformation is a major determinant of delta sustainability. Sentinel-1 Terrain Observation by Progressive Scans (TOPS) data are widely used in interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) applications to monitor ground subsidence. Due to the unparalleled mapping coverage and considerable data volume requirements, high-performance computing resources including graphics processing units (GPUs) are employed in state-of-the-art methodologies. This paper presents a fast InSAR time-series processing approach targeting Sentinel-1 TOPS images to process massive data with higher efficiency and resolution. We employed a GPU-assisted InSAR processing method to accelerate data processing. Statistically homogeneous pixel selection (SHPS) filtering was used to reduce noise and detect features in scenes with minimal image resolution loss. Compared to the commonly used InSAR processing software, the proposed method significantly improved the Sentinel-1 TOPS data processing efficiency. The feasibility of the method was investigated by mapping the surface deformation over the Yellow River Delta using SAR datasets acquired between January 2021 and February 2022. The findings indicate that several events of significant subsidence have occurred in the study area. Combined with the geological environment, underground brine and hydrocarbon extraction as well as sediment consolidation and compaction contribute to land subsidence in the Yellow River Delta.

TI  - Research Progress of Infrared Thin Film Coatings Applied in Space Remote Sensing Systems(Invited)
T2  - ACTA PHOTONICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - As one of the great achievements of modern science and technology, remote sensing technology is an effective means for human beings to understand the objective world. The demands in the fields of weather forecast, resource exploration, environmental monitoring, disaster assessment and deep space exploration have promoted the rapid development of space infrared remote sensing technology. In the space infrared optical system, optical thin film coatings undertake the functions of optical energy transfer, optical spectrum division and distribution, working band limitation and out of band suppression, system polarization sensitivity regulation and so on. Space optical remote sensing instruments are widely used in weather forecasting,earth mapping, astronomical observation and other fields. Reflective optical systems are mostly used due to long detection distance, large aperture and limited volume and weight;In order to obtain as much target information as possible, its spectral coverage is generally wide,and the working spectral band from near ultraviolet to long wave infrared is also common; It is necessary to accurately limit the spectrum of the working band to obtain the detailed characteristics of the target; In addition, in order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the system, it is necessary to suppress the spectrum of specific wavelength efficiently. The coatings mentioned above are used frequently in space optical remote sensing systems. The detection range of space optical instruments can be extended from 100 km to light years. In order to improve the system's ability to collect target beam energy and distinguish target details, it is necessary to improve the aperture of the optical system. It is difficult for the transmission optical elements to achieve large size because of the limitations of material uniformity and defects; The reflective optical system has no chromatic aberration and no secondary spectrum, so it is easier to realize wide-band imaging; The reflection system can fold the optical path by using the folding mirror to reduce the volume of the system; The large aperture mirror is easy to be lightweight,which can effectively reduce the weight of the system. Based on the above reasons, the reflective structure plays a leading role in the design of space remote sensing optical instruments, and the mirrors have also become an indispensable optical element in the system. The design of mirror film can be roughly divided into three technical routes:metal reflective film,all dielectric multilayer reflective film, and metal dielectric composite multilayer reflective film. For space optical instruments with a wide spectrum, all dielectric multilayers are rarely used due to the technical characteristics of narrow reflection band, film thickness and stress. Metal film and metal dielectric composite film are common technical schemes. In spaceborne optical instruments, the materials commonly used to prepare metal reflective films are aluminum(Al), silver (Ag) , gold (Au) , etc. Aluminum is the only metal material with stable reflectivity from ultraviolet to infrared band. It has been successfully used in the preparation of main mirror reflection film of many large aperture space telescopes. Aluminum film mirrors for space applications usually need to prepare protective films on the outer layer of metal aluminum. The materials and processes of protective films are different according to the application requirements. For example, the working band of the Hubble telescope is from ultraviolet to infrared.MgF2 is used as the protective film in order to prevent the reflectivity of ultraviolet band from decreasing due to the oxidation of aluminum film in the air; SiOx is selected as the protective film of Al for the Herschel telescope working in the infrared band. With the increasing requirements of space remote sensing system for the optical performance of large aperture mirror, the problem of low absolute reflectivity of aluminum mirror restricts its wider application. Silver material has high and stable reflectivity from visible light to long wave infrared band,and also has the smallest polarization effect in all metal thin film materials. Therefore,it has become the choice for the preparation of main mirror reflection film of large aperture space remote sensing instrument in recent years. Gold material has obvious absorption at < 600 nm,which limits its application in space remote sensing instruments with visible light in the working spectrum. However,for space remote sensing instruments working in infrared band, gold is a good choice for preparing mirror film. Firstly,the gold film has high reflectivity in the whole infrared band; Secondly, the chemical properties of the gold film are stable, and it hardly reacts with other substances, resulting in performance degradation,or even no need to prepare a protective film. Au was used to coat the primary mirrors of the James Webb Space Telescope, which was launched at the end of 2021. Though the main optical telescope of space infrared optical instruments is usually designed with reflective structure, lens or optical windows are indispensable optical thin film elements in the subsequent optical path. Antireflection coatings are used to improve the optical transmission efficiency and eliminate the ghosting artifacts caused by the residual reflectance. The refractive index span of optical materials used as infrared lenses or windows is large. The refractive index of low refractive index materials such as BaF2 and MgF2 is less than 1.4, while the refractive index of high refractive index materials represented by Si and Ge is more than 3.4. According to Fresnel formula,the greater the difference in refractive index between the two optical interfaces, the higher the residual reflection generated on the two optical surfaces. The residual reflection on one side of Ge window without antireflection reaches 36%. The more optical surfaces,the more serious the optical energy loss. Therefore, infrared antireflection coatings are of great significance for infrared lenses and windows. For the design and fabrication of infrared AR coatings, the choice of film materials is relatively limited, and the materials have more or less certain absorption. Both high optical efficiency and the adaptability of space environment are very important to the infrared AR coatings for space application. The working wavelength of space optical instruments often covers a wide spectral range. No detector can respond the full spectral range from visible to far infrared. The common technical scheme uses multi-stage dichroic beam splitters to separate the optical signals of different spectral range into different optical paths. In order to improve the performance of detectors, infrared detectors for space applications generally work in low temperature environment,while detectors in ultraviolet, visible and near-infrared bands work near room temperature. Moreover, some instruments even put the whole infrared light path in the cold box to reduce the background noise.So the broadband dichroic beam splitter, which covers the whole spectral range of the instrument, is designed to separate the spectra of visible and near-infrared from infrared. There are two methods to design the broadband dichroic beam splitter. One is induced-transmission dielectric-metal-dielectric structure, the other is multiple long- wave pass stacks. The first scheme is adopted by GOES-R ABI and FY-4A/B AGRI, and the second is used by FY-4C AGRI and MTG FCI. The infrared hyper-spectral vertical sounder can take measurements of three dimensional atmospheric structures from interference of split light beams, via a Michelson interferometer working over different infrared bands for large-area,continuous, fast, and accurate vertical air soundings of temperature and humidity. Infrared neutral beam splitter is the key thin film component of the infrared Fourier-transform spectrometer. A device which divides a beam of light into two parts is known as a beam splitter. The functional part of a beam splitter generally consists of a plane surface coated to have a specified transmittance and reflectance over a certain wavelength range. Meteorological satellites represented by NOAA in the United States and METOP in Europe are equipped with interferometric infrared vertical detection instruments. The development and application of interferometric space infrared hyperspectral instrument in China is relatively late due to the constraints of some materials and key technologies. However,with the breakthrough of broadband infrared neutral beam splitter, of which the wavelength band is from 4.44 mu m to 14.29 mu m and the surface shape is about 1/ 50 lambda, China has risen rapidly in this field. A filter which possesses a region of transmission bounded on either side by regions of rejection is known as a bandpass filter. In the traditional multi-band space remote sensing instrument, the filter is usually matched with the detector chip to realize the accurate positioning of the required working band. With the maturity and development of grating splitting, prism splitting and interference splitting, there are more ways to subdivide and select the working band, but the filter still plays an important role. In recent years, new progress has been made in infrared integrated filters. Integrated devices such as multi-channel integrated filters,dual-band-pass filters,and linearly variable filters have been successfully used in space optical instruments. Polarization describes the vibration mode of electric vector in the process of light propagation. There are some differences in the polarization information of radiated or reflected light on different target surfaces, which provides a new degree of freedom for space remote sensing to obtain information. Polarization has been successfully applied in space remote sensing instruments. The polarization of light is affected by the shape and material of the object surface. Infrared imaging with additional polarization information can greatly improve the contrast between different objects, which is of great value for target recognition. However, compared with the visible light and near-infrared wavelengths, polarization in the infrared band is more difficult to control, which brings a series of challenges to the design and preparation of infrared polarization regulated films. The reliability of optical thin film elements refers to the probability of completing the specified functions within the specified time under the working environment conditions.The working life, which is related to the orbit environment,character of the task, budget and so on, may vary from one application to another. The working life of space remote sensing instruments is an important assessment index. The reliability and space environment simulation test on the ground is an important guarantee for the optical thin film elements to meet the on orbit operation life. Since the birth of space remote sensing instrument, human beings have never stopped pursuing higher performance indicators. The demand of the system has promoted the continuous progress of optical thin film technology. Some new optical thin film elements have been widely used in space remote sensing systems. Larger aperture, wider spectral range, higher optical transmission efficiency, finer light splitting and higher integration are still the unremitting goals of optical thin film development.

M3  - Article
AB  - Modeling the Earth's ionosphere is a critical component of forecasting space weather, which in turn impacts radio wave propagation, navigation and communication. This research focuses on predicting the electron density in the topside of the ionosphere using satellite data, in particular from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program, a collection of 19 satellites that have been polar orbiting the Earth for various lengths of times, fully covering 1982 to the present. An artificial neural network was developed and trained on two solar cycles worth of data (113 satellite-years), along with global drivers and indices such as F10.7, interplanetary magnetic field, and Kp to generate an electron density prediction. We tested the model on six years of subsequent data (26 satellite-years), and found a correlation coefficient of 0.87. Once trained, the model can predict topside electron density at any location specified by latitude and longitude given current/recent geomagnetic conditions. We validated the model via comparison with data from the DEMETER satellite which orbited at a similar altitude, and taking that as an independent source of true electron density values. Comparing our results to the International Reference Ionosphere, we find that our model works better at low to mid-latitudes, and for quiet and moderately disturbed geomagnetic conditions, but not for highly disturbed conditions.

TI  - <i>Gamay at Hiyang</i>: Reconstructing Fray Juan de Oliver's <i>Declaracion de la Doctrina Christiana en Idioma Tagalog</i> as a Catechetical Paradigm
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - During the American annexation of the Philippines, a classic English catechism designed in a question-and-answer format known as the Baltimore catechism became popular. Apparently, that said catechism served as the standard Catholic catechetical text (lingua franca) in the country from 1900 to the late 1960s. There is no single best method and approach in the ministry of catechesis. However, cultural appreciation of the people is essential to realize purposeful and meaningful catechesis. In the celebration of the Quincentenario of the arrival of Catholicism in the Philippines, it is a fitting tribute to recognize Fray Juan de Oliver, O.F.M. and revisit his Declaracion de la Doctrina Christian en Idioma Tagalog which he used from 1582 to 1591 when he was tasked to evangelize the locals of Balayan, Batangas during the early stages of the Catholic propagation in Luzon. The 188-page catechism attributed to de Oliver was all written in Tagalog which meant that he persevered in learning the local language to impart the Catholic teachings strikingly to the natives. Through historical and textual analysis, the proponent intends to reconstruct de Oliver's adaptable and comfortable (gamay) methods and approaches of catechizing in a suitable way (hiyang) to the worldview, language, and culture of the locals. Likewise, de Oliver's catechetical pedagogy may also serve as a pedagogical paradigm for priests, religious educators, and catechists in conducting contextualized catechesis.

AB  - Rationale. Interest in the knowledge of the art language essence, the search for different models of its description and study are typical not only for modern science in general, but also for cognitive approach in culture studies in particular. This explains the publication relevance, that is expressed in the accumulative function of language and culture, connecting the outside world objects and human consciousness, providing a systematic and orderly reality image.The article aim is to objectify the problem of correlation between the understanding the real world principles and the modeling artistic reality principles on the example of the film "Madam" (2017) directed by A. Sthers.To reach this purpose is possible by the solution of such research objectives:Analysis of the film intertextual nature, given the European cultural experience - from the medieval farces and Shakespeare's theatre to the postmodern novel, from the Leonardo da Vinci's frescoes to D. Buren's conceptualism. The key element of this cultural mosaic is the Baroque tradition with its gameful nature.Designation of the author image status in the text: the film plays out the situation when the writer's artistic reflection goes beyond his individual consciousness, modeling the real situation and at the same time objectifying itself in the verbal text. There is a subtle image of the subjective process of the modeling "second reality" beneath the outwardly unpretentious comedy film plot.Actualization the games category. The associations freedom and the wide scope of combining meanings constitute the Baroque combinational game essence - the game as the creative thought manifestation, as the human culture essence. There are surprisingly witty (in the Baroque sense) parallels with the L. Carroll's "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" and "Through The Looking-Glass And What Alice Found There", V. Nabokov's "Luzhin's Defense", S. Zweig's "Chess Novella". The analysis of these "chess" texts reveals their semantic commonality with the film artistic organization.The setting objectives led to the useing of three research methods: the structural semiological, the intertextual and the hermeneutic methods of the filmtext research.The study found that the inner film semantic core includes the following oppositions: truth and lie; freedom and unfreedom; emptiness and fullness. Overall, A. Sthers playing a kind of "the glass bead game" party, in which she makes actual the Baroque artistic thinking, given the postmodern discourse experience and using associative links with a variety of culture periods and culture texts. The neo-Baroque character of the modern worldview is determined largely by the problems of human knowledge possibility limits, of the illusory nature of the hypothesis about the world that human consciousness constructs - the problems that were first put with the greatest clarity in the Baroque era. This same era affirms the universality of the moral world foundations, loyalty to which allows you to escape from the illusions world.

TI  - Multicriteria Accuracy Assessment of Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) Produced by Airborne P-Band Polarimetric SAR Tomography in Tropical Rainforests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The penetration capability of P-band radar waves through dense vegetation, along with the ability of tomography to separate the contributions of different layers in a vertical reflectivity profile, make P-band radar tomography a promising tool for digital terrain modeling in forested areas, specifically in dense tropical forests under which terrain topography remains poorly known. This paper aims to assess the overall quality of a digital terrain model (DTM) produced using tomographic processing of airborne P-band SAR imagery acquired during the TropiSAR campaign in French Guiana. Many quality descriptors are used to evaluate the quality of this DTM. Position and slope accuracies are computed based on a lidar DTM considered as the reference, and the impact of several parameters on these accuracies is studied, namely, slope, slope orientation, off-nadir angle and local incidence angle. The realism of the landforms is also studied according to geomorphological criteria. The results of this multicriteria accuracy assessment show the high potential of P-band SAR tomography in depicting the topography under forests, despite the intrinsic limitations related to the slant range geometry: the absolute elevation error is around 2 m; the slope is overestimated with an error of about 16 degrees, mainly due to a processing artifact for which easy and direct solutions exist. Indeed, this error is equal to about 3 degrees in flat artifact-free areas. These errors vary depending on the acquisition parameters and the local topography. The shapes are globally well preserved. These results are also discussed in the frame of the upcoming BIOMASS mission developed by the European Space Agency (ESA) and expected to be launched in 2024.

TI  - Mapping land cover and forest density in Zagros forests of Khuzestan province in Iran: A study based on Sentinel-2, Google Earth and field data
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Zagros forests in western Iran have widely been destroyed because of various reasons. This study was performed to provide the land cover and forest density maps in Zagros forests of Khuzestan province using Sentinel-2, Google Earth and field data. The forest boundary in Khuzestan province was digitized in Google Earth. Sentinel-2 satellite images were provided for the study area. One 1:25000 index sheet of Iranian Mapping Organization (IMO) was selected as pilot area in the province. Sentinel-2 image of the pilot area was classified using different supervised classification algorithms to select the best algorithm for land cover mapping in Khuzestan province. In addition, to evaluate the accuracy of Google Earth data, field sampling was performed using random plots in different land covers. Field data of forest plots were applied to investigate tree canopy cover percent (forest density), as well. Classification of Sentinel-2 image in Zagros area of Khuzestan province was done using the best algorithm and the land cover was obtained. The forest density map was also obtained using a linear regression model between tree canopy cover percent (obtained from field plots) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) (obtained from NDVI map). Finally, the accuracy of land cover map was assessed by some square plots on Google Earth. Results demonstrated that support vector machine (SVM) algorithm had the highest accuracy for land cover mapping. Results also showed that Google Earth images had a good accuracy in the Zagros forests of Khuzestan province. Results demonstrated that NDVI has been a good predicator to estimate tree canopy cover in the study area. Based on results, an area of 443,091.22 ha is covered by Zagros forests in Khuzestan province. Results of accuracy assessment of the land cover map showed the good accuracy of this map in Khuzestan province (overall accuracy: 91% and kappa index: 0.83). For optimum management of Zagros forests, it is suggested that the land cover and forest density mapping will be performed using SVM algorithm, NDVI, and Sentinel-2 satellite images in Zagros forests of Khuzestan province in the certain periods.

TI  - The impact of wildfire smoke and temperature on traumatic worker injury claims, Oregon 2009-2018
T2  - HEALTH SCIENCE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Aims As average temperatures rise and wildfire events increase in the United States, outdoor workers may be at an increased risk of injury. Recent research suggests that heat exposure increases outdoor workers' risk of traumatic injuries, but co-exposures of heat and wildfire smoke have not been evaluated. Methods Oregon workers' compensation data from 2009 to 2018 were linked to satellite data by the date of injury to determine if acute heat (maximum Heat Index) and wildfire smoke (presence/absence) were associated with a traumatic injury. North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes were utilized to identify accepted, disabling injury claims from construction (NAICS 23) and agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting (NAICS 11). Claims from April to October were analyzed using negative binomial models to calculate incident rate ratios (IRR) by heat and wildfire exposure for All workers and specifically for Agricultural (Ag)/Construction workers. Results During the study period, 91,895 accepted, traumatic injury claims were analyzed. All workers had an injury IRR of 1.04 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-1.06) while Ag/Construction workers had an IRR of 1.11 (95% CI: 1.06-1.16) when wildfire smoke was present. When the maximum Heat Index was 75 degrees F or greater, the IRR significantly increased as temperatures increased. When the maximum Heat Index was above 80-84 degrees F, All workers had an IRR of 1.04 (95% CI: 1.01-1.06) while Ag/construction workers had an IRR of 1.14 (95% CI: 1.08-1.21) with risk increasing with increased temperatures. In joint models, heat remained associated with injury rates, but not wildfire smoke. No multiplicative interactions between exposures were observed. Conclusion Increasing temperature was associated with increased rates of traumatic injury claims in Oregon that were more pronounced in Ag/Construction workers. Future work should focus on further understanding these associations and effective injury prevention strategies.

AB  - Fadhilah A, Leidonald R, Susetya IE, Dewinta AF. 2022. Analysis of the relationship between the ENSO phenomenon, Net Primary Productivity and catches of yellowfin tuna in Sibolga Waters, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 23: 4440-4447. The eastern Indian Ocean includes the western seas off of North Sumatra. They have a high potential for catching fish, which is a measure of their degree of primary production. Numerous factors, including oceanic conditions and the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomena, frequently have an impact on its potential. Additionally, ENSO has an influence on the availability of nutrients that generate chlorophyll, a component of primary production, as well as water mass. It is also responsible for anomalies of sea surface temperature (SST) that occur in the Pacific Ocean. Therefore, this study aims to determine the effect of the ENSO phenomenon on primary productivity as well as the abundance of yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) in the western waters of North Sumatra. Data were obtained from the Aqua MODIS level 3 satellite for analysis of net primary productivity (NPP) using various parameters, namely Vertically Generalized Production Model (VGPM), Ocean Nino Index (ONI), yellowfin tuna catch, winds from ERDDAP, and currents from AVISO. Its relationship with the abundance of yellowfin tuna, and ENSO was then determined using the Pearson correlation. The VGPM calculation showed that NPP for 2016-2020 ranged from 275.169 mgC/m2 to 994.898 mgC/m2. The study also revealed that the ENSO phenomenon has a weak relationship with primary productivity and the abundance of yellowfin tuna with correlation values of 0.262 and-0.191, respectively.

TI  - Retrieval of Aerosol Optical Properties over Land Using an Optimized Retrieval Algorithm Based on the Directional Polarimetric Camera
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Directional Polarization Camera (DPC) onboard the Chinese Gaofen-5 satellite, launched in May 2018, has similar specifications as the POLDER-3 instrument. The SRON Remote Sensing of Trace gas and Aerosol Products (RemoTAP) full retrieval algorithm is applied to DPC measurements to retrieve aerosol properties including the total Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), the fine/coarse mode AOD and the SSA (Single Scattering Albedo). Measurements of the global ground-based AERONET network between December 2019 and April 2020 have been used for the validation of the DPC retrievals. According to the average Fine Mode Fraction (FMF) of the selected AERONET stations, the stations are divided into urban stations (FMF >= 0.5) and dust stations (FMF < 0.5). For the total AOD validation, DPC retrievals show better performance over urban stations than over dust stations, with average biases of 0.055 and 0.106, and RMSEs of 0.151 and 0.228, respectively. Regarding the fine mode AOD, the retrieval also performs better over urban stations. Compared with the total AOD validation, both the relatively lower bias (0.021 and 0.065) and the higher Gfrac (Fraction of Good retrieval, 63.8% and 47.3%, respectively) further indicate that DPC performs better when fine mode aerosols dominate. For the land SSA validation, most of our SSA retrievals (similar to 71%) show differences with AERONET SSA retrievals lower than 0.05. Case studies over fire spots and dust over northern China demonstrate the encouraging application potential of DPC aerosol products. The difference between fine and coarse AOD can provide more aerosol source information compared with the total AOD alone. Since the SSA retrievals are particularly sensitive to absorbing fine particles, they can be easily used in the tracking of biomass burning aerosol.

TI  - Estimating the Routing Parameter of the Xin'anjiang Hydrological Model Based on Remote Sensing Data and Machine Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The parameters of hydrological models should be determined before applying those models to estimate or predict hydrological processes. The Xin'anjiang (XAJ) hydrological model is widely used throughout China. Since the prediction in ungauged basins (PUB) era, the regionalization of the XAJ model parameters has been a subject of intense focus; nevertheless, while many efforts have targeted parameters related to runoff yield using in-site data sets, classic regression has predominantly been applied. In this paper, we employed remotely sensed underlying surface data and a machine learning approach to establish models for estimating the runoff routing parameter, namely, CS, of the XAJ model. The study was conducted on 114 catchments from the Catchment Attributes and MEteorology for Large-sample Studies (CAMELS) data set, and the relationships between CS and various underlying surface characteristics were explored by a gradient-boosted regression tree (GBRT). The results showed that the drainage density, stream source density and area of the catchment were the three major factors with the most significant impact on CS. The best correlation coefficient (r), root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) between the GBRT-estimated and calibrated CS were 0.96, 0.06 and 0.04, respectively, verifying the good performance of GBRT in estimating CS. Although bias was noted between the GBRT-estimated and calibrated CS, runoff simulations using the GBRT-estimated CS could still achieve results comparable to those using the calibrated CS. Further validations based on two catchments in China confirmed the overall robustness and accuracy of simulating runoff processes using the GBRT-estimated CS. Our results confirm the following hypotheses: (1) with the help of large sample of catchments and associated remote sensing data, the ML-based approach can capture the nonstationary and nonlinear relationships between CS and the underlying surface characteristics and (2) CS estimated by ML from large samples has a robustness that can guarantee the overall performance of the XAJ mode. This study advances the methodology for quantitatively estimating the XAJ model parameters and can be extended to other parameters or other models.

TI  - Application of Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Satellite Data in Seismic Response Assessment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The proven relationship between soil moisture and seismic ground response highlights the need for a tool to track the Earth's surface soil moisture before and after seismic events. This paper introduces the application of Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite data for global soil moisture measurement during earthquakes and consequent events. An approach is presented to study areas that experienced high level of increase in soil moisture during eleven earthquakes. Two ancillary datasets, Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) and Global Land Data Assimilation (GLDAS), were used to isolate areas that had an earthquake-induced increase in soil moisture from those that were due to hydrological processes. SMAP-based soil moisture changes were synthesized with seismic records developed by the United States Geological Survey (USGS), mapped ground failures in reconnaissance reports, and surface changes marked by Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)-based damage proxy maps. In the majority of the target earthquakes, including Croatia 2020, Greece 2020, Indonesia 2018, Taiwan 2016, Ecuador 2016, and Nepal 2015, a relationship between the SMAP soil moisture estimates and seismic events was evident. For these events, the earthquake-induced soil moisture response occurred in liquefaction-prone seismic zones. The New Zealand 2016 event was the only study region for which there was a clear inconsistency between ASMSMAP and the seismic records. The promising relationship between soil moisture changes and ground deformations indicates that SMAP would be a useful data resource for geotechnical earthquake engineering applications and reconnaissance efforts.

TI  - A Contrast Minimization Approach to Remove Sun Glint in Landsat 8 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sun glint, i.e., direct solar radiation reflected from a water surface, negatively affects the accuracy of ocean color retrieval schemes if entering the field-of-view of the observing instrument. Herein, a simple and robust method to quantify the sun glint contribution to top-of-atmosphere reflectances in the visible and near-infrared is proposed, exploiting concomitant observations of the sun glint's morphology in the shortwave infrared. The method, termed Glint Removal through Contrast Minimization (GRCM), requires high spatial resolution (ca. 10-50 m) imagery to resolve the sun glint's characteristic morphology, meeting additional criteria on radiometric resolution, signal-to-noise ratio, and temporal delay between the individual band's acquisitions. It has been applied with good success to a selection of cloud-free Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) scenes, otherwise encompassing a wide range of environmental conditions in terms of observation geometry, glint intensity, water types, as well as aerosol and Rayleigh optical depths. GRCM is entirely image based and does not require ancillary information on the sea surface roughness or related parameters (e.g., surface wind), nor the presence of homogeneous clear water areas in the image under consideration. GRCM's limitations are discussed, and its potential for sensors other than OLI as well as applications beyond glint removal are sketched.

TI  - Weakening of Coastlines and Coastal Erosion in the Gulf of Guinea: The Case of the Kribi Coast in Cameroon
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - For more than four decades, the Gulf of Guinea's coasts have been undergoing a significant phenomenon of erosion, resulting from the pressures of both anthropogenic and marine weather forcings. From the coasts of West Africa (Senegal, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Benin, Togo, and Nigeria) to those of Central Africa (Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, and Cameroon), the phenomenon has been growing for more than four decades. The southern Cameroonian coastline from Kribi to Campo has become the scene of significant environmental dynamics that render it vulnerable to coastal erosion, which appears to be the major hazard of this coastal territory and causes a gradual degradation of the vegetative cover, thereby leading to the degradation of the coast's land/ground cover and human-made infrastructure. The objective of this work is to analyze the kinematics of the Kribian coastline between 1973 and 2020; to quantify the levels of retreat, accretion, and stability; and finally, to discuss the factors influencing the evolution of the coastline. The methodological approach is based on the large-scale processing of Landsat images with a spatial resolution of 30 m. Then, small-scale processing is carried out around the autonomous port of Kribi using Pleiades and Google Earth images from the years 2013, 2018, and 2020 with a 0.5 m spatial resolution. The Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) version 5 and ArcMap 10.5((R)) tool are used to model coastal kinematics. In addition, the dynamics of the agro-industrial plantations are assessed via satellite images and landscape perception. Environmental degradation is measured with respect to the entire Cameroonian coastline through the supervised classification of Landsat images (1986-2020). The results show that erosion is in its initial phase in Kribi because significant retreats of the coastline are noticeable over the period from 2015-2020. Thus, between 1973 and 2020, the linear data present a certain stability. In total, +72.32% of the line remained stable, with values of +1.3% for accretion and +26.33% for erosion-obtained from Landsat images of 30 m resolution-with an average retreat of +1.3 m/year and an average accretion of 0.9 m/year between 1973-2020. Based on high-resolution images, between 2013 and 2019, the average retreat of the coastline on the Kribian coast was -8.5 m/year and the average accretion was about 7 m/year. Agro-industrial plantations are responsible for environmental degradation. Thus, at SOCAPALM in Apouh, there has been a clear growth in plantations, which has fallen from 53% in 1990 to 78% in 2020, i.e., an increase of 25% of its baseline area. This is linked to the fact that plantations are growing significantly, with increases of 16% in 1990, 28% in 2000, and 29% in 2020, for old plantations.

TI  - Comparison of Winter Wheat Yield Estimation Based on Near-Surface Hyperspectral and UAV Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop yields are important for food security and people's living standards, and it is therefore very important to predict the yield in a timely manner. This study used different vegetation indices and red-edge parameters calculated based on the canopy reflectance obtained from near-surface hyperspectral data and UAV hyperspectral data and used the partial least squares regression (PLSR) and artificial neural network (ANN) methods to estimate the yield of winter wheat at different growth stages. Verification was performed based on these two types of hyperspectral remote sensing data and the yield was estimated using vegetation indices and a combination of vegetation indices and red-edge parameters as the modeling independent variables, respectively, using PLSR and ANN regression, respectively. The results showed that, for the same data source, the optimal vegetation index for estimating the yield was the same in all of the studied growth stages; however, the optimal red-edge parameters were different for different growth stages. Compared with using only the vegetation indices as the modeling factor to estimate yield, the combination of the vegetation indices and red-edge parameters obtained superior estimation results. Additionally, the accuracy of yield estimation was shown to be improved by using the PLSR and ANN methods, with the yield estimation model constructed using the PLSR method having a better prediction effect. Moreover, the yield prediction model obtained using the near-surface hyperspectral sensors had a higher fitting and accuracy than the model obtained using the UAV hyperspectral remote sensing data (the results were based on the specific growth stressors, N and water supply). This study shows that the use of a combination of vegetation indices and red-edge parameters achieved an improved yield estimation compared to the use of vegetation indices alone. In the future, the selection of suitable sensors and methods needs to be considered when constructing models to estimate crop yield.

TI  - MID: A Novel Mountainous Remote Sensing Imagery Registration Dataset Assessed by a Coarse-to-Fine Unsupervised Cascading Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The geometric registration of mountainous remote sensing images is always a challenging project, as terrain fluctuations increase the complexity. Deep learning, with its superior computing power and data-driven nature, promises to solve this problem. However, the lack of an appropriate dataset limits the development of deep learning technology for mountainous remote sensing image registration, which it still an unsolved problem in photogrammetry and remote sensing. To remedy this problem, this paper presents a manually constructed imagery dataset of mountainous regions, called the MID (mountainous imagery dataset). To create the MID, we use 38 images from the Gaofen-2 satellite developed by China and generated 4093 pairs of reference and sensed image patches, making this the first real mountainous dataset to our knowledge. Simultaneously, we propose a fully unsupervised, convolutional-network-based iterative registration scheme for the MID. First, the large and global deformation of the reference and sensed images is reduced using an affine registration module, generating the coarse alignment. Then, the local and varied distortions are learned and eliminated progressively using a hybrid dilated convolution (HDC)-based encoder-decoder module with multistep iterations, achieving fine registration results. The HDC aims to increase the receptive field without blocking the artifacts, allowing for the continuous characteristics of the mountainous images of a local region to be represented. We provide a performance analysis of some typical registration algorithms and the developed approach for the MID. The proposed scheme gives the highest registration precision, achieving the subpixel alignment of mountainous remote sensing images. Additionally, the experimental results demonstrate the usability of the MID, which can lay a foundation for the development of deep learning technology in large mountainous remote sensing image registration tasks.

AB  - I argue that the concept of Umwelterlebnis in Heidegger's 1919 text The idea of philosophy and the problem of worldview, concerns the intentional structure of a philosophy without a transcendental subject. I argue, however, that the model of this intentional structure involves the author in the problem of the constitution of meaning as in the project of phenomenology as an original science.

TI  - Influence of Thermohaline Stratification on the Evolution of Coastal Upwelling on the Northeastern Shelf of Sakhalin
T2  - RUSSIAN METEOROLOGY AND HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite data on sea surface temperature and temperature and salinity profiles in the northeastern shelf of Sakhalin showed that during the periods of advection of warm and low-salinity water to the eastern shelf of Sakhalin, intensive coastal upwelling did not develop, even under favorable wind conditions. Regular deepening of the thermocline/halocline has prevented the rise of cold and salt water to the sea surface. Numerical experiments with the INMOM-JRA55-do model showed a significant deepening of the thermocline/halocline accompanied by the increasing density stratification, which prevented the elevating of the Sea of Okhotsk water to the sea surface. It is assumed that the joint monitoring of wind conditions and hydrology on the eastern shelf of Sakhalin in the second half of the year will significantly clarify the features of its development and more accurately assess the biological productivity of water in this area of the Sea of Okhotsk.

TI  - A Comparison between Variable Deficit Irrigation and Farmers' Irrigation Practices under Three Fertilization Levels in Cotton Yield (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i> L.) Using Precision Agriculture, Remote Sensing, Soil Analyses, and Crop Growth Modeling
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The major global challenge for the coming decades will be increasing crop production with less water consumption. Precision agriculture (PA) and variable deficit irrigation (VDI) are management strategies that help farmers to improve crop production, fertilizer's efficiency, and water use efficiency (WUE). The effects of irrigation (IR1 = variable deficit irrigation; IR2 = farmers' irrigation common practices) under three fertilization (Ft1, Ft2, Ft3) treatments were studied on a cotton yield, on various indicators for more efficient water and fertilizer use, and on plant growth characteristics by applying a number of new agrotechnologies (such as TDR sensors; soil moisture (SM); PA; remote-sensing NDVI (Sentinel-2 satellite sensors); soil hydraulic analyses; geostatistical models; and SM root-zone modelling 2D GIS mapping). The reference evapotranspiration was computed based on the F.A.O. Penman-Monteith method. The crop (ETc) and actual (ETa) evapotranspiration were computed using crop coefficients obtained from the remote-sensing NDVI vegetation index (R-2 = 0.9327). A daily soil-water-crop-atmosphere (SWCA) balance model and a depletion model were developed using sensor data (climatic parameters' sensors, as well as soil and satellite sensors) measurements. The two-way ANOVA statistical analysis results revealed that irrigation (IR1 = best) and fertilization treatments (Ft2 = best) significantly affected the cotton yield, the plant height, the plant stem, the boll weight, the above-ground dry matter, nitrogen and fertilizer efficiency, and WUE. VDI, if applied wisely during critical growth stages, could result in a substantial improvement in the yield (up to +28.664%) and water savings (up to 24.941%), thus raising water productivity (+35.715% up to 42.659%), WUE (from farmers' 0.421-0.496 kg center dot m(-3) up to a VDI of 0.601-0.685 kg center dot m(-3)), nitrogen efficiency (+16.888% up to +22.859%), and N-P-K fertilizer productivity (from farmers' 16.754-23.769 up to a VDI of 20.583-27.957).

TI  - Patients with initial nodal involvement due to breast cancer who have received neoadjuvant chemotherapy: Combined sentinel node-radioguided surgery of the pathological node.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the feasibility and usefulness of ultrasound-guided pre-chemotherapy marking of pathologic lymph node followed by sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB)-pathologic node radioguided biopsy (ROLL) combined technique, in axillary involvement breast cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT).MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prospective diagnostic study of 30 patients with breast cancer and cN1 axillary staging with NACT indication. Before NACT, the biopsied node was marked with a clip (MBN). After NACT an ultrasound was performed and in case of good response a SLNB (99mTc-nanocolloids) plus targeted axillary dissection MBN ROLL biopsy (99mTc-albumin macroaggregates) was performed. Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) was performed if SLNB and/or MBN were positive for tumor cells. The localization-removal rate of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) and MBN were evaluated. False-negative rate (FNR) and positive predictive value (PPV) of SLNB alone were also evaluated.RESULTS: Thirty patients were included in the study. SLN could be detected in all patients while MBN was successfully removed in 27 (90%). The SLN coincided with MBN in 15 patients (50%). In 12 patients SLNB was negative while MBN positive, leading to a FNR of 44.4% for SLNB alone. We found a PPV of 37% for the SLNB. In 5 patients (18.5%) both SLNB and MBN were negative, avoiding ALND.CONCLUSIONS: SLNB-MBN radioguided biopsy ROLL combined technique is a useful and accessible procedure for accurate axillary restaging after NACT, avoiding the high rate of FNR of SLNB alone in this group of patients and avoiding a great number of ALND.

TI  - Satellite-Based Frost Damage Detection in Support of Winter Cover Crops Management: A Case Study on White Mustard
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Cover crops are grown in order to provide agro-ecological services and must be terminated before planting the subsequent cash crop. Winterkill termination (by frost damage) depends on the interaction between crop frost hardiness, temperatures and the development stage reached at the time of sub-zero temperature exposure. Remotely sensing intensity, timing and spatial variation of cover crop frost damage can be useful for modeling and planning purposes. Therefore, in this study Sentinel-2 vegetation indices were employed in order to detect frost damage in four white mustard (Sinapis alba L.) fields located in Northern Italy. We estimated the starting date of frost events by means of vegetation indices (EVI, NDRE, NDVI, MMSR, and CCCI); we quantified and mapped frost damage at the sub-field level, using ground-based frost damage measurements carried out during the 2021/2022 season. As to frost damage quantification, MMSR outperformed the other VIs followed by CCCI and EVI (R-2 > 0.55). The adopted procedure to detect starting dates of frost events was successful in most cases, with a one-day and a four-day delay in the two best cases (NDRE). Finally, maps of frost damage were consistent with its observed spatial variation. We demonstrated that it is possible to employ vegetation indices in order to detect cover crop frost damage and thus assessing cover crop winterkill termination efficiency in the field. Further research is needed, involving additional field monitoring of white mustard in more diverse conditions, and extension of the calibration, as well as validation.

TI  - Comparison of the Absolute and Relative Difference Spectral Indices to Estimate Burn Severity: The Case of Endangered <i>Nothofagus alessandrii</i> (ruil)
T2  - ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate information is needed about burn severity caused by fires to design strategies for ecosystem recovery. The Mediterranean zone of Chile holds a high level of plant endemism. In summer 2017, nearly half a million hectares were severely burnt by fire in this zone. In this paper, we assessed the performance of three spectral indices used in mapping burn severity (difference Normalized Burn Ratio [dNBR], Relative difference Normalized Burn Ratio [RdNBR], and Relativized Burn Ratio [RBR]) on fragmented populations of the endangered ruil tree Nothofagus alessandrii, an endemic species of central Chile. The indices were obtained from Sentinel 2 images and their results contrasted with field measurements of severity recorded using the Composite Burn Index (CBI). The indices estimated the severity categories with a high overall accuracy obtained from error matrices and reaching values of 77.3, 76.0 and 69.3% for RdNBR, RBR, and dNBR, respectively. The surface estimated for the categories without damage (ND), low (L), and medium (M) were greater for the RdNBR and RBR indices than for the dNBR, while an opposite tendency was observed for the high severity category (H). Our results properly described the spatial variability of burn severity. This information may be useful for creating and managing plans for the recovery of highly fragmented and threatened deciduous ecosystems such as those dominated by ruil. We suggest that strategies for recovery or restoration should be oriented to the high fire severity zones, where reproductive individuals were lost, and the successful seedling recruitment is expected to diminish.

TI  - Identification and Quantification of Actual Evapotranspiration Using Integrated Satellite Data for Sustainable Water Management in Dry Areas
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is a significant consumer of irrigation water and precipitation on cropland. Global and regional interest in the sustainable management of limited freshwater supplies to meet the rapidly increasing population and food demands has resulted in advanced scientific research on ET measurement, rapid water accounting, and irrigation schedules in the NENA region. The primary goal of this paper is to compare actual daily evapotranspiration (ET) collected by a remote sensing model and validated by Energy Balance (EB) flux tower field measurements. The flux tower was installed in a wheat field in Sids Agricultural Research Station in Beni Suef Governorate. Through the integration of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra and Sentinel-2 data, a new remote sensing-based ET model is built on two parties: Thermal condition factor (TCF) and vegetation condition fraction (VCF). The remote sensing-based ET estimation model was evaluated using ET field measurements from the Energy Balance flux tower. The land use and land cover maps were created to assist the interpretation of remotely sensed ET data. Field data for five categories were collected to test the accuracy of the land use and cover maps: Water bodies (93 points), urban areas (252 points), trees (104 points), other field crops (227 points), and wheat (249 points), for a total of 925 ground points. The Google Earth Engine (GEE) imported sentinel-2 datasets and filtered the necessary dates and regions. From 1 October 2020 to 30 May 2021, sentinel-2 data were processed and transformed into the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), and Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), which were then combined. The composite layer data were classified using the Random Forest (RF) method on the GEE platform, and the results showed an overall accuracy of 91 percent. The validation factors revealed good indices when RS-based ET results were compared to ground-measured ET. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was 0.84 mm/day. The 'r' and 'd' values indicated satisfactory results, where 'r' yielded a value of 0.785, which indicates that the correlation between predicted and reference results is robust. The analysis of d values revealed a high degree of correlation between predicted (RS-based ET) and reference results (measured ET). The d value was found to be 0.872. Between 21 November 2020 and 30 April 2021, RS-based accumulated ET was 418 mm/season, while ground-measured ET was 376 mm/season. The new RS-based ET model produced acceptable daily and seasonal results.

TI  - An Integrated Method for Estimating Forest-Canopy Closure Based on UAV LiDAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest-canopy closure (FCC) reflects the coverage of the forest tree canopy, which is one of the most important indicators of forest structure and a core parameter in forest resources investigation. In recent years, the rapid development of UAV LiDAR and photogrammetry technology has provided effective support for FCC estimation. However, affected by factors such as different tree species and different stand densities, it is difficult to estimate FCC accurately based on the single-tree canopy-contour method in complex forest regions. Thus, this study proposes a method for estimating FCC accurately using algorithm integration with an optimal window size for treetop detection and an optimal algorithm for crown-boundary extraction using UAV LiDAR data in various scenes. The research results show that: (1) The FCC estimation accuracy was improved using the method proposed in this study. The accuracy of FCC in a camphor pine forest (Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica Litv.) was 89.11%, with an improvement of 6.77-11.25% compared to the results obtained from other combined conditions. The FCC accuracy for white birch (White birch platyphylla Suk) was about 87.53%, with an increase of 3.25-8.42%. (2) The size of the window used for treetop detection is closely related to tree species and stand density. With the same forest-stand density, the treetop-detection window size of camphor pine was larger than that of white birch. The optimal window size of camphor pine was between 5 x 5 similar to 11 x 11 (corresponding 2.5 similar to 5.5 m), while that of white birch was between 3 x 3 similar to 7 x 7 (corresponding 1.5 similar to 3.5 m). (3) There are significant differences in the optimal-canopy-outline extraction algorithms for different scenarios. With a medium forest-stand density, the marker-controlled watershed (MCW) algorithm has the best tree-crown extraction effect. The region-growing (RG) method has better extraction results in the sparse areas of camphor pine and the dense areas of white birch. The Voronoi tessellation (VT) algorithm is more suitable for the dense areas of camphor pine and the sparse regions of white birch. The method proposed in this study provides a reference for FCC estimation using high-resolution remote-sensing images in complex forest areas containing various scenes.

TI  - Role of Water Vapor Modulation From Multiple Pathways in the Occurrence of a Record-Breaking Heavy Rainfall Event in China in 2021
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Extreme torrential rainfall events are low-probability events. A "China-Record Extremely Heavy Rainfall" (CREHR) event with rain rate of 201.9 mm/hr occurred on 20 July in Zhengzhou in North China. Using high-density meteorological observations, ERA5 reanalysis data, remote sensing data from China's FY-4A satellite, and numerical simulation, we revealed that sufficient warm-humid airflows were continuously transported to the Zhengzhou area via multiple pathways that were mainly modulated by the large-scale western Pacific subtropical high to the north along with the anomalies of the westerly belt and a meso-scale binary typhoon system. At the local scale, under the combined action of the vertical circulation that caused low-level convergence and high-level divergence, and the rapid uplift of water vapor related to the blocking by mountainous terrain, this CREHR event was eventually triggered. Particularly, our present work shows the roles of both typhoon Cempaka and meso-scale convective systems to south of Henan province can not be ignored, producing a strong super-thick water vapor transport layer. The existence of the binary typhoon raises the level of uncertainty involved in the water vapor transport of this CREHR event.Plain Language Summary Extreme torrential rainfall events are low-probability events. The rainfall from 16:00 to 17:00 Beijing time on 20 July in Zhengzhou in North China reached 201.9 mm, which was a record in mainland China-a so-called "China-Record Extremely Heavy Rainfall" (CREHR) event. By using high-density meteorological observations, ERA5 reanalysis data, remote sensing data from China's FY-4A satellite, and numerical simulation, we found that sufficient warm-humid airflows were continuously transported to the Zhengzhou area via multiple pathways that were mainly modulated by the large-scale western Pacific subtropical high to the north along with the anomalies of the westerly belt and a meso-scale binary typhoon system. At the local scale, under the combined action of the vertical circulation that caused low-level convergence and high-level divergence, and the rapid uplift of water vapor related to the blocking by mountainous terrain, this CREHR event was eventually triggered over northern mainland China. Our findings reveal that the existence of the binary typhoon circulation raises the level of uncertainty involved in the water vapor transport of this CREHR event, which has implications for improving our ability to predict and provide early warnings for severe rainstorms and related disasters in cities with such a complex context.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Is Feasible in Dogs with Scars from Prior Local Excision of Solid Malignancies
T2  - ANIMALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Sentinel lymph node (SLN) excision is gaining relevance in the management of various canine malignancies due to its recognized impact on staging and treatment choices. However, the technologies to perform SLN mapping are only available to a few referral centers, and there is increasing demand for secondary nodal staging after prior tumor excision at the primary care institution. This retrospective study investigated the feasibility and usefulness of SLN biopsy in dogs with surgical scars resulting from the removal of various solid tumors referred for further staging and/or adjuvant treatment options. Thirty-three dogs with 34 scars underwent SLN biopsy at a median of 50 days after primary tumor excision. An SLN was identified for 31/34 scars, translating to a detection rate of 91.2%. Metastases were identified with histopathology in 13/31 dogs (41.9%) and they all had an excision of a mast cell tumor. SLN biopsy should be suggested in dogs presenting with scars from prior solid tumor excision, considering the observed detection rate and the importance of knowing the metastatic status of the SLN in oncological diseases. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is a well-established staging tool in canine oncology. This study aims to explore the feasibility of SLN biopsy in dogs with scars from prior excised solid malignancies that were referred for further tumor staging and/or adjuvant treatment options. Mapping was either performed using radiopharmaceutical, methylene blue, and/or near-infrared fluorescent (NIRF) imaging. Thirty-three dogs with 34 scars from prior excision of the mast cell tumor (MCT) (n = 29), soft tissue sarcoma (n = 2), oral melanoma (n = 1), subungual melanoma (n = 1), and mammary adenocarcinoma (n = 1) were retrospectively enrolled. Primary treatment consisted of curative intent/wide tumor excisions in 50.0% of dogs and marginal excision in the remaining 50.0%. The median time between tumor excision and SLN biopsy was 50 days (range 17-110 days). The procedure was successful in 31/34 scars, translating to a detection rate of 91.2%. The SLN did not correspond to the regional lymph node in 19/31 scars (61.3%). SLN metastases were histologically identified in 13/31 (41.9%) dogs, all of them affected by MCT. Based on our results, SLN biopsy using lymphoscintigraphy/methylene blue and/or NIRF is feasible in dogs presenting with scars from the prior surgical excision of solid tumors, and should be suggested for accurate nodal staging.

TI  - Continuity, Simplification, and Paradigm Shifting in Biological Evolution
T2  - PERSPECTIVES ON SCIENCE AND CHRISTIAN FAITH
M3  - Article
AB  - The principle of continuity in evolution is often violated by discontinuous saltations leading to "punctuations" in evolutionary history. Highly accurate cellular replication fidelity is a requirement for biological evolution. In previous work, I have used a statistical theoretical model to demonstrate discontinuity in the evolution of high replication fidelity. Depending on the granularity of approach, both a continuous and a saltational view of evolutionary history are consistent with a scientific worldview of creation, and with the concept of simplification in biology as articulated by Emily Boring et al. The apparent contradiction between the complexity of biological systems with the idea of evolutionary simplification can be resolved by considering the globally simplifying selection of single systems and the local evolution of increasing system complexity. Explanations of thresholds and discontinuities during evolution might require the inclusion of paradigms such as teleology and agency in biological science, with theological implications.

TI  - A Hierarchical Information Extraction Method for Large-Scale Centralized Photovoltaic Power Plants Based on Multi-Source Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of global sustainable development, solar energy is very widely used. The installed capacity of photovoltaic panels in countries around the world, especially in China, is increasing steadily and rapidly. In order to obtain accurate information about photovoltaic panels and provide data support for the macro-control of the photovoltaic industry, this paper proposed a hierarchical information extraction method, including positioning information and shape information, and carried out photovoltaic panel distribution mapping. This method is suitable for large-scale centralized photovoltaic power plants based on multi-source satellite remote sensing images. This experiment takes the three northwest provinces of China as the research area. First, a deep learning scene classification model, the EfficientNet-B5 model, is used to locate the photovoltaic power plants on 16-m spatial resolution images. This step obtains the area that contains or may contain photovoltaic panels, greatly reducing the study area with an accuracy of 99.97%. Second, a deep learning semantic segmentation model, the U-2-Net model, is used to precisely locate photovoltaic panels on 2-m spatial resolution images. This step achieves the exact extraction results of the photovoltaic panels from the area obtained in the previous step, with an accuracy of 97.686%. This paper verifies the superiority of a hierarchical information extraction method in terms of accuracy and efficiency through comparative experiments with DeepLabV3+, U-Net, SegNet, and FCN8s. This meaningful work identified 180 centralized photovoltaic power plants in the study area. Additionally, this method makes full use of the characteristics of different remote sensing data sources. This method can be applied to the rapid extraction of global photovoltaic panels.

TI  - Detection of Alpha- and Betacoronaviruses in Frugivorous and Insectivorous Bats in Nigeria
T2  - PATHOGENS
M3  - Article
AB  - The rise of bat-associated zoonotic viruses necessitates a close monitoring of their natural hosts. Since the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), it is evident that bats are vital reservoirs of coronaviruses (CoVs). In this study, we investigated the presence of CoVs in multiple bat species in Nigeria to identify viruses in bats at high-risk human contact interfaces. Four hundred and nine bats comprising four bat species close to human habitats were individually sampled from five states in Nigeria between 2019 and 2021. Coronavirus detection was done using broadly reactive consensus PCR primers targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene of CoVs. Coronavirus RNA was detected in 39 samples (9.5%, CI 95%: [7.0, 12.8]), of which 29 were successfully sequenced. The identified CoVs in Nigerian bats were from the unclassified African alphacoronavirus lineage and betacoronavirus lineage D (Nobecovirus), with one sample from Hipposideros ruber coinfected with alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus. Different bat species roosting in similar or other places had CoVs from the same genetic lineage. The phylogenetic and evolutionary dynamics data indicated a high CoV diversity in Nigeria, while host switching may have contributed to CoV evolution. Robust sentinel surveillance is recommended to enhance our knowledge of emerging and re-emerging coronaviruses.

TI  - Sentinel-2 Satellite Imagery-Based Assessment of Soil Salinity in Irrigated Rice Fields in Portugal
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Salinization is a major soil degradation threat in irrigated lands worldwide. In Portugal, it affects several pockets of irrigated agricultural areas, but the spatial distribution and intensity of soil salinity are not well known. Unlike conventional approaches to appraise soil salinity, remote sensing multispectral data have great potential for detecting, monitoring, and investigating soil salinity problems in agricultural areas. This study explores the assessment of soil salinity in irrigated rice cultivation fields using two types of multispectral-based indices calculated from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery: (i) vegetation indices (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Generalized Difference Vegetation Index and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index), to monitor the indirect effect of salinity on rice growth; and (ii) salinity indicators, namely those based on visible and near-infrared bands (Normalized Difference Salinity Index) and on shortwave infrared bands (Salinity Index ASTER). The data are for the Lower Mondego Valley (Central Portugal) and the period 2017-2018. Results revealed that salinity indices can be used for mapping soil salinity and constitute a valuable soil salinity assessment tool in rice cultivation areas affected by salinity issues. As there is less reported inventorying of spatial extent of such degradation in irrigated agricultural areas of Portugal, this innovative approach allowed by remote sensing technology can add to understanding the spatial extent of such areas and undertaking more such studies spatially and temporally.

TI  - Spatial analysis techniques for tsunami vulnerability and inundation mapping of Andaman region using remote sensing, GIS, AHP, and Fuzzy logic methods
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The detailed inundation mapping and vulnerability assessment is an essential component of risk reduction and rehabilitation planning in tsunami-prone regions. Integrated spatial analyses through Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Fuzzy logic operation, mainly Fuzzy PRODUCT and Fuzzy GAMMA (0.9), are used to assess tsunami vulnerability and inundation mapping in the Andaman region, which experienced the 2004-Great Indian Ocean Tsunami. The thematic layers of elevation, slope, shoreline distance, and vegetation density are created using SRTM DEM and Landsat-8 OLI (similar to 30 m spatial resolution). The tsunami wave heights are generated from TUNAMI-N2 Model using GEBCO bathymetry data. AHP evaluation process is applied to assign weights to the thematic layers, which are integrated using the weighted sum method. The input weight score of each thematic layer is transformed into a 0 to 1 scale using Fuzzy membership function to derive Fuzzy PRODUCT and Fuzzy GAMMA tsunami vulnerability classes, namely very low, low, medium, high, and very high, depending on correlation with tsunami run-up map. The weighted sum, Fuzzy PRODUCT, and Fuzzy GAMMA methods estimate similar to 1227 (26%), 225 (5%), and 844.33 (18%) km(2) areas as very high vulnerability. The Fuzzy GAMMA method closely compares with the observed-modeled inundation of similar to 14% in the Andaman region. The vulnerability is correlated with the inundation pattern and LULC changes to understand the change in vulnerability from 2004 to 2021. The results are discussed for the robustness of the observation and technique that can be used for tsunami disaster management and land-use planning.

TI  - Evaluation of Accuracy Enhancement in European-Wide Crop Type Mapping by Combining Optical and Microwave Time Series
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - This investigation evaluates the potential of combining Copernicus Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite data in producing a detailed Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) map with 19 crop type classes and 2 broader categories containing Woodland/Shrubland and Grassland over 28 Member States of Europe (EU-28). The Eurostat Land Use and Coverage Area Frame Survey (LUCAS) 2018 dataset is employed as ground truth for model training and validation. Monthly and yearly optical features from S2 spectral reflectance and spectral indices, alongside decadal (10-days) composites from an S1 microwave sensor, are extracted for the EU-28 territory for 2018 using Google Earth Engine (GEE). Five different feature sets using a mixture of indicators were created as input training data. A Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithm was applied to classify these feature sets, and the generated classification models were compared using an identical validation dataset. Results show that S1 and S2 yearly features together are able to provide a full coverage map less dependent on cloud effects and having appropriate overall accuracy (OA). Based on this feature set, the 21 classes could be classified with an OA of 78.3% using the independent validation data set. The OA increases to 82.7% by grouping 21 classes into 8 broader categories. The comparison with similar studies using individual S1 and S2 data indicates that combining S1 and S2 time series can attain slightly better results while enhancing spatial coverage.

TI  - Study on the Establishment of the Gastropod Lymnaea stagnalis (Linne,1758) as a Bio-sentinel to Monitor the Water Quality of North Algerian Rivers: Case of the El-Malah River.
T2  - Nature Environment and Pollution Technology
M3  - Article
AB  - Biomonitoring is a key solution for assessing the effects and risks of pollutants to preserve the most vulnerable ecosystems, including aquatic ecosystems. This study aims in establishing the gastropod Lymnaea stagnalis, as a sentinel species to assess the water quality of the El-Malah river in the Algerian North-West. Three sites were chosen along the river: upstream (US), midstream (MS), and downstream (DS). The responsiveness of the aquatic snails has been compared using physiological and biological markers: condition index (CI), volumetric condition index (VCI), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), glutathione s-transferase (GST), and catalase (CAT). Additionally, the occurrence of changes in biometric parameters of the specimens has also been treated: shell height (SH), shell thickness (ST) total weight (TW), and the ratio ST/SH. Snails from the site MS reacted in front to the water deterioration with low biometric values (ST 1.28 - 0.17 cm; SH 1.83 - 0.20 cm; TW 2.95 - 0.69 cm), and condition indices values (CI 31.19 - 3.58; VCI 2.09 - 0.53 g.cm-3), thereby signaling smaller individuals compared to the population of site US. Whereas, no specimen was recorded in the site submitted to wastewaters discharge (DS). This indicates that the degradation of the water quality affected the growth and the viability of the snails. Furthermore, a significant induction in the GST activity (88.98 ?? 10.72 nmol min-1mg-1), and a significant inhibition in the CAT activity (82.85 - 9.49 [mu]mol min-1mg-1) were recorded in the site MS, whereas no statistically significant variation was observed in AChE activity. L. stagnalis demonstrated biological and physiological variability between the studied contrasting sites of the El-Malah River. These results allow us to propose this species as a model in the ecotoxicology of western Algerian freshwaters.

TI  - Dual-wavelength photoacoustic atlas method to estimate fractional methylene blue and hemoglobin contents
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Significance: Methylene blue (MB) is an exogenous contrast agent that has the potential to assist with visualization and penetration challenges in photoacoustic imaging. However, monitoring the local concentration between MB and endogenous chromophores is critical for avoiding unnecessary MB accumulations that could lead to adverse effects such as hemolysis when exposed to increased dose and photodamage when exposed to high laser energies.Aim: We developed a modified version of a previously proposed acoustic-based atlas method to estimate concentration levels from a mixture of two photoacoustic-sensitive materials after two laser wavelength emissions.Approach: Photoacoustic data were acquired from mixtures of 100-mu M MBand either human or porcine blood (Hb) injected in a plastisol phantom, using laser wavelengths of 710 and 870 nm. An algorithm to perform linear regression of the acoustic frequency response from an atlas composed of pure concentrations was designed to assess the concentration levels from photoacoustic samples obtained from 11 known MB/Hb volume mixtures. The mean absolute error (MAE), coefficient of determination (i.e., R-2), and Spearman's correlation coefficient (i.e., rho) between the estimated results and ground-truth labels were calculated to assess the algorithm performance, linearity, and monotonicity, respectively.Results: The overall MAE, R-2, and rho were 12.68%, 0.80, and 0.89, respectively, for the human Hb dataset and 9.92%, 0.86, and 0.93, respectively, for the porcine Hb dataset. In addition, a similarly linear relationship was observed between the acoustic frequency response at 2.3 MHz and 870-nm laser wavelength and the ground-truth concentrations, with R-2 and vertical bar rho vertical bar values of 0.76 and 0.88, respectively.Conclusions: Contrast agent concentration monitoring is feasible with the proposed approach. The potential for minimal data acquisition times with only two wavelength emissions is advantageous toward real-time implementation in the operating room. (C) The Authors.

TI  - An Analysis of the Stability and Trends in the LST_cci Land Surface Temperature Datasets Over Europe
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term satellite land surface temperature (LST) data are desirable to augment 2m air temperatures (T2m) measured in situ and as an independent measure of surface temperature change. However, previous studies show variable agreement between LST and T2m time series. The objective of this study is to assess the stability and trends in six new LST data sets from the European Space Agency's Climate Change Initiative for LST (LST_cci). LST anomalies are compared with homogenized station T2m anomalies over Europe, which verifies all six data sets are well coupled (LST vs T2m anomaly correlations and slopes: 0.6-0.9). The temporal stability of the LST_cci data is assessed through a comparison with the T2m anomaly time series. Only the LST_cci data sets for the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard Aqua and the Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) appear stable; the MODIS/Terra, ATSR-2, and multisensor InfraRed and MicroWave data sets show non-climatic discontinuities associated with changes in sensor and/or drift over time. For MODIS/Aqua (2002-2018), significant trends in LST of 0.64-0.66 K/decade compare well with the equivalent T2m trends of 0.52-0.59 K/decade. The LST and T2m trends for AATSR (2002-2012) are found to be statistically insignificant, likely due to the comparatively short study period and specific years available for analysis. No evidence is found to suggest that trends calculated using cloud-free InfraRed observations are affected by clear-sky bias. This study suggests that satellite LST data can be used to assess warming trends over land and for other climate applications if the required homogeneity is assured.Plain Language Summary Long-term changes in surface temperature due to climate change are usually studied using near-surface air temperatures (T2m) from weather stations. However, these data are not available everywhere and changes in T2m are poorly understood in some regions (e.g., parts of Africa). This study assesses the potential for satellite-observed land surface temperatures (LST) to help fill these gaps. The study finds that LST and T2m provide very similar information on surface temperatures and therefore LST can provide useful information where T2m data are unavailable. However, some of the LST data sets are found to be "unstable" and suffer from jumps and changes over time that result from for example, changes in satellite instrument or a change in the orbit of the satellite platform. These unstable LST data sets cannot be used to measure changes in surface temperature. However, the study finds that for "stable" LST data sets, which do not suffer from these non-climatic jumps and changes, the changes in LST over time are very similar to, or even the same as, the changes in T2m. Therefore, this work suggests that satellite LST data could be used to measure changes in surface temperature where there are not enough stations to make these measurements using T2m.

TI  - Assessment of bioaccumulation of glyphosate and aminomethylphosphonic acid in marine mussels using capillary electrophoresis with light-emitting diode-induced fluorescence detection
T2  - JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY A
M3  - Article
AB  - Glyphosate or N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine, widely used as herbicide in agriculture to control weeds and to facilitate harvesting, has been included in Group 2A pollutants (probably carcinogenic to humans) by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). In intensive agricultural areas, runoff and soil leaching are likely to drive glyphosate to surface waters, where the compound is often detected together with its main microbial metabolite, aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA). In the present study a method based on capillary electrophoresis coupled with light-emitting diode -induced fluorescence detection has been developed and validated for the determination of the two com-pounds in whole soft mass of marine mussels ( Mytilus galloprovincialis). The method is based on the acidic hydrolysis of lyophilized tissue using 6 M HCl (oven at 110 & DEG;C for 22 h) to release the target an-alytes; their subsequent derivatization using 4-fluoro-7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazole, was found to be suit-able for the sensitive fluorescence detection. To achieve optimum separation of the analytes from the ma-trix and degradation reagent interferences, the background electrolyte constituted by borate buffer (pH 9.2, 30 mM) was supplemented with 10 mM heptakis(2,6-di-O-methyl)-beta-cyclodextrin. The method was validated for linearity, precision, accuracy, robustness and sensitivity showing LOQ of 0.2 and 1.0 mu g/g in fresh tissues, for AMPA and glyphosate, respectively; the recovery values ranged within 88.5 - 94.6% for glyphosate and 70.4 - 76.6% for AMPA. Experimental samples of Mediterranean mussels M. galloprovin-cialis treated with 100 mu g/L or 500 mu g/L of both glyphosate and AMPA, showed a dose dependent bioaccu-mulation of the compounds reaching maximum level of 77.0 mu g/g and 11.3 mu g/g of AMPA and glyphosate, respectively. The study demonstrates for the first time M. galloprovincialis as potential sentinel organisms for the environmental occurrence of these small amphoteric pollutants.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Extraction of Saline Soil Distributions Using Different Salinity Indices and Deep Neural Networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization has become one of the major environmental problems threatening food security. The identification and knowledge of the spatial distributions of soil salinization are key in addressing this problem. This study assumes that a good saline land identification effect can be obtained with the help of deep learning methods. Therefore, this study used the OLI sensor data from the Landsat-8, based on the U-2-Network, and proposes a method to extract saline land from remote sensing images. The study also adds different salinity indices (SI, SI1, and SI2) to explore its impact on classification accuracy. Through our method, accurate saline soil distribution information were obtained, and several verification indicators (the Intersection-over-Union (IoU), recall, precision, and F1-score) were all measured above 0.8. In addition, compared with the multi-spectral training results, the classification accuracy increased after adding a specific salinity index, and most of the accuracy indices increased by about 2% (the IoU increased by 3.70%, recall increased by 1.50%, precision increased by 2.81%, and F1-score increased by 2.13%). In addition, we also included a case study based on our methodology to analyze the distribution characteristics and changes of saline soil in the Zhenlai area of Northeast China from 2016 to 2020. We found that the area of saline land in the Zhenlai area has reduced, which shows that the extraction method proposed in this study is feasible. Overall, this paper indicates that deep learning-based methods can efficiently extract the salinity of soil and enhance the mapping of its spatial distribution. The study has the broad impact of supplementing satellite imagery for salinity modeling and helping to guide agricultural land management practices for northeastern China and other salinized regions.

It was divided into three time intervals, using remote sensing (RS), geographic information system (GIS), Landsat TM, Landsat ETM+, and Landsat 8 OLI approaches. A transition matrix for the total change was developed to generate spatiotemporal and quantitative indicators to analyze LULC spatiotemporal dynamics for better developmental decisions. Overall accuracy assessment results were 97.41% (kappa 0.96), 90.45% (kappa 0.85), and 91.5% (kappa 0.89) for years 2000, 2009, and 2017, respectively. Furthermore, quantitative and spatiotemporal results show that built up areas drastically increase, especially from 2009 to 2017. The most dominant class in the study area was grassland, 9929.9 km(2) (54.22%), followed by forest, 5555 km(2) (30.33%), barren land, 2497.3 km(2) (13.64%), built up areas, 166.7 km(2) (0.9%), farmland, 128.31 km(2) (0.71%), and water bodies, 35.91 km(2) (0.96%). The outcomes of the analysis show that since 1955 Jubek State (Juba) has been the preferable place for the local citizens' settlement in South Sudan. Unfortunately, agricultural production was insufficient due to the limited cultivated area; on the other hand, the study area is rich in natural resources and could meet local people's demand if a proper strategy such as LULC transformation is well implemented.

TI  - Overcoming the environmental crisis in the forestry sector of Ukraine in the context of the ecocentric paradigm
T2  - REVISTA DE LA UNIVERSIDAD DEL ZULIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the scientific research is to determine and justify the need to harmonize the environmental legislation of Ukraine and the EU in the field of forest resources, based on the prism of the "ecocentric paradigm and a new worldview". To achieve this goal, general scientific and special scientific methods of cognition were used, in particular dialectical, formal-logical, analysis and synthesis, system-structural, comparative-legal, formal-legal, predictive. The author substantiates the creation of an environmental strategy of Ukraine, which would be based on the principles of sustainable development, based on the need for greening forest management, among other things. It is noted that the harmonization of the legislation of Ukraine and the EU is aimed at implementing legal guarantees for the comprehensive application of the principle of mutual benefit and the principle of environmental cooperation in order to liberalize economic relations between Ukraine and its neighbors, on the one hand, and prevent environmental damage, on the other. It is proposed to introduce a whole range of measures, starting from the highest state level, aimed at increasing the level of greening the nature management of forest resources.

TI  - Divergent impact of urban 2D/3D morphology on thermal environment along urban gradients
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Optimizing urban morphology is an effective way to alleviate the thermal environment, and it has always been the focus of urban planning. Although previous scholars have explored the impact of urban 2D/3D morphology on Land Surface Temperature (LST), they have rarely revealed differences along urban gradients, thus ignoring the nonlinear relationship between urban morphology and LST. In this study, we use multi-source data such as night-time lights, Landsat 8, land cover, and buildings, and employ dynamic threshold, single-window algorithm, and boosted regression trees methods to reveal the gradient and marginal effects of urban 2D/3D morphology on LST. Results showed that the proportion of built-up land (PCL), digital elevation model (DEM) and normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) have important contribution to LST. Moreover, relative influence of PCL, NDBI and building density (BD) on LST varies significantly along urban gradients, which are +25.87%, +14.85% and 10.88%, respectively. Interestingly, we found that as the value of each variable increased, its relationship to LST changed. For example, when PCL < similar to 49%, it is negatively correlated with LST, so lowering PCL can alleviate thermal environment. Our findings inform the sound practice of urban planning by accounting for marginal effects of urban morphology on thermal environment.

TI  - Mapping Soil Organic Matter Content Based on Feature Band Selection with ZY1-02D Hyperspectral Satellite Data in the Agricultural Region
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic matter (SOM) is an essential nutrient for crop growth and development. Hyperspectral satellite images with comprehensive spectral band coverage and high spectral resolution can be used to estimate and draw a spatial distribution map of SOM content in the region, which can provide a scientific management basis for precision agriculture. This study takes Xinzheng City, Henan Province's agricultural area, as the research object. Based on ZY1-02D hyperspectral satellite image data, the first derivative of reflectance (FDR) was processed on the original reflectance (OR). The SOM characteristic spectral bands were extracted using the correlation coefficient (CC) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) methods. The prediction model of SOM content was established by multiple linear regression (MLR), partial least squares regression (PLSR), and random forest (RF) algorithms. The results showed that: (1) FDR processing can enhance SOM spectral features and reduce noise; (2) the Lasso feature band extraction method can reduce the model's input variables and raise the estimation precision; (3) the SOM content prediction ability of the RF model was significantly better than that of the MLR and PLSR models. The FDR-Lasso-RF model was the best SOM content prediction model, and the validation set R-2 = 0.921, MAEv = 0.512 g/kg, RMSEv = 0.645 g/kg; (4) compared with laboratory hyperspectral data-SOM prediction methods, hyperspectral satellite data can achieve accurate, rapid, and large-scale SOM content prediction and mapping. This study provides an efficient, accurate, and feasible method for predicting and mapping SOM content in an agricultural region.

TI  - Validation and Comparison of Seven Land Surface Evapotranspiration Products in the Haihe River Basin, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is an important part of the surface energy balance and water balance. Due to imperfect model parameterizations and forcing data, there are still great uncertainties concerning ET products. The validation of land surface ET products has a certain research significance. In this study, two direct validation methods, including the latent heat flux (LE) from the flux towers validation method and the water balance validation method, and one indirect validation method, the three-corned hat (TCH) uncertainty analysis, were used to validate and compare seven types of ET products in the Haihe River Basin in China. The products evaluated included six ET products based on remotely-sensed observations (surface energy balance based global land evapotranspiration [EB-ET], Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer [MODIS] global terrestrial evapotranspiration product [MOD16], Penman-Monteith-Leuning Evapotranspiration version 2 [PML_V2], Global Land Surface Satellite [GLASS], global land evaporation Amsterdam model [GLEAM], and Zhangke evapotranspiration [ZK-ET]) and one ET product from atmospheric re-analysis data (Japanese 55-year re-analysis, JRA-55). The goals of this study were to provide a reference for research on ET in the Haihe River Basin. The results indicate the following: (1) The results of the six ET products have a higher accuracy when the flux towers validation method is used. Except for MOD16_ET and EB_ET, the Pearson correlation coefficients (R) were all greater than 0.6. The root mean square deviation (RMSD) values were all less than 40 W/m(2). The GLASS_ET data have the smallest average deviation (BIAS) value. Overall, the GLEAM_ET data have a higher accuracy. (2) When the validation of the water balance approach was used, the low values of the MOD16_ET were overestimated and the high values were underestimated. The values of the EB_ET, GLEAM_ET, JRA_ET, PML_ET, and ZK_ET were overestimated. According to the seasonal variations statistics, most of the ET products have higher R values in spring and lower R values in summer, and the RMSD values of most of the products were the highest in summer. (3) According to the results of the uncertainty quantification based on the TCH method, the average value of the relative uncertainties of the GLEAM_ET data were the lowest. The relative uncertainties of the JRA_ET and ZK_ET were higher in mountainous areas than in non-mountainous area, and the relative uncertainties of the PML_ET were lower in mountainous areas. The performances of the EB_ET, GLEAM_ET, and MOD16_ET in mountainous and non-mountainous areas were relatively equal. The relative uncertainties of the ET products were significantly higher in summer than in other periods, and they also varied in the different sub-basins.

TI  - Estimate the Earliest Phenophase for Garlic Mapping Using Time Series Landsat 8/9 Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Garlic is the major economic crop in China. Timely and accurate identification and mapping of garlic are significant for garlic yield prediction and garlic market management. Previous studies on garlic mapping were mainly based on all observations of the entire growing season, so the resulting maps have a hysteresis. Here, we determined the optimal identification strategy and the earliest identifiable phenophase for garlic based on all available Landsat 8/9 time series imagery in Google Earth Engine. Specifically, we evaluated the performance of different vegetation indices for each phenophase to determine the optimal classification metrics for garlic. Secondly, we identified garlic using random forest algorithm and classification metrics of different time series lengths. Finally, we determined the earliest identifiable phenophase of garlic and generated an early-season garlic distribution map. Garlic could be identified as early as March (bud differentiation period) with an F1 of 0.91. Our study demonstrates the differences in the performance of vegetation indices at different phenophases, and these differences provide a new idea for mapping crops. The generated early-season garlic distribution map provides timely data support for various stakeholders.

TI  - Using cloud computing techniques to monitor long-term variations in ecohydrological dynamics of small seasonally-flooded wetlands in semi-arid South Africa
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands in drylands have high inter-and intra-annual ecohydrological variations that are driven to a great extent by climate variability and anthropogenic influences. The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands encourages the development of frameworks for national action and international cooperation for ensuring conservation and wise use of wetlands and their resources at local, national and regional scales. However, the implementation of these frameworks remains a challenge. This is mainly due to limited availability of high-resolution data and suitable big data processing techniques for assessing and monitoring wetland ecohydrological dynamics at large spatial scales, particularly in the sub-Saharan African region. The availability of cloud computing platforms such as Google Earth Engine (GEE) offers unique big data handling and processing opportunities to address some of these challenges. In this study, we applied the GEE cloud computing platform to monitor the long-term ecohydrological dynamics of a seasonally flooded part of the Nylsvley floodplain wetland complex in north-eastern South Africa over a 20-year period (2000-2020). The specific objectives of the study were 1) to evaluate wetland ecohydrological dynamics using the 20-year multi-date Landsat composite data coupled with the Random Forest machine learning algorithm, and 2) to establish the major drivers of wetland ecohydrological changes, using selected spectral indices (i.e. Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI) and Normalised Difference Phenology Index (NDPI)) coupled with climate data. The ecohydrology of the wetland changed over time, with some classes increasing twice when compared to the previous measurement, while others decreasing significantly during the study period. Notably, the bare surface class increased at rates of 230% and 350% between 2006-2010 and 2016-2020, respectively. Moreover, the indices showed similar trends throughout the 20-year period, with NDWI having minimum values less than zero in all cases. This implied no surface inundation, although the presence of some wetland vegetation indicated seasonal to semipermanent soil saturation conditions. A comparative analysis of climate data and remotely sensed indices showed that annual changes of precipitation and evapotranspiration were the main drivers of wetland ecohydrological variations. The findings of the study underscore the relevance of cloud computing artificial intelligence techniques, and particularly the GEE platform, in evaluating wetland ecohydrological dynamics for semiarid southern African systems which are deteriorating due to the unsustainable use and poor management resulting from limited knowledge about their changes over time.

TI  - Considerations for Assessing Functional Forest Diversity in High-Dimensional Trait Space Derived from Drone-Based Lidar
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed morphological traits have been used to assess functional diversity of forests. This approach is potentially spatial-scale-independent. Lidar data collected from the ground or by drone at a high point density provide an opportunity to consider multiple ecologically meaningful traits at fine-scale ecological units such as individual trees. However, high-spatial-resolution and multi-trait datasets used to calculate functional diversity can produce large volumes of data that can be computationally resource demanding. Functional diversity can be derived through a trait probability density (TPD) approach. Computing TPD in a high-dimensional trait space is computationally intensive. Reductions of the number of dimensions through trait selection and principal component analysis (PCA) may reduce the computational load. Trait selection can facilitate identification of ecologically meaningful traits and reduce inter-trait correlation. This study investigates whether kernel density estimator (KDE) or one-class support vector machine (SVM) may be computationally more efficient in calculating TPD. Four traits were selected for input into the TPD: canopy height, effective number of layers, plant to ground ratio, and box dimensions. When simulating a high-dimensional trait space, we found that TPD derived from KDE was more efficient than using SVM when the number of input traits was high. For five or more traits, applying dimension reduction techniques (e.g., PCA) are recommended. Furthermore, the kernel size for TPD needs to be appropriate for the ecological target unit and should be appropriate for the number of traits. The kernel size determines the required number of data points within the trait space. Therefore, 3-5 traits require a kernel size of at least 7 x 7 pixels. This study contributes to improving the quality of TPD calculations based on traits derived from remote sensing data. We provide a set of recommendations based on our findings. This has the potential to improve reliability in identifying biodiversity hotspots.

TI  - Identifying Exposure of Urban Area to Certain Seismic Hazard Using Machine Learning and GIS: A Case Study of Greater Cairo
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The 1992 Cairo earthquake, with a moment magnitude of 5.8, is the most catastrophic earthquake to shock the Greater Cairo (GC) in recent decades. According to the very limited number of seismological stations at that time, the peak ground acceleration (PGA) caused by this event was not recorded. PGA calculation requires identification of nature of the earthquake source, the geologic setting of the path between the source and site under investigation and soil dynamic properties of the site. Soil dynamic properties are acquired by geotechnical investigations and/or geophysical survey. These two methods are costly and are not applicable in regional studies. This study presents an adaptive and reliable PGA prediction model using machine learning (ML) along with six standard geographic information system (GIS) interpolation methods (IDW, Kriging, Natural, Spline, TopoToR, and Trend) to predict the spatial distribution of PGA caused by this event over the GC. The model is employed to estimate the exposure of the urban area and population in the GC based on the available geotechnical and geophysical investigations. The exposure (population) data is from free and easy-access sources, e.g., Landsat images and the Global Human Settlement Population Grid (GHS-POP). The results show that Natural, Spline, and Trend are not suitable GIS interpolation techniques for generating seismic hazard maps (SHMs), while the Kriging Method shows sufficient prediction. Interestingly, with an accuracy of 96%, the ML model outperforms the classical GIS methodologies.

TI  - SEAN: A Simple and Efficient Attention Network for Aircraft Detection in SAR Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the unique imaging mechanism of synthetic aperture radar (SAR), which leads to a discrete state of aircraft targets in images, its detection performance is vulnerable to the influence of complex ground objects. Although existing deep learning detection algorithms show good performance, they generally use a feature pyramid neck design and large backbone network, which reduces the detection efficiency to some extent. To address these problems, we propose a simple and efficient attention network (SEAN) in this paper, which takes YOLOv5s as the baseline. First, we shallow the depth of the backbone network and introduce a structural re-parameterization technique to increase the feature extraction capability of the backbone. Second, the neck architecture is designed by using a residual dilated module (RDM), a low-level semantic enhancement module (LSEM), and a localization attention module (LAM), substantially reducing the number of parameters and computation of the network. The results on the Gaofen-3 aircraft target dataset show that this method achieves 97.7% AP at a speed of 83.3 FPS on a Tesla M60, exceeding YOLOv5s by 1.3% AP and 8.7 FPS with 40.51% of the parameters and 86.25% of the FLOPs.

TI  - Orthogonal Scattering Model-Based Three-Component Decomposition of Polarimetric SAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - New scattering models are constantly emerging to extract the detailed polarization information of ground targets. They contribute to the refined interpretation of Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) images. However, an increasingly prominent problem lies ahead of model decomposition methods when there are similar scattering models for a decomposition scheme. It is difficult to separate the polarization power of similar scattering mechanisms reasonably and robustly. Therefore, in this paper, we first analyze the necessity of orthogonality between scattering models. Following this, we propose two mutually orthogonal rank-1 scattering models, which can degenerate to mostly current scattering models. The orthogonality and adaptability of scattering models are considered in the model derivation. Simulated PolSAR data, real ALOS-2/PALSAR-2, GF-3, and E-SAR data are selected to validate the proposed method. As shown by the results, first, the proposed method enhances the double-bounce scattering contribution in urban areas and maintains the volume-scattering contribution in vegetation areas because it separates the polarization power of different scattering mechanisms more reasonably. Second, the proposed method is powerful in the robust interpretation of different ground targets, resulting from the orthogonality of scattering models. These two characteristics of orthogonal scattering models are expected to play a positive role in large-scale applications, especially in land-cover classification.

TI  - Axillary Staging after Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy for Initially Node-Positive Breast Carcinoma in Germany Initial Data from the AXSANA study
T2  - GEBURTSHILFE UND FRAUENHEILKUNDE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction To date, the optimal axillary staging procedure for initially node-positive breast carcinoma patients after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy ( NACT) has been unclear. The aim of the AXSANA study is to prospectively compare different surgical staging techniques with respect to the oncological outcome and quality of life for the patients. Little is known about current clinical practice in Germany.Material and Methods In this paper we analyzed data from patients enrolled in the AXSANA study at German study sites from June 2020 to March 2022.Results During the period under investigation, 1135 patients were recruited at 143 study sites. More than three suspicious lymph nodes were initially found in 22% of patients. The target lymph node (TLN) was marked in 64% of cases. This was done with clips/coils in 83% of patients, with magnetic seeds or carbon suspension in 8% each, and with a radar marker in 1% of patients. After NACT, targeted axillary dissection (TAD) or axillary lymphadenectomy (ALND) were each planned in 48% of patients, and sentinel lymph node biopsy alone (SLNB) in 2%. Clinically, the nodal status after NACT was found to be unremarkable in 65% of cases. Histological lymph node status was correctly assessed by palpation in 65% of patients and by sonography in 69% of patients.Conclusion At the German AXSANA study sites, TAD and ALND are currently used as the most common surgical staging procedures after NACT in initially node-positive breast cancer patients. The TLN is marked with various markers prior to NACT. Given the inadequate accuracy of clinical assessment of axillary lymph node status after NACT, it should be questioned whether axillary dissection after NACT should be performed based on clinical assessment of nodal status alone.

TI  - Study on Spatial and Temporal Characteristics of Surface Albedo at the Northern Edge of the Badain Jaran Desert Based on C plus STNLFFM Model
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Obtaining surface albedo data with high spatial and temporal resolution is essential for measuring the factors, effects, and change mechanisms of regional land-atmosphere interactions in deserts. In order to obtain surface albedo data with higher accuracy and better applicability in deserts, we used MODIS and OLI as data sources, and calculated the daily surface albedo data, with a spatial resolution of 30 m, of Guaizi Lake at the northern edge of the Badain Jaran Desert in 2016, using the Spatial and Temporal Non-Local Filter-based Fusion Model (STNLFFM) and topographical correction model (C model). We then compared the results of STNLFFM and C + STNLFFM for fusion accuracy, and for spatial and temporal distribution differences in surface albedo over different underlying surfaces. The results indicated that, compared with STNLFFM surface albedo and MODIS surface albedo, the relative error of C + STNLFFM surface albedo decreased by 2.34% and 3.57%, respectively. C + STNLFFM can improve poor applicability of MODIS in winter, and better responds to the changes in the measured value over a short time range. After the correction of the C model, the spatial difference in surface albedo over different underlying surfaces was enhanced, and the spatial differences in surface albedo between shifting dunes and semi-shifting dunes, fixed dunes and saline-alkali land, and the Gobi and saline-alkali land were significant. C + STNLFFM maintained the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of STNLFFM surface albedo, but the increase in regional aerosol concentration and thickness caused by frequent dust storms weakened the spatial difference in surface albedo over different underlying surfaces in March, which led to the overcorrection of the C model.

T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - As a typical physical retrieval algorithm for retrieving atmospheric parameters, one-dimensional variational (1DVAR) algorithm is widely used in various climate and meteorological communities and enjoys an important position in the field of microwave remote sensing. Among algorithm parameters affecting the performance of the 1DVAR algorithm, the accuracy of the microwave radiative transfer model for calculating the simulated brightness temperature is the fundamental constraint on the retrieval accuracies of the 1DVAR algorithm for retrieving atmospheric parameters. In this study, a deep neural network (DNN) is used to describe the nonlinear relationship between atmospheric parameters and satellite-based microwave radiometer observations, and a DNN-based radiative transfer model is developed and applied to the 1DVAR algorithm to carry out retrieval experiments of the atmospheric temperature and humidity profiles. The retrieval results of the temperature and humidity profiles from the Microwave Humidity and Temperature Sounder (MWHTS) onboard the Feng-Yun-3 (FY-3) satellite show that the DNN-based radiative transfer model can obtain higher accuracy for simulating MWHTS observations than that of the operational radiative transfer model RTTOV, and also enables the 1DVAR algorithm to obtain higher retrieval accuracies of the temperature and humidity profiles. In this study, the DNN-based radiative transfer model applied to the 1DVAR algorithm can fundamentally improve the retrieval accuracies of atmospheric parameters, which may provide important reference for various applied studies in atmospheric sciences.

TI  - Soil Reflectance Composites-Improved Thresholding and Performance Evaluation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Reflectance composites that capture bare soil pixels from multispectral image data are increasingly being analysed to model soil constituents such as soil organic carbon. These temporal composites are used instead of single-date multispectral images to account for the frequent vegetation cover of soils and, thus, to get broader spatial coverage of bare soil pixels. Most soil compositing techniques require thresholds derived from spectral indices such as the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Normalised Burn Ratio 2 (NBR2) to separate bare soils from all other land cover types. However, the threshold derivation is handled based on expert knowledge of a specific area, statistical percentile definitions or in situ data. For operational processors, such site-specific and partly manual strategies are not applicable. There is a need for a more generic solution to derive thresholds for large-scale processing without manual intervention. This study presents a novel HIstogram SEparation Threshold (HISET) methodology deriving spectral index thresholds and testing them for a Sentinel-2 temporal data stack. The technique is spectral index-independent, data-driven and can be evaluated based on a quality score. We tested HISET for building six soil reflectance composites (SRC) using NDVI, NBR2 and a new index combining the NDVI and a short-wave infrared (SWIR) band (PV+IR2). A comprehensive analysis of the spectral and spatial performance and accuracy of the resulting SRCs proves the flexibility and validity of HISET. Disturbance effects such as spectral confusion of bare soils with non-photosynthetic-active vegetation (NPV) could be reduced by choosing grassland and crops as input LC for HISET. The NBR2-based SRC spectra showed the highest similarity with LUCAS spectra, the broadest spatial coverage of bare soil pixels and the least number of valid observations per pixel. The spatial coverage of bare soil pixels is validated against the database of the Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) of the European Commission. Validation results show that PV+IR2-based SRCs outperform the other two indices, especially in spectrally mixed areas of bare soil, photosynthetic-active vegetation and NPV. The NDVI-based SRCs showed the lowest confidence values (95%) in all bands. In the future, HISET shall be tested in other areas with different environmental conditions and LC characteristics to evaluate if the findings of this study are also valid.

AB  - There is a perception that our time shows a general and profound crisis of confidence in several essential areas. The seriousness of this trend can only be measured against the background of a view on how important trust is for being human. During and after the Enlightenment, it became fashionable to reduce being human to rationality. Thus, rationalism requires that trust be constructed primarily to reflect rationality or take a lesser place in human existence. We currently live in a time that increasingly realises that rationality has its limits and that being human presupposes far more aspects and factors than the dominant currents of

TI  - Future Land Use/Land Cover Change Has Nontrivial and Potentially Dominant Impact on Global Gross Primary Productivity
T2  - EARTHS FUTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic land use/land cover (LULC) change alters terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP), the largest land-atmosphere carbon exchanges. Identifying the impacts of LULC changes on future terrestrial GPP has been challenging due to the scarcity of standardized future LULC for ecosystem models. Here, we present eight scenario-based projections of global spatially explicit LULC at 1-km resolution over the period 2015-2100 with a Future Land Use Simulation model-consistent with the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways and Representative Concentration Pathways. Twenty computational experiments with different LULC patterns, climate forcing, and CO2 concentrations were conducted to quantify their contributions to future GPP dynamics. Results show that the global terrestrial GPP would decline in the 21st century in most LULC scenarios due to urbanization, agricultural expansion, and deforestation. Moreover, the contribution of LULC changes to global GPP dynamics ranges from 3.43% to 10.78% when CO2 fertilization effect (CFE) is not modeled during 2000-2100 (7%-9% of the terrestrial area is dominated by LULC change). However, this value may range from 10.92% to 16.16% during 2000-2050 and 1.41%-14.57% during 2050-2100. The contribution of LULC even reached 56.08% during 2050-2100 in Southeast Asia due to deforestation. Despite the relatively important role of LULC to GPP dynamics, it becomes trivial globally when incorporating CFE into the model (i.e., LULC accounts for 1.24%-2.51% during 2000-2100). Our findings emphasize the strategic role of CFE in enhancing global GPP and highlight the quantitatively nontrivial role of LULC at the regional scale.

TI  - Urban Surface Deformation Management: Assessing Dangerous Subsidence Areas through Regional Surface Deformation, Natural Factors, and Human Activities
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Geological disasters caused by surface deformation are common, especially in urban areas, which seriously impede urbanization's sustainable development. Monitoring and analysis with high spatial and temporal resolution are particularly important to assess the risk of geological disasters caused by urban deformation. This study uses Sentinel-1A satellite imagery to obtain the surface deformation time series of Nanchang City based on SBAS-InSAR and PS-InSAR techniques and is combined with wavelet period analysis and gray correlation analysis to determine the correlation between deformation area and climate environment. This study shows that there was a large-scale subsidence trend in the central urban area of Nanchang in those two years, and an uplift trend in the agro-ecological areas in the southeast. A periodic analysis further shows that the areas with larger changes in surface deformation are more affected by changes in precipitation. This study, integrated with external data, examines the possibility of subsidence disasters occurring along subway lines in areas with large deformation magnitudes from multiple angles.

TI  - Improving Mountain Snow and Land Cover Mapping Using Very-High-Resolution (VHR) Optical Satellite Images and Random Forest Machine Learning Models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Very-high-resolution (VHR) optical imaging satellites can offer precise, accurate, and direct measurements of snow-covered areas (SCA) with sub-meter to meter-scale resolution in regions of complex land cover and terrain. We explore the potential of Maxar WorldView-2 and WorldView-3 in-track stereo images (WV) for land and snow cover mapping at two sites in the Western U.S. with different snow regimes, topographies, vegetation, and underlying geology. We trained random forest models using combinations of multispectral bands and normalized difference indices (i.e., NDVI) to produce land cover maps for priority feature classes (snow, shaded snow, vegetation, water, and exposed ground). We then created snow-covered area products from these maps and compared them with coarser resolution satellite fractional snow-covered area (fSCA) products from Landsat (similar to 30 m) and MODIS (similar to 500 m). Our models generated accurate classifications, even with limited combinations of available multispectral bands. Models trained on a single image demonstrated limited model transfer, with best results found for in-region transfers. Coarser-resolution Landsat and MODSCAG fSCA products identified many more pixels as completely snow-covered (100% fSCA) than WV fSCA. However, while MODSCAG fSCA products also identified many more completely snow-free pixels (0% fSCA) than WV fSCA, Landsat fSCA products only slightly underestimated the number of completely snow-free pixels. Overall, our results demonstrate that strategic image observations with VHR satellites such as WorldView-2 and WorldView-3 can complement the existing operational snow data products to map the evolution of seasonal snow cover.

TI  - SDGSAT-1 TIS Prelaunch Radiometric Calibration and Performance
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - SDGSAT-1 was launched in November 2021, and TIS (Thermal infrared sensor) is a major instrument onboard this satellite. An analysis of the radiometric calibration and noise performance of the TIS has been carried out in the thermal vacuum chamber before launch in order to ensure that it meets the requirements. The prelaunch test results show NEdT (noise equivalent temperature difference) is 0.034 K, 0.047 K and 0.076 K@300 K for the three bands, respectively. The maximum fitting residuals are less than 0.5 K at measured blackbody temperatures. In addition, this paper also discusses the dependence between TIS performance and instrument temperature and focal plane array (FPA) temperature. The good radiometric and noise performance of TIS demonstrates it has potential to provide high resolution thermal remote sensing data in urban heat island, and other environmental issues research.

TI  - An Image Fusion Method of SAR and Multispectral Images Based on Non-Subsampled Shearlet Transform and Activity Measure
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an important remote sensing sensor whose application is becoming more and more extensive. Compared with traditional optical sensors, it is not easy to be disturbed by the external environment and has a strong penetration. Limited by its working principles, SAR images are not easily interpreted, and fusing SAR images with optical multispectral images is a good solution to improve the interpretability of SAR images. This paper presents a novel image fusion method based on non-subsampled shearlet transform and activity measure to fuse SAR images with multispectral images, whose aim is to improve the interpretation ability of SAR images easily obtained at any time, rather than producing a fused image containing more information, which is the pursuit of previous fusion methods. Three different sensors, together with different working frequencies, polarization modes and spatial resolution SAR datasets, are used to evaluate the proposed method. Both visual evaluation and statistical analysis are performed, the results show that satisfactory fusion results are achieved through the proposed method and the interpretation ability of SAR images is effectively improved compared with the previous methods.

TI  - Comparison of Multiple Machine Learning Models for Estimating the Forest Growing Stock in Large-Scale Forests Using Multi-Source Data
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The forest growing stock is one of the key indicators in monitoring forest resources, and its quantitative estimation is of great significance. Based on multi-source data, including Sentinel-1 radar remote sensing data, Sentinel-2 optical remote sensing data, digital elevation model (DEM), and inventory data for forest management planning and design, the Lasso feature selection method was used to remove the non-significant indicators, and three machine learning algorithms, GBDT, XGBoost, and CatBoost, were used to estimate forest growing stock. In addition, four category features, forest population, dominant tree species, humus thickness, and slope direction, were involved in estimating forest growing stock. The results showed that the addition of category features significantly improved the performance of the models. To a certain extent, radar remote sensing data also could improve estimating accuracy. Among the three models, the CatBoost model (R-2 = 0.78, MSE = 0.62, MAE = 0.59, MAPE = 16.20%) had the highest estimating accuracy, followed by XGBoost (R-2 = 0.75, MSE = 0.71, MAE = 0.62, MAPE = 18.28%) and GBDT (R-2 = 0.72, MSE = 0.78, MAE = 0.68, MAPE = 20.28%).

TI  - Mapping the Spatio-Temporal Distribution of Fall Armyworm in China by Coupling Multi-Factors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The fall armyworm (FAW) (Spodoptera frugiperda) (J. E. Smith) is a migratory pest that lacks diapause and has raised widespread concern in recent years due to its global dispersal and infestation. Seasonal environmental changes lead to its large-scale seasonal activities, and quantitative simulations of its dispersal patterns and spatiotemporal distribution facilitate integrated pest management. Based on remote sensing data and meteorological assimilation products, we constructed a mechanistic model of the dynamic distribution of FAW (FAW-DDM) by integrating weather-driven flight of FAW with host plant phenology and environmental suitability. The potential distribution of FAW in China from February to August 2020 was simulated. The results showed a significant linear relationship between the dates of the first simulated invasion and the first observed invasion of FAW in 125 cities (R-2 = 0.623; p < 0.001). From February to April, FAW was distributed in the Southwestern and Southern Mountain maize regions mainly due to environmental influences. From May to June, FAW spread rapidly, and reached the Huanghuaihai and North China maize regions between June to August. Our results can help in developing pest prevention and control strategies with data on specific times and locations, reducing the impact of FAW on food security.

TI  - Head and Neck Merkel Cell Carcinoma: A 12-Year Single Institutional Experience
T2  - JPRAS OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is an aggressive malignancy of presumed neuroendocrine origin. Most case series of MCC are limited by low case numbers and are not specific to head and neck tumours. The purpose of this study was to provide a focused review of head and neck MCC diagnosis and management in a single Irish institution. Methods: Patient's demographics, tumour characteristics, pathological diagnosis, surgical treatment, adjuvant treatment, subsequent management and clinical course were collected. Estimates of progression-free MCC survival rates were calculated by the KaplanMeier statistical model. A Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient examined the association between surgical margins and disease-free follow-up. Results: In total, 11 patients were treated for head and neck MCC with a mean age of 79.6 years (range = 69-91 years). The mean average follow-up duration of patients was 18.3 months. Of the cohort, 18% (n=2) had a sentinel node biopsy (SLNB). A selective neck dissection was subsequently performed in 18% (n= 2). In total, 72% (n= 8) of patients received adjuvant radiotherapy. Median disease-specific survival was 15 months for the SLNB group and 17 months for the non-SLNB group, not statistically significant (p=0.23). There was no significant association between surgical margins and disease-free follow (p= 0.65). Conclusions: Our case series adds to a limited body of evidence of head and neck MCC. Surgery remains the treatment priority in localized disease, with an increasing role of SLNB for accurate prognostication and staging. Early management of stage I disease results in moderate long-term disease-free survivability. (c) 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Review on the Geophysical and UAV-Based Methods Applied to Landslides
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Landslides (LS) represent geomorphological processes that can induce changes over time in the physical, hydrogeological, and mechanical properties of the involved materials. For geohazard assessment, the variations of these properties might be detected by a wide range of non-intrusive techniques, which can sometimes be confusing due to their significant variation in accuracy, suitability, coverage area, logistics, timescale, cost, and integration potential; this paper reviews common geophysical methods (GM) categorized as Emitted Seismic and Ambient Noise based and proposes an integrated approach between them for improving landslide studies; this level of integration (among themselves) is an important step ahead of integrating geophysical data with remote sensing data. The aforementioned GMs help to construct a framework based on physical properties that may be linked with site characterization (e.g., a landslide and its subsurface channel geometry, recharge pathways, rock fragments, mass flow rate, etc.) and dynamics (e.g., quantification of the rheology, saturation, fracture process, toe erosion, mass flow rate, deformation marks and spatiotemporally dependent geogenic pore-water pressure feedback through a joint analysis of geophysical time series, displacement and hydrometeorological measurements from the ground, air and space). A review of the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) based photogrammetry for the investigation of landslides was also conducted to highlight the latest advancement and discuss the synergy between UAV and geophysical in four possible broader areas: (i) survey planning, (ii) LS investigation, (iii) LS dynamics and (iv) presentation of results in GIS environment. Additionally, endogenous source mechanisms lead to the appearance of deformation marks on the surface and provide ground for the integrated use of UAV and geophysical monitoring for landslide early warning systems. Further development in this area requires UAVs to adopt more multispectral and other advanced sensors where their data are integrated with the geophysical one as well as the climatic data to enable Artificial Intelligent based prediction of LS.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, European countries have faced repeated heat waves. Traditionally, atmospheric CO2 concentration linked to repeated heat wave-induced photosynthetic inhibition has been explored based on local-specific in-situ observations. However, previous research based on field surveys has limitations in exploring area-wide atmospheric CO2 concentrations linked to repeated heat wave-induced photosynthetic inhibition. The present study aimed to evaluate the spatial cross-correlation of Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) CO2 concentrations with repeated heat wave-induced photosynthetic inhibition in Europe from 2009 to 2017 by applying geographically weighted regression (GWR). The local standardized coefficient of a fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR: -0.24) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI: -0.22) indicate that photosynthetic inhibition increases atmospheric CO2 in Europe. Furthermore, from 2009 to 2017, the heat waves in Europe contributed to CO2 emissions (27.2-32.1%) induced by photosynthetic inhibition. This study provides realistic evidence to justify repeated heat wave-induced photosynthetic inhibition as a fundamental factor in mitigating carbon emissions in Europe.

TI  - Augmentative biological control of<i> Halyomorpha</i><i> halys</i> using the native European parasitoid<i> Anastatus</i><i> bifasciatus:</i> Efficacy and ecological impact
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - We report the first large-scale augmentative biological control project carried out in Europe against Halyomorpha halys (Stal) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) using the native egg parasitoid Anastatus bifasciatus (Geoffroy) (Hyme-noptera: Eupelmidae). During summer 2020, a total of 325,000 adults of A. bifasciatus were released at a rate of 1000 individuals/ha of orchard in 11 sites in Trentino-Alto Adige (Northern Italy). Parasitism parameters were compared between release and control (no release) sites, in which at least three egg masses naturally laid by H. halys were collected (for a total of 262 egg masses). Anastatus bifasciatus and Trissolcus mitsukurii (Ashmead) (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae) were the dominant parasitoids, but parasitism by both species fluctuated widely among sites. At release sites, A. bifasciatus showed a significantly higher discovery efficiency (31.4%) and parasitism rate (16.7%) of H. halys egg masses than at control sites (1.7% and 1.2%, respectively). Parasitism by A. bifasciatus was not dependent on egg mass abundance at release sites, but at control sites a host density-dependent response was revealed by a positive relationship between parasitism and number of H. halys egg masses. On the other hand, parasitism by the adventive T. mitsukurii was not affected by either the releases of A. bifasciatus or by the abundance of H. halys egg masses per site. In conclusion, augmentative releases of A. bifasciatus contributed to increasing its parasitization of H. halys, without causing any negative effects on parasitization by naturally occurring species.

TI  - THE IMPACT OF POSITIVE IOD AND LA NI?A ON THE DYNAMICS OF HYDRO-CLIMATOLOGICAL PARAMETERS ON PEATLAND
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Peatlands in Indonesia are highly flammable during extremely dry seasons and are prone to flooding during extreme rainy seasons. This incident is related to the dynamics of the hydro-climatological parameters of the peatland. In 2019 the IOD+ phenomenon occurred which caused extreme drought and in 2020 there was a La Nina phenomenon that caused above-average rainfall. This study aims to determine and compare the dynamics of hydro-climatological parameters in the dry season during the 2018 normal climate, when there is IOD+ 2019, and when there is La Nina 2020. The data used are the results of in situ measurements by an integrated measurement system called SESAME and the measurement data of the MODIS satellite. The results of this study show that the rainfall and groundwater level during the IOD+ phenomenon in 2019 was lower than during the normal climate in 2018, while during La Nina in 2020 it was higher than during the normal climate in 2018. This study found a relationship that rainfall affecting groundwater level, and groundwater level affecting the number of hotspots, but their correlation is not significant. It is also found that hotspots can appear when the groundwater level reaches-0.65 m in West Kalimantan and-0.81 m in Central Kalimantan.

M3  - Article
AB  - The possible effects of wastewater treatment products on mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) were studied. Three common pollution biomarkers were used: neutral red retention assay, malondialdehyde contents and DNA damage through comet assay. Two groups of mussels were treated in the laboratory for 25 days with 20 and 40 %v/v of treated wastewater collected after chlorination, and the control mussels formed a third group. The results showed statistically significantly lower neutral red retention times, higher malondialdehyde contents and higher formation of single-stranded DNA fragments in the mussels exposed at both treated wastewater concentrations compared to the controls.

TI  - Undiagnosed comorbidities among individuals hospitalised with COVID-19 in South African public hospitals
T2  - SAMJ SOUTH AFRICAN MEDICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Previous studies have reported comorbid disease, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic cardiac and renal disease, malignancy, HIV, tuberculosis (TB) and obesity, to be associated with COVID-19 mortality. National demographic surveys have reported a high proportion of undiagnosed and untreated comorbid disease in South Africa (SA).Objectives. To determine the number of individuals with previously undiagnosed HIV, TB and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) among patients hospitalised with COVID-19, and the level of medical control of these chronic diseases.Methods. We conducted a sentinel surveillance study to collect enhanced data on HIV, TB and NCDs among individuals with COVID-19 admitted to 16 secondary-level public hospitals in six of the nine provinces of SA. Trained surveillance officers approached all patients who met the surveillance case definition for inclusion in the study, and consenting patients were enrolled. The data collection instrument included questions on past medical history to determine the self-reported presence of comorbidities. The results of clinical and laboratory testing introduced as part of routine clinical care for hospitalised COVID-19 patients were collected for the study, to objectively determine the presence of hypertension, diabetes, HIV and TB and the levels of control of diabetes and HIV.Results. On self-reported history, the most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension (n=1 658; 51.5%), diabetes (n=855; 26.6%) and HIV (n=603; 18.7%). The prevalence of self-reported active TB was 3.1%, and that of previous TB 5.5%. There were 1 254 patients admitted with COVID-19 (39.0%) who met the body mass index criteria for obesity. On clinical and laboratory testing, 87 patients were newly diagnosed with HIV, 29 with TB, 215 with diabetes and 40 with hypertension during their COVID-19 admission. There were 151/521 patients living with HIV (29.0%) with a viral load >1 000 copies/mL and 309/570 (54.2%) with a CD4 count <200 cells/pL. Among 901 patients classified as having diabetes, 777 (86.2%) had a glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) level >= 6.5%.Conclusion. The study revealed a high prevalence of comorbid conditions among individuals with COVID-19 admitted to public hospitals in SA. In addition, a significant number of patients had previously undiagnosed hypertension, diabetes, HIV and active TB, and many had poorly controlled chronic disease, as evidenced by high HbA1c levels in patients with diabetes, and high viral loads and low CD4 levels in patients with HIV. The findings highlight the importance of strengthening health systems and care cascades for chronic disease management, which include prevention, screening for and effectively treating comorbidities, and ensuring secure and innovative supplies of medicines in primary healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - Monitoring System of the Mar Menor Coastal Lagoon (Spain) and Its Watershed Basin Using the Integration of Massive Heterogeneous Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The tool created aims at the environmental monitoring of the Mar Menor coastal lagoon (Spain) and the monitoring of the land use of its watershed. It integrates heterogeneous data sources ranging from ecological data obtained from a multiparametric oceanographic sonde to agro-meteorological data from IMIDA's network of stations or hydrological data from the SAIH network as multispectral satellite images from Sentinel and Landsat space missions. The system is based on free and open source software and has been designed to guarantee maximum levels of flexibility and scalability and minimum coupling so that the incorporation of new components does not affect the existing ones. The platform is designed to handle a data volume of more than 12 million records, experiencing exponential growth in the last six months. The tool allows the transformation of a large volume of data into information, offering them through microservices with optimal response times. As practical applications, the platform created allows us to know the ecological state of the Mar Menor with a very high level of detail, both at biophysical and nutrient levels, being able to detect periods of oxygen deficit and delimit the affected area. In addition, it facilitates the detailed monitoring of the cultivated areas of the watershed, detecting the agricultural use and crop cycles at the plot level. It also makes it possible to calculate the amount of water precipitated on the watershed and to monitor the runoff produced and the amount of water entering the Mar Menor in extreme events. The information is offered in different ways depending on the user profile, offering a very high level of detail for research or data analysis profiles, concrete and direct information to support decision-making for users with managerial profiles and validated and concise information for citizens. It is an integrated and distributed system that will provide data and services for the Mar Menor Observatory.

TI  - Effect of Image-Processing Routines on Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis for Mapping Glacier Surface Facies from Svalbard and the Himalayas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Advancements in remote sensing have led to the development of Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA). This method of information extraction focuses on segregating correlated pixels into groups for easier classification. This is of excellent use in analyzing very-high-resolution (VHR) data. The application of GEOBIA for glacier surface mapping, however, necessitates multiple scales of segmentation and input of supportive ancillary data. The mapping of glacier surface facies presents a unique problem to GEOBIA on account of its separable but closely matching spectral characteristics and often disheveled surface. Debris cover can induce challenges and requires additions of slope, temperature, and short-wave infrared data as supplements to enable efficient mapping. Moreover, as the influence of atmospheric corrections and image sharpening can derive variations in the apparent surface reflectance, a robust analysis of the effects of these processing routines in a GEOBIA environment is lacking. The current study aims to investigate the impact of three atmospheric corrections, Dark Object Subtraction (DOS), Quick Atmospheric Correction (QUAC), and Fast Line-of-Sight Atmospheric Analysis of Hypercubes (FLAASH), and two pansharpening methods, viz., Gram-Schmidt (GS) and Hyperspherical Color Sharpening (HCS), on the classification of surface facies using GEOBIA. This analysis is performed on VHR WorldView-2 imagery of selected glaciers in Ny-angstrom lesund, Svalbard, and Chandra-Bhaga basin, Himalaya. The image subsets are segmented using multiresolution segmentation with constant parameters. Three rule sets are defined: rule set 1 utilizes only spectral information, rule set 2 contains only spatial and contextual features, and rule set 3 combines both spatial and spectral attributes. Rule set 3 performs the best across all processing schemes with the highest overall accuracy, followed by rule set 1 and lastly rule set 2. This trend is observed for every image subset. Among the atmospheric corrections, DOS displays consistent performance and is the most reliable, followed by QUAC and FLAASH. Pansharpening improved overall accuracy and GS performed better than HCS. The study reports robust segmentation parameters that may be transferable to other VHR-based glacier surface facies mapping applications. The rule sets are adjusted across the processing schemes to adjust to the change in spectral characteristics introduced by the varying routines. The results indicate that GEOBIA for glacier surface facies mapping may be less prone to the differences in spectral signatures introduced by different atmospheric corrections but may respond well to increasing spatial resolution. The study highlighted the role of spatial attributes for mapping fine features, and in combination with appropriate spectral features may enhance thematic classification.

TI  - Imaging Cancer in Pregnancy
T2  - RADIOGRAPHICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Pregnancy-associated cancer (PAC) is defined as cancer that is detected during pregnancy and up to 1 year postpartum. Although rare (& SIM;1:1000 pregnancies), PAC is increasing owing to postponed childbearing and advanced maternal age at conception. Cancer -related symptoms masked by physiologic gestational changes may delay diagnosis. Imaging, clinical management, and treatment require a carefully choreographed multidisciplinary team approach. The risk-benefit of every imaging modality, the strategies to balance the safety of mother and fetus, and the support of the patient and family at every step are crucial. US and MRI are preferred imaging modalities that lack ionizing radiation. Radiation dose concerns should be addressed, noting that most imaging examinations (including mammography, radiography, CT, and technetium 99m-labeled sulfur colloid sentinel lymph node staging) are performed at radiation levels below thresholds at which deterministic side effects are seen. Dose estimates should be provided after each examination. The use of iodinated intravenous contrast material is safe during pregnancy, but gadolinium-based contrast material should be avoided. Accurate diagnosis and staging combined with gestational age affect decisions about surgery and chemotherapy. Whole-body MRI with diffusion-weighted sequences is ideal to screen for primary and metastatic sites, determine disease stage, identify biopsy targets, and guide further cancer site-specific imaging. The authors provide an update of the imaging triage, safety considerations, cancer-specific imaging, and treatment options for cancer in pregnancy.

TI  - Large-Scale Extraction and Mapping of Small Surface Water Bodies Based on Very High-Spatial-Resolution Satellite Images: A Case Study in Beijing, China
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface water is a crucial resource and environmental element for human survival and ecosystem stability; therefore, accurate information on the distribution of surface water bodies is essential. Extracting this information on a large scale is commonly implemented using moderate- and low-resolution satellite images. However, the detection and analysis of more detailed surface water structures and small water bodies necessitate the use of very high-resolution (VHR) satellite images. The large-scale application of VHR images for water extraction requires convenient and accurate methods. In this paper, a method combining a pixel-level water index and image object detection is proposed. The method was tested using 2018/2019 multispectral 4-m resolution images obtained from the Chinese satellite Gaofen-2 across Beijing, China. Results show that the automatic extraction of water body information over large areas using the proposed method and VHR images is feasible. Kappa coefficient and overall accuracy of 0.96 and 99.8% after post-classification improvement were obtained for testing images inside the Beijing area. The Beijing water body dataset obtained included a total of 489.53 km(2) of surface water in 2018/2019, 108.01 km(2) of which were ponds with an area smaller than 2 km(2). This study can be applied for water body extraction and mapping in other large regions and provides a reference for other methods for using VHR images to extract water body information on a large scale.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In 1999, the Yellow River Basin (YRB) launched the Grain for Green Program (GGP), which has had a huge impact on the Yellow River Basin vegetation. Research regarding the causes of vegetation changes can provide beneficial information for the management and construction of the ecological environment in the Yellow River Basin. In this study, after reconstructing the relationship between vegetation and climate change under natural conditions, topographic factors were introduced to understand vegetation change in the Yellow River Basin before and after the initiation of the Grain for Green Program, and the contribution rates of the driving factors of change were analyzed. Results show that human activities have had a great impact on the vegetation cover in the Yellow River Basin. We found that after the start of the Grain for Green Program, the vegetation recovery rate was more than six times (slope = 0.0067) that before its start (slope = 0.0011); high NDVI levels moved to lower altitudes, while low NDVI levels moved to high altitudes; and most vegetation types turned to gentle slopes. Human activities and climate change are the dominant factors influencing vegetation coverage, and the contribution rate of human activities had reached 59.3% after 2000, with a tendency to gradually dominate.

TI  - Integrating spaceborne LiDAR and Sentinel-2 images to estimate forest aboveground biomass in Northern China
T2  - CARBON BALANCE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Fast and accurate forest aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation and mapping is the basic work of forest management and ecosystem dynamic investigation, which is of great significance to evaluate forest quality, resource assessment, and carbon cycle and management. The Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2), as one of the latest launched spaceborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors, can penetrate the forest canopy and has the potential to obtain accurate forest vertical structure parameters on a large scale. However, the along-track segments of canopy height provided by ICESat-2 cannot be used to obtain comprehensive AGB spatial distribution. To make up for the deficiency of spaceborne LiDAR, the Sentinel-2 images provided by google earth engine (GEE) were used as the medium to integrate with ICESat-2 for continuous AGB mapping in our study. Ensemble learning can summarize the advantages of estimation models and achieve better estimation results. A stacking algorithm consisting of four non-parametric base models which are the backpropagation (BP) neural network, k-nearest neighbor (kNN), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF) was proposed for AGB modeling and estimating in Saihanba forest farm, northern China. Results The results show that stacking achieved the best AGB estimation accuracy among the models, with an R-2 of 0.71 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 45.67 Mg/ha. The stacking resulted in the lowest estimation error with the decreases of RMSE by 22.6%, 27.7%, 23.4%, and 19.0% compared with those from the BP, kNN, SVM, and RF, respectively. Conclusion Compared with using Sentinel-2 alone, the estimation errors of all models have been significantly reduced after adding the LiDAR variables of ICESat-2 in AGB estimation. The research demonstrated that ICESat-2 has the potential to improve the accuracy of AGB estimation and provides a reference for dynamic forest resources management and monitoring.

TI  - Eco-Hydrological Response of Water Conveyance in the Mainstream of the Tarim River, China
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Desert riparian vegetation forms an ecological corridor in extremely arid environments, and ecological water conveyance is an important measure of vegetation restoration and biodiversity conservation in desert riparian zones. Studying the responses of vegetation to ecological water conveyance and changes in this process in arid desert riparian zones and assessing the comprehensive benefits of ecological water conveyance are highly significant for ecological conservation and restoration in addition to the formulation of water transfer policies. Previous studies mainly used a single indicator to evaluate the ecological restoration of the mainstream Tarim River in Northwest China; thus, systematic and comprehensive assessments based on multiple indicators have not been conducted. In the present study, remote sensing data and field surveys were used to analyze the ecological restoration status of the Tarim River during 2015-2021 in terms of hydrological responses, vegetation responses, and ecological water conveyance benefits. The results showed that groundwater levels and soil moisture in the mainstream area of the Tarim River increased significantly from 2015 to 2021. The amount of groundwater storage also increased. Ecological water conveyance has created good hydrological conditions for groundwater recharge and ecological restoration on both sides of the mainstream area of the Tarim River. Desert forest ecosystems, mainly comprising Populus euphratica and Tamarix ramosissima, have been saved and rejuvenated in water conveyance areas. After ecological water conveyance, the Simpson and Shannon-Wiener indices increased significantly, but the diversity level began to decline and then stabilize with the increase in water conveyance frequency. The overall habitat status improved and the quality of the ecological environment below the Wusiman section of the middle reaches of the Tarim River improved significantly.

TI  - Trends in direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) prescribing in English primary care (2014-2019)
T2  - HEART
M3  - Article
AB  - Background In England, most prescribing of direct-acting oral anticoagulants for atrial fibrillation (AF) is in primary care. However, there remain gaps in our understanding of dosage and disparities in use. We aimed to describe trends in direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) prescribing, including dose reduction in people with renal impairment and other criteria, and adherence. Methods Using English primary care sentinel network data from 2014 to 2019, we assessed appropriate DOAC dose adjustment with creatinine clearance (CrCl). Our primary care sentinel cohort was a subset of 722 general practices, with 6.46 million currently registered patients at the time of this study. Results Of 6 464 129 people in the cohort, 2.3% were aged >= 18 years with a diagnosis of AF, and 30.8% of these were prescribed vitamin K antagonist and 69.1% DOACs. Appropriate DOAC prescribing following CrCl measures improved between 2014 and 2019; dabigatran from 21.3% (95% CI 15.1% to 28.8%) to 48.7% (95% CI 45.0% to 52.4%); rivaroxaban from 22.1% (95% CI 16.7% to 28.4%) to 49.9% (95% CI 48.5% to 53.3%); edoxaban from 10.0% (95% CI 0.3% to 44.5%) in 2016 to 57.6% (95% CI 54.5% to 60.7%) in 2019; apixaban from 30.8% (95% CI 9.1% to 61.4%) in 2015 to 60.5% (95% CI 57.8% to 63.2%) in 2019. Adherence was highest for factor Xa inhibitors, increasing from 50.1% (95% CI 47.7% to 52.4%) in 2014 to 57.8% (95% CI 57.4% to 58.2%) in 2019. Asian and black/mixed ethnicity was associated with non-adherence (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.56 to 2.09) as was male gender (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.22), higher socioeconomic status (OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.52 to 1.68), being an ex-smoker (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.19) and hypertension (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.17). Conclusions The volume and quality of DOAC prescribing has increased yearly. Future interventions to augment quality of anticoagulant management should target disparities in adherence.

TI  - Monitoring of Air Pollution by Remote Sensing in Lanzhou City from 2010 to 2019
T2  - WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on satellite remote sensing data acquired by the ozone monitoring instrument (OMI), this study used pixel space analysis, a coefficient of variation, stability analysis, and an atmospheric transmission model to determine the concentration of tropospheric ozone (O-3), NO2, HCHO, and SO2 columns in Lanzhou from 2010 to 2019. A series of analyses were carried out on the temporal and spatial distribution of concentration, influencing factors and atmospheric transmission path. The results show that the air pollutants in this area present multi-dimensional characteristics and have a complex spatial distribution. In terms of inter-annual changes, in addition to the increase in the concentration of the HCHO column, the ozone, NO2, and SO2 column concentrations have all decreased over time. In terms of monthly average changes, these four pollutants reached their maximum values in April, December, June, and January, respectively. These four types of pollution had a strong spatial correlation, among which HCHO and SO2 had a significant positive correlation, with a correlation coefficient of 0.76. Many factors affect the atmospheric pollutant in Lanzhou. Among them, pollutants are closely related to urbanization and to the activities of coal-burning industries. Moreover, temperature, precipitation, and sunshine also have certain effects on air quality. The proliferation of pollutants in Gansu Province was one of the sources of pollutants in Lanzhou, while long-distance transportation in the atmosphere from outside the province (Qinghai, Sichuan, and Shaanxi) also exacerbated the pollution in Lanzhou.

TI  - On the uncertainty associated with detecting global and local mean sea level drifts on Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B altimetry missions
T2  - OCEAN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - An instrumental drift in the point target response (PTR) parameters has been detected on the Copernicus Sentinel-3A altimetry mission. It will affect the accuracy of sea level sensing, which could result in errors in sea level change estimates of a few tenths of a millimeter per year. In order to accurately evaluate this drift, a method for detecting global and regional mean sea level relative drifts between two altimetry missions is implemented. Associated uncertainties are also accurately calculated thanks to a detailed error budget analysis. A drift on both Sentinel-3A (S3A) and Sentinel-3B (S3B) global mean sea level (GMSL) is detected with values significantly higher than expected. For S3A, the relative GMSL drift detected is 1 0 mm yr(-1) with Jason-3 and 1.3 mm yr(-1) with SARAL/AltiKa. For S3B, the relative GMSL drift detected is -3 4 mm yr(-1) with Jason-3 and -2.2 mm yr(-1) with SARAL/AltiKa. The drift detected at global level does not show detectable regional variations above the uncertainty level of the proposed method. The investigations led by the altimeter experts can now explain the origin of this drift for S3A and S3B. The ability of the implemented method to detect a sea level drift with respect to the length of the common period is also analyzed. We find that the minimum detectable sea level drift over a 5-year period is 0.3 mm yr(-1) at the global scale and 1 5 mm yr(-1) at the 2400 km regional scale. However, these levels of uncertainty do not meet the sea level stability requirements for climate change studies.

TI  - Monitoring Land Use/Cover Changes by Using Multi-Temporal Remote Sensing for Urban Hydrological Assessment: A Case Study in Beijing, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the change in hydrological response due to urban dynamics is important for better flood preparedness and future sustainable urban planning. This study investigated the influence of urban land cover change on spatiotemporal changes in flood peak discharge and flood volume within a rapidly urbanizing catchment located in Beijing, China. We used Landsat satellite data ranging from 1986 to 2017 to monitor and quantify urban growth. Moreover, the Hydrological Modeling System (HEC-HMS) coupled with meteorological data was utilized to examine the impact of urban growth on hydrological responses. The results revealed that major changes in land use/cover (LULC) were detected in the urban landscape, which increased from 25.22% to 65.48% of the total catchment area, while agricultural land decreased from 64.85% to 25.28% during 1986-2017. The flood peak discharge and flood volume average of the three rainstorms events reached 7.02% and 11.93%, respectively. Furthermore, the changes in flood peak discharge and flood volume were more obvious at the sub-catchment scale. These findings indicate that urban growth enhanced the possible flooding risk in the study catchment. This study improves the understanding of the isolated impacts of urbanization on flooding and provides essential information for sustainable urban planning.

TI  - Urban Landscape Fragmentation as an Indicator of Urban Expansion Using Sentinel-2 Imageries
T2  - CIVIL ENGINEERING JOURNAL-TEHRAN
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization in some cities has led to the emergence of numerous subsidiary settlements around their primary cities. Due to this rapid urbanization and growth, there is a great demand for urban land, mostly for commercial, industrial, and residential uses. Urban green spaces and vegetation are at risk due to a large amount of urban land, as seen by a decline in connectivity and increased fragmentation, especially due to land conversion. However, the identification of the spatial and momentary variability in the clustering and fragmentation of vegetation patterns in urban settings has not made full use of local indicators of spatial distribution measurements, such as Baqubah, a city in Iraq. Since it is essential to measure the degree of fragmentation and evaluate urban expansion trajectories consistently, this study proposes a new approach to assessing the anticipated direction of urban extension, using the fragmentation indicator of built-up patterns in urban areas. Sentinel-2 data was used to map the fragmented urban centres and their future extent in the city at a single time point. The proposed method employs indices to capture the initial distribution of spatial patterns of vegetation cover and built-up areas. The main extracted land cover classes, landscape fragmentation performance, and surface density analysis were accomplished in ArcGIS. The results indicate that the entire built-up area in Baqubah has a high degree of fragmentation at 75%, and about 23% of the open space within the urban extent of the city. Two predicted trajectories of urban expansion were also revealed: one may follow the external road direction, while the other is multi-directional, commencing from the edges of the built-up area. The study concludes that the new method is useful for comprehending and assessing urban landscape fragmentation, as well as anticipating its path. This integrated approach to remote sensing and GIS can sufficiently and effectively determine priority urban regions for successful planning and management. In addition, our study's findings highlight the potential of the suggested strategy as a useful spatially explicit method for determining the spatial clustering and fragmentation of urban landscape patterns.

TI  - Current Approaches to the Management of Patients with Endometrial Cancer
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Simple Summary New data, the development of new methods of treatment and management and the rising incidence of endometrial cancer require constant reviewing, in order to inform healthcare professionals about the current approaches to endometrial cancer. This review aims to present old, new and emerging perspectives in the management of endometrial cancer and evaluate the existing therapeutic strategies, by assessing the different surgical routes, the position of adjuvant therapies in the treatment of endometrial cancer and the implementation of SLNB. Upon reviewing literature data, it became clear that minimally invasive surgery is becoming gradually the preferred route of surgery, whereas SLNB is gaining more ground and could yield important information about the management needed in low-risk and high-risk endometrial cancer. The incidence of endometrial cancer (EC) is rising and healthcare professionals need to be informed about the latest data on the constant developments in the field of its management. With particular interest in the classification and management of EC, we surveyed current literature, national and international data, and guidelines, as well as the latest studies to present the most recent data regarding the management of EC. It became evident that despite the consensus on low-risk EC, there are still controversies surrounding the management of high-risk EC, especially regarding the role of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). Our aim is to present the old and new perspectives in the management of EC, the different available surgical routes, the possible desire for fertility preservation, the role of adjuvant therapies and the focus on the advantages and the limitations of the implementation of SLNB in therapeutic strategies. It became evident throughout our search and based on literature data that minimally invasive surgery (MIS) leads to satisfying outcomes, thus becoming gradually the preferred route of surgery, while SLNB could provide essential information and guidance about the overall management needed in cases of both low-risk and high-risk EC.

T2  - VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY- REGIONAL STUDIES AND REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Dogs are important sentinels for the surveillance of some zoonotic diseases including human leishmaniasis. To obtain information on the role of dogs in the epidemiology of leishmaniasis in Nigeria, 98 sera and 204 DNA samples obtained from dogs were screened for anti-leishmania antibodies and DNA of Leishmania spp. using the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and PCR, respectively. Initially, three out of the 98 sera samples had ELISA borderline optical density (OD) values and were retested. Two out of the three samples turned out to be negative while one sample gave yet a borderline OD value on a retest. A real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting the 120-bp fragment of the minicircle kDNA of Leishmania spp. run on DNA extracted from EDTA preserved blood of the borderline positive serum failed to amplify the 120-bp sequence of Leishmania spp. In the second phase of the study, 204 DNA from dog blood samples were subjected to conventional PCR targeting the 300-350 bp of the internal transcribe spacer region 1 (ITS1) of Leishmania spp. None of the samples could be amplified (n = 204, 0%). Our study suggests that L. infantum is not prevalence in Jos, Plateau State, Nigeria and this should be confirmed using a larger sample of local dogs tested using PCR methods in lymphoid tissue samples.

TI  - Understanding the Linkage between Urban Growth and Land Surface Temperature-A Case Study of Bangalore City, India
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Planning for a sustainable future involves understanding the past and present problems associated with urban centers. Rapid urbanization has caused significant adverse impacts on the environment and natural resources. In cities, one such impact is the unsettling urban growth, resulting in the urban heat island (UHI) effect, which causes considerable positive feedback in the climate system. It can be assessed by investigating the relationships between urban Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) changes and changes in land surface temperature. This study links the urban transformations in Bangalore, India, between 2001 and 2021, with the city's changing average land surface temperatures. LULC classification was performed on Landsat satellite images for the years 2001, 2011, and 2021, using the support vector machine (SVM) classification algorithm. LULC change analysis revealed an increase in the built-up area coinciding with a decreasing trend of water bodies, vegetation, and the area under the others (wasteland/open land/barren land) category. The results show that built-up increased from 462.49 km(2) to 867.73 km(2), vegetation decreased from 799.4 km(2) to 485.72 km(2), and waterbody declined from 34.28 km(2) to 24.69 km(2) in 20 years. The impact of urbanization was evident in Bangalore's land temperature changes between 2001 and 2021, showing the average temperature increased by 0.34 degrees C per year between the highest UHI events, contrary to 0.14 degrees C per year in non-urbanized areas. It is hoped that the results of this study can help the urban planners of Bangalore city identify critical areas where improvement in urban dwelling could be planned sustainably according to the global smart cities concept, an offshoot concept of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG)-11.

TI  - Water Levels in the Major Reservoirs of the Nile River Basin-A Comparison of SENTINEL with Satellite Altimetry Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the increasing number of reservoirs on the Nile River Basin, it has become important to understand the reservoir operations in the basin for coordinated water management among the various countries. With the lack of a proper framework for data sharing amongst the Nile basin countries, satellite remote sensing provides a simple transparent way to continuously monitor the changes taking place in reservoirs in all regions of the Nile River Basin. This paper presents a comparison between Sentinel-1- and Sentinel-2-derived reservoir water levels and the altimetry-based water level from G-REALM (Global Reservoirs and Lakes Monitor) for three major reservoirs downstream of the Millennium Reservoir impounded by the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) on the Nile River for the period of 2014-2021. Water surface extents were derived from Sentinel-1 using dynamic thresholds and from Sentinel-2 with the use of the NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index). The water levels were estimated using a DEM-based contour matching technique. For Roseires Reservoir, the water levels from Sentinel agreed well with those from G-REALM (RMSE = 0.92 m; R-2 = 0.82). For Lake Nasser, the water levels also agreed well (RMSE = 0.72 m; R-2 = 0.85). For Lake Merowe, there was a significant mismatch in the derived water levels, mostly due to a lack of sufficient data from both sources. Overall, satellite imagery from Sentinel provides a very good alternative to altimetry-based water levels for the Nile River Basin.

TI  - Retrieved XCO<sub>2</sub> Accuracy Improvement by Reducing Aerosol-Induced Bias for China's Future High-Precision Greenhouse Gases Monitoring Satellite Mission
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - China is developing the High-precision Greenhouse gases Monitoring Satellite (HGMS), carrying a high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL) for aerosol vertical profiles and imaging grating spectrometers for CO2 measurements at the same time. By providing simultaneous evaluation of the aerosol scattering effect, HGMS would reduce the bias of the XCO2 retrievals from the passive sensor. In this work, we propose a method to reduce aerosol-induced bias in XCO2 retrievals for the future HGMS mission based on the correlation analysis among simulated radiance, XCO2 bias, and aerosol optical depth (AOD) ratio. We exercise the method with the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) XCO2 retrievals and AOD ratio inferred from the OCO-2 O-2 A-band aerosol parameters at 755 nm and the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) AOD at 532 nm at several Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) sites in Europe. The results showed that 80% of measurements from OCO-2 were improved, and data from six TCCON sites show an average of 2.6 ppm reduction in mean bias and a 68% improvement in accuracy. We demonstrate the advantage of fused active-passive observation of the HGMS for more accurate global XCO2 measurements in the future.

TI  - Large-Scale Monitoring of Glacier Surges by Integrating High-Temporal- and -Spatial-Resolution Satellite Observations: A Case Study in the Karakoram
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier surges have been increasingly reported from the mountain and high-latitude cryosphere. They represent active glaciological processes that affect the evolution of natural landscapes, and they possibly lead to catastrophic consequences, such as ice collapse, which threatens the downstream communities. Identifying and monitoring surge-type glaciers has been challenging due to the irregularity of the behavior and limitations on the spatiotemporal coverage of remote-sensing observations. With a focus on the Karakoram region, with concentrated surge-type glaciers, we present a new method to efficiently detect glacier-surging activities by integrating the high temporal resolution of MODIS imagery and the long-term archived medium spatial resolution of Landsat imagery. This method first detects the location and initial time of glacier surges by trend analysis (trend and breakpoint) from MODIS data, which is implemented by the Breaks for Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST) tool. The initial location and time information is then validated with the detailed surging features, such as the terminus-position changes from Landsat, and the thickness-change patterns from surface-elevation-change maps. Our method identified 74 surging events during 2000-2020 in the Karakoram, including three tributary-glacier surges, and seven newly detected surge-type glaciers. The surge-type glaciers tend to have longer lengths and smaller mean slopes compared with nonsurge-type glaciers. A comparison with previous studies demonstrated the method efficiency for detecting the surging of large-scale and mesoscale glaciers, with limitations on small and narrow glaciers due to the spatial-resolution limitation of MODIS images. For the 38 surge-type nondebris-covered glaciers, we provide details of the surging, which depict the high variability (heavy-tailed distribution) in the surging parameters in the region, and the concentration of the surge initiation during 2008-2010 and 2013-2015. The updated glacier-surging information solidifies the basis for a further investigation of the surging processes at polythermal glaciers, and for an improved assessment of the glacier-mass balance and monitoring of glacier hazards.

TI  - Development of a Roadmap for the Antimicrobial Usage Monitoring System for Medical Institutions in Korea: a Delphi Study
T2  - INFECTION AND CHEMOTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: It is necessary to develop a roadmap for antimicrobial usage monitoring in order to perform monitoring of antimicrobial use at the national level properly. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a roadmap for establishing surveillance and monitoring of antimicrobial use in medical institutions at the national level. Materials and Methods: A modified Delphi study was conducted, including 3 rounds of an online survey and a virtual meeting with 16 expert panels. The survey items were developed based on a literature review of the surveillance systems for antimicrobial use in 12 countries and interviews with experts. The questionnaire was designed to include both the surveillance and benchmarking systems.Results: Regarding the scope of target institutions to be included in the surveillance system, medical institutions for sentinel surveillance had the highest proportion of agreement among the panels (75.0%, 9/12). For the benchmarking system, "tertiary-and secondary -care hospitals" were accepted as the scope of target institutions at the current moment. Furthermore, the National Health Insurance claims and prescription data of individual hospitals were considered appropriate data sources for the surveillance system. As for the measures to promote the participation of hospitals in the benchmarking system, "compensation through the establishment of antimicrobial management fees" and "set the participation in the program as a quality evaluation or accreditation index for hospital evaluation" were accepted.Conclusion: This study provides a roadmap for establishing an antimicrobial use monitoring and benchmarking system for medical institutions at a national level in Korea.

TI  - Group Behavior and Concrete Breakout Strength of 16 mm Deformed Wire Anchors in Tension br
T2  - ACI STRUCTURAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to lower carbon equivalents than those in steel reinforcing bars, deformed wires are easy to weld. Embedment steel plates welded with a straight deformed wire anchor (DWA) are commonly used to connect steel structural members to concrete members. Because there is no anchor plate at the end of the DWA, the failures of concrete breakout and side-face blowout usually caused by the anchor plate have not been considered. Only the development length of deformed bars governs the anchorage design of the DWA. However, a concrete breakout is thought to be a possible failure. To investigate the failure modes and anchorage strength of DWAs under tension, 13 pullout tests of DWAs embedded in concrete of fck = 42 MPa (6000 psi) were performed. In each specimen, 25 DWAs of fy = 515 MPa (75 ksi) were placed in a 5 x 5 form. The experimental variables included the embedment depth and spacing of the DWAs and the absence of cracking across the DWAs. Failure modes and maximum loads were investigated and compared to predictions by the concrete capacity design (CCD) method (Fuchs et al. 1995). All specimens failed due to concrete breakout. Evaluating the experimental results with a 5% fractile safety factor strength of the DWAs is equivalent to the strength of a headed anchor and can be safely designed according to Chapter 17 of ACI 318-19.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy in high-risk endometrial cancer: performance, outcomes, and future avenues
T2  - OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Endometrial cancer is the second most common gynecological malignancy worldwide, with an overall favorable prognosis. However, a subgroup of patients has a high risk of recurrence and poor prognosis. This review summarizes recently published articles that examined sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy in patients with high-risk endometrial cancer. We focused on the performance and outcomes of SLN biopsy, and examined potential methods for improving the management of this high-risk subset. Few studies have examined the long-term outcomes of SLN in patients with high-risk endometrial cancer. Thus, we reviewed recently published retrospective studies that have adopted statistical techniques, such as inverse probability weighting or propensity score matching, to examine the outcome of SLN biopsy compared to conventional lymphadenectomy. Potential avenues for future research to fine-tune decision making for this patient subgroup were also discussed.

TI  - Investigation of Cultural-Environmental Relationships for an Alternative Environmental Management Approach Using Planet Smallsat Constellations and Questionnaire Datasets
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The values (i.e., importance) that humans place on ecosystems are critical for sustainable socioecological management. Recently, the value pluralism approach with instrumental, intrinsic, and relational values using multiple disciplines that integrate qualitative and quantitative methodologies has been encouraged. However, these values have received little attention in environmental management. This study explored the values placed on cultural practices among groups experiencing different land cover transformations (LCTs) under the rapid shrinkage of the Limboto Lake, Gorontalo Province, Indonesia, using questionnaires and time-series Landsat and PlanetScope smallsat constellations (SSCs). The time series of LCTs and questionnaire data were computed, visualized, and analyzed statistically using the chi-square test for comparing the two village groups. Results show SSCs enabled a detailed analysis due to high spatiotemporal resolutions in tropical regions. This observation would help in monitoring natural disasters (floods) caused by the decreased lake's water storing capacity, agricultural damage, locality safety, and environmental protection in shorter cycles. Furthermore, we found that relational values originating from traditional beliefs and practices were the domain values in the land steady-type villages. Hence, integrating the cultural-environmental values of localities with prior spatiotemporal analysis into environmental management policy and implementation processes would be a high-potential alternative for environmental conservation.

TI  - A Combined Method for Preparation of Landslide Susceptibility Map in Izmir (Turkiye)
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslide susceptibility maps (LSMs) have been used frequently by researchers for many years in prediction of the occurrence of landslides. Since many landslides have occurred there in the past, Izmir, which is the third largest city of Turkiye, was selected for landslide susceptibility assessment using geographical information systems (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) techniques. The aim of this study is to create a better landslide susceptibility map (LSM) for the Izmir metropolitan area and its surroundings by minimizing the shortcomings of some of the commonly used methods. For this purpose, four different LSMs were prepared using the logistic regression (LR), analytical hierarchy process (AHP), frequency ratio (FR) and index of entropy (IOE) methods with susceptibility classes ranging from extremely low to extremely high. These four maps were then overlaid. The highest susceptibility class was chosen for each pixel to form a combined landslide susceptibility map (CLSM). The final CLSM is a thematic map presenting landslide susceptibility using five different classes. The geo-environmental factors selected for use in this analysis were slope angle, slope aspect, lithology, slope curvature, elevation, density of discontinuity, stream power index (SPI), land use and distance from stream. Finally, the areas under receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were employed to compare the predictive capability of the five models used. Overall, the Combined Method (CM) (AUC = 0.887) performed very well for landslide susceptibility assessment. Out of all the models, the IOE model (AUC = 0.841) had a slightly lower predictive capability than the CM model, and AHP (AUC = 0.816) was better than FR (AUC = 0.738) and LR (AUC = 0.727). It was observed that, compared to rural areas, residential areas of Izmir city are particularly susceptible to landslides.

TI  - Mapping Secondary Vegetation of a Region of Deforestation Hotspot in the Brazilian Amazon: Performance Analysis of C- and L-Band SAR Data Acquired in the Rainy Season
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The re-suppression of secondary vegetation (SV) in the Brazilian Amazon for agriculture or land speculation occurs mostly in the rainy season. The use of optical images to monitor such re-suppression during the rainy season is limited because of the persistent cloud cover. This study aimed to evaluate the potential of C- and L-band SAR data acquired in the rainy season to discriminate SV in an area of new hotspot of deforestation in the municipality of Colniza, northwestern of Mato Grosso State, Brazil. This is the first time that the potential of dual-frequency SAR data was analyzed to discriminate SV, with an emphasis on data acquired during the rainy season. The L-band ALOS/PALSAR-2 and the C-band Sentinel-1 data acquired in March 2018 were processed to obtain backscattering coefficients and nine textural attributes were derived from the gray level co-occurrence matrix method (GLCM). Then, we classified the images based on the non-parametric Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. The use of SAR textural attributes improved the discrimination capability of different LULC classes found in the study area. The results showed the best performance of ALOS/PALSAR-2 data classified by the RF algorithm to discriminate the following representative land use and land cover classes of the study area: primary forest, secondary forest, shrubby pasture, clean pasture, and bare soil, with an overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of 84% and 0.78, respectively. The RF outperformed the SVM classifier to discriminate these five LULC classes in 14% of overall accuracy for both ALOS-2 and Sentinel-1 data sets. This study also showed that the textural attributes derived from the GLCM method are highly sensitive to the moving window size to be applied to the GLCM method. The results of this study can assist the future development of an operation system based on dual-frequency SAR data to monitor re-suppression of SV in the Brazilian Amazon or in other tropical rainforests.

TI  - Towards Forecasting Future Snow Cover Dynamics in the European Alps-The Potential of Long Optical Remote-Sensing Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow is a vital environmental parameter and dynamically responsive to climate change, particularly in mountainous regions. Snow cover can be monitored at variable spatial scales using Earth Observation (EO) data. Long-lasting remote sensing missions enable the generation of multi-decadal time series and thus the detection of long-term trends. However, there have been few attempts to use these to model future snow cover dynamics. In this study, we, therefore, explore the potential of such time series to forecast the Snow Line Elevation (SLE) in the European Alps. We generate monthly SLE time series from the entire Landsat archive (1985-2021) in 43 Alpine catchments. Positive long-term SLE change rates are detected, with the highest rates (5-8 m/y) in the Western and Central Alps. We utilize this SLE dataset to implement and evaluate seven uni-variate time series modeling and forecasting approaches. The best results were achieved by Random Forests, with a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of 0.79 and a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 258 m, Telescope (0.76, 268 m), and seasonal ARIMA (0.75, 270 m). Since the model performance varies strongly with the input data, we developed a combined forecast based on the best-performing methods in each catchment. This approach was then used to forecast the SLE for the years 2022-2029. In the majority of the catchments, the shift of the forecast median SLE level retained the sign of the long-term trend. In cases where a deviating SLE dynamic is forecast, a discussion based on the unique properties of the catchment and past SLE dynamics is required. In the future, we expect major improvements in our SLE forecasting efforts by including external predictor variables in a multi-variate modeling approach.

T2  - GEOGRAPHICA PANNONICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural use of sewage sludge is one of the means of sustainable environmental management. In order to monitor the short-term effects of sludge disposal a multi-year, high-resolution data collection was planned on arable land in south-eastern Hungary. Data acquisition was applied at the highest temporal and spatial resolution using Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope satellite imagery observing the vegetation period based on vegetation indices (EVI, NDVI) from 2016 to 2021. There were statistical differences in the case of sunflower and maize biomass productions but the spatial and statistical deviations between the affected and non-affected areas of sludge disposal were generally not significant. The sensitivity of EVI in the dense vegetation period and its applicability might be emphasized in a comparative analysis.

TI  - Deep Learning on Synthetic Data Enables the Automatic Identification of Deficient Forested Windbreaks in the Paraguayan Chaco
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Paraguayan Chaco is one of the most rapidly deforested areas in Latin America, mainly due to cattle ranching. Continuously forested windbreaks between agricultural areas and forest patches within these areas are mandatory to minimise the impact that the legally permitted logging has on the ecosystem. Due to the large area of the Paraguayan Chaco, comprehensive in situ monitoring of the integrity of these landscape elements is almost impossible. Satellite-based remote sensing offers excellent prerequisites for large-scale land cover analyses. However, traditional methods mostly focus on spectral and texture information while dismissing the geometric context of landscape features. Since the contextual information is very important for the identification of windbreak gaps and central forests, a deep learning-based detection of relevant landscape features in satellite imagery could solve the problem. However, deep learning methods require a large amount of labelled training data, which cannot be collected in sufficient quantity in the investigated area. This study presents a methodology to automatically classify gaps in windbreaks and central forest patches using a convolutional neural network (CNN) entirely trained on synthetic imagery. In a two-step approach, we first used a random forest (RF) classifier to derive a binary forest mask from Sentinel-1 and -2 images for the Paraguayan Chaco in 2020 with a spatial resolution of 10 m. We then trained a CNN on a synthetic data set consisting of purely artificial binary images to classify central forest patches and gaps in windbreaks in the forest mask. For both classes, the CNN achieved an F1 value of over 70%. The presented method is among the first to use synthetically generated training images and class labels to classify natural landscape elements in remote sensing imagery and therewith particularly contributes to the research on the detection of natural objects such as windbreaks.

TI  - Increasing Wind Speeds Fuel the Wider Spreading of Pollution Caused by Fires over the IGP Region during the Indian Post-Monsoon Season
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Every year, forest fires and harvest harnessing produce atmospheric pollution in October and November over the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP). The fire count data (MODIS) shows a decreasing/increasing trend of fire counts in all confidence ranges in October/November over Northern India. There is a widespread increase in fires with a confidence level above 60 to 80% over the whole Northern Indian region. The Aerosol Optical Index (AOD) also shows an increase with values > 0.7 over the northwestern and IGP regions. There have been some startling results over the lower IGP belt, where there has been increasing trend in AOD during October similar to 56% and during November, the increase was by a whopping similar to 116%. However, in November, a slight turning of the winds towards central India might be transporting the AOD towards the central Indian region. Hence, during November, it is inferred that due to the low wind speed over the lower IGP belt and increased fires, the AODs in the polluted air tend to hover for a long time. During recent years from 2010, the winds have become stronger, indicating more transport of AOD is occurring over the lower IGP belt as compared to previous years till 2009, especially in October.

TI  - Dislodged Experience as an Overcoming of Reason: Towards a Phenomenology of Beyng
T2  - RESEARCH IN PHENOMENOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Heidegger's Contributions to Philosophy approaches human transformation as an overcoming of Western metaphysics. The nature of this transformation does not imply a mere change of a worldview, an ethical or spiritual fulfillment, or even selftranscendence. Instead, Heidegger speaks about a dislodgement of human essence. In the article I address the notion of dislodgement as central for understanding the nature of the shift required for the human selfhood to be grounded in Da-sein. I stress the relation between dislodgement and an overcoming of reason as the basis of overcoming metaphysics. I then focus on the way dislodgement transforms the nature of experience, freeing it from the metaphysical constriction of a priority of beingness and the psychological subjectivity that accompanies it. I point out that such a dislodged experience transgresses the ontological-ontic distinction and thus offers a phenomenological basis for experiencing the truth of Beyng. I also suggest that the way to become prepared for such a full-fledged dislodgement is to be attentive to the moments in which our experience betrays its belonginess to Beyng.

TI  - Fairy-tale fantasy in Russian handwritten fiction of the late 17th - first third of the 18th centuries
T2  - SIBIRSKII FILOLOGICHESKII ZHURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper analyzes the changes in interpreting magic, fairy-tale fiction that occurred in translated and original stories of the late 17th - first third of the 18th centuries. A number of fiction works of this period show representations of magic closely linked to the Christian worldview, with some works appearing referring to magic and sorcery as a non-judgmental category. The first Russian translations of fairy tales by M.-C. d'Aulnoy's made in the Petrine era contributed to the appearance of pure genre fiction free from judgment. These were "The Tale of Florine" (1700 - late 1710s, "L'oiseau bleu") and "The History of Prince Adolf" (1720-1730s, L'Ile de la Felicite). A fairy was an entirely unfamiliar character to the Russian reader. In The Tale of Florine, the word "fee" was translated by "ega baba" ("yaga baba") commonly used to refer to women with demonic forces. Magical abilities were designated by "vorozhenie" (divination) and "yagina mudrost'" (yaga's wisdom). In the manuscripts of The History of Prince Adolf, fairies appear as "goddesses" and "gods", and magical abilities - "l'esprit de feerie" - as "divine spirit". When describing magical actions, Russian translators of French fairy tales use everyday vocabulary related to the sphere of folk magical beliefs or associated with the Russian folklore and book tradition. In the period under study, we observe the formation of the genre category of fairy-tale magic and a gradual replacement of the category of "miracle" by a genre-conditioned understanding of magic.

In this study, we developed an internet-based vector mosquito monitor, MS-300, and evaluated its efficiency for the capture of the important vector mosquitoes, Aedes albopictus and Culex quinquefasciatus, in laboratory and field trials.Methodology/Principal findingsThe linear sizes of adult Ae. albopictus and Cx. quinquefasciatus were measured and an infrared window was designed based on these data. A device to specifically attract these two species and automatically transmit the number of captured mosquitoes to the internet was developed. The efficiency of the device in capturing the two species was tested in laboratory, semi-field and open field trials. The efficiency results for MS-300 for catching and identifying Ae. albopictus in laboratory mosquito-net cages were 98.5% and 99.3%, and 95.8% and 98.6%, respectively, for Cx. quinquefasciatus. In a wire-gauze screened house in semi-field trials, the efficiencies of MS-300 baited with a lure in catching Ae. albopictus and Cx. quinquefasciatus were 54.2% and 51.3%, respectively, which were significantly higher than 4% and 4.2% without the lure. The real-time monitoring data revealed two daily activity peaks for Ae. albopictus (8:00-10:00 and 17:00-19:00), and one peak for Cx. quinquefasciatus (20:00-24:00). During a 98-day surveillance trial in the field, totals of 1,118 Ae. albopictus and 2,302 Cx. quinquefasciatus were captured by MS-300. There is a close correlation between the number of captured mosquitoes and the temperature in the field, and a positive correlation in the species composition of the captured samples among the mosquitoes using MS-300, BioGents Sentinel traps and human landing catches.Conclusions/SignificanceThe data support the conclusion that MS-300 can specifically and efficiently capture Ae. albopictus and Cx. quinquefasciatus, and monitor their density automatically in real-time. Therefore, MS-300 has potential for use as a surveillance tool for prevention and control of vector mosquitoes.

TI  - Remote Sensing Precursors Analysis for Giant Landslides
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Monitoring and early warning systems for landslides are urgently needed worldwide to effectively reduce the losses of life and property caused by these natural disasters. Detecting the precursors of giant landslides constitutes the premise of landslide monitoring and early warning, and remote sensing is a powerful means to achieve this goal. In this work, we aim to summarize the basic types and evolutionary principles of giant landslide precursors, describe the remote sensing methods capable of identifying those precursors, and present typical cases of related sliding. Based on a review of the literature and an analysis of remote sensing imagery, the three main types of remote sensing techniques for capturing the geomorphological, geotechnical, and geoenvironmental precursors of giant landslides are optical, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and thermal infrared methods, respectively. Time-series optical remote sensing data from medium-resolution satellites can be used to obtain abundant information on geomorphological changes, such as the extension of cracks and erosion ditches, and band algebraic analysis, image enhancement, and segmentation techniques are valuable for focusing on the locations of geomorphological landslide precursors. SAR sensors have the ability to monitor the slight slope deformation caused by unfavorable geological structures and can provide precursor information on imminent failure several days before a landslide; furthermore, persistent scatterer interferometric SAR has significant advantages in large-scale surface displacement monitoring. Thermal infrared imagery can identify landslide precursors by monitoring geoenvironmental information, especially in permafrost regions where glaciers are widely distributed; the reason may be that freeze-thaw cycles and snowmelt caused by increased temperatures affect the stability of the surface. Optical, SAR, and thermal remote sensing all exhibit unique advantages and play an essential role in the identification of giant landslide precursors. The combined application of these three remote sensing technologies to obtain the synthetic geomorphological, geotechnical, and geoenvironmental precursors of giant landslides would greatly promote the development of landslide early warning systems.

TI  - Gap Filling Cloudy Sentinel-2 NDVI and NDWI Pixels with Multi-Frequency Denoised C-Band and L-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Texture, and Shallow Learning Techniques
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multispectral imagery provides unprecedented information on Earth system processes: however, data gaps due to clouds and shadows are a major limitation. Normalized-Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized-Difference Water Index (NDWI) are two spectral indexes employed for monitoring vegetation phenology, land-cover change and more. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) with its cloud-penetrating abilities can fill data gaps using coincident imagery. In this study, we evaluated C-band Sentinel-1, L-band Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle SAR (UAVSAR) and texture for gap filling using efficient machine learning regression algorithms across three seasons. Multiple models were evaluated including Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees and an ensemble of models. The Gap filling ability of SAR was evaluated with Sentinel-2 imagery from the same date, 3 days and 8 days later than both SAR sensors in September. Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery from winter and spring seasons were also evaluated. Because SAR imagery contains noise, we compared two robust de-noising methods and evaluated performance against a refined lee speckle filter. Mean Absolute Error (MAE) rates of the cloud gap-filling model were assessed across different dataset combinations and land covers. The results indicated de-noised Sentinel-1 SAR and UAVSAR with GLCM texture provided the highest predictive abilities with random forest R-2 = 0.91 (+/- 0.014), MAE = 0.078 (+/- 0.003) (NDWI) and R-2 = 0.868 (+/- 0.015), MAE = 0.094 (+/- 0.003) (NDVI) during September. The highest errors were observed across bare ground and forest, while the lowest errors were on herbaceous and woody wetland. Results on January and June imagery without UAVSAR were less strong at R-2 = 0.60 (+/- 0.036), MAE = 0.211 (+/- 0.005) (NDVI), R-2 = 0.61 (+/- 0.043), MAE = 0.209 (+/- 0.005) (NDWI) for January and R-2 = 0.72 (+/- 0.018), MAE = 0.142 (+/- 0.004) (NDVI), R-2 = 0.77 (+/- 0.022), MAE = 0.125 (+/- 0.004) (NDWI) for June. Ultimately, the results suggest de-noised C-band SAR with texture metrics can accurately predict NDVI and NDWI for gap-filling clouds during most seasons. These shallow machine learning models are rapidly trained and applied faster than intensive deep learning or time series methods.

TI  - ModelOps for enhanced decision-making and governance in emergency control rooms
T2  - Environment Systems & Decisions
M3  - Article
AB  - For mission critical (MC) applications such as bushfire emergency management systems (EMS), understanding the current situation as a disaster unfolds is critical to saving lives, infrastructure and the environment. Incident control-room operators manage complex information and systems, especially with the emergence of Big Data. They are increasingly making decisions supported by artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) tools for data analysis, prediction and decision-making. As the volume, speed and complexity of information increases due to more frequent fire events, greater availability of myriad IoT sensors, smart devices, satellite data and burgeoning use of social media, the advances in AI and ML that help to manage Big Data and support decision-making are increasingly perceived as "Black Box". This paper aims to scope the requirements for bushfire EMS to improve Big Data management and governance of AI/ML. An analysis of ModelOps technology, used increasingly in the commercial sector, is undertaken to determine what components might be fit-for-purpose. The result is a novel set of ModelOps features, EMS requirements and an EMS-ModelOps framework that resolves more than 75% of issues whilst being sufficiently generic to apply to other types of mission-critical applications.

TI  - Surface Deformation Mechanism Analysis in Shanghai Areas Based on TS-InSAR Technology
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To address the problem that surface deformation causes in urban areas by affecting urban security and threatening human life and property, this study first measured the surface deformation in Shanghai from 2016 to 2020 using the time series InSAR method. Then, the spatial-temporal distribution and evolution characteristics of deformation were investigated in detail. The deformation mechanism is explained by factors including groundwater and rainfall. By introducing the seasonal changes of tides and sediment accumulation, the reason for the uplift in the Shanghai area is further explained. Finally, the surface deformation of the reclamation area is detected further. Meanwhile, the spatial-temporal variation characteristics of the surface in the reclamation area are explored. Through time series InSAR technology, the results of surface deformation in Shanghai demonstrate the following: (1) The deformation in the study area is uneven in time, and the subsidence is especially apparent during the 2016-2017 period. The maximum cumulative subsidence amounts to -131.1 mm, and the PS points with subsidence rates greater than -5 mm/y occupy 41.36% of all the subsidence points. In addition, PS points with uplift rates greater than 5 mm/y account for 39.55% of all the uplift points. The overall spatial distribution in the Shanghai area is characterized by the uplift in the north and subsidence in the south, whereas the cumulative subsidence in the time series presents a slowing trend; (2) Surface subsidence and groundwater, rainfall, and urban development in the Shanghai area are correlated. Seasonal changes in tides contribute to surface uplift in coastal areas. Coastal sediment accumulation and soil changes also make direct contributions to the occurrence of surface uplift; (3) The deformation of the reclamation area and the completion time are correlated, and the subsidence points of the reclamation area are mainly concentrated on the surrounding dikes from 2016 to 2020. The cumulative subsidence of the two years from 2016 to 2017 is up to -102.2 mm. The results of this study systematically explore the spatial--temporal evolution and causes of surface deformation in Shanghai, providing scientific data which can support the development of Shanghai.

TI  - A Batch Pixel-Based Algorithm to Composite Landsat Time Series Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Compositing is a fundamental pre-processing for remote sensing images. Landsat series optical satellite images are influenced by cloud coverage, acquisition time, sensor types, and seasons, which make it difficult to obtain continuous cloud-free observations. It limits the potential use and analysis of time series images. Therefore, global change researchers urgently need to 'composite' multi-sensor and multi-temporal images. Many previous studies have used isolated pixel-based algorithms to composite Landsat images; however, this study is different and develops a batch pixel-based algorithm for composing continuous cloud-free Landsat images. The algorithm chooses the best scene as the reference image using the user-specified image ID or related parameters. Further, it accepts all valid pixels in the reference image as the main part of the result and develops a priority coefficient model. Development of this model is based on the criteria of five factors including cloud coverage, acquisition time, acquisition year, observation seasons, and sensor types to select substitutions for the missing pixels in batches and to merge them into the final composition. This proposed batch pixel-based algorithm may provide reasonable compositing results on the basis of the experimental test results of all Landsat 8 images in 2019 and the visualization results of 12 locations in 2020. In comparison with the isolated pixel-based algorithms, our algorithm eliminates band dispersion, requires fewer images, and enhances the composition's pixel concentration considerably. The algorithm provides a complete and practical framework for time series image processing for Landsat series satellites, and has the potential to be applied to other optical satellite images as well.

TI  - Exploring the Individualized Effect of Climatic Drivers on MODIS Net Primary Productivity through an Explainable Machine Learning Framework
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Along with the development of remote sensing technology, the spatial-temporal variability of vegetation productivity has been well observed. However, the drivers controlling the variation in vegetation under various climate gradients remain poorly understood. Identifying and quantifying the independent effects of driving factors on a natural process is challenging. In this study, we adopted a potent machine learning (ML) model and an ML interpretation technique with high fidelity to disentangle the effects of climatic variables on the long-term averaged net primary productivity (NPP) across the Amazon rainforests. Specifically, the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model was employed to model the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NPP data, and the Shapley addictive explanation (SHAP) method was introduced to account for nonlinear relationships between variables identified by the model. Results showed that the dominant driver of NPP across the Amazon forests varied in different regions, with temperature dominating the most considerable portion of the ecoregion with a high importance score. In addition, light augmentation, increased CO2 concentration, and decreased precipitation positively contributed to Amazonia NPP. The wind speed for most vegetated areas was under the optimum, which benefits NPP, while sustained high wind speed would bring substantial NPP loss. We also found a non-monotonic response of Amazonia NPP to VPD and attributed this relationship to the moisture load in Amazon forests. Our application of the explainable machine learning framework to identify the underlying physical mechanism behind NPP could be a reference for identifying relationships between components in natural processes.

TI  - Evaluation of Global Historical Cropland Datasets with Regional Historical Evidence and Remotely Sensed Satellite Data from the Xinjiang Area of China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global land use/cover change (LUCC) datasets are essential for quantitatively assessing the impacts of LUCC on global change, but many uncertainties in existing global datasets seriously hamper climate modeling. Evaluating the reliability of existing global LUCC datasets is a precondition for improved data quality. In this study, based on the regional historical document-based reconstructions, satellite-based data, and historical reclamation evidence for the Xinjiang area of China, the accuracy and rationality of cropland data for this area in the HYDE 3.2 and SAGE datasets were evaluated by utilizing comparative analysis regarding three aspects, namely the change tendency of the cropland area, the area of cropland, and the differences in spatial pattern. This study concluded that the amount of cropland in the Xinjiang area in the global and regional datasets shows both disparate trends and large differences in absolute values. Spatially, historical reclamation evidence indicated that agricultural cultivation in the Xinjiang area underwent expansion from south to north and from east to west over the past 300 years; however, the global datasets revealed that the cropland spatial patterns in the Xinjiang area in the historical period are similar to those in the current period. These differences are attributable to the uncertainties of the basic assumptions, per capita cropland area estimates, and reconstruction methods in the global datasets. The findings of the study highlight the necessity of regional studies on historical LUCC in the Xinjiang area.

TI  - Crop Monitoring Using Sentinel-2 and UAV Multispectral Imagery: A Comparison Case Study in Northeastern Germany
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring within-field crop variability at fine spatial and temporal resolution can assist farmers in making reliable decisions during their agricultural management; however, it traditionally involves a labor-intensive and time-consuming pointwise manual process. To the best of our knowledge, few studies conducted a comparison of Sentinel-2 with UAV data for crop monitoring in the context of precision agriculture. Therefore, prospects of crop monitoring for characterizing biophysical plant parameters and leaf nitrogen of wheat and barley crops were evaluated from a more practical viewpoint closer to agricultural routines. Multispectral UAV and Sentinel-2 imagery was collected over three dates in the season and compared with reference data collected at 20 sample points for plant leaf nitrogen (N), maximum plant height, mean plant height, leaf area index (LAI), and fresh biomass. Higher correlations of UAV data to the agronomic parameters were found on average than with Sentinel-2 data with a percentage increase of 6.3% for wheat and 22.2% for barley. In this regard, VIs calculated from spectral bands in the visible part performed worse for Sentinel-2 than for the UAV data. In addition, large-scale patterns, formed by the influence of an old riverbed on plant growth, were recognizable even in the Sentinel-2 imagery despite its much lower spatial resolution. Interestingly, also smaller features, such as the tramlines from controlled traffic farming (CTF), had an influence on the Sentinel-2 data and showed a systematic pattern that affected even semivariogram calculation. In conclusion, Sentinel-2 imagery is able to capture the same large-scale pattern as can be derived from the higher detailed UAV imagery; however, it is at the same time influenced by management-driven features such as tramlines, which cannot be accurately georeferenced. In consequence, agronomic parameters were better correlated with UAV than with Sentinel-2 data. Crop growers as well as data providers from remote sensing services may take advantage of this knowledge and we recommend the use of UAV data as it gives additional information about management-driven features. For future perspective, we would advise fusing UAV with Sentinel-2 imagery taken early in the season as it can integrate the effect of agricultural management in the subsequent absence of high spatial resolution data to help improve crop monitoring for the farmer and to reduce costs.

TI  - Built-Up Area Extraction from GF-3 SAR Data Based on a Dual-Attention Transformer Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Built-up area (BA) extraction using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data has emerged as a potential method in urban research. Currently, typical deep-learning-based BA extractors show high false-alarm rates in the layover areas and subsurface bedrock, which ignore the surrounding information and cannot be directly applied to large-scale BA mapping. To solve the above problems, a novel transformer-based BA extraction framework for SAR images is proposed. Inspired by SegFormer, we designed a BA extractor with multi-level dual-attention transformer encoders. First, the hybrid dilated convolution (HDC) patch-embedding module keeps the surrounding information of the input patches. Second, the channel self-attention module is designed for dual-attention transformer encoders and global modeling. The multi-level structure is employed to produce the coarse-to-fine semantic feature map of BAs. About 1100 scenes of Gaofen-3 (GF-3) data and 200 scenes of Sentinel-1 data were used in the experiment. Compared to UNet, PSPNet, and SegFormer, our model achieved an 85.35% mean intersection over union (mIoU) and 94.75% mean average precision (mAP) on the test set. The proposed framework achieved the best results in both mountainous and plain terrains. The experiments using Sentinel-1 shows that the proposed method has a good generalization ability with different SAR data sources. Finally, the BA map of China for 2020 was obtained with an overall accuracy of about 86%, which shows high consistency with the global urban footprint. The above experiments proved the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework in large-scale BA mapping.

TI  - Changes in Gross Primary Production in Response to Afforestation in the Hilly Loess Plateau of Northern Shaanxi, China
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - As a large-scale afforestation initiative, the Grain for Green (GFG) program was implemented for more than decade in the hilly Loess Plateau of Northern Shaanxi starting in 1999 and inevitably affected plant biomass production. This study evaluated the trend and magnitude of gross primary production (GPP) changes with VPM in the study area over 2000-2012 and quantitatively identified GFG's contribution. The results indicate that the regional mean GPP was 529.6 to 854.7 g C m(-2) yr(-1), which significantly increased by 1.63% per year during the period. At the pixel level, 80% of the pixels presented an increasing trend in annual GPP, and in nearly half of the region, the increasing trend was statistically significant. Spatial analyses showed that the GPP increased more significantly in the gully areas of the middle north area, while no evident change trend was observed in the southern forestland areas. Statistical data from relevant yearbooks and interpreted data from high-resolution images show that the GFG program promoted vegetation restoration. Taking the increased area of forestland to indicate the achievements of GFG, we estimated, using regression analyses, that the afforestation contributed 40%-60% to the increased GPP in the region during 2000-2012. Overall, the ecosystem had a positive response to the Grain for Green (GFG) program in Northern Shaanxi.

TI  - Enhanced Multi-Stream Remote Sensing Spatiotemporal Fusion Network Based on Transformer and Dilated Convolution
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing images with high temporal and spatial resolutions play a crucial role in land surface-change monitoring, vegetation monitoring, and natural disaster mapping. However, existing technical conditions and cost constraints make it very difficult to directly obtain remote sensing images with high temporal and spatial resolution. Consequently, spatiotemporal fusion technology for remote sensing images has attracted considerable attention. In recent years, deep learning-based fusion methods have been developed. In this study, to improve the accuracy and robustness of deep learning models and better extract the spatiotemporal information of remote sensing images, the existing multi-stream remote sensing spatiotemporal fusion network MSNet is improved using dilated convolution and an improved transformer encoder to develop an enhanced version called EMSNet. Dilated convolution is used to extract time information and reduce parameters. The improved transformer encoder is improved to further adapt to image-fusion technology and effectively extract spatiotemporal information. A new weight strategy is used for fusion that substantially improves the prediction accuracy of the model, image quality, and fusion effect. The superiority of the proposed approach is confirmed by comparing it with six representative spatiotemporal fusion algorithms on three disparate datasets. Compared with MSNet, EMSNet improved SSIM by 15.3% on the CIA dataset, ERGAS by 92.1% on the LGC dataset, and RMSE by 92.9% on the AHB dataset.

TI  - Dual-Branch Remote Sensing Spatiotemporal Fusion Network Based on Selection Kernel Mechanism
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Popular deep-learning-based spatiotemporal fusion methods for creating high-temporal-high-spatial-resolution images have certain limitations. The reconstructed images suffer from insufficient retention of high-frequency information and the model suffers from poor robustness, owing to the lack of training datasets. We propose a dual-branch remote sensing spatiotemporal fusion network based on a selection kernel mechanism. The network model comprises a super-resolution network module, a high-frequency feature extraction module, and a difference reconstruction module. Convolution kernel adaptive mechanisms are added to the high-frequency feature extraction module and difference reconstruction module to improve robustness. The super-resolution module upgrades the coarse image to a transition image matching the fine image; the high-frequency feature extraction module extracts the high-frequency features of the fine image to supplement the high-frequency features for the difference reconstruction module; the difference reconstruction module uses the structural similarity for fine-difference image reconstruction. The fusion result is obtained by combining the reconstructed fine-difference image with the known fine image. The compound loss function is used to help network training. Experiments are carried out on three datasets and five representative spatiotemporal fusion algorithms are used for comparison. Subjective and objective evaluations validate the superiority of our proposed method.

M3  - Article
AB  - The surface water extraction algorithm based on satellite remote sensing images is advantageous as it is able to obtain surface water information in a relatively short time. However, when it is used to extract information on surface water in large-scale, long-time series and complex terrain areas, there will be a large number of misclassified pixels, and a large amount of image preprocessing work is required. The accuracy verification is time-consuming and laborious, and the results may not be accurate. The complex climatic and topographic conditions in Bosten Lake Basin make it more difficult to monitor and control surface water bodies. Therefore, based on the GEE (Google Earth Engine) cloud platform, and the studies of the effect of nine kinds of water indexes on the surface water extraction in Bosten Lake Basin, this paper adds a slope mask to remove misclassified pixels and finds the best extraction method of surface water extraction in the basin by means of accuracy verification and visual discrimination through continuous iteration of index threshold and slope mask threshold. The results show that when the threshold value is -0.25 and the slope mask is 8 degrees, the index WI2019 has the best effect on the surface water information extraction of Bosten Lake Basin, effectively eliminating the interference of shadow and snow. The effect of water extraction in the long-time series is discussed and it was found that the precision of water extraction in the long-time series is also better than other indexes. The effects of various indexes on surface water extraction under complex terrain are compared. It can quickly and accurately realize the long-time series of surface water extraction under large-area complex terrain and provides useful guiding significance for water resources management and allocation as well as a water resources ecological assessment of Bosten Lake Basin.

TI  - Comparison of Lake Area Extraction Algorithms in Qinghai Tibet Plateau Leveraging Google Earth Engine and Landsat-9 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the lake waterbody area in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) is significant in dealing with global climate change. The latest released Landsat-9 data, which has higher radiation resolution and can be complemented with other Landsat data to improve imaging temporal resolution, have great potential for applications in lake area extraction. However, no study is published on identifying waterbodies and lakes in large-scale plateau scenes based on Landsat-9 data. Therefore, we relied on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform and selected ten waterbody extraction algorithms to evaluate the quantitative evaluation of waterbody and lake area extraction results on the QTP and explore the usability of Landsat-9 images in the relationship between the extraction accuracy and the algorithm. The results show that the random forest (RF) algorithm performs best in all models. The overall accuracy of waterbody extraction is 95.84%, and the average lake waterbody area extraction error is 1.505%. Among the traditional threshold segmentation waterbody extraction algorithms, the overall accuracy of the NDWI waterbody extraction method is 89.89%, and the average error of lake waterbody area extraction is 3.501%, which is the highest performance model in this kind of algorithm. The linear regression coefficients of NDVI and reflectance of Landsat-8 and Landsat-9 data are close to 1, and R-2 is more significant than 0.91. At the same time, the overall accuracy difference of water extraction between the two data is not better than 1.1%. This study proves that Landsat-9 and Landsat-8 data have great consistency, which can be used for collaborative analysis to identify plateau waterbodies more efficiently. With the development of cloud computing technologies, such as Gee, more complex models, such as RF, can be selected to improve the extraction accuracy of the waterbody and lake area in large-scale research.

TI  - Estimating Rangeland Fine Fuel Biomass in Western Texas Using High-Resolution Aerial Imagery and Machine Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rangeland fine fuel biomass is a key factor in determining fire spread and intensity, while the accuracy of biomass estimation is limited due to inherent heterogeneity in rangeland ecosystems. In this study, high spatial resolution (0.23 m) images were used to classify fuel types and predict rangeland fine fuel biomass in west Texas based on the random forest algorithm. Two biomass models, including one with the fuel type, original spectral bands, and vegetation indices as explanatory variables, and the other that contained a combination of the fuel type, original spectral bands, vegetation, and texture indices as explanatory variables, were assessed. Furthermore, the biomass models were also examined by upscaling the remote sensing images from high to medium (30 m) spatial resolution with the spectral curves derived from Landsat images. The fuel type map had an accuracy of more than 95%, and herbaceous fuel types were kept for estimating fine fuel biomass. The results showed that around 76% and 80% of biomass variances were explained by models without texture indices and with texture indices, respectively. The fuel type and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were two significant input variables influencing fine fuel biomass for both models and adding texture indices contributed to the improvement of model accuracy. An upscaling analysis for biomass estimation using medium spatial resolution imagery showed that approximately 60% of the variance in biomass was explained by the model. The addition of fractional vegetation cover improved the model performance by explaining an additional 5% of the variance in biomass estimation. These findings indicate that high spatial resolution images have the potential to effectively estimate rangeland fuel types and fine fuel biomass, which can be helpful for mapping the spatial distribution of fine fuels to aid in monitoring and fire management on rangelands.

TI  - Investigating the nonlinear relationship between surface solar radiation and its influencing factors in North China Plain using interpretable machine learning
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Using surface solar radiation (SSR) during 2015-2019 and the corresponding meteorological variables, pollution observations and temporal code, random forest models were built for the seven stations in North China Plain. The permutation feature importance (PFI) and partial dependence plot (PDP) reveal that, besides temporal code, total cloud cover (TCC) and aerosol optical depth (AOD) are the most important influencing feature on global radiation (GR) and diffuse radiation (DR), respectively. Single feature PDP visualized how the input variables affect the estimated SSR. The different order in PFI of boundary layer height (BLH) between urban and farmland stations and the distinct variations in PDP of BLH among urban stations suggest the interaction of BLH and aerosols has substantial impact on the SSR in metropolis areas. The joint PDP displayed the nonlinear relationships between SSR and the input feature pairs. The change range of SSR with the corresponding input features and feature pairs is also investigated, with the maximum variation of GR from 63.4 Wm(-2) to 231.9 Wm(-2) under the influence of TCC -BLH and of DR from 51.8 Wm(-2) to 104.9 Wm(-2) under the impact of TCC-AOD in Zhengzhou, respectively. These findings provide insight into the simulation and prediction of SSR, temperature and subsequent weather conditions in urban areas.

TI  - Exploring the Variations and Influencing Factors of Land Surface Temperature in the Urban Agglomeration on the Northern Slope of the Tianshan Mountains
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in land surface temperature (LST) can have serious impacts on the water cycle and ecological environment evolution, which in turn threaten the sustainability of ecosystems. The urban agglomeration on the northern slopes of the Tianshan Mountains (UANSTM) is located in the arid and semi-arid regions of northwest China, with an extremely fragile ecological environment and sensitive to climate change. However, studies on the LST of the UANSTM have not received much attention. Therefore, this study explored the spatial distribution pattern, fluctuation characteristics, and influencing factors of the LST of the UANSTM from 2005 to 2021 based on MODIS time series LST data and the geo-detector model with optimal parameters. The results show that the UANSTM is dominated by medium- and high-temperature classes, with high- and extremely high-temperature classes clustered in Turpan City. The daytime and nighttime LST patterns are significantly different, with a typical "daytime cold island and nighttime heat island" feature in the oasis region. During 2005-2021, LST fluctuated greatly in the northwestern part of the UANSTM, with LST showing an increasing trend during both daytime and nighttime, and the warming rate was more intense during daytime than nighttime. The increasing trend of LST in Urumqi, Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture, Shihezi, and Wujiaqu is very significant and will remain consistent in the future. Precipitation, DEM, and AOD are the most important influencing factors of LST in the UANSTM, where precipitation and DEM are negatively correlated with LST, and AOD is positively correlated with LST. Land cover factors (LULC, NDVI,, and NDBSI) are the next most influential, and socioeconomic factors (NTL, GDP, and POP) are the least influential. The results of this study can provide a scientific reference for the conservation and sustainable development of the ecological environment of the UANSTM.

TI  - Cloud Detection of Gaofen-2 Multi-Spectral Imagery Based on the Modified Radiation Transmittance Map
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - For optical remote sensing images with high spatial resolution and low spectral number, the complexity of ground objects poses great challenges to cloud detection algorithms, such as the differentiation of clouds from objects with similar features as clouds and the identification of thin clouds. In this paper, a novel cloud detection method is proposed for Gaofen-2 remote sensing imagery. The radiation transmittance is estimated based on the dark channel prior, and the overestimated radiation transmittance is corrected using spectral features. A three-step post-processing strategy is adopted to eliminate misidentification introduced by the highlighted surfaces based on object geometric, textural, and boundary features. In the experiments, Gaofen-2 multispectral images with different cloud categories and cloud thicknesses are involved to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method can obtain an average cloud detection accuracy of 0.9573 on six different clouds. The proposed algorithm can also effectively detect both thick and thin clouds with an average accuracy of more than 0.9517. The advantages of the method for thin cloud detection are further demonstrated by comparison with existing algorithms.

TI  - Oceanic Karman Vortex Streets in the Luzon Strait in the Lee of Didicas Island from Multiple Satellite Missions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The oceanic Karman vortex street is an important hydrokinetic phenomenon caused by the unsteady separation of sea currents in the wake of an obstacle. This study quantitatively analyzed the characteristics of the small-scale vortex street of Didicas Island in the Luzon Strait based on multimission satellite data. Five groups of vortex streets were captured, and each group was observed by two satellite images within one hour. Based on the displacement and change in the vortex street within one hour, we found that the formation time of a single vortex is longer than 40 min. The vortex propagation speed behind the island is approximately 0.98 m s(-1) (ranging from 0.66-1.22 m s(-1)). The incoming velocity was calculated using the vortex propagation speed and the aspect ratio based on a vortex propagation model, which ranges from 0.72 to 1.47 m s(-1) The incoming speed is 1.6-2.3 times the geostrophic speed extracted from AVISO data, implying that the contribution of non-geostrophic flow to the total flow field is comparable to that of geostrophic flow in this region.

TI  - A Comparison of Different Water Indices and Band Downscaling Methods for Water Bodies Mapping from Sentinel-2 Imagery at 10-M Resolution
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based remote sensing is important for monitoring the spatial distribution of water resources. The water index is currently one of the most widely used water body extraction methods. Based on Sentinel-2 remote sensing image, this study combines area-to-point regression kriging interpolation, bilinear interpolation, and the Gram-Schmidt (GS) pan-sharpening method with the water indices MNDWI, AWEI(sh) and WI2015 to compare different water body extraction methods. The experimental results showed that all water indices have satisfactory extraction ability, with the kappa coefficient as an accuracy threshold above 0.8. Moreover, the GS downscaling method combined with the WI2015 yielded the best performance. This research demonstrates the efficacy of the WI2015 method to extract water bodies in urban areas and its ability to comprehensively describe river water bodies. The findings indicate that high-resolution band information is particularly important for improving low-resolution band downscaling results and can significantly minimize erroneous water body extraction.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - (1) Background: Eco-spatial networks play an important role in enhancing ecosystem services and landscape connectivity. It is necessary to study landscape structure optimization to achieve synergistic gains in network connectivity and ecosystem functionality. (2) Method: Based on remote sensing data, RS and GIS were used to evaluate the spatiotemporal changes in ecosystem services in China. Combined with complex network theory, the spatiotemporal evolution of China's ecological spatial network and its topological structure from 2005 to 2020 is discussed. Network function-structure co-optimization was carried out using the edge augmentation strategy. (3) Result: The "three River resource" has high water conservation and high soil and water conservation in southeastern hilly areas. There is strong windbreak and sand fixation in southeastern Inner Mongolia. In the past 15 years, there have been about 8200 sources and about 14,000 corridors. The network has the characteristics of small-world and heterogeneity. After optimization, 18 sources and 3180 corridors are added, and the network connectivity and robustness are stronger. Finally, five regions are divided according to the network heterogeneity and corresponding protection and management countermeasures are proposed to provide scientific guidance for the country's territorial space planning.

TI  - Extraction of blue roofs using BRSAM and the newly created spectral index derived from WorldView-2/3 imagery
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - To extract blue roofs (BRs) from remote sensing images quickly, first, this study used WorldView-2 and WorldView-3 as the data sources and created a new BR spectral area model (BRSAM) using the polygon area difference between the spectral curves of BRs and other image categories in bands 2-8. Then the extraction effect of BRSAM with those of the blue ground object spectral index (BGOSI), blue object spectrum index (BOSI) and maximum likelihood classification was compared; the results showed that BRSAM overcomes the shortcomings of BGOSI and BOSI, i.e. erroneously extracted shadow and white and yellow ground objects as BRs. However, BRSAM has the disadvantage of erroneously extracting some vegetation and green plastic playground as BRs. Considering that the disadvantage of one of BRSAM, BGOSI, and BOSI in extracting BRs can be compensated by the two other spectral models/indices, we combined the three spectral models/indices and used the synthetic spectral model to extract BRs. Notably, the synthetic spectral model overcomes the shortcomings of the three spectral models in BR extraction, and its effect is better than any one of them separately used. Meanwhile, the spectral model/index method used in BR extraction is better than the classification method. The spectral model/ index method is a convenient and effective method for BR extraction, which could be used as a reference in the classification of other data.

TI  - An Analysis of Spatio-Temporal Relationship between Satellite-Based Land Surface Temperature and Station-Based Near-Surface Air Temperature over Brazil
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A better understanding of the relationship between land surface temperature (Ts) and near-surface air temperature (Ta) is crucial for improving the simulation accuracy of climate models, developing retrieval schemes for soil and vegetation moisture, and estimating large-scale Ta from satellite-based Ts observations. In this study, we investigated the relationship between multiple satellite-based Ts products, derived from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard Aqua satellite, and Ta from 204 meteorological stations over Brazil during 2003-2016. Monthly satellite-based Ts products used in this study include: (1) AIRS Version 6 with 1 degrees spatial resolution, (2) AIRS Version 7 with 1 degrees spatial resolution, (3) MODIS Collection 6 with 0.05 degrees spatial resolution, and (4) MODIS Collection 6 with 1 degrees spatial resolution re-sampled from (3) for a direct comparison with AIRS products. We found that satellite-based Ts is lower than Ta over the forest area, but higher than Ta over the non-forest area. Nevertheless, the correlation coefficients (R) between monthly Ta and four Ts products during 2003-2016 are greater than 0.8 over most stations. The long-term trend analysis shows a general warming trend in temperatures, particularly over the central and eastern parts of Brazil. The satellite products could also observe the increasing Ts over the deforestation region. Furthermore, we examined the temperature anomalies during three drought events in the dry season of 2005, 2010, and 2015. All products show similar spatio-temporal patterns, with positive temperature anomalies expanding in areal coverage and magnitude from the 2005 to 2015 event. The above results show that satellite-based Ts is sensitive in reflecting environmental changes such as deforestation and extreme climatic events, and can be used as an alternative to Ta for climatological studies. Moreover, the observed differences between Ts and Ta may inform how thermal assumptions can be improved in satellite-based retrievals of soil and vegetation moisture or evapotranspiration.

TI  - Ageing, technology, and health: Advancing the concepts of autonomy and independence.
T2  - Healthcare management forum
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The global pandemic expedited the adoption of AgeTech solutions that aim to help older adults maintain their autonomy and independence. This article examines the negative impact of the Western worldview of autonomy and independence on older adults. Negative impact can manifest as ageism and may be compounded by intersections of identities with race, gender, and culture. We propose an inclusive framework for health leaders, one that is not binary or categorical, but instead, on a continuum: (1) relational autonomy which assumes that relationships form one's identity; therefore, no one is autonomous to the exclusion of others, and (2) interdependence which proposes that one's lifestyle choice is supported by interreliance with aspects of one's environment. We examine two examples of AgeTech from the perspective of relational autonomy and interdependence and discuss how health leaders can use this inclusive framework to ensure that their services do not discriminate against older adults.

TI  - Monitoring and Assessing Land Use/Cover Change and Ecosystem Service Value Using Multi-Resolution Remote Sensing Data at Urban Ecological Zone
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - An urban ecological zone (UEZ) is an important part of a city, focusing on environmental conservation and ecological economic development simultaneously. During the past decade, the urban scale of Xi'an city in China has been expanding, and the population has been increasing rapidly. This dramatic change is a huge challenge to urban sustainability. It puts forward higher requirements for the construction of an UEZ. Under different spatial resolution scales, this study adopted Landsat8-OLI and gaofen-2 (GF-2) satellite high-resolution remote sensing data to interpret the land use/cover change (LUCC) of the Weihe River UEZ. The ecosystem service value (ESV) was assessed, and the ecological effect was analyzed based on LUCC. The results showed that the spatial distribution of land types in the Weihe River UEZ changed significantly from 2014 to 2020. The construction land gathered to the southeast. Especially, the vegetative land (i.e., forestland, grassland and other green land) and water body showed a slightly increasing trend since the official establishment of the UEZ in 2018. The cultivated land area gradually reduced, and the vegetative land area tended to be concentrated as well as expanded. Through the interpretation of GF-2 remote sensing data, the ESV at the Weihe River UEZ showed a downward trend in general. The high-value areas were mainly distributed in the Weihe River and its surrounding beach areas, which were greatly affected by river water scope. Construction land normally had low ESV, and it was affected by human activities obviously. Therefore, the development of urban construction had significant impacts on the Weihe River UEZ.

TI  - Area Changes and Influencing Factors of Large Inland Lakes in Recent 20 Years: A Case Study of Sichuan Province, China
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes are important natural resources closely related to human survival and development. Based on PIE cloud computing platform, the study uses Landsat images and the empirical normalized water body index (ENDWI) to extract water body information of the large lakes in Sichuan province from 2000 to 2020 in the drought and rainy seasons, respectively, and uses the Mann-Kendall test to obtain the long-term trends of their area and climate. On this basis, the evolution of the lakes and their correlation with climate and human activities are analyzed. The results show that (1) In the past 20 years, the area of Lugu Lake, Qionghai Lake, and Luban Reservoir represent a decreasing trend, with Lugu Lake being the most affected. The area of Ma Lake, Three Forks Lake, and Shengzhong Reservoir increased, with the area of Shengzhong Reservoir increasing significantly; (2) During the drought season, all six lakes showed a decreasing trend in precipitation, with the most apparent decreasing trend for Lugu Lake (Slope = -0.8). Only Lugu Lake showed a decreasing trend in precipitation (Slope = -0.15) during the rainy season. The precipitation of Ma Lake, Three Forks Lake, Luban Reservoir and Shengzhong Reservoir showed a significant increasing trend (Slope value was greater than 1.96); (3) The temperatures of the remaining lakes all decreased in the drought season and increased in the rainy season, except that the temperature of Shengzhong Reservoir decreases throughout the year; (4) The area change of plain lakes is greatly affected by human activities, but the area of plateau lakes is are more impacted by climate. Our study improved the accuracy of long-term water body change monitoring with PIE-Engine Studio. Besides, the findings would provide reference for the implementation of sustainable water resources management in Sichuan Province.

TI  - Self-Trained Deep Forest with Limited Samples for Urban Impervious Surface Area Extraction in Arid Area Using Multispectral and PolSAR Imageries
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Impervious surface area (ISA) has been recognized as a significant indicator for evaluating levels of urbanization and the quality of urban ecological environments. ISA extraction methods based on supervised classification usually rely on a large number of manually labeled samples, the production of which is a time-consuming and labor-intensive task. Furthermore, in arid areas, man-made objects are easily confused with bare land due to similar spectral responses. To tackle these issues, a self-trained deep-forest (STDF)-based ISA extraction method is proposed which exploits the complementary information contained in multispectral and polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images using limited numbers of samples. In detail, this method consists of three major steps. First, multi-features, including spectral, spatial and polarimetric features, are extracted from Sentinel-2 multispectral and Chinese GaoFen-3 (GF-3) PolSAR images; secondly, a deep forest (DF) model is trained in a self-training manner using a limited number of samples for ISA extraction; finally, ISAs (in this case, in three major cities located in Central Asia) are extracted and comparatively evaluated. The experimental results from the study areas of Bishkek, Tashkent and Nursultan demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, with an overall accuracy (OA) above 95% and a Kappa coefficient above 0.90.

TI  - ALOS-Based USV Path-Following Control with Obstacle Avoidance Strategy
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Path following and obstacle avoidances are used in heading control and path replanning for unmanned surface vessels (USVs), which have attracted the interest of many researchers over the years. This paper investigates the path-following and obstacle avoidance problems for USVs. First, on the basis of the current position and desired path, an adaptive line-of-sight (ALOS) algorithm is used to obtain the desired heading angle, and the sideslip angle compensation is considered. Then, to ensure that the USV follows the desired path. Model predictive control (MPC) is used to reduce the lateral error. The event-triggered mechanism (ETM) strategy is utilized to reduce the computational cost of MPC. Moreover, to obtain accurate state quantities in real time, a linear extended state observer (LESO) is used to counteract the effects of external disturbances and the nonlinear term of the model. Furthermore, an improved obstacle avoidance algorithm based on the geometric relationship is proposed. This method can better ensure USV navigation safety and reduce consumption and computation. Lastly, multiple simulation experiments illustrate that the algorithm improves the path-following capability and security and ensures smooth input changes by setting input constraints. Therefore, the designed controller has better feasibility and robustness.

TI  - Woody plant encroachment pervasive across three socially and ecologically diverse ecoregions
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Woody plant encroachment in grasslands represents one of the greatest challenges for global biodiversity conservation. Furthermore, this is a social-ecological problem, where human activity and behavior have resulted in significant changes in ecological processes that control woody plants, and failure to fully recognize the role of human activity has led to continued loss of grasslands worldwide. It is therefore critical that conservation professionals understand how ecological systems, settlement patterns, and fragmentation from anthropogenic development interact to influence rates of woody plant encroachment. Using annual estimates of tree cover derived from regionally available remote-sensing data, our objectives were, first, to describe rates of woody plant encroachment over the last 20 years (2000-2019) across three ecologically and socially diverse ecoregions in the Southern Great Plains of North America. Then, we examined how anthropogenic and biophysical variables influenced rates of encroachment (both directly and indirectly) within the region. Results indicate that, despite marked differences in social and ecological characteristics, all three ecoregions have experienced consistent increases in woody plant encroachment during the study period. This included the Flint Hills ecoregion of Kansas and Oklahoma, an area that experiences widespread and frequent fires. At the regional scale, rates of encroachment were directly and negatively related to the average area burned in a county, initial cover of trees, and fragmentation from row crops. Percent cover of development and row crop agriculture also indirectly alter rates of encroachment in a county by influencing initial tree cover and fire activity. The pervasive nature of woody plant encroachment, even in regions that experience frequent fires, suggests that many grasslands are being managed outside of critical ecological thresholds needed to maintain grasslands and limit woody encroachment, which can have significant implications for biodiversity. Our results show that anthropogenic or ecological factors do not act in isolation in their influence on woody plant encroachment and can form complex relationships that shape regional trends in woody plant encroachment.

TI  - Research on the Dynamic Evolution of the Landscape Pattern in the Urban Fringe Area of Wuhan from 2000 to 2020
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban fringe area is a discontinuous spatial phenomenon that refers to the urban-rural interlacing zone which is undergoing urbanization on the fringe of the core built-up area of a large city after the emergence of industrialization. Dynamic, ambiguous, and complex interlacing of various types of lands make urban planners and managers fuzzy about the spatial scope of the urban fringe and it is difficult to control its evolution patterns scientifically. Based on remote sensing data from 2000 to 2020, the range of Wuhan's urban fringe was extracted from the surface impermeability ratio mutation points, landscape flocculation, and population density. On this basis, the dynamic evolution characteristics of land-use and landscape patterns in the urban fringe area of Wuhan City were analyzed by using dynamic change and landscape pattern index analysis. The results show that: Wuhan City shows a clear "urban core area-urban fringe area-rural hinterland" circle structure, and the urban fringe area continuously extends to the rural hinterland. Moreover, most of the rural hinterland, in the process of moving to the urban core area, has gone through the process of the urban fringe. By comparison with other cities, it is found that the expansion of large cities is generally influenced by policies, topography, and traffic arteries, and gradually shifts from expansion to infill, with the urban core of Wuhan continuously extending and the urban fringe rapidly expanding from 2000 to 2010, and gradually entering a stable development state from 2010 to 2020. The future urban construction of Wuhan should pay attention to the influences of these characteristics on the implementation of urban territorial spatial planning.

TI  - Spectrophenology from Sentinel 2 data: definition of reference curves for forest ecosystem mapping
T2  - ECOSISTEMAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the spectral response of habitat types obtained by medium resolution satellite imagery can provide relevant information about the distribution and temporal dynamics of vegetation types through environmental gradients and geographic scales. The combination of the orbital cycle and bandwidth of Sentinel 2 sensor provides data every 5 days in mid-latitudes, which allows high-resolution temporal monitoring related to ecosystem phenology cycles and possible changes of habitats conservation status. In this context, the objective of this study was to obtain average spectrophenological curves for main tree and shrub formations present in Cantabria, as well as the analysis and characterization of phenological metrics that allow characterizing distributions and determining particular vegetation functions across landscape continuum. For the definition of the curves, we have processed all the historical data available from the MSI sensor of Sentinel 2 A and B satellites in order to generate a high temporal resolution time series of the NDVI index. Results have been temporarily averaged for a monthly representation after applying a manual filter of clouds and shadows that maximizes the quality of the data at the pixel level and a temporal smoothing of the series that filters out anomalous and missing values. NDVI values have been extracted at the pixel level for a sample of 230 points located with a subpixel GPS precision and whose floristic composition has been characterized by botanists in the field. Seasonal phenological curves for the years from 2017 to 2020 and annual average curves have been obtained, determining their variability and the degree of representativeness for each habitat type of interest. Finally, the equations of the functions adjusted to the average phenological curves by plant formation have been obtained by applying Fourier analyses. Results show particular features for each of the habitat type due to the existence of specific functional traits related to phenological variations between their average multiannual curves. These results highlight the interest of using spectrophenological time series of satellite data for defining reference curves of habitat types. These curves allow, on the one hand, identifying the spatial distribution as well as structural and function variations of different ecosystems, and on the other hand, having at hand an early detection system of anomalous phenological responses of vegetation communities that can be related to natural or anthropic disturbances in a context of Global Change.

TI  - Reducing Weather Influences on an 89 GHz Sea Ice Concentration Algorithm in the Arctic Using Retrievals From an Optimal Estimation Method
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea ice concentration (SIC) derived from 89 GHz data has up to four times finer spatial resolution compared to that from the widely used 19 and 37 GHz data. But it has lower accuracy due to the enhanced weather influences from water vapor, cloud liquid water (CLW), wind, and surface temperature. Here we improve a high-resolution SIC algorithm, called the ASI algorithm, based on the difference between vertical and horizontal polarization 89 GHz data, by correcting the observed data for these weather influences through a radiative transfer model and geophysical data retrieved by an optimal estimation method. The improved algorithm denoted ASI3, is developed for the Arctic based on the weather-corrected brightness temperatures and newly identified open water (80 K) and sea ice (14 K) tie-points. The most important component of this correction is the inclusion of CLW, the largest weather influence contributor. ASI3 results are evaluated over pure surface sites of 0% and 100% SICs under various weather conditions, showing a much lower average standard deviation (1.1%) than ASI (16.2%). ASI3 reduces weather patterns over pack ice resulting in more homogeneous retrievals but biased toward lower values. Comparison to Landsat imagery under clear-sky conditions shows that ASI3 results in better agreement with the Landsat SIC than ASI. The number of cases where real sea ice is falsely identified as open water is reduced by ASI3 due to its relaxed open-water mask and wider water/ice dynamic range.

TI  - A New Method to Map Spring Irrigated Areas Using MODIS LST Products and Ancillary Data in an Agricultural District of Northwest China
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Irrigation alleviates drought in croplands and maintains or increases crop yields. The accurate monitoring of irrigated areas is important to regional water resource management, food security, climate change, drought monitoring, and emergency disaster relief. Based on field experiments that demonstrate the feasibility of irrigated area mapping using land-surface temperature, we propose a method to map spring irrigation areas using historical meteorological data, main crop phenological characteristics, irrigation regimes, and MODIS land-surface temperature (LST) products. The distribution of irrigation intensity, spring irrigated areas (SIA, considering the irrigation intensity), and total area of spring irrigation (STIA, regardless of irrigation intensity) were monitored by the proposed method for the Donglei Irrigated District (Phase II) in northwestern China from 2011 to 2018. The spring irrigation of the study area was divided into three periods (16 January-23 February, 24 February-24 March, and 25 March-31 May). Then, the temperature threshold of the irrigated area in each period was determined by the diurnal temperature range (DTR) of the rain-fed plots and precipitation data; for the three periods, this was 12 degrees C, 15 degrees C, and 11 degrees C, respectively. The results showed that most of the croplands in the study area were irrigated once or twice. The SIA in most years varied between 55,900 and 73,100 ha, but in 2016, the irrigation area reached 100,200 ha. The STIA accounted for 60-70% of the irrigated area except 2016. The average accuracy of SIA monitoring was satisfactory and above 94% for years when sufficient and reliable data was available.

TI  - Basin management inspiration from impacts of alternating dry and wet conditions on water production and carbon uptake in Murray-Darling Basin
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The impacts of alternating dry and wet conditions on water production and carbon uptake at different scales remain unclear, which limits the integrated management of water and carbon. We quantified the response of runoff efficiency (RE) and plant water-use efficiency (PWUE) to a typical shift from dry to wet episode of 2003-2014 in Australia's Murray-Darling basin using good and specific data products for local application, including Australian Water Availabil-ity Project, Penman-Monteith-Leuning Evapotranspiration V2 product, MODIS MCD12Q1 V6 Land Cover Type and MODIS MOD17A3 V055 GPP product. The results show that there are significant power function relationships be-tween RE and precipitation for basin and all ecosystems, while the PWUE had a negative quadratic correlation with precipitation and satisfied the significance levels of 0.05 for basin and the ecosystems except the grassland and crop-land. The shrubs can achieve the best water production and carbon uptake under dry conditions, while the evergreen broadleaf trees and evergreen needleleaf trees can obtain the best water production and carbon uptake in wet condi-tions, respectively. These findings help integrated basin management for balancing water resource production and climate change mitigation.

TI  - All-Sky Soil Moisture Estimation over Agriculture Areas from the Full Polarimetric SAR GF-3 Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to estimate the soil moisture (SM) in all-sky agriculture areas using fully polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) Gaofen-3 (GF-3) data. The radar vegetation index (RVI) is obtained using the radar SAR data, which overcomes the difficulty that the optical data cannot construct the vegetation index in cloud-covered areas. The RVI is introduced into the water cloud model (WCM) to remove the contribution of vegetation to the total radar backscatter sigma(0) and obtain the soil backscattering coefficients sigma(0)(soil) with HH and VV polarization. Subsequently, sigma(0)(soil) and radar frequency data are introduced into the Chen model, and a semi-empirical model of SM estimation is established. The main findings of this study are as follows: (1) Compared with the sigma(0), the sigma(0 )(soil)obtained by the WCM has a stronger correlation with the SM. (2) In the cloud covered area, the accuracy of the estimated SM by synergistically using the WCM and the Chen model is ideal. An RMSE of 0.05 and a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.69 are achieved. In this study, the SM estimation method is not affected by clouds, and it shows many advantages for sustainable development, monitoring soil drought degree, and other related research.

TI  - Monitoring Subsidence over the Planned Jakarta-Bandung (Indonesia) High-Speed Railway Using Sentinel-1 Multi-Temporal InSAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Investigation of subsidence situations is important for the design of railway lines. Traditional geological investigations are expensive. Multi-temporal InSAR (MT-InSAR) analysis has shown great potential for detecting subsidence areas along large-scale manmade linear features (LMLFs). The disadvantage of applying high-resolution SAR data such as that from TerraSAR-X and COSMO-SkyMed data is the high cost. By contrast, the free and open data from Sentinel-1 A/B offer an unprecedented opportunity for InSAR applications. Despite these advantages, research investigating the potential for monitoring subsidence along LMSFs using multi-temporal Sentinel-1 InSAR data at the design stage of LMSFs is limited. This paper explores the monitoring ability of MT-InSAR analysis with Sentinel-1 A/B multi-temporal data in an experiment along the planned Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway in Bandung, Indonesia. Subsidence patterns along the route of the planned high-speed railway were analyzed in detail. By means of validation using 12 leveling points, the root mean square error (RMSE) of the average displacement velocity that was obtained from the MT-InSAR results was found to be 10.31 mm/yr. This paper demonstrates the potential of Sentinel-1 multi-temporal INSAR data to detect potential subsidence areas along planned LMLFs (e.g., the planned high-speed railway that is the focus of this study), serving as a reference for further planning of monitoring subsidence over planned LMLFs.

TI  - The Large-Scale Investigation and Analysis of <i>Lophodermium piceae</i> in Subalpine Areas Based on Satellite Multi-Spectral Remote Sensing
T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Picea asperata, a common tree species in the subalpine areas of Li County, Sichuan Province, China, is susceptible to Lophodermium piceae. Remote sensing has the advantages of large-scale, fast information acquisition, and low cost, which can overcome the shortcomings of ground survey. Hence, we used Landsat 8 satellite multi-spectral images and forest resource distribution data to investigate and analyze this forest disease at a large scale. Firstly, we extracted the spatial distribution information of Picea asperata and chose a temporal sequence indicator to establish a regression model and obtained a significantly negative correlation between the damage degree of plants and the change rate of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Accordingly, the investigation results of the disease have good consistency with the ground survey data in spatial distribution and damage degree. On this basis, a temporal regression analysis was performed by combining the remote sensing investigation results with climate variables, and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was utilized in the spatial comprehensive analysis of Lophodermium piceae with terrain, soil and forest stand factors. Conclusively, this study effectively coped with the difficulties in full investigation and analysis of Lophodermium piceae in ecologically fragile subalpine areas of Western Sichuan. It is of important reference value in the early warning and monitoring of this disease, and also provides objective and reliable information support for ecological restoration and management planning in the Wenchuan earthquake-stricken areas.

TI  - FLOOD MONITORING APPLICATION OF 2018 LAOS DAM COLLAPSE BASED ON SENTINEL-1A SAR DATA AND THE OBJECT-ORIENTED METHOD
T2  - GEOSFERNYE ISSLEDOVANIYA-GEOSPHERE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood disasters seriously threaten the survival and development of human beings. Monitoring the changes of water bodies during floods and estimating the affected area is essential for comprehensive and accurate analysis of disaster information. Recently, radar satellite data has been increasingly used for flood monitoring, since in this case, cloudiness is not an obstacle to estimating the flood area. In this paper Sentinel-1 ground range detected (GRD) data was selected to estimate the inundated area after the Xe-Pian Xe-Namnoy Dam breach in Laos at the end of July 2018. The flooded Hinlat area and the Xe-Pian Xe-Namnoy reservoir were selected as the study area for flood inundation extent monitoring, because this area is characterized by bare land, agricultural land, and residential land with complex topography and geomorphology. The study area is located in the Bolaven Plateau, is a highland region in southern Laos. One of the reasons for the flooding of the study area is an elevation difference between upper reaches and downstream of the river. Several reaches with a convex profile and knickpoints because of the geologic control when draining the plateau represent the undeveloped longitudinal profile of the Vang Ngao River. The main channel of the Vang Ngao River is dug into Mesozoic fluvial sandstones, which resist scouring by the flood. The eCognition software is used to organize the process of extracting information about the flood zone. The object-oriented approach and the threshold method are combined to extract information about the reservoir. First, SNAP software is used to pre-process Sentinel-1A SAR images. Then, the eCognition multi-scale segmentation method is used to determine the best segmentation scale, for iterative testing and comparative analysis of experimental results, taking into account the characteristics of the object and a priori knowledge. After sensitivity analysis of the flooded area image features and other features, the VH-polarized backscattered mean features were selected to construct a knowledge base for flooded area extraction to differentiate water and non-water bodies. At the same time, the modified bare soil index (MBI) and the terrain relief were combined to remove the influence of bare land and mountain shadow on the extraction results to achieve the 2018 dam collapse flood monitoring in Laos. Finally, the extent and area of the affected region were analyzed and the changes of water bodies before and after the disaster were mapped. The study shows that the monitoring results of Sentinel-1A SAR data are more consistent with the actual situation and have significant advantages in flood hazard monitoring and assessment, which can effectively carry out large-scale flood inundation extent monitoring.

TI  - Rice Planting Area Identification Based on Multi-Temporal Sentinel-1 SAR Images and an Attention U-Net Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice is one of the most important food crops for human beings. The timely and accurate understanding of the distribution of rice can provide an important scientific basis for food security, agricultural policy formulation, and regional development planning. As an active remote sensing system, polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) has the advantage of working both day and night and in all weather conditions and hence plays an important role in rice growing area identification. This paper focuses on the topic of rice planting area identification using multi-temporal PolSAR images and a deep learning method. A rice planting area identification attention U-Net (RIAU-Net) model is proposed, which is trained by multi-temporal Sentinel-1 dual-polarimetric images acquired in different periods of rice growth. In addition, considering the diversity of the rice growth period in different years caused by the different climatic conditions and other factors, a transfer mechanism is investigated to apply the well-trained model to monitor the rice planting areas in different years. The experimental results show that the proposed method can significantly improve the classification accuracy, with 11-14% F1-score improvement compared with the traditional methods and a pleasing generalization ability in different years. Moreover, the classified rice planting regions are continuous. For reproducibility, the source codes of the well-trained RIAU-Net model are provided.

TI  - Hypoxia and Ezrin Expression in Primary Melanoma Have High Prognostic Relevance
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Hypoxia affects tumor aggressiveness and activates pathways associated with epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) which are crucial for tumor progress. In this study, the correlation of hypoxia and EMT with sentinel lymph node status and tumor-specific survival was investigated in primary melanomas. CD34 for capillary count and Hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) as hypoxia indicators as well as Ezrin and L1-Cell Adhesion Molecule (L1CAM), both critical proteins contributing to EMT, were analyzed using immunohistochemistry in 49 melanoma patients with long follow-up (F/U, mean no months; range 12-263 months). We found a significant correlation between Breslow tumor thickness and Ezrin expression (p = 0.018). L1CAM expression in primary melanoma was significantly associated with HIF-1 alpha expression (p < 0.0001) and sentinel lymph node metastasis (p = 0.011). Furthermore, low capillary count, reflecting hypoxic condition, was significantly associated with Ezrin expression (p = 0.047) and decreased tumor-specific survival (p = 0.035). In addition, patients with high Ezrin expression in their primary melanoma had a dramatic loss of life early in their F/U period (mean survival time 29 months; range 15-44 month). Our results highlight the relevance of Ezrin, L1CAM and HIF-1 alpha as prognostic markers in melanoma patients. Additionally, we demonstrate that hypoxia in primary melanoma affects EMT and is at least partly responsible for early metastatic dissemination.

TI  - Land use/land cover changing aspect implications: Lesser Zab River Basin, northeastern Iraq
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Research shows that regularly performed land use/land cover (LU/LC) variation detection is recommended to support different prospect organizations and management activities to resolve a variety of environmental problems. The current research aims to investigate the LU/LC pattern and measure the corresponding alteration in the arid and semi-arid climatic conditions by considering the Lesser Zab catchment, northeastern Iraq, as a typical basin area. Data from Landsat imageries for the years 1989, 1999, 2009, 2019, and 2021 were utilized. Generally, seven general classes have been noted within the study area through applying a supervised image classification process. Urban lands in 1989 covered 0.46%; however, in 2021, the urban lands increased to 5.59% compared to 1989. Agricultural lands were reduced by 11.1% between 1989 and 2021. It was identified that there has been a quick transformation from agricultural lands to urban lands. The studied basin witnessed a reduction trend in barren and agricultural lands, although urban lands experienced expansion. Whereas, a fluctuation in the occupied area by the water bodies and forest lands has been recorded during the studied period. Analyzing the spatiotemporal pattern of LU/LC would support strategy makers' detection to cope with the undesired impact of such an event. The unwanted impact of difficult ecological dynamics in the basin would be mitigated by giving particular attention to recovering the affected area to protect the basin's natural resources.

TI  - Spectral analysis of Sentinel-2A imagery for mapping of iron minerals in parts of Mayurbhanj district, Odisha, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF INDIAN GEOPHYSICAL UNION
M3  - Article
AB  - Exploration of mineral resources entails adequate information on subsurface geological characteristics. Accurate interpretation is a prerequisite, which is achievable through geological, geophysical, geochemical and remote sensing techniques. Each have significance in various stages of exploration of potential mineralized areas. Remote Sensing (RS) application products or satellite image derivatives, have become an integral part of the exploration services. It is particularly helpful in assessing the mineral reserves as indicated in surface exposures, hence useful in reconnaissance studies that cover larger unexplored areas in a synoptic view. Remotely sensed data is not only a databank for interpreting basic geological aspects, it also helps in assessing of the accessibility issue, terrain conditions, distance from other urban centres, land cover characteristics, drainage pattern etc. Remote sensing data provides invaluable inputs for exploration program at a comparatively negligible costs and lesser time as compared to ground surveys. The Sentinel-2 mission was primarily designed to provide routine observations for Copernicus Programme or Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) and to provide data for enhancement of SPOT and Landsat missions. The Sentinel-2 mission contains two identical satellites, Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B. With a wide swath (290 km), fine spatial resolution and temporal resolution (5 days), Sentinel-2A imagery are being widely used for global monitoring since the launch, including vegetation indices extraction, wildfire detection, land cover mapping and geological applications. Extraction of iron mineral from the sentinel-2A image was explored in the Odisha area India. With the complete set of 12 bands with a fine spatial resolution and spectral matching, the band ratio of (4/3) image were used for mapping of Iron mineral in the study area. Results of spectral analysis from the Sentinel-2 data reveal potential Iron signatures in the Jhadbeda, Badampahar, Nangalsilva and Bargiput areas of Mayurbhanj disrcit, Odisha.

TI  - CT Lymphography Using Lipiodol(R) for Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Early-Stage Oral Cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluated sentinel lymph node (SLN) identification with CT lymphography (CTL) following peritumoral administration of Lipiodol(R) relative to conventional Tc-99m-nanocolloid lymphoscintigraphy (including SPECT/CT) in 10 early-stage oral cancer patients undergoing SLN biopsy. Patients first underwent early dynamic and static scintigraphy after peritumoral administration of Tc-99m-nanocolloid. Subsequently, Lipiodol(R) was administered at the same injection sites, followed by fluoroscopy and CT acquisition. Finally, late scintigraphy and SPECT/CT were conducted, enabling the fusion of late CTL and SPECT imaging. The next day, designated SLNs were harvested, radiographically examined for Lipiodol(R) uptake and histopathologically assessed. Corresponding images of CT, Tc-99m-nanocolloid lymphoscintigraphy and SPECT/late CTL fusion were evaluated. Tc-99m-nanocolloid lymphoscintigraphy identified 21 SLNs, of which 7 were identified with CTL (33%). CTL identified no additional SLNs and failed to identify any SLNs in four patients (40%). Out of six histopathologically positive SLNs, two were identified by CTL (33%). Radiographic examination confirmed Lipiodol(R) uptake in seven harvested SLNs (24%), of which five were depicted by CTL. CTL using Lipiodol(R) reached a sensitivity of 50% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 75% (median follow-up: 12.3 months). These results suggest that CTL using Lipiodol(R) is not a reliable technique for SLN mapping in early-stage oral cancer.

TI  - Giant Aufeis-Unknown Glaciation in North-Eastern Eurasia According to Landsat Images 2013-2019
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the analysis of Landsat satellite images over the period of 2013-2019, the number (6683) and total area (4529 km(2)) of giant aufeis fields (area >= 0.1 km(2)) were estimated for the territory of North-Eastern Eurasia. The contribution of aufeis runoff to river streamflow in different seasons was calculated for 58 hydrological gauges (area 523-526,000 km(2)). The contribution of aufeis and glaciers to water balance is compared. The aufeis resources vary from 0.4 to 4.25 km(3) (or 3.7-11 mm) for individual basins of large rivers. They are at least 10.6 km(3) in total or 5 mm of water depth on average for the study area. Aufeis annual runoff varies from 0.3 to 29 mm (0.1-22%, average 3.8%), with the share in winter runoff amount about 6-712% (average 112%) and the spring freshet 0.2-43% (average 7.1%). In general, the aufeis runoff exceeds the glacial runoff. The dynamics of aufeis formation are directly related to winter runoff, whose changes are observed in different parts of the cryosphere. The presented results are relevant for studying the impact of climate change on the hydrological cycle and its components in the permafrost regions of the Northern Hemisphere.

TI  - GOES ABI Detection of Thin Cirrus over Land
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study develops a new thin cirrus detection algorithm applicable to overland scenes. The methodology builds from a previously developed overwater algorithm, which makes use of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite 16 (GOES-16) Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) channel 4 radiance (1.378-mu m "cirrus" band). Calibration of this algorithm is based on coincident Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) cloud profiles. Emphasis is placed on rejection of false detections that are more common in overland scenes. Clear-sky false alarm rates over land are examined as a function of precipitable water vapor (PWV), showing that nearly all pixels having a PWV of <0.4 cm produce false alarms. Enforcing an above-cloud PWV minimum threshold of similar to 1 cm ensures that most low-/midlevel clouds are not misclassified as cirrus by the algorithm. Pixel-filtering based on the total column PWV and the PWV for a layer between the top of the atmosphere (TOA) and a predetermined altitude H removes significant land surface and low-/midlevel cloud false alarms from the overall sample while preserving over 80% of valid cirrus pixels. Additionally, the use of an aggressive PWV layer threshold preferentially removes noncirrus pixels such that the remaining sample is composed of nearly 70% cirrus pixels, at the cost of a much-reduced overall sample size. This study shows that lower-tropospheric clouds are a much more significant source of uncertainty in cirrus detection than the land surface.

TI  - Preliminary Application of a Multi-Physical Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter in Cloud and Precipitation Forecasts
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, based on the retrieval data from the Fengyun geostationary meteorological satellite and the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite, a large-scale precipitation case in eastern China is selected to address the systematic deviations of deterministic forecasts for clouds and precipitation. A multi-physical ensemble transform Kalman filter (ETKF) is constructed in this research based on the Weather Research and Forecast model version 3.6, and its forecasting ability in terms of cloud-top height and temperature, hydrometeors, and precipitation is evaluated by quantitatively comparing three microphysical parameterization schemes (Lin, Morrison, and CAM5.1 schemes) and their corresponding multi-physical ensemble mean. The results show that the Lin, Morrison, and CAM5.1 schemes all underestimate the range of cloud systems and have different advantages and disadvantages in forecasting different elements, while the forecasting improvement of the multi-physical ensemble mean is limited. However, the multi-physical ETKF can effectively improve the forecast accuracy of the cloud system range. In addition, the multi-physical ETKF has the advantages of different physical parameterization schemes, which can dramatically improve the forecast accuracy of cloud hydrometeors, reduce precipitation forecast errors, and improve threat scores.

TI  - Creation theology and evolutionary creationism
T2  - REVISTA DE CULTURA TEOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Belief in a creator God raises profound and important questions for many of us, especially among religious people and scientists. We present in this work a theology of creation that dialogues with the science of creation, the evolutionary biology. We made a concise approach to the origins through Genesis 1 to 11, following with a focus on the theological repercussion of Darwin's work on the origin of species. We discuss four types of creationism that are the most publicized in our environment to, finally, expose and defend Evolutionary Creationism, including its theological view of human evolu-tion. This worldview is a modality of evolutionary theism that emphasizes the belief in the Triune God as the Creator and understands biological evolution as a natural process, ordered and sustained by God. We end with the perspectives of some scholars on the existential meaning of human life, the universe and its relationship with the Christian faith. Our expectation is that the clarification of concepts and the demonstration of scien-tific data can bring light to the debate between faith and science, favoring dialogue and a collaborative work. Once knowledge is well understood and disseminated, many precon-ceptions can be deconstructed. The transformed mind generates new attitudes, efficient dialogues and persuasive enlightenments.

TI  - Preventing Drift through Continued Co-Design with a First Nations Community: Refining the Prototype of a Tiered FASD Assessment
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - As part of the broader Yapatjarrathati project, 47 remote health providers and community members attended a two-day workshop presenting a prototype of a culturally-safe, tiered neurodevelopmental assessment that can identify fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) in primary healthcare. The workshop provided a forum for broad community feedback on the tiered assessment process, which was initially co-designed with a smaller number of key First Nations community stakeholders. Improvement in self-reported attendee knowledge, confidence, and perceived competence in the neurodevelopmental assessment process was found post-workshop, assessed through self-report questionnaires. Narrative analysis described attendee experiences and learnings (extracted from the workshop transcript), and workshop facilitator experiences and learnings (extracted from self-reflections). Narrative analysis of the workshop transcript highlighted a collective sense of compassion for those who use alcohol to cope with intergenerational trauma, but exhaustion at the cyclical nature of FASD. There was a strong desire for a shared responsibility for First Nations children and families and a more prominent role for Aboriginal Health Workers in the assessment process. Narrative analysis from workshop facilitator reflections highlighted learnings about community expertise, the inadvertent application of dominant cultural approaches throughout facilitation, and that greater emphasis on the First Nation's worldview and connection to the community was important for the assessment process to be maintained long-term. This study emphasised the benefit of continued co-design to ensure health implementation strategies match the needs of the community.

AB  - Purpose: The treatment paradigm for patients with anorectal melanoma eligible for sphincter-sparing excision has evolved over time. This study examines outcomes across a 30-year era in this rare disease with poor prognosis.Methods and Materials: This retrospective cohort study included all patients with pelvis-confined anorectal melanoma undergoing sphincter-sparing local excision and adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) at our institution between 1989 and 2020. Patterns of care and predictors of outcome were evaluated.Results: Of the 108 patients included, 92 (85%) presented with clinically uninvolved nodes. For clinically node-negative patients, the sentinel lymph node biopsy rate increased from 18/43 (42%) before 2008 to 38/49 (78%) subsequently and the use of inguinal nodal RT decreased from 33/35 (94%) before 2003 to 1/57 (2%) subsequently. All clinically node-positive patients treated before 2003 received inguinal nodal RT, whereas no node-positive patient treated subsequently received this treatment. Patients treated before 2016 mostly received biochemotherapy, and those treated since 2017 mostly received immune checkpoint inhibitors. With median follow-up of 32 months, 77 patients (71%) recurred. Three-year actuarial outcomes were 84% local control, 64% nodal control, 38% distant metastasisfree survival, 30% disease-free survival, and 51% melanoma-specific survival. Ostomy-free survival at last follow-up was 95%. Factors contributing to outcome were identified. Outcomes for patients treated in the contemporary era (2017+) were not significantly better than those treated earlier.Conclusions: Sphincter-sparing surgery followed by adjuvant RT results in excellent local control and ostomy-free survival for locally resectable anorectal melanoma. Overall oncologic outcomes continue to be poor, reinforcing the need to identify more effective therapies. (c) 2022 American Society for Radiation Oncology. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Spectral Indices as a Tool to Assess the Moisture Status of Forest Habitats
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Measurement of water content in forest habitats is considered essential in ecological research on forests, climate change, or forest management. In the traditional forest habitat classification, two systems of habitat conditions analysis are found: single factor and multifactor methods. Both are laborious and therefore costly. Remote sensing methods provide a low-cost alternative. The aim of the presented study was to find the relationship between the spectral indices obtained from satellite images and the forest habitats moisture indices used traditionally in the Polish forest habitats classification. The scientific hypothesis of the research is as follows: it is possible to assess the variation in the humidity of forest habitats on the basis of spectral indices. Using advanced geographic information system (GIS) technology, 923 research plots were tested, where habitat studies performed with the traditional methods were compared with the analysis of 191 spectral indices calculated for Sentinel-2 image data. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) has proved to be the most useful to the assessing of moisture of forest habitats. The ranking of the most correlated indices was calculated as E-intg-the product of the absolute value of the slope and the mean square error complement, and for the top five indices was as follows: NDVI = 0.248619, EXG = 0.242112, OSAVI = 0.239412, DSWI-4 = 0.238784, and RDVI = 0.236995. The results also highlight the impact of water reservoirs on the humidity and trophicity of forest habitats, showing a decrease in the fertility of habitats with an increase in distance from the water reservoir. The results of the study can be used to preparing maps of the diversity of forest types, especially in hard-to-reach places, as well as to assess changes in the moisture status of habitats, which may be useful, for example, in the assessment of the fire risk of forest habitats. We have proved that NDVI can be used in applications for which it was not originally designed.

TI  - Vegetation Mapping with Random Forest Using Sentinel 2 and GLCM Texture Feature-A Case Study for Lousa Region, Portugal
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation mapping requires accurate information to allow its use in applications such as sustainable forest management against the effects of climate change and the threat of wildfires. Remote sensing provides a powerful resource of fundamental data at different spatial resolutions and spectral regions, making it an essential tool for vegetation mapping and biomass management. Due to the ever-increasing availability of free data and software, satellites have been predominantly used to map, analyze, and monitor natural resources for conservation purposes. This study aimed to map vegetation from Sentinel-2 (S2) data in a complex and mixed vegetation cover of the Lousa district in Portugal. We used ten multispectral bands with a spatial resolution of 10 m, and four vegetation indices, including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI). After applying principal component analysis (PCA) on the 10 S2A bands, four texture features, including mean (ME), homogeneity (HO), correlation (CO), and entropy (EN), were derived for the first three principal components. Textures were obtained using the Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM). As a result, 26 independent variables were extracted from S2. After defining the land use classes using an object-based approach, the Random Forest (RF) classifier was applied. The map accuracy was evaluated by the confusion matrix, using the metrics of overall accuracy (OA), producer accuracy (PA), user accuracy (UA), and kappa coefficient (Kappa). The described classification methodology showed a high OA of 90.5% and kappa of 89% for vegetation mapping. Using GLCM texture features and vegetation indices increased the accuracy by up to 2%; however, classification using GLCM texture features and spectral bands achieved the highest OA (92%), indicating the texture features ' capability in detecting the variability of forest species at stand level. The ME and CO showed the highest contribution to the classification accuracy among the GLCM textures. GNDVI outperformed other vegetation indices in variable importance. Moreover, using only S2A spectral bands, especially bands 11, 12, and 2, showed a high potential to classify the map with an OA of 88%. This study showed that adding at least one GLCM texture feature and at least one vegetation index into the S2A spectral bands may effectively increase the accuracy metrics and tree species discrimination.

TI  - Global Evaluation of SMAP/Sentinel-1 Soil Moisture Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - SMAP/Sentinel-1 soil moisture is the latest SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) product derived from synergistic utilization of the radiometry observations of SMAP and radar backscattering data of Sentinel-1. This product is the first and only global soil moisture (SM) map at 1 km and 3 km spatial resolutions. In this paper, we evaluated the SMAP/Sentinel-1 SM product from different viewpoints to better understand its quality, advantages, and likely limitations. A comparative analysis of this product and in situ measurements, for the time period March 2015 to January 2022, from 35 dense and sparse SM networks and 561 stations distributed around the world was carried out. We examined the effects of land cover, vegetation fraction, water bodies, urban areas, soil characteristics, and seasonal climatic conditions on the performance of active-passive SMAP/Sentinel-1 in estimating the SM. We also compared the performance metrics of enhanced SMAP (9 km) and SMAP/Sentinel-1 products (3 km) to analyze the effects of the active-passive disaggregation algorithm on various features of the SMAP SM maps. Results showed satisfactory agreement between SMAP/Sentinel-1 and in situ SM measurements for most sites (r values between 0.19 and 0.95 and ub-RMSE between 0.03 and 0.17), especially for dense sites without representativeness errors. Thanks to the vegetation effect correction applied in the active-passive algorithm, the SMAP/Sentinel-1 product had the highest correlation with the reference data in grasslands and croplands. Results also showed that the accuracy of the SMAP/Sentinel-1 SM product in different networks is independent of the presence of water bodies, urban areas, and soil types.

TI  - Quantification of Magnetic Nanoparticles in <i>ex vivo</i> Colorectal Lymph Nodes
T2  - NANO LIFE
M3  - Article
AB  - En-bloc tumor resection is the standard treatment for locally advanced colorectal cancer (CRC). An extensive histopathological assessment is necessary to evaluate the metastatic spread and adjuvant therapy. Sentinel lymph node biopsy decreases the histopathological burden when only sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) are examined. This study aims to evaluate the spread of a magnetic tracer throughout the lymphatic system after ex vivo injection in en-bloc resected specimens of patients with CRC. To achieve this, lymph nodes (LNs) were quantified using a new magnetic detection method. Fifteen patients with CRC diagnosed with clinically negative LNs were included in this study and received 2-4 ex vivo magnetic tracer injections (total volume of 2mL). Magnetic sample series were acquired to create a look-up table for magnetic tracer quantification. In 80% of the patients, at least one magnetic LN was detected. A total of 33 LNs were marked as magnetic, containing an average of 8.1 mu g iron. In 71% of the patients, metastases were found in nonmagnetic LNs. Ex vivo injection leads to sub-optimal tracer spread and therefore inaccurate diagnosis. This study presents a novel magnetic detection method to quantify magnetic tracer in lymph nodes. Detecting the SLNs in en-bloc resected specimens and involving only these LNs in histopathological investigation enable a decrease in healthcare costs or an increased diagnostic potential.

TI  - Fusion of Different Image Sources for Improved Monitoring of Agricultural Plots
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Valencian Community, the applications of precision agriculture in multiannual woody crops with high added value (fruit trees, olive trees, almond trees, vineyards, etc.) are of priority interest. In these plots, canopies do not fully cover the soil and the planting frames are incompatible with the Resolution of Sentinel 2. The present work proposes a procedure for the fusion of images with different temporal and spatial resolutions and with different degrees of spectral quality. It uses images from the Sentinel 2 mission (low resolution, high spectral quality, high temporal resolution), orthophotos (high resolution, low temporal resolution) and images obtained with drones (very high spatial resolution, low temporal resolution). The procedure is applied to generate time series of synthetic RGI images (red, green, infrared) with the same high resolution of orthophotos and drone images, in which gray levels are reassigned from the combination of their own RGI bands and the values of the B3, B4 and B8 bands of Sentinel 2. Two practical examples of application are also described. The first shows the NDVI images that can be generated after the process of merging two RGI Sentinel 2 images obtained on two specific dates. It is observed how, after the merging, different NDVI values can be assigned to the soil and vegetation, which allows them to be distinguished (contrary to the original Sentinel 2 images). The second example shows how graphs can be generated to describe the evolution throughout the vegetative cycle of the estimated values of three spectral indices (NDVI, GNDVI, GCI) on a point in the image corresponding to soil and on another assigned to vegetation. The robustness of the proposed algorithm has been validated by using image similarity metrics.

TI  - Elevation Change of CookE2 Subglacial Lake in East Antarctica Observed by DInSAR and Time-Segmented PSInSAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, elevation change and surface morphology of CookE2, one of the most active subglacial lakes in East Antarctica, were analyzed by using Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) and a newly adapted Time-Segmented Persistent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (TS-PSInSAR) techniques. Firstly, several DInSAR pairs were used to study the surface morphology of the subglacial lake during the rapid discharge event in 2007 and the subsequent recharge in 2010 by using ALOS PALSAR data and the continuous recharge from 2018 to 2020 by using Sentinel-1 SAR data. For time-series observation from 2018 to 2020, however, simple integration of DInSAR deviates largely from the satellite altimeter data because errors from the horizontal flow of the surrounding ice field or atmospheric phase accumulate. Conventional PSInSAR deviates from the altimeter data if the LOS displacement exceeds 300 mm, i.e., approximately 1/4 of the slant range resolution of the Sentinel-1 SAR in Interferometric Wide-swath (IW) mode, during the time window. Therefore, a series of Time-Segmented PSInSAR with a 4-month time window could accurately distinguish 1.10 +/- 0.01 m/year of highly linear (R-2 = 0.99) surface rise rate of CookE2 and 0.63 m/year of horizontal deformation rate of the surrounding ice field from 2018 to 2020.

TI  - Patagonian Andes Landslides Inventory: The Deep Learning's Way to Their Automatic Detection
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslide inventories are crucial to studying the dynamics, associated risks, and effects of these geomorphological processes on the evolution of mountainous landscapes. The production of landslide maps is mainly based on manual visual interpretation methods of aerial and satellite images combined with field surveys. In recent times, advances in machine learning methods have made it possible to explore new semi-automated landslide detection methodologies using remotely detected images. In this sense, developing new artificial intelligence models based on Deep Learning (DL) opens up an excellent opportunity to automate this arduous process. Although the Andes mountain range is one of the most geomorphologically active areas on the planet, the few investigations that use DL mainly focus on mountain ranges in Europe and Asia. One of the main reasons is the low density of landslide data available in the Andean areas, making it difficult to experiment with DL models requiring large data volumes. In this work, we seek to narrow the existing gap in the availability of landslide inventories in the area of the Patagonian Andes. In addition, the feasibility and efficiency of DL techniques are studied to develop landslide detection models in the Andes from the generated datasets. To achieve this goal, we generated in a manual process a datasets of 10,000 landslides for northern Chilean Patagonia (42-45 degrees S), being the largest freely accessible landslide datasets in this region. We implement a machine learning model, through DL, to detect landslides in optical images of the Sentinel-2 constellation using a model based on the DeepLabv3+ architecture, a state-of-the-art deep learning network for semantic segmentation. Our results indicate that the algorithm detects landslides with an accuracy of 0.75 at the object level. For its part, the segmentation reaches a precision of 0.86, a recall of 0.74, and an F1-score of 0.79. The correlation of the segmentation measured through the Matthews correlation coefficient shows a value of 0.59, and the geometric similarity of the correctly detected landslides measured through the Jaccard score reaches 0.70. Although the model shows a good response in the testing area, errors are generated that can be explained by geometric and spectral relationships, which should be solved through new training approaches and data sets.

M3  - Review
AB  - Indocyanine Green is a fluorescent substance visible in near-infrared light. It is useful for the identification of anatomical structures (biliary tract, ureters, parathyroid, thoracic duct), the tissues vascularization (anastomosis in colorectal, esophageal, gastric, bariatric surgery, for plasties and flaps in abdominal wall surgery, liver resection, in strangulated hernias and in intestinal ischemia), for tumor identification (liver, pancreas, adrenal glands, implants of peritoneal carcinomatosis, retroperitoneal tumors and lymphomas) and sentinel node identification and lymphatic mapping in malignant tumors (stomach, breast, colon, rectum, esophagus and skin cancer). The evidence is very encouraging, although standardization of its use and randomized studies with higher number of patients are required to obtain definitive conclusions on its use in general surgery. The aim of this literature review is to provide a guide for the use of ICG fluorescence in general surgery procedures.

TI  - What Do We Know about Water Scarcity in Semi-Arid Zones? A Global Analysis and Research Trends
T2  - WATER
M3  - Review
AB  - Water supply is strategic for the development of society. The water distribution in nature follows patterns linked to geographic and territorial issues. Climate fluctuations aggravate shortage problems in semi-arid regions. This study aims to develop a systematic review of research on water scarcity in semi-arid areas through bibliometric methods that allow the analysis of its structure, performance, evolution, and future trends. The methodology considers three phases: (i) literature review, (ii) data cleaning and processing, and (iii) analysis of the research field and future trends. The intellectual structure of water scarcity in semi-arid zones covers 2206 documents with the collaboration of sixty-one countries, distributed in studies carried out in 54 years (1967 to 2021). This field of research has been growing, especially since the 21st century (93.1% of the documents). The countries that study the issue the most are those with high population rates and large consumption patterns, such as the United States and China. There are two central areas of interest led by the terms "water scarcity" and "water stress" due to the intensive use of the resource for agriculture and the management of the water-energy-climate nexus. Thus, the most significant journals studied relate remote sensing to resource management, and the most cited are related to agriculture. This research made it possible to consider future topics such as the study of anthropogenic effects and climate change, the accuracy and applicability of models, and future trends in conventional and unconventional agriculture and resources.

TI  - Analysis of Forest Dynamics using Landscape Metrics and Markov Chain Model in Omo Forest Reserve, Ogun State, Nigeria
T2  - Journal of Applied Sciences & Environmental Management
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest Canopy density (FCD) is an important index in the assessment and monitoring of forest ecosystems and it is a significant indicator for potential management interventions. The objective of this study was to analyse forest cover and landscape changes with Landsat images of 1990 and 2018 using FCD and Landscape metrics and, Markov Chain and CA-Markov to project the forest cover classes in Omo Forest Reserve. The FCD was obtained from the combination of data from the Advance Vegetation Density index (AVI), Bare soil index (BI), and Forest Shadow Index (FSI). Four categories of change were identified in the reserve, no change, growth, degradation, and deforestation. There was no change in 41798.79ha (44.36%), growth had 22498.11ha (23.87%), degradation with 24916.05ha (26.45%), and deforestation with the least change with 5006.43 (5.32%). Deforestation had the least area coverage with 5006.43 ha. Degradation with a change rate of 0.27 % contributed more in terms of change. There was a slight increase in the values of the three diversity indices (SHDI, SHEI, SIDI) while a high degree of homogeneity is recorded in the no forest class, and the three others classes were fragmented. The 28years projection showed a slight change with no forest area gaining 1.7% while the high forest density losing 2%. Assessment and monitoring of the forest ecosystem will enhance its ecosystem services potential.

TI  - Uncontrolled Exploitation of <i>Pterocarpus tinctorius</i> Welw. and Associated Landscape Dynamics in the Kasenga Territory: Case of the Rural Area of Kasomeno (DR Congo)
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The uncontrolled logging of Pterocarpus tinctorius Welw. in the Kasenga territory in the southeast of the Democratic Republic of the Congo is of significant socioeconomic benefit, but above all, it is a threat to the stability of forest ecosystems. Based on Landsat images from 2009, 2013, 2017 and 2021, the landscape dynamics of the Kasomeno region in the Kasenga territory, a P. tinctorius exploitation area, was quantified using a mapping approach coupled with landscape ecology analysis tools. The results reveal a continuous loss of forest cover over all the periods studied, mostly between 2013 and 2017, primarily through the dissection of patches. Also, through the spatial process of attrition, the fields recorded a regressive dynamic between 2013-2017, a sign of abandonment of agricultural activity in favour of P. tinctorius illegal logging. These landscape dynamics are the consequences of strong anthropic activities in the study area, leading to an important spatial expansion of the savannah. Consequently, the level of landscape disturbance doubled from 0.8 to 1.7 between 2009 and 2021. Our results suggest that, without regulatory enforcement, illegal logging of P. tinctorius seriously compromises forest ecosystem health and household food security in the region.

TI  - Micro-Climate Computed Machine and Deep Learning Models for Prediction of Surface Water Temperature Using Satellite Data in Mundan Water Reservoir
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Water temperature is an important indicator of water quality for surface water resources because it impacts solubility of dissolved gases in water, affects metabolic rates of aquatic inhabitants, such as fish and harmful algal blooms (HABs), and determines the fate of water resident biogeochemical nutrients. Furthermore, global warming is causing a widespread rise in temperature levels in water sources on a global scale, threatening clean drinking water supplies. Therefore, it is key to increase the frequency of spatio-monitoring for surface water temperature (SWT). However, there is a lack of comprehensive SWT monitoring datasets because current methods for monitoring SWT are costly, time consuming, and not standardized. The research objective of this study was to estimate SWT using data from the Landsat-8 (L8) and Sentinel-3 (S3) satellites. To do this, we used machine learning techniques, such as Support Vector Regression (SVR), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), simple neural network (ANN), and deep learning techniques (Long Short Term Memory, LSTM, and Convolutional Long Short Term Memory, 1D ConvLSTM). Using deep and machine learning techniques to regress satellite data to estimate SWT presents a number of challenges, including prediction uncertainty, over- or under-estimation of measured values, and significant variation in the final estimated data. The performance of the L8 ConvLSTM model was superior to all other methods (R-2 of 0.93 RMSE of 0.16 degrees C, and bias of 0.01 degrees C). The factors that had a significant effect on the model's accuracy performance were identified and quantified using a two-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) analysis. The results demonstrate that the main effects and interaction of the type of machine/deep learning (ML/DL) model and the type of satellite have statistically significant effects on the performances of the different models. The test statistics are as follows: (satellite type main effect p *** <= 0.05, F-test = 15.4478), (type of ML/DL main effect p *** <= 0.05, F-test = 17.4607) and (interaction, satellite type x type of ML/DL p ** <= 0.05, F-test = 3.5325), respectively. The models were successfully deployed to enable satellite remote sensing monitoring of SWT for the reservoir, which will help to resolve the limitations of the conventional sampling and laboratory techniques.

TI  - Mitigating Effect of Urban Green Spaces on Surface Urban Heat Island during Summer Period on an Example of a Medium Size Town of Zvolen, Slovakia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change affects the urban population's health and quality of life. Urban green spaces (UGS) underpin several essential ecosystem services, amongst them climate regulation. Urban vegetation mitigates high temperatures and, thus, reduces the heat stress for urban residents. The study aimed to verify whether the Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI) effect manifests itself even in a medium size town (Zvolen, Slovakia) surrounded by agricultural and forested landscape and to quantify the temperature mitigating effect of urban green spaces. Land surface temperature (LST) and SUHI distribution were derived from the Landsat data during the summer months of 2010-2021. To statistically prove the cooling effect of the urban vegetation, we tested (by one-way ANOVA) LST within three urban zones of the Zvolen municipality defined by the Copernicus imperviousness density data: (a) dense urban area (31-100% impervious surfaces), (b) discontinuous urban area (1-30% impervious surfaces), (c) urban green spaces (0% impervious surfaces), and the open land surrounding the town (0% impervious surfaces). The results showed a statistical difference in temperatures between all urban areas (all zones) and the open land. Moreover, the UGS temperature was statistically different compared to the other urban zones. The mean temperature difference through the years 2010-2021 between urban green spaces and the dense urban area was 3.5 degrees C, with a maximum of 4.9 degrees C and a minimum 1.7 degrees C in favor of the urban spaces. Moreover, the temperature of urban green spaces and open land varied during the studied summer period. The warmer the weather, the higher the difference, while at the end of August, on a notably colder day, there was no significant difference between them. The results confirmed that UGS are significantly cooler during hot days, and they can mitigate the local climate.

TI  - "Cool" Roofs as a Heat-Mitigation Measure in Urban Heat Islands: A Comparative Analysis Using Sentinel 2 and Landsat Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban growth, characterized by expansion of impervious at the cost of the natural landscape, causes warming and heat-related distress. Specifically, an increase in the number of buildings within an urban landscape causes intensification of heat islands, necessitating promotion of cool roofs to mitigate Urban Heat Islands (UHI) and associated impacts. In this study, we used the freely available Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 data to determine the study area's Land Use Land Covers (LULCs), roof colours and Land Surface Temperature (LST) at a 10-m spatial resolution. Support Vector Machines (SVM) classification algorithm was adopted to derive the study area's roof colours and proximal LULCs, and the Transformed Divergence Separability Index (TDSI) based on Jeffries Mathussitta distance analysis was used to determine the variability in LULCs and roof colours. To effectively relate the Landsat 8 thermal characteristics to the LULCs and roof colours, the Gram-Schmidt technique was used to pan-sharpen the 30-m Landsat 8 image data to 10 m. Results show that Sentinel 2 mapped LULCs with over 75% accuracy. Pan-sharpening the 30-m-resolution thermal data to 10 m improved the spatial resolution and quality of the Land Surface map and the correlation between LST and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) used as proxy for LULC. Green-colour roofs were the warmest, followed by red roofs, while blue roofs were the coolest. Generally, black roofs in the study area were cool. The study recommends the need to incorporate other roofing properties, such as shape, and further split the colours into different shades. Furthermore, the study recommends the use of very high spatial resolution data to determine roof colour and their respective properties; these include data derived from sensors mounted on aerial platforms such as drones and aircraft. The study concludes that with appropriate analytical techniques, freely available image data can be integrated to determine the implication of roof colouring on urban thermal characteristics, useful for mitigating the effects of Urban Heat Islands and climate change.

TI  - Modeling wildfire risk in western Iran based on the integration of AHP and GIS
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed at delineating the wildfire risk zones in a fire-prone region located in a rarely addressed area of western Iran (Paveh city) by assessing the potential of factors such as NDVI, topographic factors (elevation, slope, and aspect), land cover, and evaporation in explaining the fire occurrence probability. Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and geographical information system (GIS) methods were used synergistically to integrate the mentioned factors into analysis, following an informed categorization of each factor based on the information on previous fire occurrence. In the AHP process, elevation and evaporation data were considered to be the most critical factors. It was found that the predicted wildfire risk areas were in agreement with past fire events by the use of the methodology proposed by this study. Accordingly, the study's final wildfire risk map indicated that approximately 64.7% of the study area is located in the high-and very high-risk zones. Land-use planners and decision-makers may use the developed map to setup and implement fire prevention strategies and enhance or develop the fire-surveillance logistics and infrastructure, including but not limited to the positions of fire watchtowers, fire lines, and fire sensors, with the aim to minimize potential fire impacts.

TI  - Spatial-social evaluations of ecosystem services of adaptive aquaculture models using SAR and multivariate analyses: a case in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The presented study is conducted to investigate the efficiency of two important aquaculture models of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD)'s Soc Trang province via quantifying and mapping the supporting ecosystem services (ES). The study targets the two most prevalent rearing practices, intensive and semi-intensive, covering four rural districts: My Xuyen, Tran De, Cu Lao Dung, and Vinh Chau. A mixed-method approach was applied, combining remote sensing, grass-root social survey, and multivariate statistical analyses. First, image analysis using Sentinel-1A time-series data was conducted to detect the aquaculture areas across the study area based on temporal changes of VV backscatter of different land use/land cover (LULC) types, in which aquaculture receives relatively low backscatter values compared to other LULC categories except river and deeper water surfaces. Our analysis yields an overall accuracy of 91% with a kappa coefficient of 0.82. Second, using semi-structured questionnaires, a total of 140 shrimp farming households across the four focused districts were interviewed for their rearing experience. Thereupon, the collected responses were analyzed using two multivariate analyses, including principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA). In general, the intensive model could have generated more economic values of ecosystem services than the artisanal/semi-intensive model. Our analyses also took note of the potential barriers hindering the semi-intensive farmers from achieving higher economic income. These include (i) geographical factors, i.e., locations; (ii) social factors, i.e., experience, farming calendar, education; (iii) financial factors, i.e., investments; and (iv) technical factors, i.e., farm areas, productivity, rearing concentration. Since semi-intensive food is more appropriate for small-scale farming households, it is recommendable that addressing these factors can enhance the efficiency of this model as a profitable livelihood option.

TI  - Environmental management in Ramsar designated wetland areas in Vietnam: studies from U Minh Thuong and Tram Chim national parks (Mekong Delta)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the possibility of using remotely sensed data and field surveys for understanding the environmental management practices in two Ramsar sites - U Minh Thong and Tram Chim national parks - in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta. Enhanced agriculture, infrastructure development, changes in hydrological regime, forest fires, and natural resources exploitation are the key variables that caused the depletion of these two wetland areas. Land cover, particularly vegetation coverage, has been changed considerably during the post-war period and agriculture has been intensified in the surrounding areas of U Minh Thuong and Tram Chim wetlands. The current water management strategies in U Minh Thuong and Tram Chim were designated to ensure proper water circulation during the dry and wet seasons in a way helpful to agriculture in the buffer zones and to prevent forest fires during the dry season. It is found that the water management strategies to prevent forest fires in both the parks resulted in the accumulation of toxic agrochemicals within the park during the wet season. Both U Minh Thuong and Tram Chim wetlands are invaded by alien plant species which is threatening the natural biodiversity of the area. Proper monitoring and control of invasive species is necessary for protecting the natural biodiversity of these wetland ecosystems. Proper law enforcement and an interactive and inclusive wetland management should be practiced in order to conserve these valuable wetland ecosystems.

TI  - Mapping forest in the Swiss Alps treeline ecotone with explainable deep learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest maps are essential to understand forest dynamics. Due to the increasing availability of remote sensing data and machine learning models like convolutional neural networks, forest maps can these days be created on large scales with high accuracy. Common methods usually predict a map from remote sensing images without deliberately considering intermediate semantic concepts that are relevant to the final map. This makes the mapping process difficult to interpret, especially when using opaque deep learning models. Moreover, such procedure is entirely agnostic to the definitions of the mapping targets (e.g., forest types depending on variables such as tree height and tree density). Common models can at best learn these rules implicitly from data, which greatly hinders trust in the produced maps. In this work, we aim at building an explainable deep learning model for forest mapping that leverages prior knowledge about forest definitions to provide explanations to its decisions. We propose a model that explicitly quantifies intermediate variables like tree height and tree canopy density involved in the forest definitions, corresponding to those used to create the forest maps for training the model in the first place, and combines them accordingly. We apply our model to mapping forest types using very high resolution aerial imagery and lay particular focus on the treeline ecotone at high altitudes, where forest boundaries are complex and highly dependent on the chosen forest definition. Results show that our rule-informed model is able to quantify intermediate key variables and predict forest maps that reflect forest definitions. Through its interpretable design, it is further able to reveal implicit patterns in the manually-annotated forest labels, which facilitates the analysis of the produced maps and their comparison with other datasets.

TI  - Deep Learning Model for Global Spatio-Temporal Image Prediction
T2  - MATHEMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mathematical methods are the basis of most models that describe the natural phenomena around us. However, the well-known conventional mathematical models for atmospheric modeling have some limitations. Machine learning with Big Data is also based on mathematics but offers a new approach for modeling. There are two methodologies to develop deep learning models for spatio-temporal image prediction. On these bases, two models were built-ConvLSTM and CNN-LSTM-with two types of predictions, i.e., sequence-to-sequence and sequence-to-one, in order to forecast Aerosol Optical Thickness sequences. The input dataset for training was NASA satellite imagery MODAL2_E_AER_OD from Terra/MODIS satellites, which presents global Aerosol Optical Thickness with an 8 day temporal resolution from 2000 to the present. The obtained results show that the ConvLSTM sequence-to-one model had the lowest RMSE error and the highest Cosine Similarity value. The advantages of the developed DL models are that they can be executed in milliseconds on a PC, can be used for global-scale Earth observations, and can serve as tracers to study how the Earth's atmosphere moves. The developed models can be used as transfer learning for similar image time-series forecasting models.

M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol has always been an important factor in environmental climate, air quality, and public health. Satellite remote sensing can realize the observation of the earth's large field of view and has become one of the mainstream methods of aerosol detection. In order to understand the development status and trend of spaceborne aerosol passive optical remote sensing instruments, this paper investigates the main technical parameters of spaceborne aerosol optical remote sensing instruments in different countries in history based on multi-spectral, multi-angle, and polarization observations. Firstly, the design parameters of several typical instruments in the world and their specific applications in aerosol parameter inversion are introduced in detail. Then, the advanced remote sensing instruments to be launched are analyzed. Finally, the development direction of spaceborne aerosol passive optical remote sensing instruments in the future is summarized. In addition, the paper points out that the integration of multi-spectral observation, multi-angle observation, medium spatial resolution, large field of view, and high-precision polarization measurement is the development trend of spaceborne aerosol optical remote sensing instruments in the future.

TI  - Water Quality Retrieval from Landsat-9 (OLI-2) Imagery and Comparison to Sentinel-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Landsat series has marked the history of Earth observation by performing the longest continuous imaging program from space. The recent Landsat-9 carrying Operational Land Imager 2 (OLI-2) captures a higher dynamic range than sensors aboard Landsat-8 or Sentinel-2 (14-bit vs. 12-bit) that can potentially push forward the frontiers of aquatic remote sensing. This potential stems from the enhanced radiometric resolution of OLI-2, providing higher sensitivity over water bodies that are usually low-reflective. This study performs an initial assessment on retrieving water quality parameters from Landsat-9 imagery based on both physics-based and machine learning modeling. The concentration of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and total suspended matter (TSM) are retrieved based on physics-based inversion in four Italian lakes encompassing oligo to eutrophic conditions. A neural network-based regression model is also employed to derive Chl-a concentration in San Francisco Bay. We perform a consistency analysis between the constituents derived from Landsat-9 and near-simultaneous Sentinel-2 imagery. The Chl-a and TSM retrievals are validated using in situ matchups. The results indicate relatively high consistency among the water quality products derived from Landsat-9 and Sentinel-2. However, the Landsat-9 constituent maps show less grainy noise, and the matchup validation indicates relatively higher accuracies obtained from Landsat-9 (e.g., TSM R-2 of 0.89) compared to Sentinel-2 (R-2 = 0.71). The improved constituent retrieval from Landsat-9 can be attributed to the higher signal-to-noise (SNR) enabled by the wider dynamic range of OLI-2. We performed an image-based SNR estimation that confirms this assumption.

TI  - Comparison Among All-Sky Simulations, FY-3E MWTS-3 and FY-4A AGRI Observations of the First Typhoon Malakas in 2022
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The newly launched early morning satellite Fengyun-3E (FY-3E) helps to form a three-orbit constellation for better observing the first Typhoon Malakas in 2022. Together with MetOp-B and NOAA-20, global observations are made available 6 times daily from three temperature sounders of MWTS-3, AMSU-A, and ATMS onboard FY-3E, MetOp-B, and NOAA-20, respectively. Having channel frequencies much less than 200 GHz, brightness temperatures (TBs) at different sounding channels are linearly related to temperatures at different altitudes. This allows Malakas's warm cores to be retrieved from MWTS-3, AMST-A, and ATMS TB observations. The warm-core maxima of Malakas at 250 hPa has a single-peaked diurnal cycle, with its maximum and minimum peaking around midnight and noon, respectively. FY-3E MWTS-3 observations allowed the intensity and phase of the diurnal cycle better captured. The diurnal variations of warm core retrieved from all-sky TB simulations of the ERA5 reanalysis and National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Forecast System (GFS) analysis compared well with the three-orbit constellation retrieval. All-sky simulations of TB from the NCEP GFS analysis compared more favorably with FY-4A AGRI TB observations than those from the ERA5 reanalysis.Plain Language Summary As the world's first early morning-orbit meteorological satellite for civil use, Fengyun-3E (FY-3E) was launched successfully on 5 July 2021. The FY-3E satellite fills the vacancy of the global early morning-orbit satellite observations. This study examines an added value of FY-3E MWTS-3 for observing the first typhoon in 2022 when working together with the mid-morning-orbit MetOp-B and the afternoon-orbit NOAA-20 satellites. A temperature retrieval algorithm was applied to TB observations from four microwave temperature sounders MWTS-3, ATMS, AMSU-A and MWTS-2 onboard FY-3E, NOAA-20, MetOp-B and FY-3D, respectively. We showed that FY-3E MWTS-3 observations made a non-negligible impact on describing a single-peaked diurnal cycle of Malakas's warm cores, especially the phase of the diurnal cycle. The diurnal variations and the vertical extents of warm core retrieved from satellite TB observations compared well with those from all-sky TB simulations of the ERA5 reanalysis and National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Forecast System (GFS) analysis. Besides, All-sky simulations of TB from the NCEP GFS analysis compared more favorably with FY-4A AGRI TB observations than those from the ERA5 reanalysis.

TI  - Deforestation, plantation-related land cover dynamics and oil palm age-structure change during 1990-2020 in Riau Province, Indonesia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The expansion of plantations, such as oil palm, in Indonesia has caused large-scale deforestation. Loss of tropical forest, in particular peatland forest, is a major ecological and environmental threat as well as a source of atmospheric carbon emissions. Understanding the spatio-temporal dynamics of plantation expansion may illuminate pathways to reduce deforestation while maintaining high yields in existing plantations. Beyond mapping forest conversion to plantations, it is also important to understand post-conversion plantation success and crop age. In the case of oil palm, the typical productive lifespan is 25-30 years before replanting or conversion to other land use becomes necessary. Knowledge about the extent of oil palm in different productive growth stages is important for yield estimation and improving management strategies. This study characterizes the land-cover and land-use changes inherent to oil palm plantation expansion and age-structured oil palm dynamics across Riau, the province with the greatest production of oil palm in Indonesia, using a 30 year time-series of Landsat satellite imagery. From 1990 to 2020, Riau lost 4.63 M ha of forest, while oil palm extent grew six-fold, reaching an estimated 3.52 M ha in 2020. Rapid expansion of oil palm plantations in Riau resulted in the predominance of younger age classes (<10 yr-old) and rapidly increasing yields during 2010-2020. Conversion dynamics changed over time such that, after 2014, the <10 yr age class declined by 14%, whereas the 10-20 yr-old (peak yield stage) and > 20 yr-old (decline stage) age classes increased by 11% and 3%, respectively. In 28 years of observation (1992-2020), 41% of oil palm planted between 1990 and 1992 underwent at least one cycle of replanting in Riau.

TI  - Creation of Wildfire Susceptibility Maps in Plumas National Forest Using InSAR Coherence, Deep Learning, and Metaheuristic Optimization Approaches
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Plumas National Forest, located in the Butte and Plumas counties, has experienced devastating wildfires in recent years, resulting in substantial economic losses and threatening the safety of people. Mapping damaged areas and assessing wildfire susceptibility are necessary to prevent, mitigate, and manage wildfires. In this study, a wildfire susceptibility map was generated using a CNN and metaheuristic optimization algorithms (GWO and ICA) based on images of areas damaged by wildfires. The locations of damaged areas were identified using the damage proxy map (DPM) technique from Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data collected from 2016 to 2020. The DPMs' depicting areas damaged by wildfires were similar to fire perimeters obtained from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE). Data regarding damaged areas were divided into a training set (50%) for modeling and a testing set (50%) for assessing the accuracy of the models. Sixteen conditioning factors, categorized as topographical, meteorological, environmental, and anthropological factors, were selected to construct the models. The wildfire susceptibility models were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) and root mean square error (RMSE) analysis. The evaluation results revealed that the hybrid-based CNN-GWO model (AUC = 0.974, RMSE = 0.334) exhibited better performance than the CNN (AUC = 0.934, RMSE = 0.780) and CNN-ICA (AUC = 0.950, RMSE = 0.350) models. Therefore, we conclude that optimizing a CNN with metaheuristics considerably increased the accuracy and reliability of wildfire susceptibility mapping in the study area.

TI  - Evidence for frequency-dependent selection in House Wrens, but not Eastern Bluebirds
T2  - BIOS
M3  - Article
AB  - Frequency-dependent selection occurs when predators alter their prey choice to target abundant prey. We tested whether two species of insectivorous songbirds exhibited similar frequency-dependent selection behavior. House Wren (Troglodytes aedon) and Eastern Bluebird (Sialia sialis) routinely occupy nest boxes established over 700 acres at Missouri Western State University. During the 2018 breeding season from April through July, House Wrens consumed more sentinel prey from the color station that had previously appeared in higher frequency after four days of training. Eastern Bluebirds did not consume more of the previously abundant prey color stations and neither species showed a preference when the abundant color was reversed for the second half of the experiment which may be explained by latency in switching previously learned behaviors. Consequently, House Wrens demonstrated an initial frequency-dependent foraging strategy, but the Eastern Bluebirds did not. These results indicate how generalist insectivores that nest in the same habitat differ in their foraging strategies and behaviors.

TI  - Ancestor Christology: Re-assessing Bénézet Bujo's contribution to African theology
T2  - HORIZONTE-REVISTA DE ESTUDOS DE TEOLOGIA E CIENCIAS DA RELIGIAO
M3  - Article
AB  - Attempts at developing a Christology from a uniquely African perspective could be considered as one of the contextual expressions of Christian theological enterprise. Of course, it is clear that within the context of world Christianity, every theology is contextual. This article, which critically explores the Christological ideas of one of the foremost African theologians, Benezet Bujo, locates the many reflections about Christ within the African context. The article consistently argues for the necessity of African Christology and for a deepened understanding of Bujo's argument in making the person of Christ intelligible within Africa by deploying the traditional African category of ancestorship in this regard. Ancestorship as a Christological paradigm remains contentious as it raises a lot of questions as to its appropriateness in the understanding of Christ for African Christians. Yet, the assessment of the paradigm must go beyond seeking a logical interpretation that ties it to the predominant Christological formulations of the West to seek the meaning of revelation within the African worldview. This article, therefore, appraises the insights of Bujo and highlights the deficiencies of his arguments, while calling for more attention to its ethical and catechetical import.

TI  - New Russian synonymy in the aspect of language attraction
T2  - SIBIRSKII FILOLOGICHESKII ZHURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The turn of the 21st century showed the substantial change in the synonymic composition of the Russian language due to the intensive borrowing of Anglicisms. This study focuses on the Russian synonymy novelties caused by lexical borrowings of recent years. 1 162 synonymous paradigms, including at least one borrowing introduced into the Russian language from the late 1980s to the present day, were analyzed. The synonym fund update indicates the transformation of semantic language space and, more broadly, of its concept sphere. Thus, the material is interpreted from the position of conceptualization of the linguistic worldview based on the law of synonymic attraction. Ideographic distribution of new synonyms and assessment of the synonym series update were applied. Two assumptions underlie the study: 1) thematic groups greatly enriched with synonyms correspond to the relevant spheres; 2) synonymic series augmented with numerous new components match the important concepts. The analysis revealed the semantic areas with a high synonymic increase. Synonymy of the ideographic sphere of "Society", in particular, Internet communication, employment, equipment and IT technologies, sports and culture underwent the greatest changes, accounting for about 80 % of the synonymic rows. In the ideographic sphere of "Human", the thematic groups of "Gender, sexuality", "Hygiene, beauty procedures", "Food", "Thinking, cognition", and "Human activity" demonstrated the greatest synonymic dynamics. The sphere of "Abstract categories" revealed the "equilibrium" synonymy. Ecological safety, media fame, Internet, emoticon, and shopping center prove to be the significant concepts of modern Russian society. Also, some conclusions were made concerning the worldview, values and ideological attitudes of contemporary Russian society.

TI  - Evaluation of Satellite Images and Products for the Estimation of Regional Reference Crop Evapotranspiration in a Valley of the Ecuadorian Andes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The capabilities of images and products obtained by four satellite sensors with different spatial and temporal resolutions (LANDSAT 8, ASTER, MODIS and SENTINEL 3) were analyzed as inputs for the calculation of the reference crop evapotranspiration (ETo). The FAO Penman-Monteith equation was: (a) used in a traditional way, to calculate local values of ETo using data recorded in the existing meteorological stations in the study area; and (b) applied to estimate the regional ETo using the images and products obtained through remote sensing. The capabilities of the satellite products selected were evaluated by means of cross-validation, comparing the values obtained by the meteorological stations to the corresponding values extracted from the regional evapotranspiration maps. The coefficient of determination (R-2), the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and the root mean square error (RMSE) were calculated. The results of the study show that there is a direct correlation between the spatial resolution and the accuracy of the ETo estimates, the products of LANDSAT 8 being those that reached the greatest accuracy. Nevertheless, for continuous ETo monitoring, SENTINEL 3 is preferred.

TI  - Comparing Four Machine Learning Algorithms for Land Cover Classification in Gold Mining: A Case Study of Kyaukpahto Gold Mine, Northern Myanmar
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerous studies have been undertaken to determine the optimal land use/cover classification algorithm. However, there have not been many studies that have compared and evaluated the performance of maximum likelihood (ML), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and classification and regression trees (CART) using ASTER imagery, especially in a mining district. Therefore, this study aims to investigate land use/cover (LULC) change over three decades (1990-2020), comparing the performance of the ML, RF, SVM, and CART machine learning algorithms. The Landsat and ASTER data were retrieved using Google Earth Engine (GEE). Traditional ML classification was performed on ArcGIS 10.2 software while RF, SVM, and CART classification were undertaken on GEE. Then, thematic accuracy assessments were conducted for the four algorithms and their performances were compared. The results showed that the largest changes in area occurred in forest cover that decreased from 37.8 to 27.3 km(2) during the three decades. The remarkable expansion of gold mining occurred during 2005-2010 with the increases of 1.6%. The mining land rose by 2.9% during the study period whereas agricultural land increased significantly by 10.7% between 1990 and 2020. When comparing the four algorithms, the RF algorithm gives the highest accuracy with an overall accuracy of 95.85% while SVM follows RF with 91.69%. This study proved that RF is the best choice for optimal land use/cover classification, particularly in the mining district.

TI  - Therapeutic Benefit of Systematic Lymphadenectomy in Node-Negative Uterine-Confined Endometrioid Endometrial Carcinoma: Omission of Adjuvant Therapy
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Simple Summary Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecological tract malignancy in developed countries. Extrauterine disease, in particular lymph node metastasis, is an important prognostic factor. Nevertheless, pelvic lymphadenectomy is not considered to have a therapeutic benefit, as it did not improve survival in randomized studies. However, lymphadenectomy may have a therapeutic benefit if adjuvant therapy can be omitted without decreasing oncological outcomes, as the long-term quality of life is maintained by avoiding morbidities associated with adjuvant therapy. In intermediate- and high-risk endometrioid endometrial carcinomas, adjuvant therapy may be safely omitted without decreasing long-term survival by open surgery including systematic pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy when patients are node-negative. Systematic lymphadenectomy may remove undetectable low-volume lymph node metastasis in both pelvic and para-aortic regions, and open surgery may reduce vaginal recurrence even without vaginal brachytherapy. However, lymphadenectomy may not improve survival in elderly patients and patients with p53-mutant tumors. Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecological tract malignancy in developed countries, and its incidence has been increasing globally with rising obesity rates and longer life expectancy. In endometrial cancer, extrauterine disease, in particular lymph node metastasis, is an important prognostic factor. Nevertheless, pelvic lymphadenectomy is not considered to have a therapeutic benefit, as it did not improve survival in randomized studies. However, lymphadenectomy may have a therapeutic benefit if adjuvant therapy can be omitted without decreasing oncological outcomes, as the long-term quality of life is maintained by avoiding morbidities associated with adjuvant therapy.

However, lymphadenectomy may not improve survival in elderly patients and patients with p53-mutant tumors. In this review, I discuss the characteristics of lymph node metastasis, the methods of lymph node assessment, and the therapeutic benefits of systematic lymphadenectomy in patients with intermediate- and high-risk endometrioid endometrial carcinoma.

TI  - Relationship between densification and NDVI loss. A study using the Google Earth Engine at local scale
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL & SOCIO-ECONOMIC STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Latin American cities are amongst those with the highest rates of urbanization in the world. This process has involved their territorial expansion as well as the densification of some of its neighborhoods, in mainly central areas. This is the case of the city of Santiago del Estero (Argentina) that increased its population by 33% between 1991 and 2010 with the consequent transformations of the local space. In this context, this study analyzes the evolution of vegetated areas and densification of the central area of the city using satellite data. We analyzed two indices: normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and Urban Index (UI) time-series data, for the 1992-2011 year period, using the Google Earth Engine for processing Landsat 5 TM images. We found that the NDVI showed a decreasing trend in the timelapse under consideration, while the UI performance registered the opposite trend. The mean NDVI decreased from 0.161 (1992) to 0.103 (2011) while the UI mean increased from 0.003 to 0.036 in the same timelapse. Further, the NDVI has a strong negative correlation with UI (R-squared = -0.862). The results are consistent with the census information that recorded an important demographic and housing growth for the entire city in this period.

TI  - Hydrological Forecasting under Climate Variability Using Modeling and Earth Observations in the Naryn River Basin, Kyrgyzstan
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The availability of water resources in Central Asia depends greatly on snow accumulation in the mountains of Tien-Shan and Pamir. It is important to precisely forecast water availability as it is shared by several countries and has a transboundary context. The impact of climate change in this region requires improving the quality of hydrological forecasts in the Naryn river basin. This is especially true for the growing season due to the unpredictable climate behavior. A real-time monitoring and forecasting system based on hydrological watershed models is widely used for forecast monitoring. The study's main objective is to simulate hydrological forecasts for three different hydrological stations (Uch-Terek, Naryn, and Big-Naryn) located in the Naryn river basin, the main water formation area of the Syrdarya River. We used the MODSNOW model to generate statistical forecast models. The model simulates the hydrological cycle using standard meteorological data, discharge data, and remote sensing data based on the MODIS snow cover area. As for the forecast at the monthly scale, the model considers the snow cover conditions at separate elevation zones. The operation of a watershed model includes the effects of climate change on river dynamics, especially snowfall and its melting processes in different altitude zones of the Naryn river basin. The linear regression models were produced for monthly and yearly hydrological forecasts. The linear regression shows R-2 values of 0.81, 0.75, and 0.77 (Uch-Terek, Naryn, and Big-Naryn, respectively). The correlation between discharge and snow cover at various elevation zones was used to examine the relationship between snow cover and the elevation of the study. The best correlation was in May, June, and July for the elevation ranging from 1000-1500 m in station Uch-Terek, and 1500-3500 m in stations Naryn and Big-Naryn. The best correlation was in June: 0.87; 0.76; 0.84, and May for the elevation ranging from 1000-3500 m in station Uch-Terek, and 2000-3000 m in stations Naryn and Big-Naryn. Hydrological forecast modeling in this study aims to provide helpful information to improve our under-standing that the snow cover is the central aspect of water accumulation.

TI  - Narrative Transculturation in <i>Legends of Guatemala</i>
T2  - FORUM FOR WORLD LITERATURE STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The notion of "narrative transculturation" is postulated by Angel Rama and it is widely used in the literary analysis. This article, through textual analysis methodologies, tries to approve the hypothesis that Legends of Guatemala meets all the phases of narrative transculturation indicated by Angel Rama: the language, the narrative structure and the worldview. In short, in the language, Asturias changes and recombines some words of the indigenous language, transforming them into Spanish. In the narrative structure, the use of enumeration, repetition and onomatopoeia is very frequent, which is also one of the characteristics of Mayan works. As for the worldview, Asturias talks about the Mayan-Quiche myth and its combination with the Catholic religion, creating a mythical-magical atmosphere. All these three phases show the miscegenation between two cultures. This style also has a long-lasting influence on Asturias" works and makes him one of the precursors of the famous technique "magical realism."

TI  - Multilingual Intelligence: The Politics of Poverty, Desire and Educational Reform
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY AND DEVELOPING SOCIETIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper advocates a concept, "Multilingual Intelligence" (MI), for understanding human mind in economically challenging multilingual societies of developing nations. It examines the social, cognitive and intersubjective resources a multilingual society generates, and how these contribute to the development of human intellect. The attempt here is not to replace ontologically bounded imaginaries of old concepts and theories of intelligence with a new one, but to look at human intelligence from another lens of human capacity to trans-/multilanguage. This paper discusses two paradigmatic cases - a "Multilingual Urban Poor (MUP)" and a "Multilingual Tribal Child (MTC)"- to conceptualise Multilingual Intelligence. The logic for MI is derived from the observation that because multilinguality and orality are commonplace in most societies in India, a speaker constantly trans/multi-languages and transknowledges. She reads the minds and linguistic behaviour of the interlocutors before speaking, switches between languages to enhance mutual intelligibility and, perennially lives in the realm of translation. These social-cognitive activities generate an enormous amount of cognitive flexibility, working memory, and higher inferential and metacognitive skills, making it more possible for the children to be intersubjectively attuned. Multilingual children develop a worldview that is founded primarily on connections and not on separation. Extending the two paradigmatic cases to children from other multilingual communities, this paper reflexively engages with how linguistic diversity and constraints impact human intelligence and creativity, and, if so, what should be our politics of human psychology, education and liberation.

TI  - Identifying sand and dust storm sources using spatial-temporal analysis of remote sensing data in Central Iran
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sand and dust storms (SDS) are common meteorological phenomena in arid and semi-arid regions caused by natural or anthropogenic factors. Central Iran, covers a large area on the Iranian plateau, and SDS has been known as a prevalent phenomenon in certain parts of the region since ancient times. The frequency and severity of SDS have increased over the last two decades due to population growth and mismanagement of natural resources. Identifying SDS sources is the first step to combating this phenomenon and reducing its destructive impacts. Accordingly, this study employed a remote sensing approach based on the modeling of environmental parameters to identify high potential SDS sources in Central Iran. The proposed model was implemented through a multi-step masking procedure using 20-year time-series datasets of MODIS and TerraClimate products. According to the results, 5.3% of Central Iran is identified as high potential SDS sources. Among these, sandy sources have the largest share in terms of area (60.9%) and frequency of SDS occurrence (>50%). The highest seasonal frequency of SDS (76%) was in spring and summer. The highest yearly frequency of SDS was observed in 2008, which was 120% higher than the 20-year average (2000-2020). In sandy and salt plain sources, SDS formation is predominantly associated with natural factors. However, in lakes and alluvial sources, anthropogenic activities have been directly linked with variations in SDS frequency and extent. The occurrence of severe droughts has intensified the frequency of SDS emerging from all types of high-potential sources in Central Iran.

TI  - Acral Melanocytic Neoplasms: A Comprehensive Review of Acral Nevus and Acral Melanoma in Asian Perspective
T2  - DERMATOPATHOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Acral melanocytic neoplasms, including acral melanocytic nevus and acral melanoma, are common melanocytic lesions in Asian populations. Both lesions occur on the volar surface of the hands and feet, and on nail units. Acral melanocytic nevi occur on the arch area of the sole, whereas acral melanomas frequently occur on weight-bearing areas of the sole, and on the fingernails. Therefore, the development of acral melanoma may be associated with chronic pressure, physical stress, or trauma. Dermoscopy is a useful adjunctive diagnostic tool for differential diagnosis. Acral melanocytic nevus is characterized by a parallel furrow pattern, whereas acral melanoma has a parallel ridge pattern. Genetic alterations are also different between the two types of lesion. BRAF and NRAS mutations are common in acral melanocytic nevus, whereas acral melanoma shows lower rates of KIT, NF1, BRAF, and NRAS mutations and remarkable copy number variations in genes such as CCND1, CDK4, hTERT, PAK1, and GAB2. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is important for staging and prognosis. Contemporary treatments for melanoma include targeted therapy for mutations and immunotherapy, such as anti-PD1 inhibitors.

TI  - Less is more in endometrial cancer (SLN, conservative treatment, radical hysterectomy, molecular classification)
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of review The management of endometrial cancer has known many evolutions within the last decades. In this review, we aim to summarize recent evolutions (mainly toward less aggressive management) that have occurred in the management of endometrial cancer. Recent findings Enhanced by molecular classification, the determination of lymph node status, in young women, in case of cervical invasion, the treatment is evolving toward a less aggressive strategy. The predictive value and the safety of sentinel lymph node biopsy explain why most societies propose to abandon systematic pelvic and para aortic lymphadenectomy. For young women, the safety of fertility preservation is now well established and efficient protocols have been validated. In stage II endometrial cancer (stromal cervical invasion), radical hysterectomy appears excessive. The Cancer Genome Atlas classification increases prognostic evaluation in association with the traditional pathological classification and permits to tailor adjuvant treatment more accurately.

TI  - Impact of cloud cover on local remote sensing - Piasnica River case study
T2  - OCEANOLOGICAL AND HYDROBIOLOGICAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - New satellite-based techniques open up new horizons to researchers and local communities. Concurrently, however, requirements and expectations with regard to satel-lite-based remote sensing products are increasingly higher. By relying on satellite-derived information, environmental observations can cover areas of a few to several metres resolution. Here we are dealing with free-of-charge and generally available sources of satellite-based information. The Piasnica River mouth area was selected as an observation site representing a highly dynamic morphological transect. The paper compares products of cloud cover detection, supplied with data and available in the Copernicus database for a local area in the coastal zone of the Baltic Sea. The absolute difference did not exceed 5%, which confirms a high efficiency of the solutions offered. More than 96% of the clouded area determined for the Sentinel-2/MSI (Multispectral Instrument) was correctly identified when compared with supervised observations. The rate was lower (92%) for the Sentinel-3/OLCI (Ocean and Land Colour Instrument). It was eventually concluded that, at the local level, successful observations can be conducted using the cloud cover map supplied with the satellite data. At the same time, the analyses presented do not rule out further efforts to, e.g., increase the accuracy and speed of the analyses.

TI  - Spatial Rice Yield Estimation Using Multiple Linear Regression Analysis, Semi-Physical Approach and Assimilating SAR Satellite Derived Products with DSSAT Crop Simulation Model
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and consistent information on the area and production of field crops is vital for national and state planning and ensuring food security in India. Satellite-based remote sensing offers a suitable and cost-effective technique for regional- and national-scale crop monitoring. The use of remote sensing data for crop yield estimation has been demonstrated using a semi-physical approach with reasonable success. Assimilating remote sensing data with the DSSAT model and spectral indices-based regression analysis are promising methods for spatially estimating rice crop yields. Rice area and yield in the Cauvery delta zone of Tamil Nadu, India was estimated during samba (August-January) season in the years 2020-2021 using Sentinel 1A Synthetic Aperture Radar satellite data with three different spatial yield estimation methods, namely a spectral indices-based regression analysis, semi-physical approach, and integrating remote products with DSSAT crop growth model. A rice area map was generated for the study area using a rule-based classifier approach utilizing parameterization with a classification accuracy of 94.5% and a kappa score of 0.89. The total classified rice area in Cauvery Delta Region was 379,767 ha, and the Start of Season (SoS) maps for samba season revealed that the major planting period for rice was between 22 September and 9 November in 2020. The study also aimed to identify promising spatial yield estimation techniques for optimal rice yield prediction over large areas. Regression models resulted in rice yields of 3234 to 3905 kg ha(-1) with a mean of 3654 kg ha(-1). The net primary product was computed using the periodical PAR, fAPAR, Wstress, Tstress, and maximum radiation use efficiency in a semi-physical approach. The resultant rice yields ranged between 2652 and 3438 kg ha(-1) with the mean of 3076 kg ha(-1). During the integration of remote sensing products with crop growth models, LAI values were extracted from dB images and utilized to simulate rice yields in the range of 3684 to 4012 kg ha(-1) with the mean of 3855 kg ha(-1). When compared to the semi-physical approach, both integrating remote sensing products with the DSSAT crop growth model and spectral indices-based regression analysis had R-2 greater than 0.80, NRMSE of less than 10%, and agreement of more than 90%, indicating that these two approaches could be used for spatial rice yield estimation.

TI  - Management of Early-Stage Vulvar Cancer
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Simple Summary Vulvar cancer is a rare gynecological malignancy that affects mainly postmenopausal women. Recently, however, an alarming increase in the rates among young women has been observed due to human papillomavirus infection. The standard treatment for vulvar cancer is surgery with or without radiotherapy as adjuvant treatment. In recent decades, sentinel lymph node biopsy has been included as part of the surgical treatment. Thus, our objective was to review and discuss the advances found in the literature about early-stage vulvar cancer. For this, we searched PubMed for publications in the English language. Relevant articles, such as the GROINS-V studies, and the GOG protocols, are presented in this review exhibiting the evolution of early-stage vulvar cancer treatment and the decrease in surgical morbidity rates. Vulvar cancer is a rare gynecological malignancy since it represents 4% of all cancers of the female genital tract. The most common histological type is squamous cell carcinoma (90%). This type can be classified into two clinicopathological subtypes according to the etiology. The first subtype is associated with persistent human papillomavirus infection and is usually diagnosed in younger women. The second subtype is associated with lichen sclerosus condition, and in most cases is diagnosed in postmenopausal women. Currently, an increase in first subtype cases has been observed, which raised the concern about associated mortality and treatment morbidity among young women. Vulvar cancer treatment depends on histopathology grade and staging, but surgery with or without radiotherapy as adjuvant treatment is considered the gold standard. In recent decades, sentinel lymph node biopsy has been incorporated as part of the treatment. Therefore, we sought to review and discuss the advances documented in the literature about vulvar cancer focusing on the treatment of early-stage disease. Relevant articles, such as the GROINS-V studies and the GOG protocols, are presented in this review. Additionally, we discuss key points such as the evolution of treatment from invasive surgery with high morbidity, to more conservative approaches without compromising oncologic safety; the role of sentinel lymph node mapping in the initial staging, since it reduces the complications caused by inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy; the recurrences rates, since local recurrence is common and curable, however, groin-associated, or distant recurrences have a poor prognosis; and, finally, the long-term follow-up that is essential for all patients.

TI  - Mapping carbon content in a mountainous grassland using SPOT 5 multispectral imagery and semi-automated machine learning ensemble methods
T2  - SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional methods of determining and monitoring CO2 fluxes are limited to a small area defined by the fetch of the instrumentation and depend on extensive and expensive field-work. Remote sensing, however, enables monitoring studies in a wide area at constant time periods and is likely to be more robust and adapted to a wider range of environmental conditions than the measurements taken from conventional instruments. In this study, we investigated the potential of using a multispectral sensor with moderate spectral capabilities (4 bands) to remotely detect and map the content of carbon over a mountainous rural rangeland in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The results showed that the spatial and spectral resolution of the SPOT 5 satellite can effectively map carbon across a rangeland using two contemporary ensemble models. More specifically, the study demonstrated that random forest (RF) produced the best correlation coefficient of 0.71 with an RMSE of 9 when compared to the correlation coefficient of 0.68 and RMSE of 20 when using the stochastic gradient boosting (SGB). Overall, this study provided a framework for utilising efficient ensemble methods to automatically predict grass carbon over a mountainous region while exploiting the SPOT 5 spectral bands. The study found that the SWIR, Green, and NIR spectral regions were the top three most effective bands. (C) 2022 The Author(s).

TI  - Intelligent Reflecting Surface-Assisted Interference Mitigation With Deep Reinforcement Learning for Radio Astronomy
T2  - IEEE ANTENNAS AND WIRELESS PROPAGATION LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Radio frequency interference (RFI) is a significant threat to astronomical observations. Thus, this letter exploits the intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) to mitigate RFI by adjusting the reflection coefficients of IRSs. Aiming to synthesize a spatial quiet zone in the control area of a radio telescope, an optimization problem for joint multiple reflected beamforming at IRSs is formulated. As the interference behavior and direction are dynamic, an IRS relative position encoding attention deep deterministic policy gradient (RPEA-DDPG) learning algorithm is proposed to jointly optimize the reflected beamforming of IRSs without the knowledge of the interference model. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed technique can effectively establish an open electromagnetic field quiet zone to prevent RFI from entering the receiver.

TI  - Generating a Long-Term Spatiotemporally Continuous Melt Pond Fraction Dataset for Arctic Sea Ice Using an Artificial Neural Network and a Statistical-Based Temporal Filter
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The melt pond fraction (MPF) is an important geophysical parameter of climate and the surface energy budget, and many MPF datasets have been generated from satellite observations. However, the reliability of these datasets suffers from short temporal spans and data gaps. To improve the temporal span and spatiotemporal continuity, we generated a long-term spatiotemporally continuous MPF dataset for Arctic sea ice, which is called the Northeast Normal University-melt pond fraction (NENU-MPF), from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. First, the non-linear relationship between the MODIS reflectance/geometries and the MPF was constructed using a genetic algorithm optimized back-propagation neural network (GA-BPNN) model. Then, the data gaps were filled and smoothed using a statistical-based temporal filter. The results show that the GA-BPNN model can provide accurate estimations of the MPF (R-2 = 0.76, root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.05) and that the data gaps can be efficiently filled by the statistical-based temporal filter (RMSE = 0.047; bias = -0.022). The newly generated NENU-MPF dataset is consistent with the validation data and with published MPF datasets. Moreover, it has a longer temporal span and is much more spatiotemporally continuous; thus, it improves our knowledge of the long-term dynamics of the MPF over Arctic sea ice surfaces.

TI  - Application of Geospatial Techniques to Determine Coastal Erosion and Accretion along the Ramanathapuram Shore, Tamil Nadu, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The coastal region is one of the most sensitive areas on earth. This region has a diversified ecosystem. Erosion and accretion are common natural phenomena that can be seen in this region. In some circumstances, these changes become hazardous to the coastal ecosystem. Natural processes such as rainfall, flood, cyclone, longshore drift, and tectonic shifts can trigger irregular coastal changes. Similarly, anthropogenic factors such as urbanization, unscientific land usage, mining, etc., enhance coastal dynamics and make larger changes. Hence identification of such region has great importance. Geospatial technology has brought various advanced methods for shoreline change studies. It has decreased the huge effort for getting an accurate result for a larger area. Landsat satellite imageries with 30 m spatial resolution have been used for studying the changes in the shoreline of Ramanathapuram for the years 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2020. In Geographic Information System (GIS) software, the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) tool is added for shoreline change analysis. DSAS will build the baseline transects. The rate of shoreline change was calculated using the MATLAB feature runtime function for ArcGIS. Based on the DSAS output, the region of high erosion, low erosion, stable, and low accretion, high accretion zones have been identified on the shore. The results reveal that 5.1% of the shoreline, around 9.3 km is under high erosion, 11.5% of the shoreline, which is around 20.8 km, is under low erosion, 71% of the shoreline, around 128 km, is a stable region, 6.7% of shorelines, around 12 km, have low accretion, and 5.6% of shorelines, around 10.1 km, have high accretion. The coastal villages, namely, Mayakulam, Keelakakrai, Periapattinam, Mandapam, West-Pamban, and East-Rameswaram, have a high erosion with a maximum rate of change between 2.29 to 5.11 m/y. The coastal villages Ervadi, Kalimankund, Sattankonvalsai, South-Pamban and South-Rameswaram have high accretion with a maximum rate of change between 2.34 to 5.24 m/y.

TI  - Land Subsidence Detection in the Coastal Plain of Tabasco, Mexico Using Differential SAR Interferometry
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Land subsidence (LS) increases flood vulnerability in coastal areas, coastal plains, and river deltas. The coastal plain of Tabasco (TCP) has been the scene of recurring floods, which caused economic and social damage. Hydrocarbon extraction is the main economic activity in the TCP and could be one of the causes of LS in this region. This study aimed to investigate the potential of differential SAR interferometric techniques for LS detection in the TCP. For this purpose, Sentinel-1 SLC descending and ascending images from the 2018-2019 period were used. Conventional DInSAR, together with the differential interferograms stacking (DIS) approach, was applied. The causes of interferometric coherence degradation were analyzed. In addition, Sentinel-1 GRD images were used for delimitation of areas recurrently affected by floods. Based on the results of the interferometric processing, several subsiding zones were detected. The results indicate subsidence rates of up to -6 cm/yr in the urban centers of Villahermosa, Paraiso, Comalcalco, and other localities. The results indicate the possibility of an influence of LS on the flood vulnerability of the area south of Villahermosa city. They also suggest a possible relationship between hydrocarbon extraction and surface deformation.

TI  - Inter-Calibration and Statistical Validation of Topside Ionosphere Electron Density Observations Made by CSES-01 Mission
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The China Seismo-Electromagnetic Satellite (CSES-01) provides in situ electron density (Ne) observations through Langmuir probes (LPs) in the topside ionosphere since February 2018. CSES-01 is a sun-synchronous satellite probing the ionosphere around two fixed local times (LTs), 14 LT in the daytime sector and 02 LT in the night-time sector, at an altitude of about 500 km. Previous studies evidenced that CSES-01 seems to underestimate Ne measurements with respect to those acquired by similar satellites or obtained from different instruments. To overcome this issue, we calibrated CSES-01 LP Ne observations through Swarm B satellite data, which flies approximately at CSES-01 altitude. As a first step, Swarm B LP Ne observations were calibrated through Faceplate (FP) Ne observations from the same satellite. Such calibration allowed solving the Ne overestimation made by Swarm LP during nighttime for low solar activity. Then, the calibrated Swarm B LP Ne observations were used to calibrate CSES-01 Ne observations on a statistical basis. Finally, the goodness of the proposed calibration procedure was statistically assessed through a comparison with Ne observations by incoherent scatter radars (ISRs) located at Jicamarca, Arecibo, and Millstone Hill. The proposed calibration procedure allowed solving the CSES-01 Ne underestimation issue for both daytime and nighttime sectors and brought CSES-01 Ne observations in agreement with corresponding ones measured by Swarm B, ISRs, and with those modelled by the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI). This is a first fundamental step towards a possible future inclusion of CSES-01 Ne observations in the dataset underlying IRI for the purpose of improving the description of the topside ionosphere made by IRI.

TI  - Interpretation of multispectral satellite data as a tool for detecting archaeological artifacts (Navkur Plain and Karamleis Plain, Iraq)
T2  - ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Contemporary studies of geographical space, including archaeological research, incorporate multiple spatial digital data. Such data provide an opportunity to extend research to large areas, and to objectify studies on the basis of quantitative data thus obtained and gaining access to the hard-to-reach study area. Examples of such data are satellite images at various spatial resolutions and in a wide spectrum of electromagnetic radiation (visible, infrared, and microwave). The authors made an attempt to use satellite images to analyze the areas of probable location of the Battle of Gaugamela (the Navkur Plain and the Karamleis Plain in Iraq). The photointerpretation was performed, enhanced by the multivariate processing of the multispectral image. The aim of the work was indicating the most likely places where the camp and the battle were located based on the visual interpretation of an array of satellite data. The adopted methodology of precise allocation of interpretative values to remote sensing materials for every detected artifact provided an opportunity to accumulate an extensive amount of information. It also provided the basis for a synthetic analysis regarding the methods of image processing on the one hand and the dates of recording on the other. It turned out that the season in which the photos are recorded is very important-although the best data for analysis turned out to be the autumn data (38% of all recognized artifacts), the use of data from three seasons increased the total number of indicated artifacts by as much as about 50% (the so-called unique detections). In addition, advanced image processing (such as principal component analysis and decorrelation stretch) turned out to be important, as it increased the number of areal artifacts by 31% compared to the interpretation of only photos in natural (true) color composite and false color composite (with near-infrared). The conducted analyses have confirmed the usefulness of high-resolution satellite data for archaeological applications, and the detected and described anomalies visible in satellite images are excellent material for selecting sites for detailed field research.

TI  - An automatic method for subpixel registration of KMSS-M imagery based on coarse-resolution actualized reference
T2  - COMPUTER OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper describes a method for automatic subpixel-accurate geographic referencing of imagery acquired by KMSS-M with 60 m spatial resolution, based on leveraging a coarse, reconstructed, cloud-free and daily updated MODIS surface reflectance reference image. The method is based on maximizing Pearson's correlation value when determining an optimal local displacement of the distorted image fragment by comparing with the reference image. To assess the effectiveness of the method when used over continental-scale and heterogeneous areas, three experiments were carried out providing quantitative estimates of imagery registration errors: an experiment with model datasets, an experiment to estimate the absolute registration error of MODIS reference imagery, and an experiment to estimate the registration error of geocorrected KMSS-M data. Experimental evaluation of the method based on model datasets of decameter-resolution Sentinel-2 (MSI) imagery demonstrated its robustness when used over a variety of environmental conditions over a one year-long observation period. The average georeferencing error of MODIS coarseresolution reference was shown to be less than 20 meters in Red and Near-infrared bands. Corrected KMSS-M imagery evaluation over the Russian Grain Belt within 2020 has shown, on average, the subpixel referencing accuracy both in Red and Near-infrared bands, while the average absolute georeferencing error of the original uncorrected KMSS-M imagery was shown to be about 3 kilometers. Subpixel registration accuracy of KMSS-M imagery, corrected with MODIS-based coarse-resolution reference, opens new prospects for using multi-temporal analysis of this multispectral surface reflectance data in a variety of scientific and practical applications associated with vegetation cover satellite monitoring. The technological flexibility of the method ensures its applicability to data from other satellite systems for Earth optical remote sensing.

TI  - The relationship between mucilage covered areas and chlorophyll-a concentration: The sea of Marmara case
T2  - SIGMA JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND NATURAL SCIENCES-SIGMA MUHENDISLIK VE FEN BILIMLERI DERGISI
M3  - Article
AB  - Today, mucilage, or as it is known by the people, sea saliva, which directly affects the natural life and trade opportunities of the Marmara Sea, has more and more serious consequences day by day. The rapid detection of the spreading areas of the mucilage is of great importance for the cleaning works to be carried out. Remote sensing satellites have the great advantage of detecting the mucilage layer on the sea surface and studying its propagation. It has an important place in monitoring the change in that region over time and associating it with other ecological analysis, especially thanks to the ability to take images from the same region with frequent repetitions. Within the scope of this study, the mucilage distribution areas on the sea surface in the Dardanelles Strait, Gemlik Bay and Izmit Bay were investigated temporally and the concentration of chlorophyll-a, which is the main component organic matter of phytoplankton, and it is also the main cause of mucilage in the sea, was investigated and associated with mucilage areas. The satellite images used in the study were obtained from the Sentinel-2 multispectral optical satellite and the areas were determined by interpreting the images before and after mucilage propagation. Normalized Water Index (NDWI), a band index, was used to determine the mucilage area. As a result of the analysis, the mucilage rates in the sea were determined from the images on the dates used in the study. These rates were found as approximately 2.03% in the Dardanelles Strait, approximately 6.80% and 3.52% in the Gulf of Gemlik, where satellite images were examined at 10-day intervals, and approximately 7.44% in the Gulf of Izmit. When we look at the increase in the chlorophyll-a concentration in the sea for the same regions and dates, it is detected as about 0.84% in the Dardanelles Strait, 272.64% and 84.06% in the Gulf of Gemlik, and 8.22% in the Gulf of Izmit. When we look at the results, it is understood that the chlorophyll-a concentration and the spread of the mucilage layer are related to each other. In the light of these results, it is expected that using remote sensing techniques can be easily used for detecting mucilage, which is formed on the sea surface and spreads over large areas, and be a preliminary analysis study for rapid interventions.

TI  - Critical Dynamics in Stratospheric Potential Energy Variations Prior to Significant (M &gt; 6.7) Earthquakes
T2  - SYMMETRY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Lithosphere-atmosphere-ionosphere coupling (LAIC) is studied through various physical or chemical quantities, obtained from different sources, which are observables of the involved complex processes. LAIC has been proposed to be achieved through three major channels: the chemical, the acoustic, and the electromagnetic. Accumulated evidence supporting the acoustic channel hypothesis has been published, while atmospheric gravity waves (AGWs) play a key role in LAIC as the leading mechanism for the transmission of energy from the lower atmosphere to the stratosphere and mesosphere, associated with atmospheric disturbances observed prior to strong earthquakes (EQs). The seismogenic AGW is the result of temperature disturbances, usually studied through stratospheric potential energy (E-P). In this work, we examined 11 cases of significant EQs (M > 6.7) that occurred during the last 10 years at different geographic areas by analyzing the temperature profile at the wider location of each one of the examined EQs. The "Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry" (SABER) instrument, part of the "Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics Dynamics" (TIMED) satellite, data were employed to compute the potential energy (E-P) of the AGW. Using the temperature profile, we first calculated E-P and determined the altitudes' range for which prominent pre-seismic disturbances were observed. Subsequently, the E-P time series at specific altitudes, within the determined "disturbed" range, were for the first time analyzed using the criticality analysis method termed the "natural time" (NT) method in order to find any evidence of an approach to a critical state (during a phase transition from a symmetric phase to a low symmetry phase) prior to the EQ occurrence. Our results show criticality indications in the fluctuation of E-P a few days (1 to 15 days) prior to the examined EQs, except from one case. In our study, we also examined all of the temperature-related extreme phenomena that have occurred near the examined geographic areas, in order to take into account any possible non-seismic influence on the obtained results.

TI  - Evaluation of urban green space per capita with new remote sensing and geographic information system techniques and the importance of urban green space during the COVID-19 pandemic
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A recently conducted study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention encouraged access to urban green space for the public over the prevalence of COVID-19 in that exposure to urban green space can positively affect the physical and mental health, including the reduction rate of heart disease, obesity, stress, stroke, and depression. COVID-19 has foregrounded the inadequacy of green space in populated cities. It has also highlighted the extant inequities so as to unequal access to urban green space both quantitatively and qualitatively. In this regard, it seems that one of the problems related to Malatya is the uncoordinated distribution of green space in different parts of the city. Therefore, knowing the quantity and quality of these spaces in each region can play an effective role in urban planning. The aim of the present study has been to evaluate urban green space per capita and to investigate its distribution based on the population of the districts of Battalgazi county in Malatya city through developing an integrated methodology (remote sensing and geographic information system). Accordingly, in Google Earth Engine by images of Sentinel-1 and PlanetScope satellites, it was calculated different indexes (NDVI, EVI, PSSR, GNDVI, and NDWI). The data set was prepared and then by combining different data, classification was performed according to support vector machine algorithm. From the landscaping maps obtained, the map was selected with the highest accuracy (overall accuracy: 94.43; and kappa coefficient: 90.5). Finally, by the obtained last map, the distribution of urban green space per capita and their functions in Battalgazi county and its districts were evaluated. The results of the study showed that the existing urban green spaces in the Battalgazi/Malatya were not distributed evenly on the basis of the districts. The per capita of urban green space is twenty-four regions which is more than 9m(2) and in twenty-three ones is less than 9m(2). The recommendation of this study was that Turkiye city planners and landscape designers should replan and redesign the quality and equal distribution of urban green spaces, especially during and following COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, drawing on the Google Earth Engine cloud system, which has revolutionized GIS and remote sensing, is recommended to be used in land use land cover modeling. It is straightforward to access information and analyze them quickly in Google Earth Engine. The published codes in this study makes it possible to conduct further relevant studies.

TI  - The European Experience of Religious Education and Education on Religions in Modern Russia
T2  - CONTEMPORARY EUROPE-SOVREMENNAYA EVROPA
M3  - Article
AB  - Modern models of teaching about religion in the Russian educational system in a peculiar way refract the novelty of the presence of religion in secular education. The research proposes the hypothesis about the evolution of religious education towards a non-confessional worldview course. According to this hypothesis, the relevance of such a subject in a modern school is a natural and inevitable trend. The author makes a number of arguments in favor of a non-confessional subject focused on the discussion of worldview problems of concern to adolescents. The implementation of this subject is assumed in the format of the interested discussion. The basic principle of the non-confessional approach is interaction with more than one religion - "learning from religions". Its ideological foundation is the "ethics of multi-confessionalism" in accordance with which religions include comparable systems of moral behavior. A number of factors: the ethno-religious diversity of modern societies, the instability of the identities of a modern person who is constantly looking for oneself and, as a "nomadic subject", every day "invents" oneself and one's communities, determine the demand for a non-confessional worldview course. The non-confessional approach is based on the principle of "learning from religion". It involves the construction of mental structures together with the students instead of a simple presentation of humanistic universal values to students. This leads to an understanding of the significance of these values, and, as a result, to the development of the attitudes based on these values. Such approach contributes to the achievement of a consensus between different ethical and theological concepts.

TI  - Development of a Multi-Scale Tomato Yield Prediction Model in Azerbaijan Using Spectral Indices from Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the development and update of a multi-scale yield prediction model for processing tomatoes. The study was carried out under the EU-funded programme "Support to Development of a Rural Business Information System (RBIS)", and the performance of the updated crop-specific yield prediction models and their generated predictions at regional and national levels are presented. The model was built using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery to obtain cumulative values of six (6) selected vegetation indices (VIs). The data were collected on five (5) different dates for processing tomato fields in the Khachmaz region of Azerbaijan during summer 2021 (June to August) at 10- to 13-day intervals. In addition, a targeted field sampling campaign was conducted on selected Khachmaz pilot fields towards the end of the growing season to assess the potential of Sentinel-2 data to determine yield variability in tomato fields. Finally, actual recorded yields were collected at the field level to build the yield prediction regression model and evaluate its performance at different spatial scales, ranging from single field to national level, as well as under different data availability scenarios (number of consecutive Sentinel-2 images used). The results showed a high degree of correlation between all implemented VIs and processing tomato yield, with a coefficient of determination of up to 0.89 for the NDVI, providing valuable information for future estimates of tomato production across multiple spatial scales. The developed prediction model could also be used in the agri-food sector for national yield estimates to support policy and regulatory decisions at the national level.

TI  - Optical Remote Sensing Image Cloud Detection with Self-Attention and Spatial Pyramid Pooling Fusion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud detection is a key step in optical remote sensing image processing, and the cloud-free image is of great significance for land use classification, change detection, and long time-series landcover monitoring. Traditional cloud detection methods based on spectral and texture features have acquired certain effects in complex scenarios, such as cloud-snow mixing, but there is still a large room for improvement in terms of generation ability. In recent years, cloud detection with deep-learning methods has significantly improved the accuracy in complex regions such as high-brightness feature mixing areas. However, the existing deep learning-based cloud detection methods still have certain limitations. For instance, a few omission alarms and commission alarms still exist in cloud edge regions. At present, the cloud detection methods based on deep learning are gradually converted from a pure convolutional structure to a global feature extraction perspective, such as attention modules, but the computational burden is also increased, which is difficult to meet for the rapidly developing time-sensitive tasks, such as onboard real-time cloud detection in optical remote sensing imagery. To address the above problems, this manuscript proposes a high-precision cloud detection network fusing a self-attention module and spatial pyramidal pooling. Firstly, we use the DenseNet network as the backbone, then the deep semantic features are extracted by combining a global self-attention module and spatial pyramid pooling module. Secondly, to solve the problem of unbalanced training samples, we design a weighted cross-entropy loss function to optimize it. Finally, cloud detection accuracy is assessed. With the quantitative comparison experiments on different images, such as Landsat8, Landsat9, GF-2, and Beijing-2, the results indicate that, compared with the feature-based methods, the deep learning network can effectively distinguish in the cloud-snow confusion-prone region using only visible three-channel images, which significantly reduces the number of required image bands. Compared with other deep learning methods, the accuracy at the edge of the cloud region is higher and the overall computational efficiency is relatively optimal.

TI  - Air pollution from agricultural fires increases hypertension risk?
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In many parts of the developing world, farmers widely use deliberate fires to burn vegetation and clear land to plant crops. These agricultural fires, however, are known to be associated with health costs due to increased air pollution. We contribute to underpinning the associated health cost estimates by studying the effects of these fires on hypertension risk. Despite being one of the leading causes of mortality globally, there is little direct evidence on how hypertension risk changes with exposure to pollution from agricultural fires. To overcome common data and empirical challenges in this setting, we match blood pressure readings from nearly 784,000 individuals across India with satellite data on 1.2 million agricultural fires, wind direction realizations, and local ambient air pollution. We find that the incidence of hypertension increases by 1.8% for each standard deviation increase in the number of upwind fires observed one day before the blood pressure readings. We find that the impact is stronger among older males, smokers, individuals that were already on blood pressure medication, and individuals belonging to socially marginalized groups. Our estimates suggest that agricultural fires in India lead to hypertension-related additional mortality, associated with USD 9 billion annually in costs.

TI  - Effects of Anthropogenic Emission Control and Meteorology Changes on the Inter-Annual Variations of PM<sub>2.5</sub>-AOD Relationship in China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We identified controlling factors of the inter-annual variations of surface PM2.5-aerosol optical depth (AOD) relationship in China from 2006 to 2017 using a nested 3D chemical transport model-GEOS-Chem. We separated the contributions from anthropogenic emission control and meteorological changes by fixing meteorology at the 2009 level and fixing anthropogenic emissions at the 2006 level, respectively. Both observations and model show significant downward trends of PM2.5/AOD ratio (eta, p < 0.01) in the North China Plain (NCP), the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and the Pearl River Delta (PRD) in 2006-2017. The model suggests that the downward trends are mainly attributed to anthropogenic emission control. PM2.5 concentration reduces faster at the surface than aloft due to the closeness of surface PM2.5 to emission sources. The Pearson correlation coefficient of surface PM2.5 and AOD (r(PM-AOD)) shows strong inter-annual variations (+/- 27%) but no statistically significant trends in the three regions. The inter-annual variations of r(PM-AOD) are mainly determined by meteorology changes. Except for the well-known effects from relative humidity, planetary boundary layer height and wind speed, we find that temperature, tropopause pressure, surface pressure and atmospheric instability are also important meteorological elements that have a strong correlation with inter-annual variations of r(PM-AOD) in different seasons. This study suggests that as the PM2.5-AOD relationship weakens with reduction of anthropogenic emissions, validity of future retrieval of surface PM2.5 using satellite AOD should be carefully evaluated.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variations of XCH<sub>4</sub> across China during 2003-2021 Based on Observations from Multiple Satellites
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric methane (CH4) is an important greenhouse gas that can reflect variations of CH4 emissions and sinks. This study aimed to detect spatial and temporal variations of atmospheric CH4 concentrations in China during 2003-2021 based on CH4 column-averaged dry-air mole fraction (XCH4) products from three satellites, namely, Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Chartography (SCIAMACHY), Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT), and Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P). The results revealed that XCH4 observed from three satellites showed high agreement in spatiotemporal variations and demonstrated good consistency with ground station measurements. The correlation coefficients (r) between the three satellites were 0.72 and 0.73, and the correlation coefficients for the ground stations were 0.79, 0.66, 0.03, 0.21, 0.70, and 0.80. The spatial distribution of XCH4 in China was generally high in the east and low in the west and close to that of CH4 emissions, indicating that CH4 emission sources dominated the spatial variations of atmospheric XCH4. From 2003 to 2006, XCH4 remained stable with an annual growth rate of 0.51 ppb center dot yr(-1) and then abruptly increased with an overall growth rate of 6.96 ppb center dot yr(-1). There were obvious seasonal changes in XCH4, with peaks in autumn and summer and nadir in winter and spring. These seasonal variations of XCH4 were related to CH4 emissions from rice planting. Rice cultivation areas generally had high XCH4 concentrations, and the growth cycle of rice plants significantly contributed to seasonal variations of XCH4 in the main rice planting areas. These results provide scientific data that could encourage decision-makers to enact policies and processes to reduce methane emissions.

TI  - Investigation of fire risk zones using heat-humidity time series data and vegetation
T2  - APPLIED WATER SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires destroy these areas and have devastating and harmful socio-economic and environmental effects. One of the methods of preventing and managing the hazards created in the field of forest fires is to determine the range of fire risk. The purpose of this study is to determine the high-risk areas of fire in the forests of Golestan province using remote sensing data and field information. For this purpose, the data of MODIS satellite during the years 2005 to 2020 for the middle of November to mid-February, which is the peak of the fire occurrence, were prepared. (NDVI) vegetation index, (NDMI) plant moisture stress index and (LST) land surface temperature were extracted as a 15-year average in these months. Then, using precipitation data from meteorological stations, precipitation index (SPI) was calculated as an average to estimate the amount of drought for the mentioned years. By combining the mentioned indices, the areas with fire risk were extracted. Then, previous fire reference data were used to validate the obtained results of the study. The results of fire potential map evaluation showed that about 6.39% of the area has very high potential, indicating that about 65.78% of fire risk points have been located in this area and about 56.32% of the area is in moderate-fire-risk position, encompassing about 23.16% of the areas with fire risk. Finally, a low-risk zone encompassing 36.34% of the area, which about 11.06% of the high-fire-risk areas are located in this area. Also, the indices of NDMI, NDVI, SPI and LST precipitation have a degree of correlation of 74. 58%, 60.1%, 47.11% and 41. 02% with the map of fire points, respectively.

TI  - GIS-Based Cropland Suitability Prediction Using Machine Learning: A Novel Approach to Sustainable Agricultural Production
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Review
AB  - The increasing global demand for food has forced farmers to produce higher crop yields in order to keep up with population growth, while maintaining sustainable production for the environment. As knowledge about natural cropland suitability is mandatory to achieve this, the aim of this paper is to provide a review of methods for suitability prediction according to abiotic environmental criteria. The conventional method for calculating cropland suitability in previous studies was a geographic information system (GIS)-based multicriteria analysis, dominantly in combination with the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). Although this is a flexible and widely accepted method, it has significant fundamental drawbacks, such as a lack of accuracy assessment, high subjectivity, computational inefficiency, and an unsystematic approach to selecting environmental criteria. To improve these drawbacks, methods for determining cropland suitability based on machine learning have been developed in recent studies. These novel methods contribute to an important paradigm shift when determining cropland suitability, being objective, automated, computationally efficient, and viable for widespread global use due to the availability of open data sources on a global scale. Nevertheless, both approaches produce invaluable complimentary benefits to cropland management planning, with novel methods being more appropriate for major crops and conventional methods more appropriate for less frequent crops.

TI  - Aquifer and Land Subsidence Interaction Assessment Using Sentinel-1 Data and DInSAR Technique
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change and overpopulation have led to an increase in water demands worldwide. As a result, land subsidence due to groundwater extraction and water level decline is causing damage to communities in arid and semiarid regions. The agricultural plain of Samalghan in Iran has recently experienced wide areas of land subsidence, which is hypothesized to be caused by groundwater overexploitation. This hypothesis was assessed by estimating the amount of subsidence that occurred in the Samalghan plain using DInSAR based on an analysis of 25 Sentinel-1 descending SAR images over 6 years. To assess the influence of water level changes on this phenomenon, groundwater level maps were produced, and their relationship with land subsidence was evaluated. Results showed that one major cause of the subsidence in the Samalghan plain was groundwater overexploitation, with the highest average land subsidence occurring in 2019 (34 cm) and the lowest in 2015 and 2018 (18 cm). Twelve Sentinel-1 ascending images were used for relative validation of the DInSAR processing. The correlation value varied from 0.69 to 0.89 (an acceptable range). Finally, the aquifer behavior was studied, and changes in cultivation patterns and optimal utilization of groundwater resources were suggested as practical strategies to control the current situation.

AB  - Science users typically obtain data from authoritative or trusted sources referred to as repositories. An authoritative source is defined as an entity that is approved by a legal entity to develop or manage data for a specific purpose [4], [5]. Different government agencies generating Earth observation (EO) data are one example. An authoritative source can also be an actively managed repository of valid or trusted data that is recognized by a community and supports data governance and stewardship practices. One can also have secondary sources that serve as trusted sources and provide trusted data [6]. A trusted source can be a service provider or an organization that publishes data obtained from a number of authoritative sources. These publications are often compilations and subsets of the data from more than one authoritative source. They are "trusted" because there is an "official process and/or agreement" for compiling the data from authoritative sources, data are actively managed, and the limitations, currency, and attributes are known and documented. NASA mirroring Sentinel-1 data from the European Space Agency is one such example of a trusted source.

T2  - REVISTA CHAPINGO SERIE CIENCIAS FORESTALES Y DEL AMBIENTE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The spread of agricultural use leads to changes in vegetation cover, loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Objective: To analyze land use change and its effect on natural vegetation in the region of Los Rios, Tabasco, Mexico, during the period 1947-2019.Materials and methods: A total of 14 land use and vegetation classes were identified using aerial photographs from 1947 and supervised classification of satellite images, verifying those from 1947 to 2000 with published cartography and those from 2019 (Landsat 8) in the field. Land use and vegetation cover change was analyzed by overlaying and comparing the maps with the Land Change Modeler module integrated in the TerrSet program.Results and discussion: In 72 years, natural vegetation was mostly replaced by crops, grassland and forest plantations, followed by human settlements. These uses, together, represented 14.2 % of the region's surface and increased to 61.8 %; that is, an increase of 435 %. These uses replaced areas of rainforest, secondary vegetation and hydrophytes, which went from 82.3 % to 29.7 %, representing a loss of 64 % of these coverages. Between 1947 and 1984, natural vegetation suffered the greatest loss of area (53.7 %).Conclusions: The loss of natural vegetation in the region occurred because of the increase in agricultural land and human settlements. The increase in agricultural land was driven by government programs without considering the environmental factor.

TI  - Remote Sensing-Based Prediction of Temporal Changes in Land Surface Temperature and Land Use-Land Cover (LULC) in Urban Environments
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Pakistan has the highest rate of urbanization in South Asia. The climate change effects felt all over the world have become a priority for regulation agencies and governments at global and regional scales with respect assessing and mitigating the rising temperatures in urban areas. This study investigated the temporal variability in urban microclimate in terms of land surface temperature (LST) and its correlation with land use-land cover (LULC) change in Lahore city for prediction of future impact patterns of LST and LULC. The LST variability was determined using the Landsat Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) and the land surface emissivity factor. The influence of LULC, using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the normalized difference building index (NDBI), and the normalized difference bareness index (NDBaI) on the variability LST was investigated applying Landsat Satellite data from 1992 to 2020. The pixel-level multivariate linear regression analysis was employed to compute urban LST and influence of LULC classes. Results revealed that an overall increase of 41.8% in built-up areas at the expense of 24%, 17.4%, and 0.4% decreases in vegetation, bare land, and water from 1992-2020, respectively. Comparison of LST obtained from the meteorological station and satellite images showed a significant coherence. An increase of 4.3 degrees C in temperature of built-up areas from 1992-2020 was observed. Based on LULC and LST trends, the same were predicted for 2025 and 2030, which revealed that LST may further increase up to 1.3 degrees C by 2030. These changes in LULC and LST in turn have detrimental effects on local as well as global climate, emphasizing the need to address the issue especially in developing countries like Pakistan.

TI  - Soil Moisture Measuring Techniques and Factors Affecting the Moisture Dynamics: A Comprehensive Review
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Review
AB  - The amount of surface soil moisture (SSM) is a crucial ecohydrological natural resource that regulates important land surface processes. It affects critical land-atmospheric phenomena, including the division of energy and water (infiltration, runoff, and evaporation), that impacts the effectiveness of agricultural output (sensible and latent heat fluxes and surface air temperature). Despite its significance, there are several difficulties in making precise measurements, monitoring, and interpreting SSM at high spatial and temporal resolutions. The current study critically reviews the methods and procedures for calculating SSM and the variables influencing measurement accuracy and applicability under different fields, climates, and operational conditions. For laboratory and field measurements, this study divides SSM estimate strategies into (i) direct and (ii) indirect procedures. The accuracy and applicability of a technique depends on the environment and the resources at hand. Comparative research is geographically restricted, although precise and economical-direct measuring techniques like the gravimetric method are time-consuming and destructive. In contrast, indirect methods are more expensive and do not produce measurements at the spatial scale but produce precise data on a temporal scale. While measuring SSM across more significant regions, ground-penetrating radar and remote sensing methods are susceptible to errors caused by overlapping data and atmospheric factors. On the other hand, soft computing techniques like machine/deep learning are quite handy for estimating SSM without any technical or laborious procedures. We determine that factors, e.g., topography, soil type, vegetation, climate change, groundwater level, depth of soil, etc., primarily influence the SSM measurements. Different techniques have been put into practice for various practical situations, although comparisons between them are not available frequently in publications. Each method offers a unique set of potential advantages and disadvantages. The most accurate way of identifying the best soil moisture technique is the value selection method (VSM). The neutron probe is preferable to the FDR or TDR sensor for measuring soil moisture. Remote sensing techniques have filled the need for large-scale, highly spatiotemporal soil moisture monitoring. Through self-learning capabilities in data-scarce areas, machine/deep learning approaches facilitate soil moisture measurement and prediction.

TI  - Rotation of Low-mass Stars in Upper Centaurus-Lupus and Lower Centaurus-Crux with TESS
T2  - ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - We present stellar rotation rates derived from Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) light curves for stars in Upper Centaurus-Lupus (UCL; similar to 136 pc, similar to 16 Myr) and Lower Centaurus-Crux (LCC; similar to 115 pc, similar to 17 Myr). We find spot-modulated periods (P) for similar to 90% of members. The range of light-curve and periodogram shapes echoes that found for other clusters with K2, but fewer multiperiod stars may be an indication of the different noise characteristics of TESS, or a result of the source selection methods here. The distribution of P as a function of color as a proxy for mass fits nicely in between that for both older and younger clusters observed by K2, with fast rotators being found among both the highest and lowest masses probed here, and a well-organized distribution of M-star rotation rates. About 13% of the stars have an infrared excess, suggesting a circumstellar disk; this is well matched to expectations, given the age of the stars. There is an obvious pileup of disked M stars at P similar to 2 days, and the pileup may move to shorter P as the mass decreases. There is also a strong concentration of disk-free M stars at P similar to 2 days, hinting that perhaps these stars have recently freed themselves from their disks. Exploring the rotation rates of stars in UCL/LCC has the potential to help us understand the beginning of the end of the influence of disks on rotation, and the timescale on which stars respond to unlocking.

TI  - A Microcosm of Tobacco Research: An American Indian Northern Plains Review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDIGENOUS HEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - Despite decades of continued commercial tobacco prevention and control efforts, smoking rates in Northern Plains American Indian (AI) communities within the United States continues to be remarkably high. We sought to take a microcosmic view of AI tobacco research in the Northern Plains region to identify the types of tobacco-related research that has been completed, and to critically examine whether the four areas of community importance outlined as best practice for tobacco programming in AI communities have been represented in the literature to date. A systematic search of multiple databases was executed, utilizing an established scoping review framework that was adapted to fit within an Indigenous worldview. A consequent title and abstract review of tobacco-related research published with AI Northern Plains communities was completed. Structured deductive content analysis was carried out on each article utilizing a matrix of analysis developed from existing literature on best practices in AI communities. Of the 916 published studies identified, 50 met the inclusion criteria and were represented within five identified categorical themes: (a) commercial tobacco smoking as a risk factor; (b) commercial tobacco-related disease outcomes; (c) tobacco policy; (d) commercial tobacco smoking cessation; and (e) cultural or traditional tobacco use. The matrix analysis identified substantial variation in the number of studies carried out with community-identified best practices in place, including 22 of the 50 (44%) articles containing one or none of the four areas of importance noted as best practice. We identified a substantial lack of community and culturally informed tobacco-related research being carried out in the Northern Plains region. Community-based and culturally grounded efforts that consider colonization, historical trauma, and adverse childhood experiences when planning research, funding mechanisms, and health programming activities in the region are urgently needed to decrease commercial tobacco use and consequent health disparities.

T2  - PATTERN RECOGNITION AND IMAGE ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea observation through remote sensing technologies plays an essential role in understanding the health status of the marine coastal environment, its fauna species and their future behavior. Accurate knowledge of the marine habitat and the factors affecting faunal variations allows us to perform predictions and adopt proper decisions. This paper concerns the proposal of a classification system devoted to recognizing marine mesoscale events. These phenomena are studied and monitored by analyzing sea surface temperature imagery. Currently, the standard way to perform such analysis relies on experts manually visualizing, analyzing, and tagging large imagery datasets. Nowadays, the availability of remote sensing data has increased so much that it is desirable to replace the labor-intensive, time-consuming, and subjective manual interpretation with automated analysis tools. The results presented in this work have been obtained by applying the proposed approach to images captured over the southwestern region of the Iberian Peninsula.

TI  - Hydrogeological investigation of fluoride ion in groundwater of Ruparail and Banganga basins, Bharatpur district, Rajasthan, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrochemical analysis, geological study and evaluation of hydrogeochemical processes play a crucial role to understand the variability of fluoride ion concentration in groundwater. The present study is focused on a watershed boundary comprising of parts of two river basins namely Ruparail and Banganga within Bharatpur district of Rajasthan in India. Administratively, the study area is covered in five blocks of Bharatpur district viz. Deeg, Kaman, Nagar, Pahari and Kumher. The study area and sampling locations were identified based on the spectral signatures of satellite data, literature study and field-based experience. Seventy-five groundwater samples were collected for pre and post-monsoon seasons, separately. The hydrochemical results have shown that Banganga basin has experienced greater fluoride enrichment in groundwater as compared to Ruparail basin. Both the basins have experienced more groundwater samples in the class of high-risk water (more than 1.5 mg/l F-) during the post-monsoon season due to mineral dissolution with the surface run-off water in the aquifer material. The shallow aquifers (< 40 m bgl) have experienced high fluoride distribution in groundwater as compared to deeper aquifers (> 40 m bgl). The spatiotemporal interpolation maps for fluoride ion concentration generated by following inverse distance weighted (IDW) method have shown the varied fluoride concentration with geologic, geomorphic and seismo-tectonic features. Chadha's plot for hydrochemical facies has revealed that the groundwater of the study area is mainly of Na-Cl and Ca-Mg-Cl type. The evaluation of hydrochemical facies has suggested that Na-Cl water type is having elevated fluoride ion concentration as compared to Ca-Mg-Cl and Ca-Mg-HCO3 water types. The interpretation of hydrogeochemical processes based on scatter plots of hydrochemical parameters has revealed that processes such as silicate weathering, direct-ion exchange, mineral dissolution and rock-water interaction are responsible for fluoride augmentation in groundwater. The enrichment is also governed by evaporation, semiarid environment, salinity hazard and overdraft of groundwater. The water types having inhibited fluoride ion concentration are found dominated with carbonate weathering and recharge water (Ca-Mg-HCO3 type) and reverse-ion exchange process (Ca-Mg-Cl type). Moreover, the geochemical modeling is indicative of under-saturation of fluorite with over-saturation of calcite and dolomite, augmenting fluoride ion concentration in groundwater. The comprehensive understanding of hydrogeochemical processes controlling fluoride enrichment is found useful for planning strategies adopted for providing safe drinking water in a sustainable way.

TI  - Use of geostatistical models to evaluate landscape and stream network controls on post-fire stream nitrate concentrations
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Forested watersheds provide many ecosystem services, such as the filtration of sediment, pollutants, and nutrients, which are increasingly threatened by wildfire. For example, stream nutrient concentrations often increase following wildfire and can remain elevated for decades, making downstream waters susceptible to eutrophication. We investigated the drivers of persistent elevated stream nutrients, specifically nitrate (NO3-), in nine watersheds that were burned 16 years prior by the Hayman fire, Colorado, USA. We evaluated the ability of multiple linear regression and spatial stream network modeling approaches to predict observed concentrations of the biologically active solute NO3- and the conservative solute sodium (Na+) which serves as a partial control. Specifically, we quantified the degree to which landscape and stream network characteristics predict stream solute concentrations. Stream Na+ exhibited strong spatial autocorrelation that was primarily controlled by topography and hydrology. In contrast, stream NO3- had higher spatial variability and was inversely correlated to vegetation cover, measured as mean normalized differenced moisture index (NDMI). Spatially heterogeneous wildfire behaviour left intact forest patches interspersed with high burn severity patches dominated by shrubs and grasses which contributes to the spatial variability in stream NO3- concentrations. Post-fire vegetation also interacts with watershed structure to influence stream NO3- patterns. For example, severely burned convergent hillslopes in headwaters positions were associated with the highest stream NO3- concentrations due to the high proportional influence of hillslope water in these locations. Our findings suggest that targeted reforestation in severely burned convergent hillslopes in headwater positions may enhance the recovery of stream NO3- concentrations to pre-fire levels.

AB  - Rationale In muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), lymph node invasion has proven to be an independent predictor of disease recurrence and cancer-specific survival. We evaluated the feasibility of targeting the sentinel node (SN) for biopsy in MIBC patients using the hybrid tracer indocyanine green (ICG)-Tc-99m-nanocolloid for simultaneous radioguidance and fluorescence guidance. Methods Twenty histologically confirmed cN0M0 MIBC patients (mean age, 63.3 years; range, 30-82 years), scheduled for radical cystectomy with SN biopsy and extended pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND), were prospectively included. Twelve patients were operated on following neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The patients received lymphoscintigraphy as well as SPECT/CT after 4 transurethral injections of ICG-Tc-99m-nanocolloid (mean, 208 MBq; range, 172-229 MBq) around the tumor/scar in the detrusor muscle of the bladder on the day before radical cystectomy. Sentinel node resection was performed under radioguidance and fluorescence guidance. Results Nineteen patients could be analyzed. On preoperative imaging, SNs could be identified in 10 patients (53%; mean, 1.6 SN/patient), which revealed drainage pathways outside the ePLND in 20% of the patients. Interesting to note is that 2 patients (10%) with preoperative nonvisualization displayed fluorescent and radioactive SNs during surgery. Location of the primary tumor near the left lateral side of the bladder seemed to be a factor for nonvisualization. Nodal harvesting with ePLND varied among patients (mean, 23.3). Histopathology confirmed tumor-positive nodes in 4 (21%) of all patients. In the 2 patients where an SN could be identified, the ePLND specimens were tumor-negative. All patients with tumor-positive nodes had advanced disease (stage III). Conclusion Sentinel node biopsy in bladder cancer using the hybrid tracer ICG-Tc-99m-nanocolloid is feasible, and preoperative imaging is predictive for the ability to perform SN biopsy in 83% of the patients who displayed an SN. In patients with a successful preoperative SN mapping using lymphoscintigraphy and SPECT/CT, the intraoperative SN guidance and detection were effective, even outside the ePLND area. As such, this study underscores the critical role that preoperative imaging plays in challenging image-guided surgery applications.

TI  - WEST NILE VIRUS SURVEILLANCE IN SENTINEL CHICKENS AND MOSQUITOES IN PANAMA CITY BEACH, FLORIDA, FROM 2014 TO 2020
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MOSQUITO CONTROL ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Over 20 years since its introduction, the West Nile virus (WNV) continues to be the leading cause of arboviral disease in the USA. In Panama City Beach (Bay County, FL), WNV transmission is monitored using sentinel chickens and testing mosquito pools for presence of viral RNA. In the current work, we monitored WNV transmission from 2014 to 2020 through weekly serology sampling of sentinel chickens; mosquito populations through biweekly mosquito collections by suction traps (1 m and 9 m) and weekly gravid trap collections; and mosquito infection rates using a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Samples were sent to the Bureau of Public Health Laboratories (Tampa, FL) for testing presence/absence of WNV via RT-PCR assay. Our results indicated that canopy surveillance could augment ground collections, providing greater proportions of Culex mosquitoes with less bycatch compared with ground collections. Serology indicated 94 seroconversions to WNV in the study area from 2014 to 2020. The most active year was 2016, which accounted for 32% (n = 30) of all seroconversions reported during the study period. We detected 20 WNV-positive mosquito pools from Culex quinquefasciatus during 2014-17; mosquito infection rates ranged from 2.02 to 23.81 per thousand (95% CI). Climate data indicated anomalously high precipitation in 2014-19 preceding WNV transmission. Data analyzed herein indicate utility in year-round continuous and diversified surveillance methodologies. This information is needed to properly calibrate future models that could assist with predicting transmission events of WNV in Panama City Beach, FL.

TI  - Changes over the Last 35 Years in Alaska's Glaciated Landscape: A Novel Deep Learning Approach to Mapping Glaciers at Fine Temporal Granularity
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers are important sentinels of a changing climate, crucial components of the global cryosphere and integral to their local landscapes. However, many of the commonly used methods for mapping glacier change are labor-intensive and limit the temporal and spatial scope of existing research. This study addresses some of the limitations of prior approaches by developing a novel deep-learning-based method called GlacierCoverNet. GlacierCoverNet is a deep neural network that relies on an extensive, purpose-built training dataset. Using this model, we created a record of over three decades long at a fine temporal cadence (every two years) for the state of Alaska. We conducted a robust error analysis of this dataset and then used the dataset to characterize changes in debris-free glaciers and supraglacial debris over the last similar to 35 years. We found that our deep learning model could produce maps comparable to existing approaches in the capture of areal extent, but without manual editing required. The model captured the area covered with glaciers that was similar to 97% of the Randolph Glacier Inventory 6.0 with similar to 6% and similar to 9% omission and commission rates in the southern portion of Alaska, respectively. The overall model area capture was lower and omission and commission rates were significantly higher in the northern Brooks Range. Overall, the glacier-covered area retreated by 8425 km(2) (-13%) between 1985 and 2020, and supraglacial debris expanded by 2799 km(2) (64%) during the same period across the state of Alaska.

TI  - Assessment of the Diffuse Attenuation Coefficient of Photosynthetically Active Radiation in a Chilean Lake
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The diffuse attenuation coefficient of photosynthetically active radiation is an important inherent optical property of the subaquatic light field. This parameter, as a measure of the transparency of the medium, is a good indicator of water quality. Degradation of the optical properties of water due to anthropogenic disturbances is a common phenomenon in freshwater ecosystems. In this study, we used four algorithm-based Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel-2A/B MSI images to estimate the diffuse attenuation coefficient of photosynthetically active radiation in Lake Villarrica located in south-central Chile. The algorithms' estimated data from the ACOLITE module were validated with in situ measurements from six sampling stations. Seasonal and intralake variations of the light attenuation coefficient were studied. The relationship between the diffuse attenuation coefficient of photosynthetically active radiation, meteorological parameters, and an optical classification was also explored. The best results were obtained with QAA v6 KdPAR Nechad (R-2 = 0.931, MBE = 0.023 m(-1), RMSE = 0.088 m(-1), and MAPE = 35.9%) for spring and QAA v5 Kd490 algorithms (R-2 = 0.919, MBE = -0.064 m(-1), RMSE = -0.09 m(-1), and MAPE = 30.3%) for summer. High KdPAR values are associated with the strong wind and precipitation events suggest they are caused by sediment resuspension. Finally, an optical classification of freshwater ecosystems was proposed for this lake. The promising results of this study suggest that the combination of in situ data and observation satellites can be useful for assessing the bio-optical state of water and water quality dynamics in Chilean aquatic systems.

TI  - Analysis of Air and Soil Quality around Thermal Power Plants and Coal Mines of Singrauli Region, India
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Singrauli region is known as the energy capital of India, as it generates nearly 21 GW of electricity, supplied to various parts of the northern India. Many coal-based Thermal Power Plants (TPPs) using coal from several nearby coal mines, and numerous industries are set up in this region which has made it as one of the highly polluted regions of India. In the present study, detailed temporal analysis and forecast of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and methane (CH4) concentrations retrieved from satellite data have been carried out for the periods 2005-2020. Based on the classical multiplicative model and using linear regression, the maximum concentration of CO2, NO2, SO2, and CH4 in the year 2025 is found to be 422.59 ppm, 29.28 ppm, 0.23 DU, and 1901.35 ppbv, respectively. Detailed analysis shows that carbon dioxide has a 95% correlation with all other trace gases. We have also carried out the geo-accumulation index for the presence of various contaminants in the soil of this region. The geo-accumulation index shows that soil in and around thermal power plants and coal mines is contaminated by heavy metals. The cumulative index shows that soil around Hindalco industries, Bina coal mines, Khadia coal mines, and coal-based TPPs (Anpara and Vindhayachal) are highly polluted and a threat to human population living in the region.

TI  - Essential and non-essential metals in three lowland rivers of temperate South America (Argentina): Distribution and accumulation
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRACE ELEMENTS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Geographic distribution of essential metals on earth is largely uneven. Therefore, regional specific approaches to assess metal contents in freshwater ecosystems are mandatory. Cd, Cu, Cr, Pb, Ni, Mn and Zn concentrations were measured in water, sediments and fish tocharacterize the partitioning of these essential and non-essential metals in three river ecosystems of the Pampean Plain==. Methods: Water, sediment and eight fish species were collected at three rivers from the Pampean Plain. After sample-specific pretreatments, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn concentrations in water, sediment and muscle were determined in triplicate by Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES). Contamination (Hakanson's index) and bioconcentration factors were calculated to assess the degree of contamination and the relationship between the matrices, while the target hazard quotient was estimated to explore the risk to human health from fish consumption. Results: Water metal concentration was below detection limit in all sampled rivers. Sediments were mostly enriched by Mn (186-474 mg kg(-1)) followed by Zn (36.8-40.3 mg kg(-1)), whereas in fish, the situation was the opposite, suggesting different biogeochemical pathways and uneven bioaccumulation of these elements. The largest concentrations for all explored metals were invariably recorded in fish from the Sauce Grande River, although only Cd, Cu and Ni in sediments were highest at this site. Indeed, the bioconcentration factor showed that Cd and Zn are actively accumulated by almost all species in all sampled rivers. The Targeted Hazard Quotient based on the muscle metal concentration tissue of the edible fish species (Odontesthes bonariensis) was less than 1. Conclusion: None metal seemed to pose a significant risk for humans. In some sites biota-sediment concentration factors of Cd and Zn and muscle Cd, Cr, Ni, Zn and Pb levels were highest in the silurid Pimelodella laticeps, suggesting that it may be used as a sentinel species for biomonitoring programs in Neotropical fish assemblages.

TI  - Post-Soviet changes in cropping practices in the irrigated drylands of the Aral Sea basin
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Water withdrawals for irrigated crop production constitute the largest source of freshwater consumption on Earth. Monitoring the dynamics of irrigated crop cultivation is crucial for tracking crop water consumption, particularly in water-scarce areas. We analyzed changes in water-dependent crop cultivation for 650 000 km(2) of Central Asian drylands, including the entire basin of the Amu Darya river, once the largest tributary to the Aral Sea before large-scale irrigation projects grossly reduced the amount of water reaching the river delta. We used Landsat time series to map overall cropland extent, dry season cropping, and cropping frequency in irrigated croplands annually from 1987 to 2019. We scrutinized the emblematic change processes of six localities to discern the underlying causes of these changes. Our unbiased area estimates reveal that between 1988 and 2019, irrigated dry season cropping declined by 1.34 million hectares (Mha), while wet season and double cropping increased by 0.64 Mha and 0.83 Mha, respectively. These results show that the overall extent of cropland in the region remained stable, while higher cropping frequency increased harvested area. The observed changes' overall effect on water resource use remains elusive: Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, declining dry season cultivation reduced crop water demand while, more recently, increasing cropping frequency raised water consumption. Our analysis provides the first fine-scale analysis of post-Soviet changes in cropping practices of the irrigated areas of Central Asia. Our maps are openly available and can support future assessments of land-system trajectories and, coupled with evapotranspiration estimates, changes in crop water consumption.

TI  - Watching the Saltmarsh Grow: A High-Resolution Remote Sensing Approach to Quantify the Effects of Wetland Restoration
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands are restored to regenerate lost ecosystem services. Accurate and frequent representations of the distribution and area of coastal wetland communities are critical for evaluating restoration success. Typically, such data are acquired through laborious, intensive and expensive field surveys or traditional remote sensing methods that can be erroneous. Recent advances in remote sensing techniques such as high-resolution sensors (<2 m resolution), object-based image analysis and shallow learning classifiers provide promising alternatives but have rarely been applied in a restoration context. We measured the changes to wetland communities at a 200 ha restoring coastal wetland in eastern Australia, using remotely sensed Worldview-2 imagery, object-based image analysis and random forest classification. Our approach used structural rasters (digital elevation and canopy height models) and a multi-temporal technique to distinguish between spectrally similar land cover. The accuracy of our land cover maps was high, with overall accuracies ranging between 91 and 95%, and this supported early detection of increases in the area of key ecosystems, including mixed she-oak and paperbark (10 ha), mangroves (0.91 ha) and saltmarsh (4.31 ha), over a 5-year monitoring period. Our approach provides coastal managers with an accurate and frequent method for quantifying early responses of coastal wetlands to restoration, which is essential for informing adaptive management in the regeneration of ecosystem services.

TI  - Comparison of Different Machine Learning Methods for Predicting Cation Exchange Capacity Using Environmental and Remote Sensing Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was conducted to examine the capability of topographic features and remote sensing data in combination with other auxiliary environmental variables (geology and geomorphology) to predict CEC by using different machine learning models ((random forest (RF), k-nearest neighbors (kNNs), Cubist model (Cu), and support vector machines (SVMs)) in the west of Iran. Accordingly, the collection of ninety-seven soil samples was performed from the surface layer (0-20 cm), and a number of soil properties and X-ray analyses, as well as CEC, were determined in the laboratory. The X-ray analysis showed that the clay types as the main dominant factor on CEC varied from illite to smectite. The results of modeling also displayed that in the training dataset based on 10-fold cross-validation, RF was identified as the best model for predicting CEC (R-2 = 0.86; root mean square error: RMSE = 2.76; ratio of performance to deviation: RPD = 2.67), whereas the Cu model outperformed in the validation dataset (R-2 = 0.49; RMSE = 4.51; RPD = 1.43)). RF, the best and most accurate model, was thus used to prepare the CEC map. The results confirm higher CEC in the early Quaternary deposits along with higher soil development and enrichment with smectite and vermiculite. On the other hand, lower CEC was observed in mountainous and coarse-textured soils (silt loam and sandy loam). The important variable analysis also showed that some topographic attributes (valley depth, elevation, slope, terrain ruggedness index-TRI) and remotely sensed data (ferric oxides, normalized difference moisture index-NDMI, and salinity index) could be considered as the most imperative variables explaining the variability of CEC by the best model in the study area.

TI  - Pasture Productivity Assessment under Mob Grazing and Fertility Management Using Satellite and UAS Imagery
T2  - DRONES
M3  - Article
AB  - Pasture management approaches can determine the productivity, sustainability, and ecological balance of livestock production. Sensing techniques potentially provide methods to assess the performance of different grazing practices that are more labor and time efficient than traditional methods (e.g., soil and crop sampling). This study utilized high-resolution satellite and unmanned aerial system (UAS) imagery to evaluate vegetation characteristics of a pasture field location with two grazing densities (low and high, applied in the years 2015-2019) and four fertility treatments (control, manure, mineral, and compost tea, applied annually in the years 2015-2019). The pasture productivity was assessed through satellite imagery annually from the years 2017 to 2019. The relation and variation within and between the years were evaluated using vegetation indices extracted from satellite and UAS imagery. The data from the two sensing systems (satellite and UAS) demonstrated that grazing density showed a significant effect (p < 0.05) on pasture crop status in 2019. Furthermore, the mean vegetation index data extracted from satellite and UAS imagery (2019) had a high correlation (r >= 0.78, p < 0.001). These results show the potential of utilizing satellite and UAS imagery for crop productivity assessment applications in small to medium pasture research and management.

TI  - Association of Sentinel Node Biopsy and Pathological Report Completeness with Survival Benefit for Cutaneous Melanoma and Factors Influencing Their Different Uses in European Populations
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary The study was aimed to investigate the frequency of accurate pathology report and sentinel lymph node biopsy for staging clinically node-negative >1 mm melanomas across European countries, which are standard care indicators having relevant consequences for survival. 4245 melanoma cases from in six European countries in 2009-2013 were analyzed by multivariable logistic regression in order to estimate the odds ratio of having such indicators performed. Model-based survival to estimate the five-year relative excess risks of death were computed. Results showed how much accurate pathology profiling and sentinel lymph node biopsy carried survival benefit. Narrowing down between-countries differences in adhesion to guidelines might achieve better outcomes. Objectives: Standard care for cutaneous melanoma includes an accurate pathology report (PR) and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for staging clinically node-negative >1 mm melanomas. We aimed to investigate the frequency of these indicators across European countries, also assessing consequences for survival. Methods: We analyzed 4245 melanoma cases diagnosed in six European countries in 2009-2013. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the Odds Ratio (OR) of receiving complete PR with eight items or SLNB and model-based survival to estimate the five-year relative excess risks of death (RER). Results: Overall, 12% patients received a complete PR (range 2.3%, Estonia-20.1%, Italy); SLNB was performed for 68.8% of those with cN0cM0 stage (range 54.4%, Spain-81.7%, Portugal). The adjusted OR of receiving a complete PR was lower than the mean in Estonia (OR 0.11 (0.06-0.18)) and higher in Italy (OR 6.39 (4.90-8.34)) and Portugal (OR 1.39 (1.02-1.89)); it was higher for patients operated on in specialized than general hospitals (OR 1.42 (1.08-1.42)). In the multivariate models adjusted for age, sex, country and clinical-pathological characteristics, the RER resulted in being higher than the reference for patients not receiving a complete PR with eight items (RER 1.72 (1.08-2.72)), or for those not undergoing SLNB (RER 1.76 (1.26-2.47)) Patients with non-metastatic node-negative thickness >1 mm melanoma who did not undergo SLNB had a higher risk of death (RER (RER 1.69 (1.02-2.80)) than those who did. Conclusions: Accurate pathology profiling and SLNB carried survival benefit. Narrowing down between-countries differences in adhesion to guidelines might achieve better outcomes.

TI  - Machine learning approach to predict terrestrial gross primary productivity using topographical and remote sensing data
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) is the amount of sequestered CO2 during plant photosynthesis. GPP is an important indicator of ecosystem health in various ecologies and to assess climate change. The objective of the present work is to propose a machine learning based GPP estimation model using remote sensing (RS) data in combination with meteorological data (MET) and topographical data (TOPO) for prediction of GPP, which can be upscaled in temporal and spatial resolution. Random Forest Regression (RFR) is proposed for this using the Fluxnet2015 GPP dataset for the Australian region. This model has attained a very high accuracy with an R2 value of 0.82, as estimated by 10-fold cross-validation. The model has been compared with state-of-the-art machine learning models and found to be performing better than others. Different feature sets like METfeatures and TOPO-features were evaluated in combination with RS-features. The results exhibited that the RFR model performed better when MET and TOPO features are combined with RS-features. GPP prediction for the year 2014, in 8 days temporal and 500m spatial resolution for the Australian region for different plant function types is demonstrated using the proposed model and produced very high value of R2 (0.84), when compared to ground truth. Thus, the proposed approach of the RFR model for GPP estimation showed significant improvement in regional carbon cycle studies and can also be employed for simulating GPP for the future under different climate scenarios.

TI  - Assessment of the TsHARP method for spatial downscaling of land surface temperature over urban regions
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays, acquiring high spatial and temporal land surface temperature (LST) is one of the significant factors in urban climate studies. This study aims to assess the sharpening thermal imagery (TsHARP) method, which is developed for determining the LST in urban regions. Whereas the original TsHARP method correlates the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) with the LST, the current study seeks to evaluate the performance of the TsHARP method by correlating between the LST and NDVI over urban areas. Additionally, it is intended to investigate the relationship between the impervious surfaces (IS) and LST. At this point, the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer ASTER image of the year 2003 was used to retrieve the IS as well as the LST of the Kuala Lumpur city, Malaysia. To retrieve the main LST, IS and NDVI, ASTER Level1B data were used. On the other hand, ASTER land surface temperature products (AST08) was utilized to evaluate the downscaled LST (DLST) image. With selection of the similar to 1/4 of the pixels with lowest coefficient of variation (CV), the LST has more correlation with the IS in comparison with the NDVI, while the correlation between the IS and LST was increased in this study. The IS index illustrates the most optimal correlation for the urban LST (R-2 = 0.59). Furthermore, the TsHARP(IS-based) method depicted a good correlation between the DLST and the ASTER LST product (RMSE = 1.5 degrees C, R-2 = 0.83) compared to the NDVI (RMSE = 4 degrees C, R-2 = 0.73). Consequently, it is found that the application of TsHARP(IS-based) method to ASTER remote sensing data is a robust/low-cost approach for spatial downscaling of the LST over urban regions.

TI  - Is less more in the surgical treatment of early-stage cervical cancer?
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of review This article discusses recent developments towards less radical surgical treatment for early-stage cervical cancer. Recent findings Surgery is the standard treatment for early-stage cervical cancer. In the last decades, new treatment strategies have been developed aiming to reduce morbidity, without hampering oncological safety. We provide an update of the latest knowledge on safety and morbidity following less radical surgical procedures in early-stage cervical cancer. In cervical cancer with a tumour size of 2 cm or less, radical surgery (simple hysterectomy or fertility-sparing conisation) may be a well tolerated option. For patients with larger lesions (>2 cm) and wishing to preserve fertility, administration of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by less extensive surgery appears to be a feasible and well tolerated alternative to abdominal trachelectomy. With regard to lymph node assessment, increasing evidence shows the feasibility of the sentinel lymph node procedure instead of full pelvic lymphadenectomy. Prospective trials reporting on oncological safety are awaited. It is important to exercise caution when new surgical strategies are introduced. Despite promising retrospective data, prospective randomized studies may present unexpected results, for instance, minimally invasive radical hysterectomy showed inferior results compared to laparotomy. There is a shift towards less radical treatment for early-stage cervical cancer. This review explores whether and when less is really more.

TI  - Land Use and Land Cover Mapping Using Deep Learning Based Segmentation Approaches and VHR Worldview-3 Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep learning-based segmentation of very high-resolution (VHR) satellite images is a significant task providing valuable information for various geospatial applications, specifically for land use/land cover (LULC) mapping. The segmentation task becomes more challenging with the increasing number and complexity of LULC classes. In this research, we generated a new benchmark dataset from VHR Worldview-3 images for twelve distinct LULC classes of two different geographical locations. We evaluated the performance of different segmentation architectures and encoders to find the best design to create highly accurate LULC maps. Our results showed that the DeepLabv3+ architecture with an ResNeXt50 encoder achieved the best performance for different metric values with an IoU of 89.46%, an F-1 score of 94.35%, a precision of 94.25%, and a recall of 94.49%. This design could be used by other researchers for LULC mapping of similar classes from different satellite images or for different geographical regions. Moreover, our benchmark dataset can be used as a reference for implementing new segmentation models via supervised, semi- or weakly-supervised deep learning models. In addition, our model results can be used for transfer learning and generalizability of different methodologies.

TI  - Detecting Spatial-Temporal Changes of Urban Environment Quality by Remote Sensing-Based Ecological Indices: A Case Study in Panzhihua City, Sichuan Province, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Panzhihua City is a typical agricultural-forestry-pastoral and ecologically sensitive city in China. It is also an important ecological defense in the upper Yangtze River. It has abundant mineral resources, including vanadium, titanium, and water supplies. However, ecological and environmental problems emerge due to the excessive development of mining, agriculture, animal husbandry, and other non-natural urban economies. Therefore, a scientific understanding of the spatio-temporal changes of the eco-environment of Panzhihua is critical for environmental protection, city planning, and construction. To objectively evaluate the eco-environmental status of Panzhihua, the remote sensing-based ecological index (RSEI) was first applied to Panzhihua, a typical resource-based city, and its ecological environmental quality (EEQ) was quantitatively assessed from 1990 to 2020. This study explored the effects of mining activities and policies on EEQ and used change detection to reveal the spatial-temporal changes of EEQ in Panzhihua City over the past three decades. In addition, this study also verified the suitability of RSEI for evaluating EEQ in resource-based city using spatial autocorrelation, revealed the spatial heterogeneity of EEQ in Panzhihua City using optimized hot spot analysis, and showed different ecological clustering by hot spot analysis at two scales of urban and mining areas. According to the results: (1) From 1990 to 2020, the general eco-environmental condition of Panzhihua is improving, but there are still regional differences. (2) The Moran's I value ranges from 0.436 (1990) to 0.700 (2020), indicating that there is autocorrelation in the distribution of eco-environmental quality. (3) At the mine, the mean value of RSEI dropped by 20-40%, and the EEQ decreased significantly due to mining activities. (4) A series of ecological restoration policies can buffer the negative impact of mining activities on the ecosystem, resulting in a slight improvement in the quality of the ecological environment. This study evaluates the EEQ of resource-based city and its spatial-temporal changes using RSEI constructed by the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, which can provide theoretical support for ecological and environmental conditions monitoring, development planning, and environmental protection policy-making of a resource-based city.

TI  - Changes in River Channel Dynamics of the Satluj River, Punjab: Using a Geospatial Approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA
M3  - Article
AB  - River channel change is a dynamic process which involves erosion, accretion, lateral migration and changes in its width through the geomorphological process. Shifting of a river causes a direct impact on natural and manmade constructions which are located near the floodplain with consistent damage and devastation of the area. The objective of this study is to analyze the spatiotemporal variation along the Satluj river during the period 1990 to 2019 using Landsat TM, ETM+ and OLI satellite data. Spatiotemporal analysis of the river channel has been carried out to analyze the river channel change morphology, mid-line channel shifting and changes in surface water area of the Satluj river using twenty randomly distributed cross-sections (X1-X20). For surface water area change analysis, the satellite derived normalized difference water index (NDWI) has been used. The obtained results indicates that the river width increased by 0.033 km in overall cross-section (X1-X20) in the year 2019 as compared to the year 1990. Mid-line shifting of the river is mostly towards the left bank of the river. The maximum channel shifting of 1.364 km took place from Chak Bandala village in Jalandhar district to Madarpur village in Moga district between the years 1990 and 2019. However, the NDWI results indicate that the river surface area has been reduced by -90.33 km(2) between the years 1990 and 2019. Additionally, the average shifting rate of the Satluj river during the period 1990 to 2019 is by 0.778 km.

TI  - Modeling the Leaf Area Index of Inner Mongolia Grassland Based on Machine Learning Regression Algorithms Incorporating Empirical Knowledge
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is one of the key biophysical indicators for characterizing the growth and status of vegetation and is also used in modeling earth system processes. Machine learning algorithms (MLAs) such as random forest regression (RFR), artificial neural network regression (ANNR) and support vector regression (SVR) based on satellite data have been widely used for the estimation of LAI. However, the selection of input variables has a great impact on the estimation performance of MLAs. In this study, we aimed to improve the LAI inversion model of Inner Mongolia grassland based on MLAs incorporating empirical knowledge. Firstly, we used the ANNR, SVR and RFR approaches, respectively, to rank the input variables including vegetation indices, climate factors, soil factors and topography factors and found that Normalized Difference Phenology Index (NDPI) contributed the most to LAI estimation. Secondly, we selected four sets of input variables, namely, all variables-A, model selected variables-B, overlapping variables-C and self-defined variables-D, respectively. Subsequently, we built twelve LAI estimation models (RFR-A, RFR-B, RFR-C, etc.) based on three MLAs and four sets of input variables. The evaluation of them showed the RFR produced higher prediction accuracy, followed by ANNR and SVR. Furthermore, the RFR-D presented the highest accuracy in predicting LAI (R-2 = 0.55, RMSE = 0.37 m(2)/m(2), MAE = 0.29 m(2)/m(2)). Finally, we compared our results with MODIS LAI and GEOV2 LAI products and found that all of them showed a similar spatial distribution of grassland LAI in the four sub-regions covering all grassland types, but our model exhibited larger LAI values in the desert steppe and smaller LAI values in the others. These findings demonstrated that MLAs incorporating empirical knowledge could improve the accuracy of modelling LAI and further study is necessary to reduce the uncertainty in LAI mapping in grassland.

TI  - Spatial Autocorrelation Analysis of Land Use and Ecosystem Service Value in the Huangshui River Basin at the Grid Scale
T2  - PLANTS-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Huangshui River Basin is one of the most densely populated areas on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and is characterized by a high level of human activity. The contradiction between ecological protection and socioeconomic development has become increasingly prominent; determining how to achieve the balanced and coordinated development of the Huangshui River Basin is an important task. Thus, this study used the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud-computing platform and Sentinel-1/2 data, supplemented with an ALOS digital elevation model (ALOS DEM) and field survey data, and combined a remote sensing classification method, grid method, and ecosystem service value (ESV) evaluation method to study the spatial correlation and interaction between land use (LU) and ESV in the Huangshui River Basin. The following results were obtained: (1) on the GEE platform, Sentinel-1/2 active and passive remote sensing data, combined with the gradient tree-boosting algorithm, can efficiently produce highly accurate LU data with a spatial resolution of 10 m in the Huangshui River Basin; the overall accuracy (OA) reached 88%. (2) The total ESV in the Huangshui River Basin in 2020 was CNY 33.18 billion (USD 4867.2 million), of which woodland and grassland were the main contributors to ESV. In the Huangshui River Basin, the LU type, LU degree, and ESV have significant positive spatial correlations, with urban and agricultural areas showing an H-H agglomeration in terms of LU degree, with woodlands, grasslands, reservoirs, and wetlands showing an H-H agglomeration in terms of ESV. (3) There is a significant negative spatial correlation between the LU degree and ESV in the Huangshui River Basin, indicating that the enhancement of the LU degree in the basin could have a negative spatial spillover effect on the ESV of surrounding areas. Thus, green development should be the future direction of progress in the Huangshui River Basin, i.e., while maintaining and expanding the land for ecological protection and restoration, and the LU structure should be actively adjusted to ensure ecological security and coordinated and sustainable socioeconomic development in the Basin.

TI  - Inversion of Sea Ice Concentration in the Liaodong Bay from MODIS Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea ice concentration is an important observation element and a necessary input parameter for the numerical prediction of sea ice. In this study, a new method is developed for the inversion of sea ice concentration (SIC) in Liaodong Bay from MODIS data based on the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI). By comparing the inverted results of the NDWI method and the WU's methods, as well as observations from six shore-based observation points on the east coast of Liaodong Bay in the winter of 2016/2017 and Landsat 8 OLI data, the method based on NDWI is shown to be a useful tool to estimate the SIC. The SIC obtained by the NDWI method is in good agreement with the survey data. The mean absolute error between the SIC obtained by the NDWI method and visual observation is about 10%. In the comparison data, 92% of the absolute error values of SIC are less than 20%. The average value of the error of the SIC obtained by the NDWI method is 1%, and that of the WU's method is about -10%, which means the accuracy of SIC obtained by the NDWI method is better. The mean deviation of the error of the SIC obtained by the NDWI method and the WU's method is about 9% and 13%, which shows a certain improvement in precision. The validation results with the Landsat 8 OLI data show the precision of the SIC obtained by the NDWI method is better than the WU's method, which is consistent with the validation result of the survey data.

TI  - Assimilating MWHS-2 radiance of FY-3D satellite and its influence on the forecast of Typhoon Mitag
T2  - Journal of Tropical Oceanography
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the module of directly assimilating MWHS-2 (microwave humidity sounder 2) radiance of FY-3D in the WRF (weather research and forecasting) model, this study investigates the influence of assimilating clear-sky MWHS-2 radiance on the forecast of Typhoon Mitag (2019) by using the 3DVar (three dimensional variation) assimilation method. Four experiments are designed. No assimilation is performed in the first one, while only GTS (global telecommunications system) data are used in the second one. Further, the assimilation of both GTS data and MWHS-2 radiance is carried out in the third one. The fourth one replaces MWHS-2 radiance with ATMS (advanced technology microwave sounder) radiance. The results show that the mean differences of all channels between the observation and the background verge to 0 after the bias correction. In addition, compared with the background field, the standard deviation and root mean square error of the analysis field versus the observation decrease significantly after the assimilation, which demonstrates the effectiveness of assimilation. Compared with the experiment only assimilating GTS data and the experiment assimilating ATMS radiance, a negative height increment and a positive temperature increment are observed near the typhoon center after assimilating clear-sky MWHS-2 radiance, which contributes to the maintenance of typhoon from the dynamic and thermal aspects. In the last 12 hours of the deterministic forecast, the experiment assimilating clear-sky MWHS-2 radiance is able to improve the 500 hPa circulation simulation with stronger southwest steering flow, which finally reduces the error of typhoon track forecast.

TI  - Optimization of Samples for Remote Sensing Estimation of Forest Aboveground Biomass at the Regional Scale
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately estimating forest aboveground biomass (AGB) based on remote sensing (RS) images at the regional level is challenging due to the uncertainty of the modeling sample size. In this study, a new optimizing method for the samples was suggested by integrating variance function in Geostatistics and value coefficient (VC) in Value Engineering. In order to evaluate the influence of the sample size for RS models, the random forest regression (RFR), nearest neighbor (K-NN) method, and partial least squares regression (PLSR) were conducted by combining Landsat8/OLI imagery in 2016 and 91 Pinus densata sample plots in Shangri-La City of China. The mean of the root mean square error (RMSE) of 200 random sampling tests was adopted as the accuracy evaluation index of the RS models and VC as a relative cost index of the modeling samples. The research results showed that: (1) the statistical values (mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation) for each group of samples based on 200 experiments were not significantly different from the sampling population (91 samples) by t-test (p = 0.01), and the sampling results were reliable for establishing RS models; (2) The reliable analysis on the RFR, K-NN, and PLSR models with sample groups showed that the VC decreases with increasing samples, and the decreasing trend of VC is consistent. The number of optimal samples for RFR, K-NN, and PLSR was 55, 54, and 56 based on the spherical model of variance function, respectively, and the optimal results were consistent. (3) Among the established models based on the optimal samples, the RFR model with the determination coefficient R-2 = 0.8485, RMSE = 12.25 Mg/hm(2), and the estimation accuracy P = 81.125% was better than K-NN and PLSR. Therefore, they could be used as models for estimating the aboveground biomass of Pinus densata in the study area. For the optimal sample size and sampling population, the RFR model of Pinus densata AGB was established, combining 26 variable factors in the study area. The total AGB with the optimal samples was 1.22 x 10(7) Mg, and the estimation result with the sampling population was 1.24 x 10(7) Mg based on Landsat8/OLI images. Respectively, the average AGB was 66.42 Mg/hm(2) and 67.51 Mg/hm(2), with a relative precision of 98.39%. The estimation results of the two sample groups were consistent.

TI  - Impact of severe obesity in the management of patients with high-risk endometrial cancer: A FRANCOGYN study
T2  - JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGY OBSTETRICS AND HUMAN REPRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To assess the surgical management and survival of severely obese patients with high-risk endometrial cancer.Materials and methods: Data from 269 patients with high-risk endometrial cancer who were treated between 2001 and 2018 were collected from a multicenter database (11 centers). We classified the patients according to their BMI and compared outcomes in two groups: a normal weight group of women with a BMI < 25 kg/m(2), and a severe obesity group of women with a BMI >= 35 kg/m(2). The groups were compared for epidemiologic, pathologic, management, relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) elements.Results: Patients in the severe obesity group were younger (64 years vs. 68 years, p < 0.05) and had more comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes). They also had more locally advanced tumors and pelvic lymph node involvement (47% vs 24%, p < 0.05). The severely obese patients were less likely to undergo recommended surgical staging, with fewer lumbar aortic dissections than women of normal weight (23% vs 36%, p < 0.05) and fewer pelvic sentinel lymph node biopsies (26.5% vs 12.1%, p < 0.05). No difference in RFS or OS were observed between the two groups.Conclusion: Patients with severe obesity and high-risk endometrial cancer have more locally advanced tumors, and are less likely to be managed according to surgical recommendations. However, RFS and OS do not seem to be affected. Keywords: Endometrial cancer Obesity Surgery Clinical management (C) 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI  - Monitoring of Plastic Islands in River Environment Using Sentinel-1 SAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Plastics in the river environment are of major concern due to their potential pathways into the ocean, their persistence in the environment, and their impacts on human and marine health. It has been documented that plastic concentrations in riparian environments are higher following major rain events, where plastic can be moved through surface runoff. Considering the hazard that plastic waste poses to the environment, monitoring techniques are needed to aid in locating, monitoring, and remediating plastic waste within these systems. Dams are known to trap sediments and pollutants, such as metals and Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs). While there is an established background on the monitoring of dams using the synoptic coverage provided by satellite imaging to observe water quality and volume, the detection of marine debris in riparian systems remains challenging, especially in cloudy conditions. Herein, we exploit the use of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) to understand its capabilities for monitoring marine debris. This research focuses on detecting plastic islands within the Drina River system in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia. Here, the results show that the monitoring of these plastic accumulations is feasible using Sentinel-1 SAR data. A quantitative analysis of detection performance is presented using traditional and state-of-the-art change detectors. The analysis of these detectors indicates that detectors that can utilise the coherent data from Single Look Complex (SLC) acquisitions are perform better when compared with those that only utilise incoherent data from Ground Range-Detected (GRD) acquisitions, with true positive detection ratings of -95% with 0.1% false alarm rates seen in the best-performing detector. We also found that that the cross-pol VH channel provides better detection than those based on single-pol VV polarisation.

TI  - Microbiome-Gut Dissociation in the Neonate: Obesity and Coeliac Disease as Examples of Microbiome Function Deficiency Disorder
T2  - GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS
M3  - Review
AB  - The purpose of this article is to provide a direction for translational research based on an analysis of the nature of complex, immune-related conditions such as obesity and coeliac disease. In essence, it seems that the prevalence of these non-communicable diseases is related to the degradation of the microbiome during the industrialisation of society, and that their nature can be used to infer the functions of the "pre-industrial" microbiome. Based on this analysis, the key point is the necessity for the fully functioning microbiome, acting alongside the parental genetic inheritance of the child, to be in place immediately after birth. In our view, this is achieved by the seemingly accidental process of maternal microbial inheritance during normal birth. Note, however, that this is not possible if the microbiome of the mother is itself degraded following previous problems. Under these conditions the health of a child may be affected from the moment of birth, although, with the exception of atopic diseases, such as eczema and food allergy, the consequences may not become apparent until late childhood or as an adult. In this way, this microbiome function deficiency hypothesis incorporates the epidemiological observations of David Strachan and David Barker in that their onset can be traced to early childhood. Coeliac disease has been chosen as an illustrative example of a multifactorial disorder due to the fact that, in addition to a series of immune system manifestations and a potential problem with food absorption, there is also a significant psychological component. Finally, it is worth noting that an ingestible sensor calibrated to the detection of interkingdom communication molecules (semiochemicals) within the intestine may offer a practical way of assessment and, perhaps, amelioration of at least some of the consequences of non-communicable disease.

TI  - Assessing Spatial and Temporal Changes of Natural Capital in a Typical Semi-Arid Protected Area Based on an Ecological Footprint Model
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Exploring spatial and temporal changes in protected areas (PAs) is essential for protecting natural capital and creating a harmonious relationship between humans and nature. This study has assessed land use/land cover (LULC) changes in the Jajrud, a Protected Area with a semi-arid climate zone in Iran (covers an area of 18,814 km(2)), to assess the sustainability of the use of natural resources using Landsat imagery from 1989 to 2018. Likewise, Ecological Footprint accounts (including the sum of biological, freshwater, energy, and pollution) and changes in the per-capita Ecological Carrying Capacity were investigated to uncover Ecological Deficits. The Ecological Pressure Index was used to explore driving factors of natural capital utilization in each of the various identified zones. Between 1989 and 2018, high-density pastures decreased the most in Jajrud, while built-up land increased the most. Likewise, the Ecological Footprint increased while the Ecological Carrying Capacity decreased, increasing Ecological Deficit quantities. Driving factors for the use of natural capital differs among the various zones due to differing management goals, type of uses, and human activity development. As supply and demand for natural resources were clearly out of an imbalance between the supply and demand of natural resources and exceeded the maximum tolerable limits in Jajrud, a change in production and consumption patterns is necessary. This case study has practical importance for establishing mathematical models to reveal the patterns of LULC, ecological footprint, ecological deficit, and ecological pressure indices in a typical PA in a semi-arid region of Iran. Our approach is advisable for semi-arid PAs in Iran and regions with similar attributes in other countries.

TI  - Characterization of the Land Deformation Induced by Groundwater Withdrawal and Aquifer Parameters Using InSAR Observations in the Xingtai Plain, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term overexploitation of groundwater has led to significant land subsidence and ground fissures in the Xingtai plain. These geo-hazards have threatened the safety of buildings and infrastructures. It is extremely important to investigate the coupling relationship between land deformation and hydraulic head change for controlling land subsidence and mitigating ground fissures. In this study, we obtained the spatial and temporal evolution of land deformation in the Xingtai plain by using Envisat/ASAR data during 2009 similar to 2010 and Sentinel-1A data during 2015 similar to 2021. Combining InSAR results, head observations and geological data, we investigated the response of land deformation to head change and estimate the aquifer parameters. First, joint analysis of displacement time series and head changes infers that land subsidence was mainly caused by the inelastic compaction in aquitards. Compared with the subsidence patterns during 2009 similar to 2010, both the rate and spatial extent of land subsidence increased obviously during 2015 similar to 2021. Second, seasonal fluctuations in hydraulic head resulted in significant seasonal deformation with an amplitude of 10 similar to 30 mm and peak time of January similar to March, of which the spatial-temporal distribution was consistent with that of the rapid subsidence. Third, obvious differences in the deformation rate and seasonal amplitude were observed across the Longyao ground fissures and other three potential fissures during 2015 similar to 2021, suggesting that the activity of ground fissures increased compared with that during 2009-2010. Finally, using InSAR results and head observations, we estimated the elastic and inelastic skeletal storativity, with values ranging from 0.9 x 10(-3) to 12.4 x 10(-3) and 6.2 x 10(-3) to 88.0 x 10(-3), respectively. The comparison between elastic and inelastic skeletal storativity suggests that similar to 84.5% of total subsidence was irreversible and permanent.

TI  - GEO-ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC DIAGNOSIS OF THE MUNICIPALITY OF SANTO ANTONIO DE LISBOA/PIAUI
T2  - GEOAMBIENTE ON-LINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The present work was carried out in Santo Antonio de Lisboa - PI, whose area is 385,286 km2, in order to elaborate a geo-environmental and socio-economic diagnosis from the mapping and analysis of the types of land use identified in that municipality. The methodology applied to carry out the research was developed based on bibliographic surveys, collection of statistical data socio-economic indicators, geo-processing techniques/remote sensing and in loco reconnaissance of the object of study (field work). Images from the Landsat 8 satellite (OLI sensor, 2020) were used to prepare the land use and land cover map. After the acquisition of the matrix base, it was treated through digital image processing, generating the land use and land cover mapping of the area. The survey of geo-environmental and socio-economic data along with the mapping of land use and land cover allowed the identification of tensions in the relationship between society and nature, since within 29.44% of the study area, the occurrence of anthropic agricultural areas, deforestation and exposed soil was found, denoting the inadequate use of natural resources. It is believed that the diagnosis of the geo-environmental and socio-economic conditions carried out here can contribute to the territorial planning at the municipal level for regional development purposes.

M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - Objective: To conduct a systematic review of the currently available literature on the use of ICG to guide surgical dissection in gastrointestinal (GI) cancer surgery.Background: Real-time indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence-guided surgery has the potential to enhance surgical outcomes by increasing patient-tailored oncological precision.Methods: MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, and Google Scholar were searched for publications on the use of ICG as a contrast agent in GI cancer surgery until December 2020. Perfusion studies were excluded. Quality of the studies was assessed with the Methodological Index for nonrandomized Studies or Jadad scale for randomized controlled trials. A narrative synthesis of the results was provided, with descriptive statistics when appropriate.Results: Seventy-eight studies were included. ICG was used for primary tumor and metastases localization, for sentinel lymph node detection, and for lymph flow mapping. The detection rate for primary colorectal and gastric tumors was 100% after preoperative ICG endoscopic injection. For liver lesions, the detection rate after intravenous ICG infusion was 80% and up to 100% for lesions less than 8mm from the liver surface. The detection rate for sentinel lymph nodes was 89.8% for esophageal, 98.6% for gastric, 87.4% for colorectal, and 83.3% for anal tumors, respectively. In comparative studies, ICG significantly increases the quality of D2 lymphadenectomy in oncological gastrectomy.Conclusion: The use of ICG as a guiding tool for dissection in GI surgery is promising. Further evidence from high-quality studies on larger sample sizes is needed to assess whether ICG-guided surgery may become standard of care.

TI  - (Near) Real-Time Snow Water Equivalent Observation Using GNSS Refractometry and RTKLIB
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) refractometry enables automated and continuous in situ snow water equivalent (SWE) observations. Such accurate and reliable in situ data are needed for calibration and validation of remote sensing data and could enhance snow hydrological monitoring and modeling. In contrast to previous studies which relied on post-processing with the highly sophisticated Bernese GNSS processing software, the feasibility of in situ SWE determination in post-processing and (near) real time using the open-source GNSS processing software RTKLIB and GNSS refractometry based on the biased coordinate Up component is investigated here. Available GNSS observations from a fixed, high-end GNSS refractometry snow monitoring setup in the Swiss Alps are reprocessed for the season 2016/17 to investigate the applicability of RTKLIB in post-processing. A fixed, low-cost setup provides continuous SWE estimates in near real time at a low cost for the complete 2021/22 season. Additionally, a mobile, (near) real-time and low-cost setup was designed and evaluated in March 2020. The fixed and mobile multi-frequency GNSS setups demonstrate the feasibility of (near) real-time SWE estimation using GNSS refractometry. Compared to state-of-the-art manual SWE observations, a mean relative bias below 5% is achieved for (near) real-time and post-processed SWE estimation using RTKLIB.

TI  - Estimating Regional PM<sub>2.5</sub> Concentrations in China Using a Global-Local Regression Model Considering Global Spatial Autocorrelation and Local Spatial Heterogeneity
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Linear regression models are commonly used for estimating ground PM2.5 concentrations, but the global spatial autocorrelation and local spatial heterogeneity of PM2.5 distribution are either ignored or only partially considered in commonly used models for estimating PM2.5 concentrations. Therefore, taking both global spatial autocorrelation and local spatial heterogeneity into consideration, a global-local regression (GLR) model is proposed for estimating ground PM2.5 concentrations in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and in the Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei (BTH) regions of China based on the aerosol optical depth data, meteorological data, remote sensing data, and pollution source data. Considering the global spatial autocorrelation, the GLR model extracts global factors by the eigenvector spatial filtering (ESF) method, and combines the fraction of them that passes further filtering with the geographically weighted regression (GWR) method to address the local spatial heterogeneity. Comprehensive results show that the GLR model outperforms the ordinary GWR and ESF models, and the GLR model has the best performance at the monthly, seasonal, and annual levels. The average adjusted R-2 of the monthly GLR model in the YRD region (the BTH region) is 0.620 (0.853), which is 8.0% and 7.4% (6.8% and 7.0%) higher than that of the monthly ESF and GWR models, respectively. The average cross-validation root mean square error of the monthly GLR model is 7.024 mu g/m(3) in the YRD region, and 9.499 mu g/m(3) in the BTH region, which is lower than that of the ESF and GWR models. The GLR model can effectively address the spatial autocorrelation and spatial heterogeneity, and overcome the shortcoming of the ordinary GWR model that overfocuses on local features and the disadvantage of the poor local performance of the ordinary ESF model. Overall, the GLR model with good spatial and temporal applicability is a promising method for estimating PM2.5 concentrations.

TI  - RaftNet: A New Deep Neural Network for Coastal Raft Aquaculture Extraction from Landsat 8 OLI Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid development of marine ranching in recent years provides a new way of tackling the global food crisis. However, the uncontrolled expansion of coastal aquaculture has raised a series of environmental problems. The fast and accurate detection of raft will facilitate scientific planning and the precise management of coastal aquaculture. A new deep learning-based approach called RaftNet is proposed in this study to extract the coastal raft aquaculture in Sansha Bay using Landsat 8 OLI images accurately. To overcome the issues of turbid water environments and varying raft scales in aquaculture areas, we constructed the RaftNet by modifying the UNet network with dual-channel and residual hybrid dilated convolution blocks to improve the extraction accuracy. Meanwhile, we adopted the well-known semantic segmentation networks (FCN, SegNet, UNet, UNet++, and ResUNet) as the contrastive approaches for the extraction. The results suggested that the proposed RaftNet model achieves the best accuracy with a precision of 84.5%, recall of 88.1%, F1-score of 86.30%, overall accuracy (OA) of 95.7%, and intersection over union (IoU) of 75.9%. We then utilized our RaftNet to accurately extract a raft aquaculture area in Sansha Bay from 2014 to 2018 and quantitatively analyzed the change in the raft area over this period. The results demonstrated that our RaftNet is robust and suitable for the precise extraction of raft aquaculture with varying scales in turbid coastal waters, and the Kappa coefficient and OA can reach as high as 88% and 97%, respectively. Moreover, the proposed RaftNet will unleash a remarkable potential for long time-series and large-scale raft aquaculture mapping.

TI  - Tropospheric and stratospheric ozone profiles during the 2019 TROpomi vaLIdation eXperiment (TROLIX-19)
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - A TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) validation campaign was held in the Netherlands based at the CESAR (Cabauw Experimental Site for Atmospheric Research) observatory during September 2019. The TROpomi vaLIdation eXperiment (TROLIX-19) consisted of active and passive remote sensing platforms in conjunction with several balloon-borne and surface chemical (e.g., ozone and nitrogen dioxide) measurements. The goal of this joint NASA-KNMI geophysical validation campaign was to make intensive observations in the TROPOMI domain in order to be able to establish the quality of the L2 satellite data products under realistic conditions, such as non-idealized conditions with varying cloud cover and a range of atmospheric conditions at a rural site. The research presented here focuses on using ozone lidars from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center to better evaluate the characterization of ozone throughout TROLIX-19. Results of comparisons to the lidar systems with balloon, space-borne and ground-based passive measurements are shown. In addition, results are compared to a global coupled chemistry meteorology model to illustrate the vertical variability and columnar amounts of both tropospheric and stratospheric ozone during the campaign period.

M3  - Review
AB  - The snow depth or snow water equivalent affects water, carbon, and energy cycles as well as surface-atmosphere interactions. Therefore, the global monitoring of spatiotemporal changes in snow water equivalent is a crucial issue, which is performed by characterizing the macrophysical, microstructural, optical, and thermal characteristics of the snowpack. This paper is a review of the retrieval methods of snow water equivalent in three main categories, including in situ measurements, reconstruction approaches, and space-borne measurements, along with their basic concepts, advantages, and uncertainties. Since satellite observations are the most important tool used to detect snow properties, the paper focuses on inversion models and techniques using microwave remote sensing. The inversion models, based on various theoretical foundations, are classified into empirical, statistical, and physical (emission) models, and the techniques are described in four groups: iterative methods, lookup table, machine learning, and data assimilation approaches. At the end, the available global and regional gridded products providing the spatiotemporal maps of snow water equivalent with different resolutions are presented, as well as approaches for improving the snow data.

TI  - Geospatial Technology-Based Analysis of Air Quality in India during the COVID-19 Pandemic
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The study evaluates the impacts of India's COVID-19 lockdown and unlocking periods on the country's ambient air quality. India experienced three strictly enforced lockdowns followed by unlocking periods where economic and social restrictions were gradually lifted. We have examined the in situ and satellite data of NO2 emissions for several Indian cities to assess the impacts of the lockdowns in India. Additionally, we analyzed NO2 data acquired from the Sentinel-5P TROPOMI sensor over a few districts of the Punjab state, as well as the National Capital Region. The comparisons between the in situ and satellite NO2 emissions were performed for the years 2019, 2020 and up to July 2021. Further analysis was conducted on the satellite data to map the NO2 emissions over India during March to July for the years of 2019, 2020 and 2021. Based on the in situ and satellite observations, we observed that the NO2 emissions significantly decreased by 45-55% in the first wave and 30% in the second wave, especially over the Northern Indian cities during the lockdown periods. The improved air quality over India is indicative of reduced pollution in the atmosphere due to the lockdown process, which slowed down the industrial and commercial activities, including the migration of humans from one place to another. Overall, the present study contributes to the understanding of the trends of the ambient air quality over large geographical areas using the Sentinel-5P satellite data and provides valuable information for regulatory bodies to design a better decision support system to improve air quality.

TI  - Estimation of Urban-Rural Land Surface Temperature Difference at Different Elevations in the Qinling-Daba Mountains Using MODIS and the Random Forest Model
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) variations are very complex in mountainous areas owing to highly heterogeneous terrain and varied environment, which complicates the surface urban heat island (SUHI) in mountain cities. Previous studies on the urban heat island (UHI) effect mostly focus on the flat terrain areas; there are few studies on the UHI effect in mountainous areas, especially on the influence of elevation on the SUHI effect. To determine the SUHI in the Qinling-Daba mountains (China), MODIS LST data were first preprocessed and converted to the same elevations (1500 m, 2000 m, 2500 m, 3000 m, and 3500 m) using a digital elevation model and the random forest method. Then, the average LSTs in urban land, rural land, and cultivated land were calculated separately based on the ranges of the invariable urban, rural, and cultivated areas during 2010-2018, and the urban, rural, and cultivated land LST difference were estimated for the same elevations. Results showed that the accuracy of LST estimated using the random forest method is very high (R-2 >= 0.9) at elevations of 1500 m, 2000 m, 2500 m, 3000 m and 3500 m. The difference in urban, rural, and cultivated lands' LST has a trend of decrease with increasing elevation, meaning that the SUHI weakens at higher elevations. The average LST of urban areas is 0.52-0.59 degrees C (0.42-0.57 degrees C) higher than that of rural and cultivated areas at an elevation of 1500 m (2000 m). The average LST of urban areas is 0.10-1.25 degrees C lower than that of rural and cultivated areas at elevations of 2500 m, 3000 m, and 3500 m, indicating absence of the SUHI at those elevations.

TI  - Enhancing Aboveground Biomass Estimation for Three Pinus Forests in Yunnan, SW China, Using Landsat 8
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The estimation of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) using Landsat 8 operational land imagery (OLI) images has been extensively studied, but forest aboveground biomass (AGB) is often difficult to estimate accurately, in part due to the multi-level structure of forests, the heterogeneity of stands, and the diversity of tree species. In this study, a habitat dataset describing the distribution environment of forests, Landsat 8 OLI image data of spectral reflectance information, as well as a combination of the two datasets were employed to estimate the AGB of the three common pine forests (Pinus yunnanensis forests, Pinus densata forests, and Pinus kesiya forests) in Yunnan Province using a parametric model, stepwise linear regression model (SLR), and a non-parametric model, such as random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM). Based on the results, the following conclusions can be drawn. (1) As compared with the parametric model (SLR), the non-parametric models (RF and SVM) have a better fitting performance for estimating the AGB of the three pine forests, especially in the AGB segment of 40 to 200 Mg/ha. The non-parametric model is more sensitive to the number of data samples. In the case of the Pinus densata forest with a sample size greater than 100, RF fitting provides better fitting performance than SVM fitting, and the SVM fitting model is better suited to the AGB estimation of the Pinus yunnanensis forest with a sample size of less than 100. (2) Landsat 8 OLI images exhibit superior accuracy in estimating the AGB of the three pine forests using a single dataset. Variables, such as texture and vegetation index variables, which can reflect the comprehensive reflection information of ground objects, play a significant role in estimating AGBs, especially the texture variables. (3) By incorporating the combined dataset with characteristics of tree species distribution and ground object reflectance spectrum, the accuracy and stability of AGB estimation of the three pine forests can be improved. Moreover, the employment of a combined dataset is also effective in reducing the number of estimation errors in cases with AGB less than 100 Mg/ha or exceeding 150 Mg/ha.

TI  - Detection, Morphometric Analysis and Digital Surveying of Archaeological Mounds in Southern Iraq with CartoSat-1 and COSMO-SkyMed DEMs
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - In Near and Middle Eastern archaeology, satellite-derived digital elevation models (DEM) of medium spatial resolution (>= 30 m) are mostly used to locate and map archaeological mounds (namely 'tells'), whereas high resolution DEMs (<= 10 m) are still poorly exploited. To fill this gap, the 5 m resolution CartoSat-1 Euro-Maps 3D Digital Surface Model (DSM) is assessed vs. the 30 m Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) global DEM, the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) World 3D-30 m (AW3D30) and a 10 m COSMO-SkyMed DEM, on a test area in Wasit, southern Iraq, where the high density of tells is yet to be exhaustively documented. A total of 344 sites was mapped, with one order of magnitude improvement compared to previous mapping exercises, existing databases and historical maps. The morphometric analysis not only highlights the reliability of CartoSat-1 DSM height and volume estimates, but also suggests that, in the test area, the volume of a tell can robustly be calculated based on the simple knowledge of its basal area, following a quadratic function. Morphology and elevation of at least 53% irregularly shaped tells were impacted by anthropogenic disturbances. Morphometric indices (e.g., Topographic Position Index, DEViation from mean elevation) are a viable automated method to ease tells detection. When integrated with other satellite datasets (e.g., CORONA, Google Earth, Sentinel-2 imagery), the CartoSat-1 DSM can unveil morphological changes and support condition assessment. In Wasit, agriculture and modern development are among the major threats for tells preservation, alongside looting.

TI  - Syndromic surveillance of respiratory infections during protracted conflict: experiences from northern Syria 2016-2021
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Northern Syria faces a large burden of influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respira-tory illness (SARI). This study aimed to investigate the trends of Early Warning and Response Network (EWARN) reported ILI and SARI in northern Syria between 2016 and 2021 and the potential impact of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We extracted weekly EWARN data on ILI/ SARI and aggregated cases and consultations into 4-week intervals to calculate case positivity. We conducted a seasonal-trend decomposition to assess case trends in the presence of seasonal fluctuations. Results: It was observed that 4-week aggregates of ILI cases (n = 5,942,012), SARI cases (n = 114,939), ILI case positivity, and SARI case positivity exhibited seasonal fluctuations with peaks in the winter months. ILI and SARI cases in individuals aged >= 5 years surpassed those in individuals aged < 5 years in late 2019. ILI cases clustered primarily in Aleppo and Idlib, whereas SARI cases clustered in Aleppo, Idlib, Deir Ezzor, and Hassakeh. SARI cases increased sharply in 2021, corresponding with a severe SARS-CoV-2 wave, compared with the steady increase in ILI cases over time. Conclusion: Respiratory infections cause widespread morbidity and mortality throughout northern Syria, particularly with the emergence of SARS-CoV-2. Strengthened surveillance and access to testing and treat-ment are critical to manage outbreaks among conflict-affected populations. (C) 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Incels (a term for those who identify as involuntarily celibate) are most commonly heterosexual men who believe that they are sexually rejected by women because of their genetics and the advent of feminism. The incel movement has grown over the past two decades, with help from the internet. The incel worldview is centered around entitlement, the inferiority of women, and fatalism, which they discuss using specific jargon and idioms. Incels may be referred for various types of forensic psychiatric evaluations as a result of their unusual beliefs, as well as engagement in acts of violence related to their worldview. Understanding the extant literature about the incel population, worldview, and mental health concerns will help forensic psychiatrists to identify members of this subgroup, which will assist in completing forensic evaluations.

TI  - Enhancing Smallholder Wheat Yield Prediction through Sensor Fusion and Phenology with Machine Learning and Deep Learning Methods
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Field-scale prediction methods that use remote sensing are significant in many global projects; however, the existing methods have several limitations. In particular, the characteristics of smallholder systems pose a unique challenge in the development of reliable prediction methods. Therefore, in this study, a fast and reproducible new approach to wheat prediction is developed by combining predictors derived from optical (Sentinel-2) and radar (Sentinel-1) sensors using a diverse set of machine learning and deep learning methods under a small dataset domain. This study takes place in the wheat belt region of Ethiopia and evaluates forty-two predictors that represent the major vegetation index categories of green, water, chlorophyll, dry biomass, and VH polarization SAR indices. The study also applies field-collected agronomic data from 165 farm fields for training and validation. According to results, compared to other methods, a combined automated machine learning (AutoML) approach with a generalized linear model (GLM) showed higher performance. AutoML, which reduces training time, delivered ten influential parameters. For the combined approach, the mean RMSE of wheat yield was from 0.84 to 0.98 ton/ha using ten predictors from the test dataset, achieving a 99% confidence interval. It also showed a correlation coefficient as high as 0.69 between the estimated yield and measured yield, and it was less sensitive to the small datasets used for model training and validation. A deep neural network with three hidden layers using the ten influential parameters was the second model. For this model, the mean RMSE of wheat yield was between 1.31 and 1.36 ton/ha on the test dataset, achieving a 99% confidence interval. This model used 55 neurons with respective values of 0.1, 0.5, and 1 x 10(-4) for the hidden dropout ratio, input dropout ratio, and 12 regularization. The approaches implemented in this study are fast and reproducible and beneficial to predict yield at scale. These approaches could be adapted to predict grain yields of other cereal crops grown under smallholder systems in similar global production systems.

TI  - Drivers and Implications of Land Cover Dynamics in Muger Sub-Basin, Abay Basin, Ethiopia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Research on the landscape level dynamics of land cover and an understanding of the drivers responsible for these changes are useful for formulations of sustainable land management strategies and policy decisions. The pace and magnitude of the LCCs in Ethiopia are threatening the natural ecosystem and creating vulnerability to environmental hazards. This study used a combination of remotely sensed data, field interviews, and observations to examine the dynamics and identify the driving forces of LCC from 1986 to 2020 in the Muger sub-basin, Ethiopia. Multi-temporal satellite images were classified using supervised and unsupervised methods. Information from focus group discussions and the variable ranking method were used to explain the drivers of the observed changes. The study results showed a decline in forest cover from 11.80% in 1986 to 5.90% in 2020, which indicates a loss of 49.90% of the forest cover that existed in 1986. Bare land declined from 1.15% in 1986 to 0.57% in 2020. Similarly, grazing land declined from 1.52% in 1986 to 0.41% in 2020. Wetland also declined from 1.93% in 1986 to 0.31% in 2020. Conversely, during the same period, the proportions of cultivated land, built-up areas, shrubland, and water bodies have risen from 68.86% to 70.44%, from 0.03% to 1.53%, from 14.39% to 20.27%, and from 0.34% to 0.56%, respectively. Population growth and poor agricultural practices were identified as the main causes of LCC in the sub-basin. Therefore, the findings of this study suggest that implementation of comprehensive and integrated basin management policies and strategies will be indispensable to managing the risks and ensuring sustainable development in the larger Abay basin.

TI  - Mapping Multi-Decadal Mangrove Extent in the Northern Coast of Vietnam Using Landsat Time-Series Data on Google Earth Engine Platform
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A pixel-based algorithm for multi-temporal Landsat (TM/ETM+/OLI/OLI-2) imagery between 1990 and 2022 monitored mangrove dynamics and detected their changes in the three provinces (i.e., Thai Binh, Nam Dinh and Hai Phong), which are located on the Northern coast of Vietnam, through the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform. Results showed that the mangrove area in the study area decreased from 2960 ha in 1990 to 2408 ha in 1995 and then significantly increased to 4435 ha in 2000 but later declined to 3502 ha in 2005. The mangrove areas experienced an increase from 4706 ha in 2010 to 10,125 ha in 2020 and reached a highest peak of 10,630 ha in 2022. In 2022, Hai Phong province had the largest area of mangrove (3934 ha), followed by Nam Dinh (3501 ha) and Thai Binh (3195 ha) provinces. The overall accuracies for 2020 and 2022 were 94.94% and 91.98%, while the Kappa coefficients were 0.90 and 0.84, respectively. The mangrove restoration programs and policies by the Vietnamese government and local governments are the key drivers of this increase in mangroves in the three provinces from 1990 to 2022. The results also demonstrated that the combination of Landsat time series images, a pixel-based algorithm, and the GEE platform has a high potential for monitoring long-term change of mangrove forests during 32 years in the tropics. Moreover, the obtained mangrove forest maps at a 30-m spatial resolution can serve as a useful and up-to-date dataset for sustainable management and conservation of these mangrove forests in the Red River Delta, Vietnam.

TI  - Comparative Analysis of BPDF Land Surface Models Based on DPC Measurements of Gaofen-5 Satellite and Data of AERONET Sites
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The polarized reflectance estimation of land surfaces is one of the most important uncertainties in the polarized remote sensing detection of atmospheric aerosol by satellites and thus becomes an important link in the land-atmosphere decoupling during aerosol inversion. The directional polarized measurements of atmospheric aerosol in the near-infrared band (865 nm) by a directional polarimetric camera (DPC) aboard the GaoFen (GF-5) satellite are spatiotemporally matched with the aerosol product AOD L2. 0 of the sites of the worldwide ground-based aerosol monitoring website AERONET. Data corresponding to small aerosol optical depth (AOD) values are thereby screened out to reduce the influence of aerosol and further to obtain directional polarized reflectance data of the land surface. The performance of five semiempirical bidirectionally polarized reflectance distribution function (BPDF) models of land surfaces for eight typical land surface types is quantitatively compared using the DPC measurements. The models compared included the Nadal-Breon model, the Waquet model, the Maignan model, the Litvinov model, and the Xie-Cheng model. The comparison shows that the results of the Litvinov and Nadal-Breon models agree well with the DPC measurements. Specifically, the average correlation coefficients of the results of the two models with the DPC measurements reach 0. 958 and 0. 952, respectively, and the corresponding average root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) are 0. 202% and 0. 223%, respectively. The research results serve as a reference concerning BPDF models for polarized reflectance estimation of land surfaces with DPC data and provide prior data support for applications such as the inversion of aerosol parameters with DPC data.

TI  - Satellite Observational Evidence of Contrasting Changes in Northern Eurasian Wildfires from 2003 to 2020
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires play a critical role in re-shaping boreal ecosystems and climate. It was projected that, owing to the Arctic amplification, boreal wildfires would become more frequent and severe in the coming decades. Although provoking concern, the spatiotemporal changes in boreal wildfires remain unclear, and there are substantial inconsistencies among previous findings. In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis to determine the spatiotemporal changes in wildfires over Northern Eurasia (NEA) from 2003 to 2020 using a reconstructed Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) active fire product. We found that wildfires in NEA exhibited contrasting changes in different latitudinal zones, land cover types, and seasons from 2003 to 2020. Cropland wildfires, mainly distributed at low latitudes (50-60 degrees N), considerably decreased by 81% during the study period. Whereas forest wildfires ignited at high latitudes (north of 60 degrees N) have nearly tripled (increasing at rate of 11 similar to 13% per year) during the past two decades. The southwestern and northeastern NEA regions exhibited contrasting patterns of wildfire changes. The active fire counts in the southwestern NEA decreased by 90% at a rate of 0.29(+/- 0.12) x 10(5) per year, with cropland fires contributing to similar to 66% of the decrease. However, the fire counts in the northeastern NEA increased by 292% at a rate of 0.23(+/- 0.12) x 10(5) per year, with boreal forests contributing to similar to 97% of the increase. It is worth noting that the contrasting changes in wildfires during the past two decades have led to significant structural alternation in the NEA wildfire composition. Forest fires, contributing over 60% of the total fire counts in NEA nowadays, have become the predominant component of the NEA wildfires. The contrasting changes in NEA wildfires imply that more forest fires may emerge in far northern regions of the North Hemisphere as the Arctic becomes progressively warmer in the coming decades. As wildfires continue to increase, more gases and aerosols would be released to the atmosphere and cause considerable feedback to the Arctic climate. The increased wildfire-related climate feedbacks should, therefore, be seriously considered in climate models and projections.

TI  - Forest Fire Spread Monitoring and Vegetation Dynamics Detection Based on Multi-Source Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the increasingly severe damage wreaked by forest fires, their scientific and effective prevention and control has attracted the attention of countries worldwide. The breakthrough of remote sensing technologies implemented in the monitoring of fire spread and early warning has become the development direction for their prevention and control. However, a single remote sensing data collection point cannot simultaneously meet the temporal and spatial resolution requirements of fire spread monitoring. This can significantly affect the efficiency and timeliness of fire spread monitoring. This article focuses on the mountain fires that occurred in Muli County, on 28 March 2020, and in Jingjiu Township on 30 March 2020, in Liangshan Prefecture, Sichuan Province, as its research objects. Multi-source satellite remote sensing image data from Planet, Sentinel-2, MODIS, GF-1, GF-4, and Landsat-8 were used for fire monitoring. The spread of the fire time series was effectively and quickly obtained using the remote sensing data at various times. Fireline information and fire severity were extracted based on the calculated differenced normalized burn ratio (dNBR). This study collected the meteorological, terrain, combustibles, and human factors related to the fire. The random forest algorithm analyzed the collected data and identified the main factors, with their order of importance, that affected the spread of the two selected forest fires in Sichuan Province. Finally, the vegetation coverage before and after the fire was calculated, and the relationship between the vegetation coverage and the fire severity was analyzed. The results showed that the multi-source satellite remote sensing images can be utilized and implemented for time-evolving forest fires, enabling forest managers and firefighting agencies to plan improved firefighting actions in a timely manner and increase the effectiveness of firefighting strategies. For the forest fires in Sichuan Province studied here, the meteorological factors had the most significant impact on their spread compared with other forest fire factors. Among all variables, relative humidity was the most crucial factor affecting the spread of forest fires. The linear regression results showed that the vegetation coverage and dNBR were significantly correlated before and after the fire. The vegetation coverage recovery effects were different in the fire burned areas depending on fire severity. High vegetation recovery was associated with low-intensity burned areas. By combining the remote sensing data obtained by multi-source remote sensing satellites, accurate and macro dynamic monitoring and quantitative analysis of wildfires can be carried out. The study's results provide effective information on the fires in Sichuan Province and can be used as a technical reference for fire spread monitoring and analysis through remote sensing, enabling accelerated emergency responses.

TI  - Climate Justice in the City: Mapping Heat-Related Risk for Climate Change Mitigation of the Urban and Peri-Urban Area of Padua (Italy)
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The mitigation of urban heat islands (UHIs) is crucial for promoting the sustainable development of urban areas. Geographic information systems (GISs) together with satellite-derived data are powerful tools for investigating the spatiotemporal distribution of UHIs. Depending on the availability of data and the geographic scale of the analysis, different methodologies can be adopted. Here, we show a complete open source GIS-based methodology based on satellite-driven data for investigating and mapping the impact of the UHI on the heat-related elderly risk (HERI) in the Functional Urban Area of Padua. Thermal anomalies in the territory were mapped by modelling satellite data from Sentinel-3. After a socio-demographic analysis, the HERI was mapped according to five levels of risk. The highest vulnerability levels were localised within the urban area and in three municipalities near Padua, which represent about 20% of the entire territory investigated. In these municipalities, a percentage of elderly people over 20%, a thermal anomaly over 2.4 degrees C, and a HERI over 0.65 were found. Based on these outputs, it is possible to define nature-based solutions for reducing the UHI phenomenon and promote a sustainable development of cities. Stakeholders can use the results of these investigations to define climate and environmental policies.

TI  - Estimation of On-Road PM<sub>2.5</sub> Distributions by Combining Satellite Top-of-Atmosphere With Microscale Geographic Predictors for Healthy Route Planning
T2  - GEOHEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - How to reduce the health risks for commuters, caused by air pollution such as PM2.5 has always been an urgent issue needing to be solved. Proposed in this study, is a novel framework which enables greater avoidance of pollution and hence assists the provision of healthy travel. This framework is based on the estimation of on-road PM2.5 throughout the whole city. First, the micro-scale PM2.5 is predicted by land use regression (LUR) modeling enhanced by the use of the Landsat-8 top-of-atmosphere (TOA) data and microscale geographic predictors. In particular, the green view index (GVI) factor derived, the sky view factor, and the index-based built-up index, are incorporated within the TOA-LUR modeling. On-road PM2.5 distributions are then mapped in high-spatial-resolution. The maps obtained can be used to find healthy travel routes with less PM2.5. The proposed framework was applied in high-density Hong Kong by Landsat 8 images. External testing was based on mobile measurements. The results showed that the estimation performance of the proposed seasonal TOA-LUR Geographical and Temporal Weighted Regression models is at a high-level with an R-2 of 0.70-0.90. The newly introduced GVI index played an important role in these estimations. The PM2.5 distribution maps at high-spatial-resolution were then used to develop an application providing Hong Kong residents with healthy route planning services. The proposed framework can, likewise, be applied in other cities to better ensure people's health when traveling, especially those in high-density cities.Plain Language Summary Every year, exposure to outdoor air pollution has caused 7 million premature deaths and resulted in the loss of millions more healthy years of life. Therefore, it's critical to establish planning tools to support people's healthier and cleaner daily travel. By land use regression (LUR) modeling enhanced by the Landsat-8 top-of-atmosphere (TOA) data and microscale geographic predictors, the original framework proposed in this study provides an estimation and a mapping of on-road PM2.5 at the fine scale, providing people with healthier travel choices. The estimation performance of the proposed seasonal TOA-LUR Geographical and Temporal Weighted Regression models achieved a high R-2 of 0.70-0.90. It may become a reference and guide for high-density cities, for smart travel planning and refined monitoring of air pollution in urban areas. It is hoped, therefore, that this study assists more people in urban areas to reduce their exposure to outdoor air pollution, both to protect their health, and assist in the construction of healthy cities, especially for the high-density city.

TI  - Flood vulnerability assessment at the local scale using remote sensing and GIS techniques: a case study in Da Nang City, Vietnam
T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper has developed a cost-efficient framework for flood vulnerability assessment at a local scale using a multi-parametric approach integrated with the Open Source Geographical Information System (GIS) and Open Remote Sensing data. The study focuses on generating a set of criteria considering three dimensions of flood vulnerability: exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity (AC) on an index-based approach. These indicators were decided based on a robust analysis considering the physical and socio-economic conditions of the study area. The flood exposure was generated from the geomorphological and hydrological parameters integrated with the flood water depth, the distance to river channels, and the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index. The flood sensitivity was determined by the aggregation of local income, land use, poverty index, population density, and other parameters reflecting the socio-economic condition. The AC has been evaluated based on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, the density of the community service facilities, and other factors related to the coping capacity to flood. Finally, the flood vulnerability at the local scale was determined based on the integration of its contributing factors using the Analytical Hierarchical Process-based aggregated model. Results indicated that a total of 20 parameters impacted the flood vulnerability of the research area. The findings also confirmed that among the indicators of flood vulnerability of Da Nang City, the flood depth, land-use condition, and drainage system are the key factors affecting the vulnerability level. The empirical assessment showed that the study area is significantly affected by flood vulnerability with more than 60% of the area having the vulnerability level from moderate to very high. In addition, this paper points out that the vulnerability research should be localized and is not always based on the administrative units. This practice can make the decision-making process and adaptation plan more appropriate locally. Especially, this study attempted to evaluate the accuracy of the flood vulnerability map for the first time by using field survey data and the statistical report on flood damage that most of the previous studies have not conducted yet. This framework provides a valuable toolkit for flood management in data-scarce regions all over the world.

TI  - Nutrition Research Funding Trends and Focus Areas at the US National Cancer Institute
T2  - JNCI CANCER SPECTRUM
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Evidence for diet and nutrition's role in the cancer continuum is inconsistent and requires further study. Although more investigation is needed, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) funding for nutrition has decreased. Methods: To examine nutrition research funding at the NCI, a portfolio analysis was undertaken for fiscal year (FY) 2018. Nutrition and other cancer-related terms were searched using the National Institutes of Health Query View and Report grants management dashboard. Grants were categorized by mechanism, funding status, applicant characteristics, funding opportunity announcement type, award type, and study characteristics. Results: A total of 18 233 NCI grant applications were submitted in FY 2018; 12% were funded. Of the 653 nutrition-related grant applications received, 69 (11%) were funded. Funding status of nutrition grants did not differ statistically based on the type of funding opportunity announcement and were higher for applications classified as investigator initiated. Early stage investigators' nutrition applications were funded less than other investigators. Only 4% and 6% of overall and funded nutrition grant applications were submitted by registered dietitian nutritionist primary investigators, respectively. Average FY 2018 award amounts for funded nutrition and overall grant applications were approximately US $399 000 and approximately US $703 000, respectively. Although the percentage of NCI nutrition grants funded was similar to other grant funding at NCI in FY 2018, between FY 2012 and FY 2018, NCI decreased overall nutrition funding by 44%. Conclusions: Average grant award amounts for nutrition were less compared with overall NCI-funded grant applications and other topics. Our analysis highlights potential opportunities for greater investment in nutrition research at the NCI.

TI  - Discrimination of Mangrove Stages Using Multitemporal Sentinel-1 C-Band Backscatter and Sentinel-2 Data-A Case Study in Samut Songkhram Province, Thailand
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Discrimination of mangrove stage changes is useful for the conservation of this valuable natural resource. However, present-day optical satellite imagery is not fully reliable due to its high sensitivity to weather conditions and tidal variables. Here, we used the Vertical Transmit-Vertical Receive Polarization (VV) and Vertical Transmit-Horizontal Receive Polarization (VH) backscatter from the same and multiple-incidence angles from Sentinel-1 SAR C-band along with Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), Normalized Difference Red Edge (NDVIRE) and Chlorophyll Index Green (CIGreen) from the optical satellite imageries from Sentinel-2 to discriminate between the changes in disturbance, recovery, and healthy mangrove stages in Samut Songkhram province, Thailand. We found the mean NDVI values to be 0.08 (+/- 0.11), 0.19 (+/- 0.09), and -0.53 (+/- 0.16) for the three stages, respectively. We further found their correlation with VH backscatter from the multiple-incidence angles at about -17.98 (+/- 2.34), -16.43 (+/- 1.59), and -13.40 (+/- 1.07), respectively. The VH backscatter from multiple-incidence angles was correlated with NDVI using Pearson's correlation (r(2) = 0.62). However, Pearson's correlation of a single plot (ID2) of mangrove stage change from disturbance to recovery, and then on to the healthy mangrove stage, displayed a r(2) of 0.93 (p value is less than 0.0001, n = 34). This indicated that the multitemporal Sentinel-1 C-band backscatter and Sentinel-2 data could be used to discriminate mangrove stages, and that a reduced correlation to significant observations was the result of variations in both optical and SAR backscatter data.

M3  - Article
AB  - Postmodernism as a paradigm of culture in the 1960s- 90s offers his own view on the problem of plurality. Plurality in the form of differences has an ontological character, which makes it possible to see in each phenomenon, culture, person, community an individual, constantly revealing itself and its own capabilities. The part, not the whole, the identical, the total, is declared primordial and equal.Differences and plurality become possible as independent constructs as a result of a cultural worldview turn in relation to the understanding of the Other. European culture and the whole world have done a great job of overcoming stereotypically negative views on the phenomenon of being different, other, going beyond the socio-cultural, biological, gender norms or what is commonly considered as such.The category of the Other is complex and is interpreted differently by scientists. Moreover, it is diversely represented in cultural models and national forms of thinking. Otherness, on the one hand, is individuality, distinctiveness, which allows you to be original, individual. On the other hand, it can be imperceptibly constructed by socially powerful practices. In any case, the Other undermines the totality by incorporating differences into it, or, in the language of Jacques Derrida, differences."Difference", includes several semantic constructions-words, simultaneously present in it. This is "difference" - difference, distinction, dissimilarity, inconsistency, differentiation; as well as " differe" - to postpone, postpone; "fero" - to carry, wear. The result of being in constant motion and mutual transition of meanings is the understanding of " difference" as a neologism, including "distinguish, delay, bear". Its content casts doubt on the legitimacy of identity as the main mental construct of Modern culture, since it includes the plurality of Others.The phenomenon of the Other in "difference" overcomes the metaphysical nature of logocentrism. The term itself indicates the initial presence of otherness in a person, society, culture, more precisely, the procedure for replacing " e" with the letter "a" ("differance" instead of "difference"). "A" - "Other" is designed to make the construction of in "difference" mobile, ambiguous, revealing potential differences in a word, concept, person, etc. The other makes "difference / distinction" different from the meanings and contexts present in it, as well as from other objects and processes. In this sense, "difference" cannot be reduced to any one of the meanings. This does not mean, however, that difference denies connection, interaction as such.The Other decomposes the homogeneity of the European and daughter civilizations, resorting to a variety of methods and benefits, most often using marginalized practices, escaping from unambiguity and absolutizing totality. In this regard, the Other in "difference" is aimed at including diversity, plurality, recognition of different ways and models of the development of personality and civilization in the field of human culture and society.

TI  - Protective Effects of Systiva® Seed Treatment Fungicide for the Control of Winter Wheat Foliar Diseases Caused at Early Stages Due to Climate Change
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Foliar fungal diseases are a serious threat to winter wheat production and climate change appears to favor pathogens associated with leaf blotch and tan spot symptoms in the Mediterranean area. The present work aimed to highlight these risks and propose appropriate disease management strategies by evaluating the seed treatment with the Systiva (R) (BASF) fungicide as a means to protect the crop against foliar fungal infections during the early growing stages. Towards that aim, plant tissue symptoms affected by the pathogens Pyrenophora tritici-repentis and Septoria spp. were systematically recorded in a study field in the region of Larissa, central Greece for three years (2016-2018), and the findings were associated with the monthly weather anomalies. Consequently, for the growing period of 2021-2022, a field experiment was established in the same disease prone field, comparing different doses of the seed treatment with Systiva (R) fungicide against leaf blotch and tan spot diseases. The evaluation was made by visual disease assessments, remote sensing with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and metagenomics analysis. Parallel measurements on straw residues were also made to characterize the plant residues perithecia (pseudothecia). Visual leaf disease assessments and UAV remote sensing data showed that Systiva (R) treatments at doses of 125 cc and 150 cc per 100 kg of wheat seed can reduce the percentage of infected wheat plants caused by foliar fungal pathogens at wheat growth stages GS23-25 and GS30-31. Moreover, the metagenomics analyses performed on the microbial communities revealed that Systiva (R) can decrease the degree of infection by P. tritici-repentis and Z. tritici but do not provide sufficient protection against P. nodorum. Foliar diseases were influenced by the soil surface area covered with straw residue with a high proportion of natural inoculum (pseudothecia/ascospores).

TI  - Mapping Soil and Pasture Attributes for Buffalo Management through Remote Sensing and Geostatistics in Amazon Biome
T2  - ANIMALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Buffalo breeding in the Amazon biome can contribute significantly to local community development and, thus, is considered an essential income source. However, in Amazon regions, the inadequate breeding of these animals can lead to considerable negative consequences for the environment. Therefore, it is crucial to develop methodologies to improve animal management and grass yield. One of these methodologies is related to Precision Agriculture (PA), adapted for pasture and animal monitoring. Along these lines, we seek to utilize geostatistical techniques and remote sensing applications to better understand Buffalo grazing under a rotating system. In particular, we analyze forage Dry and Green Matter, as well as pH in pasture soils, demonstrating the obstacles against and advantages of the implementation of precise techniques for decision making and increasing grass productivity. We describe ways in which geostatistical soil pH mapping can be conducted, as well as the premises necessary to include remote sensing data in the analysis of pasture variables. Implementing these results in buffalo management systems can contribute to greater productivity and increasingly sustainable livestock. The mapping of pastures can serve to increase productivity and reduce deforestation, especially in Amazon Biome regions. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to explore precision agriculture technologies for assessing the spatial variations of soil pH and biomass indicators (i.e., Dry Matter, DM; and Green Matter, GM). An experiment was conducted in an area cultivated with Panicum maximum (Jacq.) cv. Mombaca in a rotational grazing system for dairy buffaloes in the eastern Amazon. Biomass and soil samples were collected in a 10 m x 10 m grid, with a total of 196 georeferenced points. The data were analyzed by semivariogram and then mapped by Kriging interpolation. In addition, a variability analysis was performed, applying both the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) derived from satellite remote sensing data. The Kriging mapping between DM and pH at 0.30 m depth demonstrated the best correlation. The vegetative index mapping showed that the NDVI presented a better performance in pastures with DM production above 5.42 ton/ha(-1). In contrast, DM and GM showed low correlations with the NDWI. The possibility of applying a variable rate within the paddocks was evidenced through geostatistical mapping of soil pH. With this study, we contribute to understanding the necessary premises for utilizing remote sensing data for pasture variable analysis.

TI  - Diagnostic test accuracy of sentinel lymph node biopsy in squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx, larynx, and hypopharynx: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - HEAD AND NECK-JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENCES AND SPECIALTIES OF THE HEAD AND NECK
M3  - Review
AB  - The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine the diagnostic test accuracy of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in patients with oropharyngeal, laryngeal, and hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). For this purpose, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched from inception to March 8, 2022. Included were studies evaluating diagnostic test accuracy of SLNB to identify cervical lymph node metastases with elective neck dissection or follow-up as reference. A bivariate generalized linear mixed model approach was used for the meta-analysis. Nineteen studies were eligible, evaluating 377 cases in total. The pooled estimates of sensitivity and negative predictive value were 0.93 (95% CI: 0.86-0.96) and 0.97 (95% CI: 0.94-0.98), respectively. The excellent accuracy of SLNB justifies a place in the diagnostic workup of patients with larynx and pharynx SCC. Randomized trials are required to demonstrate oncologic safety and benefits on treatment related morbidity and quality of life when omitting elective neck treatment based on SLNB.

M3  - Article
AB  - Due to extreme weather, occasionally Hungary's main rivers and lakes grow an ice cover causing severe damage to infrastructure and increased flood hazard. During cold periods in 2017 and 2022, a dangerous layer of ice developed on the main rivers in the country. Since river ice is rare in this region, no permanent ice monitoring system is in operation. Due to their all weather capabilities, active remote sensing instruments provide a good opportunity to monitor ice coverage. ESA's Sentinel-1 radar satellites acquire data with a relatively high spatial and temporal resolution. A method was developed to provide ice coverage information at a regular interval; depending on the satellite revisit, at least once every 5 days, but often also on a daily basis. In 2017, maps were created for sections along the Danube and in 2022 for another section of the Tisza river. The ice coverage was calculated with a spatial resolution of 10 metre and visualised with a spatial density of 100 metre along the rivers. The mapping procedure provides visual information to give a fast overview of the spatial extent of ice coverage and quantitative, tabular information for operational activities to mitigate the damage due to ice packs and ice jams.

TI  - Hotspot Habitat Modeling of Skipjack Tuna<i> (Katsuwonus</i><i> pelamis)</i> in the Indian Ocean by Using Multisatellite Remote Sensing
T2  - TURKISH JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Skipjack tuna (SKJ) is one of the most targeted fish species globally, especially in the Indian Ocean. SKJ fishery data from Iranian purse seiners and multisatellite remote sensing data were used for hotspot habitat modeling from 2010 to 2018. Spatial and temporal variables were the most important predictors in the generalized additive model (GAM), and 58.6% of the variance was explained. In the MaxEnt model, sea surface temperature (SST), eddy kinetic energy (EKE), and sea surface height (SSH) were the most important predictors of SKJ hotspot habitat suitability in the tropical Indian Ocean between 2 degrees S and 2 degrees N. Furthermore, of the total studied area in the Indian Ocean defined as optimal habitat (habitat suitability index 0.6), 6.8% and 5.3% exhibited ordinary habitat suitability (AUC=0.934, P<0.01) and hotspot habitat suitability (AUC=0.952, P<0.01), respec tively. Iranian purse seiners are distributed mainly in tropical areas, and in the present study, SKJ habitat was affected by environmental variables, as determined using multisatellite remote sensing data. In general, for effective regional monitoring and management strategies to ensure sustainable fisheries, diverse datasets compiled using satellite datasets and habitat modeling can help identify potential hotspot habitats, thereby enabling more accurate suitable habitat zone predictions and more efficient stock management.

TI  - Anthropogenic influences on coastal environmental changes in the Mekong Delta: a study from Ben Tre Province, Southern Vietnam
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Low-lying coastal environments are highly dynamic and sensitive to natural as well as anthropogenic perturbations. Climate change, sea level rise, storms and tsunamis are the natural phenomena that affect the deltaic coasts in Southeast Asia in general and Vietnam in particular. The effects of these phenomena can be exacerbated by human activities such as mangrove deforestation, aquaculture and infrastructure development. Conversely, the low-lying coastal areas are important in the economic development of Southeast Asian countries. In the Vietnamese Mekong Delta, coastal areas have been affected by a number of factors, such as climate change, sea level rise, aquaculture, pollution and tourism-related activities in recent decades. The present study investigated shoreline changes, expansion of aquaculture ponds, soil salinity changes and salinity intrusion in the river systems along the coastal areas of Ben Tre Province in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta between 1998 and 2020 using satellite imagery and field data. Variations in erosion and accretion were found to be not unique along the coast of Ben Tre. There was a rapid expansion of aquaculture ponds between 1998 and 2015 and a slight decline since then. Soil salinity has been increased between 1998 and 2020; it is seen from recent satellite data that soil is becoming more saline in the inland areas of Ben Tre. Saltwater intrusion into the rivers of Ben Tre is considered associated with El Nino-La Nina conditions. It is suggested that reforestation of abandoned shrimp ponds in Ben Tre by mangrove vegetation can be effective as a bioshield against coastal hazards, such as sea level rise and shoreline erosion.

TI  - Access to Cardiovascular Care for Indigenous Peoples in Canada: A Rapid Review.
T2  - CJC open
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - Indigenous peoples in Canada are at an increased risk of cardiovascular disease compared to non-Indigenous people. Contributing factors include historical oppression, racism, healthcare biases, and disparities in terms of the social determinants of health. Access to and inequity in cardiovascular care for Indigenous peoples in Canada remain poorly studied and understood. A rapid review of the literature was performed using the PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Indigenous Studies Portal (iPortal) databases to identify articles describing access to cardiovascular care for Indigenous peoples in Canada between 2002 and 2021. Included articles were presented narratively in the context of delays in seeking, reaching, or receiving care, or as disparities in cardiovascular outcomes, and were assessed for their successful engagement in indigenous health research using a preexisting framework. Current research suggests that gaps most prominently present as delays in receiving care and as poorer long-term outcomes. The literature is concentrated in Alberta, Manitoba, and Ontario, as well as among First Nations people, and is largely rooted in a biomedical worldview. Additional community-driven research is required to better elucidate the gaps in access to holistic cardiovascular care for Indigenous peoples in Canada. Healthcare professionals, researchers, and policymakers should reflect further upon their actions and privilege, educate themselves about historical facts and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, tackle prevailing disparities and systemic barriers in the healthcare systems, and develop culturally safe and ethically appropriate healthcare interventions to improve the health of all Indigenous peoples in Canada.
AB  - Le risque de maladies cardiovasculaires est plus eleve chez les populations autochtones du Canada que chez les populations non autochtones. Loppression historique, le racisme, les prejuges dans les soins de sante et les disparites quant aux determinants sociaux de la sante sont des facteurs qui contribuent a ce phenomene. Lacces aux soins cardiovasculaires et lequite des soins pour les personnes autochtones du Canada sont des questions peu etudiees et mal comprises. Une revue rapide de la litterature a ete realisee dans les bases de donnees PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science et Indigenous Studies Portal (iPortal) pour recenser les articles publies entre 2002 et 2021 qui decrivent lacces aux soins cardiovasculaires pour les peuples autochtones du Canada. Les articles retenus sont presentes de maniere narrative et font etat de retards dans la recherche de soins, dans latteinte dun etablissement de soins et dans lobtention des soins, ou de certaines disparites quant aux resultats de sante cardiovasculaire. Ces articles ont egalement ete evalues dapres leur integration reussie des principes de recherche en sante autochtone a partir dun cadre deja etabli. Selon les recherches actuelles, les ecarts se manifestent principalement par des retards dans lobtention des soins et par des resultats de sante plus defavorables a long terme. Les etudes publiees se concentrent surtout sur lAlberta, le Manitoba et lOntario, portent principalement sur les Premieres Nations et sont en grande partie abordees selon une perspective biomedicale. Des recherches plus approfondies, menees avec les communautes autochtones, sont necessaires pour mieux comprendre les ecarts dans lacces a des soins cardiovasculaires holistiques pour les peuples autochtones du Canada. Les professionnels de la sante, les chercheurs et les decideurs politiques devraient entreprendre un processus de reflexion approfondie sur leurs actions et leurs privileges, sinformer sur les realites historiques ainsi que sur la Commission de verite et reconciliation, sattaquer aux disparites qui perdurent et aux barrieres systemiques dans lacces aux soins de sante, et mettre en place des interventions de soins culturellement securitaires et ethiquement adaptees, pour ameliorer la sante de lensemble de la population autochtone du Canada.

T2  - REVISTA EUREKA SOBRE ENSENANZA Y DIVULGACION DE LAS CIENCIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article analyses Galileo's most important astronomical observations, placing the emphasis on the phases of Venus, among the most conclusive evidence against the Ptolemaic model, with the purpose of bringing into the classroom the controversy about the cosmological models (geocentrism-heliocentrism), contextualized in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. This study recommends an active methodology that involves students in the creation of mockups to analyse and visualize the phases of Venus in order to contrast this evidence with the three competitor models of the time: Ptolemaic, Copernican and Tychonic. The analysis also includes the Newtonian worldview, Physics and the present cosmology. Also, this article aims to reflect on the difficulty of teaching the history of Science at this stage.

TI  - MORAL VALUES OF THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE AS A SUBJECT OF REFLECTION BY MUSLIMS OF FOREIGN COUNTRIES IN THE PROCESS OF STUDYING THE UNIVERSAL TEXTBOOK RFL
T2  - YAZYK I KULTURA-LANGUAGE AND CULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The problem of harmonizing relations between Russian and Muslim peoples from distant foreign countries is one of the most pressing international problems. It is also necessary to solve it in the practice of teaching the Russian language, starting from the first months of teaching Islamic students. In the first year of studying the Russian language, the Russian universal textbook of Russian as a foreign language is the main means of teaching Muslim students in Russia and abroad. Studying it, foreigners get acquainted with the lifestyle and moral values of the Russian people. However, surveys of Islamic students and teachers' observations show that quite often the Russian way of life and values are not adequately understood by foreigners or taken critically. Russian language teachers and the public in traditional Muslim countries offer various ways to solve this problem: educating students to have a tolerant attitude to Russian culture, selectively applying materials from universal textbooks of the universal Russian-language textbooks, creating and using national-oriented and religious Islamic materials in Russian. In the conditions of Muslim education in secular Russian universities, a Russian teacher must create favorable conditions for the moral values of the Russian people to be correctly understood by foreigners and positively perceived by them. To do this, he must know the peculiarities of the national and religious worldview of his students and take them into account when presenting the materials of the universal textbook of the RFL. On the example of a modern educational complex S.I. Chernyshov and A.V. Chernyshova "Let's go!" the article demonstrates topics, situations, illustrations that can cause mixed reactions from Muslims and make it difficult for them to understand the values of the Russian people. The author emphasizes that the main task of the Russian textbook RFL and Russian teacher is to demonstrate the best aspects of the culture of the Russian people, to contribute to the moral improvement of the student's personality and the harmonization of relations between peoples. As the studies of sociologists of the last decade show, the traditional moral values of the Russian people, based on universal values, are significant at pre- sent for most modem Russians. Therefore, they should not be discredited in modem textbooks of the RFL, but should be comprehended by students in order to enrich them spiritually and harmonize relations between the Russian and Muslim peoples.

TI  - Improving the Treatment of Subgrid Cloud Variability in Warm Rain Simulation in CESM2
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Representing subgrid variability of cloud properties has always been a challenge in global climate models (GCMs). In many cloud microphysics schemes, the warm rain non-linear process rates calculated based on grid-mean cloud properties are usually scaled by an enhancement factor (EF) to account for the effects of subgrid cloud variability. In our study, we find that the EF derived from Cloud Layers Unified by Binormals in Community Atmosphere Model version 6 (CAM6) is severely overestimated in most of the cloudy oceanic areas, which leads to strong overestimation of the autoconversion rate. We improve the EF in warm rain simulation by developing a new formula for in-cloud subgrid cloud water variance. With the updated subgrid cloud water variance and EF treatment, the liquid cloud fraction (LCF) and cloud optical thickness (COT) increases noticeably for marine stratocumulus, and the shortwave cloud forcing (SWCF) matches better with observations. The updated formula improves the relationship between autoconversion rate and cloud droplet number concentration, and it decreases the sensitivity of autoconversion rate to aerosols. The sensitivity of liquid water path to aerosols decreases noticeably and is in better agreement with that in MODIS. Although the sensitivity of COT is similar to that in MODIS, CAM6 underestimates the sensitivity of grid-mean SWCF to aerosols because of the underestimation in the sensitivities of LCF and in-cloud SWCF. Our results indicate the importance of representing reasonable subgrid cloud variability in the simulation of cloud properties and aerosol-cloud interaction in GCMs.

TI  - Validation of the Diet Quality Questionnaire in Chinese Children and Adolescents and Relationship with Pediatric Overweight and Obesity
T2  - NUTRIENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The low-burden Diet Quality Questionnaire (DQQ) has been developed to rapidly assess diet quality globally. Poor diet is often correlated with body size, and certain dietary risk factors can result in overweight and obesity. We aimed to examine the extent to which the DQQ captured food group consumption among children and adolescents in China, and to understand the association of several new indicators of diet quality scores derived from the DQQ with overweight and obesity, using the 2011 wave of the China Health and Nutrition Survey. The DQQ questions are constructed using sentinel foods-that is, food items that are intended to capture a large proportion of the population consuming the food groups. The overall Global Dietary Recommendations (GDR) score, GDR-Healthy score, and GDR-Limit score are novel indicators of diet quality that reflect dietary risk factors for non-communicable diseases derived from the DQQ questions. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to examine the associations of the GDR scores with overweight and obesity in the sample. The DQQ questions captured over 95% of children who consumed the food groups. Additionally, we found that the GDR-Limit score was positively associated with general obesity (odds ratio (OR) = 1.43, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.17-1.74) and abdominal obesity (OR = 1.22, 95% CI: 1.05-1.43), whereas the overall GDR score was negatively related to general obesity (OR = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.74-0.97). The low-burden DQQ could be a valid tool to assess diet quality for the Chinese pediatric population aged 7-18 years. Poor diet quality, as determined by the GDR-Limit score, is associated with the increased risk of obesity in Chinese children and adolescents.

TI  - Quantifying Understory Vegetation Cover of <i>Pinus massoniana</i> Forest in Hilly Region of South China by Combined Near-Ground Active and Passive Remote Sensing
T2  - DRONES
M3  - Article
AB  - Understory vegetation cover is an important indicator of forest health, and it can also be used as a proxy in the exploration of soil erosion dynamics. Therefore, quantifying the understory vegetation cover in hilly areas in southern China is crucial for facilitating the development of strategies to address local soil erosion. Nevertheless, a multi-source data synergy has not been fully revealed in the remote sensing data quantifying understory vegetation in this region; this issue can be attributed to an insufficient match between the point cloud 3D data obtained from active and passive remote sensing systems and the UAV orthophotos, culminating in an abundance of understory vegetation information not being represented in two dimensions. In this study, we proposed a method that combines the UAV orthophoto and airborne LiDAR data to detect the understory vegetation. Firstly, to enhance the characterization of understory vegetation, the point CNN model was used to decompose the three-dimensional structure of the pinus massoniana forest. Secondly, the point cloud was projected onto the UAV image using the point cloud back-projection algorithm. Finally, understory vegetation cover was estimated using a synthetic dataset. Canopy closure was divided into two categories: low and high canopy cover. Slopes were divided into three categories: gentle slopes, inclined slopes, and steep slopes. To clearly elucidate the influence of canopy closure and slope on the remote sensing estimation of understory vegetation coverage, the accuracy for each category was compared. The results show that the overall accuracy of the point CNN model to separate the three-dimensional structure of the pinus massoniana forest was 74%, which met the accuracy requirement of enhancing the understory vegetation. This method was able to obtain the understory vegetation cover more accurately at a low canopy closure level (R-low(2) = 0.778, RMSElow = 0.068) than at a high canopy closure level (R-High(2) = 0.682, RMSEHigh = 0.172). The method could also obtain high accuracy in version results with R-2 values of 0.875, 0.807, and 0.704, as well as RMSE of 0.065, 0.106, and 0.149 for gentle slopes, inclined slopes, and steep slopes, respectively. The methods proposed in this study could provide technical support for UAV remote sensing surveys of understory vegetation in the southern hilly areas of China.

TI  - Identification and Area Information Extraction of Oat Pasture Based on GEE-A Case Study in the Shandan Racecourse (China)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forage grass is very important for food security. The development of artificial grassland is the key to solving the shortage of forage grass. Understanding the spatial distribution of forage grass in alpine regions is of great importance for guiding animal husbandry and the rational selection of forage grass management measures. With its powerful computing power and complete image data storage, Google Earth Engine (GEE) has become a new method to address remote sensing data collection difficulties and low processing efficiency. High-resolution mapping of pasture distributions on the Tibetan Plateau (China) is still a difficult problem due to cloud disturbance and mixed planting of forage grass. Based on the GEE platform, Sentinel-2 data and three classifiers, this study successfully mapped the oat pasture area of the Shandan Racecourse (China) on the eastern Tibetan Plateau over 3 years from 2019 to 2021 at a resolution of 10 m based on cultivated land identification. In this study, the key phenology windows were determined by analysing the time series differences in vegetation indices between oat pasture and other forage grasses in the Shandan Racecourse, and monthly scale features were selected as features for oat pasture identification. The results show that the mean Overall Accuracy (OA) of Random Forest (RF) classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, and Classification and Regression Trees (CART) classifier are 0.80, 0.69, and 0.72 in cultivated land identification, respectively, with corresponding the Kappa coefficients of 0.74, 0.58, and 0.62. The RF classifier far outperforms the other two classifiers. In oat pasture identification, the RF, SVM and CART classifiers have high OAs of 0.98, 0.97, and 0.97 and high Kappa values of 0.95, 0.94, and 0.95, respectively. Overall, the RF classifier is more suitable for our research. The oat pasture areas in 2019, 2020 and 2021 were 347.77 km(2) (15.87%), 306.19 km(2) (13.97%) and 318.94 km(2) (14.55%), respectively, with little change (1.9%) from year to year. The purpose of this study was to explore the identification model of forage grass area in alpine regions with a high spatial resolution, and to provide technical and methodological support for information extraction of the forage grass distribution status on the Tibetan Plateau.

TI  - High-Coverage Reconstruction of XCO<sub>2</sub> Using Multisource Satellite Remote Sensing Data in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The extreme climate caused by global warming has had a great impact on the earth's ecology. As the main greenhouse gas, atmospheric CO2 concentration change and its spatial distribution are among the main uncertain factors in climate change assessment. Remote sensing satellites can obtain changes in CO2 concentration in the global atmosphere. However, some problems (e.g., low time resolution and incomplete coverage) caused by the satellite observation mode and clouds/aerosols still exist. By analyzing sources of atmospheric CO2 and various factors affecting the spatial distribution of CO2, this study used multisource satellite-based data and a random forest model to reconstruct the daily CO2 column concentration (XCO2) with full spatial coverage in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. Based on a matched data set from 1 January 2015, to 31 December 2019, the performance of the model is demonstrated by the determination coefficient (R-2) = 0.96, root mean square error (RMSE) = 1.09 ppm, and mean absolute error (MAE) = 0.56 ppm. Meanwhile, the tenfold cross-validation (10-CV) results based on samples show R-2 = 0.91, RMSE = 1.68 ppm, and MAE = 0.88 ppm, and the 10-CV results based on spatial location show R-2 = 0.91, RMSE = 1.68 ppm, and MAE = 0.88 ppm. Finally, the spatially seamless mapping of daily XCO2 concentrations from 2015 to 2019 in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region was conducted using the established model. The study of the spatial distribution of XCO2 concentration in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region shows its spatial differentiation and seasonal variation characteristics. Moreover, daily XCO2 map has the potential to monitor regional carbon emissions and evaluate emission reduction.

TI  - Study on the Impact of Spatial Resolution on Fractional Vegetation Cover Extraction with Single-Scene and Time-Series Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial resolution of remote sensing images directly affects the accuracy, efficiency, and computational cost of extracting the fractional vegetation cover (FVC). Taking the Liyang woodland region, Jiangsu Province, as the study area, FVCs with varying spatial resolutions were extracted separately from Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, MOD13Q1, and MOD13A1. The variations in FVCs extracted from remote sensing images with varying spatial resolutions were analyzed at one specific time and time series within a year. The results show that (i) the overall mean FVC values of the four spatial resolution images did not differ substantially; however, FVCs with varying spatial resolutions present with a regular pattern of overestimation or underestimation at different vegetation levels. (ii) Taking the 10 m spatial resolution FVC as the reference, the accuracy values of FVC extraction at 30 m, 250 m, and 500 m resolutions were 91.0%, 76.3%, and 76.7%, respectively. The differences in the spatial distribution of FVCs are the most obvious at water-land interfaces and at the edge of each woodland patch. (iii) The highest accuracy of time-series FVC extraction from lower-resolution images is in the range of 0.6--0.7 for FVC. The degree of variation in FVC of time series varying spatial resolutions depends on the season and vegetation cover conditions. In summary, there are considerable differences in the need to monitor high-resolution images depending on the FVC level of the land surface. This study provides a reference for selection and accuracy research of remote sensing images for FVC extraction.

TI  - Structural Characteristics of Endorheic Rivers in the Tarim Basin
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Endorheic rivers as landlocked systems with no hydrological connections to marine environments are suffering from water and ecosystem crisis worldwide, yet little is known about their structural characteristics with complex geomorphic and climatic dependence. Based on the river networks identified from 30 m resolution digital elevation models and surface water dynamic information derived from Landsat images, we investigate the hierarchical characteristics of 60 sub-basins in the Tarim Basin, the largest endorheic river basin in China. In the Tarim River basin, endorheic rivers exhibit a self-similarity only in the range of stream-orders 1-4, compared to the range of stream-orders 1-5 observed in exorheic rivers, owning to the limited stream power to maintain the similar aggregation of rivers in the arid regions. Moreover, the Tarim River networks demonstrate lower bifurcation ratio (2.48), length ratio (2.03), fractal dimension (1.38), and drainage density (0.24 km(-1)) in representative sub-basins, with a significant decay in median values compared with those derived from exohreic rivers at similar scales, suggesting sparser and imperfect developed branching river networks in endorheic basins. Further analysis on the Tarim reveals that endorheic river structure is more related to glacier extent (r = 0.67 similar to 0.84), potential evapotranspiration (r = 0.63 similar to 0.81), and groundwater type index (r = 0.64 similar to 0.73), which is essentially different from the structure of exorheic river represented by the Yellow River largely controlled by surface runoff, precipitation, and vegetation coverage. This study stresses the differences in intrinsic structural characteristics and extrinsic drivers of endorheic and exorheic rivers and highlights the necessity of differentiated strategies for endorheic river management in fragile ecosystems.

TI  - A Comparison of Three Different Group Intelligence Algorithms for Hyperspectral Imagery Classification
T2  - PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - The classification effect of hyperspectral remote sensing images is greatly affected by the problem of dimensionality. Feature extraction, as a common dimension reduction method, can make up for the deficiency of the classification of hyperspectral remote sensing images. However, different feature extraction methods and classification methods adapt to different conditions and lack comprehensive comparative analysis. Therefore, principal component analysis (PCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and locality preserving projections (LPP) were selected to reduce the dimensionality of hyperspectral remote sensing images, and subsequently, support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) were used to classify the output images, respectively. In the experiment, two hyperspectral remote sensing data groups were used to evaluate the nine combination methods. The experimental results show that the classification effect of the combination method when applying principal component analysis and support vector machine is better than the other eight combination methods.

TI  - The Spatiotemporal Change of Xiao Qaidam Lake from 1990 to 2020 and Its Potential Hazards
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the climatic context of warming and humidification in Northwest China, most lakes in Qinghai Province experienced a rising water level and expanding area, inundating grassland and infrastructure around lakes, and even extreme events such as lake outburst floods. Based on Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI and GF PMS images, lake water level data, SRTM digital elevation model (DEM), GlobeLand30 and meteorological data used in this study, we analyzed the area change of Xiao Qaidam Lake in Qaidam Basin with its causes, factors and potential hazards. The results show that the area of Xiao Qaidam Lake increased by 60.42 km(2) (85.43%) from 1990 to 2020, which can be roughly divided into three stages: fluctuation decline in 1990-2001 (-1.89 km(2)/a); relatively stable in 2002-2014; and rapid expansion in 2015-2020 (8.54 km(2)/a). In 2020, the water level and water volume of Xiao Qaidam Lake increased by 3.62 m and 0.39 km(3), respectively, compared with 2015, resulting in the inundation of an area of 54.55 km(2) of grassland around the lake and a direct threat to the Liuge and Dexiao Expressways. Both the increase in annual precipitation (12.63 mm/10a) and the decrease in potential evapotranspiration (-13.38 mm/10a) since 1990 are the main reasons for the rapid expansion of Xiao Qaidam Lake, and the increasing trend of climate warming and humidification will lead to the continuous expansion of Xiao Qaidam Lake in the next decades. According to the water volume growth rate from 2015 to 2020, it is predicted that by 2024 the area and water level of Xiao Qaidam Lake will reach 154 km(2) and 3180 m, respectively, and part of Liuge and Dexiao Expressways will be submerged. Therefore, it is urgent to strengthen the monitoring of Xiao Qaidam Lake and formulate corresponding disaster prevention and reduction measures.

TI  - An MT-InSAR Data Partition Strategy for Sentinel-1A/B TOPS Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-1A/B satellite launched by European Space Agency (ESA) in 2014 provides a huge amount of free Terrain Observation by Progressive Scans (TOPS) data with global coverage to the public. The TOPS data have a frame width of 250 km and have been widely used in surface deformation monitoring. However, traditional Multi-Temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (MT-InSAR) methods require large computer memory and time when processing full resolution data with large width and long strips. In addition, they hardly correct atmospheric delays and orbital errors accurately over a large area. In order to solve these problems, this study proposes a data partition strategy based on MT-InSAR methods. We first process the partitioned images over a large area by traditional MT-InSAR method, then stitch the deformation results into a complete deformation result by correcting the offsets of adjacent partitioned images. This strategy is validated in a flat urban area (Changzhou City in Jiangsu province, China), and a mountainous region (Qijiang in Chongqing City, China). Compared with traditional MT-InSAR methods, the precision of the results obtained by the new strategy is improved by about 5% for Changzhou city and about 15% for Qijiang because of its advantage in atmospheric delay correction. Furthermore, the proposed strategy needs much less memory and time than traditional methods. The total time needed by the traditional method is about 20 h, and by the proposed method, is about 8.7 h, when the number of parallel processing is 5 in the Changzhou city case. The time will be further reduced when the number of parallel processes increases.

TI  - Prediction of Urban Thermal Environment Based on Multi-Dimensional Nature and Urban Form Factors
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban thermal environment is affected by multiple urban form and natural environment factors; research on the accurate prediction of the urban thermal environment, considering the interaction among different urban environmental factors, is still lacking. The development of a machine learning model provides a good means of solving complex problems. This study aims to clarify the relationship between urban environmental variables and the urban thermal environment through high-precision machine learning models as well as provide scenarios of future urban thermal environment developments. We defined an urban thermal environment index (UTEI), considering twelve urban form and natural indicators sourced from the remote sensing data of 150 cities in the Jing-Jin-Ji region from 2000 to 2015. We achieved accurate predictions of UTEI through training a gradient-boosted regression trees model. By unpacking the model, we found that the contribution rate of elevation (ELEV) was the highest. Among all the urban form indicators, the elongation index (ELONG), urban population (POP), nighttime light intensity (NLI), urban area size (AREA), and urban shape index (SHAPE) also had high contributions. We set up five scenarios to simulate the possible impact of different urban form factors on the overall urban thermal environment quality in the region. Under extremely deteriorated patterns that do not control urban expansion and vegetation reduction, the average UTEI could be as high as 0.55-0.76 degrees C in summer and 0.24-0.29 degrees C in winter, yet in the extremely optimized situation, UTEI decreased by 0.69 degrees C in summer and 0.56 degrees C in winter. Results showed that better urban form improves the quality of urban environments and can provide important insights for urban planners to mitigate urban heat island problems.

TI  - Satellite-Derived Bottom Depth for Optically Shallow Waters Based on Hydrolight Simulations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The bottom depth of coastal benthic habitats plays a vital role in the coastal ecological environment and navigation. In optically shallow waters (OSWs), seafloor reflectance has an impact on the remotely sensed data, and thus, water depth can be retrieved from the remote sensing reflectance (R-rs(lambda)) values provided by satellite imagery. Empirical methods for depth estimation are mainly limited by field measurements coverage. In addition, owing to the diverse range of water bio-optical properties in coastal regions, the high-precision models that could be applied to all OSWs are insufficient. In this study, we developed a novel bottom-depth retrieval method based on Hydrolight simulated datasets, in which R-rs(lambda) were generated from radiative transfer theory instead of actual satellite data. Additionally, this method takes into consideration the variable conditions of water depth, chlorophyll concentrations, and bottom reflectance. The bottom depth can be derived from R-rs(lambda) using a data-driven machine learning method based on the random forest (RF) model. The determination coefficient (R-2) was greater than 0.98, and the root mean squared error (RMSE) was less than 0.4 m for the training and validation datasets. This model shows promise for use in different coastal regions while also broadening the applications that utilize satellite data. Specifically, we derived the bottom depth in three areas in the South China Sea, i.e., the coastal regions of Wenchang city, Xincun Bay, and Huaguang Reef, based on Sentinel-2 imagery. The derived depths were validated by the bathymetric data acquired by spaceborne photon-counting lidar ICESat-2, which was able to penetrate clean shallow waters for sufficient bottom detection. The predicted bottom depth showed good agreement with the true depth, and large-scale mapping compensated for the limitations resulting from along-track ICESat-2 data. Under a variety of circumstances, this general-purpose depth retrieval model can be effectively applied to high spatial resolution imagery (such as that from Sentinel-2) for bottom depth mapping in optically shallow waters.

TI  - Multisource Remote Sensing Monitoring and Analysis of the Driving Forces of Vegetation Restoration in the Mu Us Sandy Land
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The Mu Us Sandy Land is a key region of man-made desert control and farmland to forest (grass) return in China. Despite global change and the strong influence of human activities, the vegetation in this region has been significantly improved and restored. In this study, multisource remote sensing data and multiple indicators were used to quantitatively monitor and evaluate the vegetation restoration status in this area. The driving factors were also analysed. The results show that in the past 20 years, nearly the entire Mu Us Sandy Land significantly and substantively recovered. The regional fractional vegetation cover increased, with an average annual growth rate of 0.59% and obvious spatial heterogeneity. The nine most important driving factors could comprehensively account for 58.38% of the spatial distribution of the vegetation coverage. Factors such as land use and land cover, the aridity index, and gross domestic product had the most significant impact, followed by precipitation and temperature. The results confirmed that the vegetation was restored and improved in the Mu Us Sandy Land and determined the main driving factors, which is helpful for vegetation restoration and ecological improvement on sandy land similar to the Mu Us Sandy Land.

TI  - Evaluation and Comparison of Different Machine Learning Models for NSAT Retrieval from Various Multispectral Satellite Images
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - As a key parameter of land surface energy balance models, near surface air temperature (NSAT) is an important indicator of the surface atmospheric environment and the urban thermal environment. At present, NSAT data are mainly captured by meteorological ground stations. In areas with a sparse distribution of meteorological stations, however, it is not possible to describe the heterogeneity of NSAT in continuous space. With the rapid development of satellite remote sensing technologies, there is now a significant method to retrieve NSAT from multispectral satellite images based on machine learning methods. In the literatures published so far, there is little reported research concerning the comprehensive evaluation and/or the systematic comparison of NSAT retrieval performances based on different machine learning models. Hence, the three most commonly-used machine learning models, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MLBPN), and Random Forest (RF), have been employed for the NSAT retrieval from various multispectral satellite images of MODIS daytime and nighttime data, Landsat 8 data, and Sentinel-2 data. Comparison of the NSAT retrieval results generated by the different machine learning models from the different types of satellite images reveals that (a) the RF-based model has a better NSAT retrieval performance than the SVR- or MLBPN-based models with respect to both the accuracy and stability, and (b) the NSAT results retrieved from the MODIS data were generally better than those from the Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 data. To sum up, the conducted research in this article does not only provide a reference for practical applications relevant to NSAT retrievals, but also proposes an efficient RF-based model for NSAT retrieval from multispectral satellite images in continuous space.

TI  - Annual Change Analysis of Mangrove Forests in China during 1986-2021 Based on Google Earth Engine
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves are a key type of protected coastal wetland, with a range of benefits such as protection from wave damage, sand fixation, water purification and ecological tourism. As the academic knowledge of mangroves has gradually increased, the use of remote sensing to monitor their dynamic changes in China has become a hot topic of discussion and has received attention in academic circles. Remote sensing has also provided necessary auxiliary decision-making suggestions and data support for the scientific and rational conservation, restoration and management of mangrove resources. In this paper, we used Landsat satellite series data combined with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and adaptive threshold partitioning (OTSU method) to monitor mangrove dynamics in coastal China from 1986 to 2021 based on Google Earth Engine (GEE), with three main results. (1) Based on the massive data and efficient computational capability of the GEE platform, we achieved large-scale interannual mangrove distribution extraction. The overall classification accuracy for 2019 exceeded 0.93, and the mangrove distribution extraction effect was good. (2) The total mangrove area and the mean patch size in China showed overall increasing trends, and Guangdong and Guangxi were the top two provinces in China in terms of the largest mangrove area. (3) Except for Dongzhaigang National Nature Reserve, the mangrove areas in other national mangrove reserves mainly showed increasing trends, confirming the effectiveness of the reserves. Data on the spatial structure and area trends of mangroves in China can provide scientific references for mangrove conservation and development, and serve in the further restoration of mangrove ecosystems.

TI  - The Change Pattern and Its Dominant Driving Factors of Wetlands in the Yellow River Delta Based on Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - There were significant differences in the dominant driving factors of the change process of different types of wetlands in the Yellow River delta. In addition, to our knowledge, the optimal classification feature sets with the Random Forest algorithm for wetlands in the Yellow River delta were least explored. In this paper, the wetland information in the study area was extracted based on a Random Forest algorithm with de-feature variable redundancy, and then the change process of wetland and its dominant factors from 2015 to 2021 was monitored and analyzed using the Geodetector and gravity center model. The results showed that (1) the optimal variable sets composed of red edge indexes based on the Random Forest algorithm had the highest classification accuracy, with the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of 95.75% and 0.93. (2) During 2015-2021, a large area of natural wetland in the Yellow River delta was transformed into an artificial wetland. The wetlands showed an overall development direction of "northwest-southeast" along the Yellow River. (3) The interaction between vegetation coverage and accumulated temperature had the largest explanatory power of the change in the natural wetland area. The interaction between solar radiation and DEM had the largest explanatory power for the change in the artificial wetland area. The research results could better provide decisions for wetland protection and restoration in the Yellow River delta.

TI  - Reclamation-oriented spatiotemporal evolution of coastal wetland along Bohai Rim, China
T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands are located in the ecotone of interaction between the land surface and sea, and anthropogenic activities extensively interfere with these wetlands through the reclamation of large tidal wetlands and destruction of the function of the ecosystems. In this study, we investigated the dynamic evolutionary characteristics of the Bohai Rim coastal area over the past 40 years using the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index, the fractal dimension, object-oriented classification, the land-use transfer trajectory, and regression analysis. Additionally, we quantified and monitored the evolution of reclamation and analyzed the correlation between reclamation and coastal wetlands based on 99 Landsat-2, -5, and -8 images (at 60 m and 30 m spatial resolution) over the period 1980-2019. The results are as follows. (1) The coastline of the Bohai Rim increased by 1 631.2 km from 1980 to 2019 with a zigzag variation. The artificial coastline increased by 2 946.1 km, whereas the natural coastline decreased by 90%. (2) The area of man-made wetlands increased by 3 736.9 km(2), the area of construction land increased by 1 008.4 km(2), and the natural wetland area decreased by 66%. The decrease of tidal flats is the main contributor to the decrease of natural wetland area (takes account for 91.1%). Coastal areas are affected by intense human disturbance, which was taken place across a large area of tidal flats and caused the landscape to fragment and be more heterogeneous. The coastal zone development activities were primarily concentrated in the southern Laizhou Bay, the Yellow River Delta, the Bohai Bay, the northern Liaodong Bay, and the Pulandian Bay. The solidified shorelines and increase in sea level have resulted in intertidal wetlands decreasing and impaired wetland ecology. (3) There is a good agreement between reclamation and the size of the coastal wetlands. Both land reclamation and the reduction in coastal wetland areas are significantly related to the population size, fishery output value, and urbanization rate. In summary, human activities, such as the construction of aquaculture ponds and salt pans, industrialization, and urbanization, are the primary forces that influence the environmental changes in the coastal region. This study is beneficial for establishing and improving the systems for the rational development and utilization of natural resources, and provides theoretical references for restoring wetland ecology and managing future reclamation activities in other coastal zone-related areas.

TI  - Resolve the Clear-Sky Continuous Diurnal Cycle of High-Resolution ECOSTRESS Evapotranspiration and Land Surface Temperature
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Although numerous evapotranspiration (ET) estimates have been developed from remote sensing measurements, a diurnally resolved product with high spatial resolution (<100 m) is still lacking, which is critically needed for agricultural and ecological monitoring. The ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) provides, for the first time, ET at 70 m resolution with diurnal samplings, enabling a step toward filling this data gap. This study developed the first framework to resolve the full diurnal cycle of ET and Land Surface Temperature (LST) from sporadic ECOSTRESS measurements. We first constructed 70 m diurnal LST utilizing a diurnal temperature cycle (DTC) model that fused ECOSTRESS and Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) LST. Next, we derived 70 m diurnal ET from the diurnally resolved LST, along with ancillary meteorological and reflectance data sets, using the Priestley-Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory (PT-JPL) algorithm. This framework was tested in two regions: A relatively homogeneous semiarid grassland landscape (centered at the US-Seg Ameriflux site) and a heterogeneous humid cropland landscape (centered at US-ARM). Our diurnally resolved LST and ET successfully reproduced the spatial patterns in the native ECOSTRESS measurements during overpasses for both landscapes (LST: r > 0.97, RMSE similar to 2 degrees C; ET: r > 0.99, and RMSE = 1-7 W m(-2)). The constructed time series also well captured the temporal variability of the in situ measurements (especially under clear-sky conditions) at both US-Seg and US-ARM, albeit performance varying with availability and quality of ECOSTRESS samples. This study sets the stage for testing and applying our framework to broader climates, biomes, and landscapes toward eventually generating diurnally resolved 70 m global operational LST/ET products to enhance ecological/agricultural applications.

AB  - Gaofen-3 is the first Chinese spaceborne C-band SAR satellite with multiple polarizations. The Gaofen-3 satellite's data has few applications for monitoring landslides at present, and its potential for use requires further investigation. Consequently, we must evaluate and analyze the landslide interference quality and displacement monitoring derived from the Gaofen-3 SAR satellite's data, particularly in high and steep, mountainous regions. Based on the nine Gaofen-3 SAR datasets gathered in 2020-2021, this study used DInSAR technology to track landslide displacement in Mao County, Sichuan Province, utilizing data from Gaofen-3. Our findings were compared to SENTINEL-1 and ALOS-2 data for the same region. This study revealed that due to its large spatial baseline, Gaofen-3's SAR data have a smaller interference effect and weaker coherence than the SENTINEL-1 and ALOS-2 SAR data. In addition, the displacement sensitivity of the Gaofen-3 and SENTINEL-1 data (C-band) is higher than that of the ALOS-2 data (L-band). Further, we conducted a study of observation applicability based on the geometric distortion distribution of the three forms of SAR data. Gaofen-3's SAR data are very simple to make layover and have fewer shadow areas in hilly regions, and it theoretically has more suitable observation areas (71.3%). For its practical application in mountainous areas, we introduced the passive geometric distortion analysis method. Due to its short incidence angle (i.e., 25.8 degrees), which is less than the other two satellites' SAR data, only 39.6% of the Gaofen-3 SAR data in the study area is acceptable for suitable observation areas. This study evaluated and analyzed the ability of using Gaofen-3's data to monitor landslides in mountainous regions based on the interference effect and observation applicability analysis, thereby providing a significant reference for the future use and design of Gaofen-3's data for landslide monitoring.

TI  - Improvement of S-adenosyl-L-methionine production in S<i>accharomyces cerevisiae</i> by atmospheric and room temperature plasma-ultraviolet compound mutagenesis and droplet microfluidic adaptive evolution
T2  - 3 BIOTECH
M3  - Article
AB  - To improve S-Adenosyl-L-methionine (a compound with important physiological functions, SAM) production, atmospheric and room temperature plasma and ultraviolet-LiCl mutagenesis were carried out with Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain ZY 1-5. The mutants were screened with ethionine, L-methionine, nystatin and cordycepin as screening agents. Adaptive evolution of a positive mutant UV6-69 was further performed by droplet microfluidics cultivation with ethionine as screening pressure. After adaptation, mutant T11-1 was obtained. Its SAM titer in shake flask fermentation reached 1.31 g/L, which was 191% higher than that of strain ZY 1-5. Under optimal conditions, the SAM titer and biomass of mutant T11-1 in 5 L bioreactor reached 10.72 g/L and 105.9 g dcw/L (142.86% and 34.22% higher than those of strain ZY 1-5), respectively. Comparative transcriptome analysis between strain ZY 1-5 and mutant T11-1 revealed the enhancements in TCA cycle and gluconeogenesis/glycolysis pathways as well as the inhibitions in serine and ergosterol synthesis of mutant T11-1. The elevated SAM synthesis of mutant T11-1 may attribute to the above changes. Taken together, this study is helpful for industrial production of SAM.

M3  - Article
AB  - Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a rare autosomal dominant condition caused by pathogenic variants in the TP53 tumor suppressor gene and characterized by a high lifetime risk of various cancers with a very early age of onset. We are presenting a 41-year-old woman with right invasive ductal cancer and no family history of cancers, diagnosed with mosaic LFS confirmed with blood and skin punch biopsy samples. She was treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, mastectomy and sentinel node biopsy with completion axillary dissection. Adjuvant radiation was not recommended due to increased risk of secondary cancers. She also elected to undergo risk reducing contralateral mastectomy. Further research is warranted to determine the appropriate clinical management and surveillance strategies in patients with mosaic LFS as whether individuals with mosaic LFS have differing cancer risks in comparison to classic germline LFS is unknown.

TI  - Quantifying the Natural Climate Solution Potential of Agricultural Systems by Combining Eddy Covariance and Remote Sensing
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Livestock agriculture accounts for similar to 15% of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Recently, natural climate solutions (NCS) have been identified to mitigate farm-scale GHG emissions. Nevertheless, their impacts are difficult to quantify due to farm spatial heterogeneity and effort required to measure changes in carbon stocks. Remote sensing (RS) models are difficult to parameterize for heterogeneous agricultural landscapes. Eddy covariance (EC) in combination with novel techniques that quantitatively match source area variations could help update such vegetation-specific parameters while accounting for pronounced heterogeneity. We evaluate a plant physiological parameter, the maximum quantum yield (MQY), which is commonly used to calculate gross and net primary productivity in RS applications. RS models often rely on spatially invariable MQY, which leads to inconsistencies between RS and EC models. We evaluate if EC data improve RS models by updating crop specific MQYs to quantify agricultural GHG mitigation potentials. We assessed how farm harvest compared to annual sums of (a) RS without improvements, (b) EC results, and (c) EC-RS models. We then estimated emissions to calculate the annual GHG balance, including mitigation through plant carbon uptake. Our results indicate that EC-RS models significantly improved the prediction of crop yields. The EC model captures diurnal variations in carbon dynamics in contrast to RS models based on input limitations. A net zero GHG balance indicated that perennial vegetation mitigated over 60% of emissions while comprising 40% of the landscape. We conclude that the combination of RS and EC can improve the quantification of NCS in agroecosystems.

TI  - Multiresolution Data Assimilation for Auroral Energy Flux and Mean Energy Using DMSP SSUSI, THEMIS ASI, and An Empirical Model
T2  - SPACE WEATHER-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - We apply a multiresolution Gaussian process model (Lattice Kriging) to combine satellite observations, ground-based observations, and an empirical auroral model, to produce the assimilation of auroral energy flux and mean energy over high-latitude regions. Compared to a simple padding, the assimilation coherently combines various data inputs leading to continuous transitions between different datasets. The multiresolution modeling capability is achieved by allocating multiple layers of basis functions with different resolutions. Higher-resolution fitting results capture more mesoscale (10-100 s km) structures such as auroral arcs, than the low-resolution ones and the empirical model. To better reconcile different datasets, two preprocessing steps, temporal interpolation of satellite data and spatial down-sampling of low-fidelity data, are implemented. The inherent smoothing effect of the fitting, which causes an unrealistic spreading of the aurora, is mitigated by a post processing step: the K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm. KNN identifies the probability of a region with significant aurora and thereby eliminates those regions with low values. Thereby, this methodology can be used to maintain realistic and mesoscale auroral structures without boundary issues. We then run the Thermosphere Ionosphere Electrodynamics General Circulation Model (TIEGCM) driven by the high- and low-resolution auroral assimilations and compare total electron contents (TECs). TIEGCM driven by data assimilation produces enhanced TECs by a factor of similar to 2 than the one driven by the empirical aurora, and high-resolution results show mesoscale structures. Our study shows the value of incorporating realistic auroral inputs via assimilation to drive ionosphere-thermosphere models for better understanding the consequences of mesoscale phenomena.

TI  - Assessment of the Combined Risk of Drought and High-Temperature Heat Wave Events in the North China Plain during Summer
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought-induced risk has attracted the attention of many scholars, but the risk of combined events caused by drought and high-temperature heat waves still needs further study. Based on MODIS products and meteorological data, the spatiotemporal variation characteristics of summer drought and high-temperature heat waves in the North China Plain from 2000 to 2018 were analyzed by the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), crop water stress index (CWSI) and high-temperature threshold, and their combined-events risk was evaluated. The results showed that (1) from 2000 to 2018, summer drought in the North China Plain became more severe. Especially in Henan, Anhui and Jiangsu Provinces, drought increased significantly. (2) From 2000 to 2018, the frequency and intensity of high-temperature heat wave events in the North China Plain gradually increased at rates of 0.28 times/10 year and 1.6 degrees C/10 year, respectively. (3) The slightly high risk and high risk caused by summer drought were mainly distributed in Hebei Province and Tianjin Municipality in the north, and the risk change was characterized by a decrease in the north and an increase in the south. (4) The combined-events risk of summer drought and high-temperature heat waves did not increase significantly, with an increase rate of approximately 0.01/10 year. Among them, the increase rate of combined-events risk in Henan Province was the largest (0.14/10 year), followed by the obvious increase in northern Anhui, Jiangsu and southern Shandong, while the risk in Beijing showed a decreasing trend. The research results have scientific guiding significance for formulating disaster prevention and reduction strategies.

TI  - Spatial Trend and Impact of Snowmelt Rate in Spring across China's Three Main Stable Snow Cover Regions over the Past 40 Years Based on Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Historical patterns of snow cover and snowmelt are shifting due to climate warming and perhaps some human activities, threatening natural water resources and the ecological environment. Passive microwave remote sensing provides quantitative data for snow mass evaluation. Here, we evaluated the long-term impact of climate warming on snowmelt rates, using snow water equivalent (SWE) datasets derived from passive microwave remotely sensed data over China's three main stable snow cover regions during the past 40 years (1981-2020). The results showed that higher ablation rates in spring were found in locations with a deeper SWE because of high snowmelt rates that occurred in late spring and early summer in areas with a deeper snowpack. Annual maximum SWE (snow water equivalent) has declined across two out of the three main mountains of China's snow cover regions over the past 40 years under climate warming. The maximum and mean snowmelt rate was ca. 30 and 3 mm/day, respectively, over the three regions. Further, due to SWE being reduced in these deep snowpack areas, moderate and high rates of snowmelt showed trends of decline after 2000. Accordingly, an earlier snow onset day (average 0.6 similar to 0.7 day/a) and slower snowmelt rates characterized the mountainous areas across the three main snow cover regions. The slower snowmelt rate is also closely related to vegetation improvement over the three main stable snow cover regions. Therefore, not only vegetation in spring but also streamflow and other ecological processes could be affected by the pronounced changes in SWE and snowmelt rates. These findings strengthen our understanding of how to better assess ecological and environmental changes towards the sustainable use of freshwater resources in spring and earlier summer months in snow-rich alpine regions.

TI  - Cyanobacterial Bloom Phenology in Green Bay Using MERIS Satellite Data and Comparisons with Western Lake Erie and Saginaw Bay
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Cyanobacteria blooms have been reported to be increasing worldwide. In addition to potentially causing major economic and ecological damage, these blooms can threaten human health. Furthermore, these blooms can be exacerbated by a warming climate. One approach to monitoring and modeling cyanobacterial biomass is to use processed satellite imagery to obtain long-term data sets. In this paper, an existing algorithm for estimating cyanobacterial biomass previously developed for MERIS is validated for Green Bay using cyanobacteria biovolume estimates obtained from field samples. Once the algorithm was validated, the existing MERIS imagery was used to determine the bloom phenology of the cyanobacterial biomass in Green Bay. Modeled datasets of heat flux (as a proxy for stratification), wind speed, water temperature, and gelbstoff absorption along with in situ river discharge data were used to separate bloom seasons in Green Bay from bloom seasons in nearby cyanobacteria bloom hotspots including western Lake Erie and Saginaw Bay. Of the ten-year MERIS dataset used here, the highest five years were considered "high bloom" years, and the lowest five years from biomass were considered "low bloom" years and these definitions were used to separate Green Bay. Green Bay had a strong relationship with gelbstoff absorption making it unique among the water bodies, while western Lake Erie responded strongly with river discharge as previously reported. Saginaw Bay, which has low interannual bloom variability, did not exhibit a largely influential single parameter.

TI  - On-Orbit Autonomous Geometric Calibration of Directional Polarimetric Camera
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Directional Polarimetric Camera (DPC) carried by the Chinese GaoFen-5-02 (GF-5-02) satellite has the ability for multiangle, multispectral, and polarization detection and will play an important role in the inversion of atmospheric aerosol and cloud characteristics. To ensure the validity of the DPC on-orbit multiangle and multispectral polarization data, high-precision image registration and geolocation are vital. High-precision geometric model parameters are a prerequisite for on-orbit image registration and geolocation. Therefore, on the basis of the multiangle imaging characteristics of DPC, an on-orbit autonomous geometric calibration method without ground reference data is proposed. The method includes three steps: (1) preprocessing the original image of the DPC and the satellite attitude and orbit parameters; (2) scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) algorithm to match homologous points between multiangle images; (3) optimization of geometric model parameters on-orbit using least square theory. To verify the effectiveness of the on-orbit autonomous geometric calibration method, the image registration performance and relative geolocation accuracy before and after DPC on-orbit geometric calibration were evaluated and analyzed using the SIFT algorithm and the coastline crossing method (CCM). The results show that the on-orbit autonomous geometric calibration effectively improves the DPC image registration and relative geolocation accuracy. After on-orbit calibration, the multiangle image registration accuracy is better than 1.530 km, the multispectral image registration accuracy is better than 0.650 km, and the relative geolocation accuracy is better than 1.275 km, all reaching the subpixel level (<1.7 km).

TI  - Pixel mapping variable-resolution spectral imaging reconstruction
T2  - CHINESE OPTICS
M3  - Review
AB  - In this paper, the basic principle and reconstruction method of random filter spectral coding-decoding are discussed. According to the automatic feature extraction mechanism of a deep learning undercomplete autoencoder, a pixel mapping variable-resolution spectral imaging reconstruction network with high reconstruction accuracy and low delay is constructed. The parallel training of a 2x2 and 4x4 pixel array spectral reconstruction network is implemented by transforming the pixel mapping relationship. Finally, the network's performance is verified by the remote sensing data with 512x616 with 120 bands spectral images. For a 2x2 pixel array with 40 bands, the reconstruction PSNR is 53 dB, the reconstruction MSE is less than 0.002, and the reconstruction time is 0.85 s. For a 4x4 pixel array with 120 bands, the reconstruction PSNR is 64 dB, the reconstruction MSE is less than 10(-5), and the reconstruction time is 0.5 s. The experimental results show that the pixel mapping variable-resolution spectral imaging reconstruction network has the dynamic transformation performance of high accuracy and low delay.

TI  - Characteristics of an Explosive Cyclone over Northeast China Revealed by Satellite Water Vapor Imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, an explosive cyclone (EC) that occurred over Northeast China in the spring of 2016 is studied by using 6.7 mu m FY satellite water vapor (WV) imagery and NCEP (1 degrees x 1 degrees) reanalysis data. Moreover, the evolutions of the upper-level jet stream (ULJ), the vertical motions, and the potential vorticity (PV) are analyzed in detail. Results show that different shapes of the WV image dark zones could reflect different stages of the EC. At the pre-explosion stage, a small dark zone and an S-shaped baroclinic leaf cloud can be found on the WV imagery. Then the dark zone expands and the leaf cloud grows into a comma-shaped cloud at the explosively developing stage. At the post-explosion stage, the dark zone brightens, and the spiral cloud forms. The whole process can be well described by the WV imagery. The dynamic dry band associated with the sinking motion and the ULJ can develop into the dry intrusion later, which is an important signal in forecasting the EC and should be paid attention to when analyzing the WV imagery. Furthermore, the mechanism is also analyzed in detail in this article. EC usually occurs in the left-exit region of the 200-hPa jet and the region ahead of the 500-hPa trough where there is significant positive vorticity advection (PVA). When the EC moves onto the sea surface, the decreased friction would favour the development of the EC. The upper-level PVA, the strong convergence at low level, and the divergence at high levels can maintain the strong updraft. Meanwhile, the high PV zone from the upper levels extends downward, approaching the cyclone. Together, they keep the cyclone deepening continuously.

TI  - Mapping Crop Types Using Sentinel-2 Data Machine Learning and Monitoring Crop Phenology with Sentinel-1 Backscatter Time Series in Pays de Brest, Brittany, France
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop supply and management is a global issue, particularly in the context of global climate change and rising urbanization. Accurate mapping and monitoring of specific crop types are crucial for crop studies. In this study, we proposed: (1) a methodology to map two main winter crops (winter wheat and winter barley) in the northern region of Finistere with high-resolution Sentinel-2 data. Different classification approaches (the hierarchical classification and the classical direct extraction), and classification methods (pixel-based classification (PBC) and object-based classification (OBC)) were performed and evaluated. Subsequently, (2) a further study that involved monitoring the phenology of the winter crops was carried out, based on the previous results. The aim is to understand the temporal behavior from sowing to harvesting, identifying three important phenological statuses (germination, heading, and ripening, including harvesting). Due to the high frequency of precipitation in our study area, crop phenology monitoring was performed using Sentinel-1 C-band SAR backscatter time series data using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The results of the classification showed that the hierarchical classification achieved a better accuracy when it is compared to the direct extraction, with an overall accuracy of 0.932 and a kappa coefficient of 0.888. Moreover, in the hierarchical classification process, OBC reached a better accuracy in cropland mapping, and PBC was proven more suitable for winter crop extraction. Additionally, in the time series backscatter coefficient of winter wheat, the germination and ripening (harvesting) phases can be identified at VV and VH/VV polarizations, and heading can be identified in both VV and VH polarizations. Secondly, we were able to detect the germination phase of winter barley in VV and VH, ripening with both polarizations and VH/VV, and finally, heading in VV and VH polarizations.

TI  - Retrieval of Live Fuel Moisture Content Based on Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data and Ensemble Deep Learning Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Live fuel moisture content (LFMC) is an important index used to evaluate the wildfire risk and fire spread rate. In order to further improve the retrieval accuracy, two ensemble models combining deep learning models were proposed. One is a stacking ensemble model based on LSTM, TCN and LSTM-TCN models, and the other is an Adaboost ensemble model based on the LSTM-TCN model. Measured LFMC data, MODIS, Landsat-8, Sentinel-1 remote sensing data and auxiliary data such as canopy height and land cover of the forest-fire-prone areas in the Western United States, were selected for our study, and the retrieval results of different models with different groups of remote sensing data were compared. The results show that using multi-source data can integrate the advantages of different types of remote sensing data, resulting in higher accuracy of LFMC retrieval than that of single-source remote sensing data. The ensemble models can better extract the nonlinear relationship between LFMC and remote sensing data, and the stacking ensemble model with all the MODIS, Landsat-8 and Sentinel-1 remote sensing data achieved the best LFMC retrieval results, with R-2 = 0.85, RMSE =18.88 and ubRMSE = 17.99. The proposed stacking ensemble model is more suitable for LFMC retrieval than the existing method.

Hypofractionated radiotherapy (HF-RT) regimen of 40-42.5 Gy in 15-16 fractions has been established as a preferred option for whole breast irradiation. However, few evidences of hypofractionated regional nodal irradiation (RNI), especially involving internal mammary nodes (IMNs), could be available during the era of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Against this background, we design this trial to explore the hypothesis that HF-RT regimen involving RNI (including infraclavicular, supraclavicular nodes and IMNs) will be non-inferior to a standard schedule by using IMRT technique.Methods and analysis This is an open-label randomised, non-inferior, multicentre phase III trial. Patients with breast cancer with an indication for RNI after breast conserving surgery or mastectomy are randomised at a ratio of 1:1 into the following two groups: hypofractionated regimen of 2.67 Gy for 16 fractions or conventional regimen of 2 Gy for 25 fractions. The dose was prescribed to ipsilateral chest wall or whole breast and RNI (including infraclavicular, supraclavicular nodes and IMNs, lower axilla if indicated). The trial plans to enrol a total of 801 patients and all patients will be treated using IMRT technique. The primary endpoint is 5-year locoregional recurrence. The secondary endpoints include 5-year distant metastasis free survival, invasive recurrence-free survival, overall survival, accumulative acute radiation-induced toxicity and accumulative late radiation-induced toxicity, cosmetic outcomes and quality of life.Ethics and dissemination The study has been approved by the Ethical Committee of Ruijin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (version 2018-95-3) and approvals from ethical committee of each participating centre have also been obtained. Research findings will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals.

TI  - Water Level Change Monitoring Based on a New Denoising Algorithm Using Data from Landsat and ICESat-2: A Case Study of Miyun Reservoir in Beijing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Inland lakes or reservoirs are the main surface water resources, related to people's survival and social development. On-site water level data are critical for water resource management, while satellite laser and remote sensing data are a significant tool for long-term change monitoring. In this study, we took the Miyun Reservoir, the most important source of drinking water in Beijing, as the research area. We used Landsat images and the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat-2) for small-scale water level change monitoring and inversion across unrecorded periods. First, we proposed a new two-step denoising method based on local statistics to denoise the ATL03 single photon data from 2018 to 2020, and extracted the effective elevation information of Miyun Reservoir. Second, based on Landsat images from 1984 to 2020, the MNDWI index was used to extract the water area and generated a percentage map of water occurrence. Finally, the water and land boundary elevation were selected from the effective photon elevation information according to the boundary position under each percentage of the water generation percentage graph, the area, and the water level elevation model (A-E model) was established, and the water level values of unrecorded periods were inverted. The denoising results showed that the denoising accuracy of all data is higher than 95%. The area of Miyun Reservoir has changed greatly in the past 37 years, especially in the northeast corner and northern region. The inverted water level elevation had a strong correlation with the measured value, the correlation coefficient reached 0.97, the root mean square error (RMSE) was 0.553 m, and the estimated water level value was highly consistent with the recorded value and fluctuated dramatically from 1984 to 2020. This method complements the traditional water level mapping method, provides a new idea for the monitoring of water level changes in lakes or reservoirs without field records, and also contributes to the timely and effective monitoring and management of global lake and reservoir water level and time changes.

TI  - A Framework for Soil Salinity Monitoring in Coastal Wetland Reclamation Areas Based on Combined Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Data and Satellite Data
T2  - DRONES
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization is one of the most important causes of land degradation and desertification, often threatening land management and sustainable agricultural development. Due to the low resolution of satellites, fine mapping of soil salinity cannot be completed, while high-resolution images from UAVs can only achieve accurate mapping of soil salinity in a small area. Therefore, how to realize fine mapping of salinity on a large scale based on UAV and satellite data is an urgent problem to be solved. Therefore, in this paper, the most relevant spectral variables for soil salinity were firstly determined using Pearson correlation analysis, and then the optimal inversion model was established based on the screened variables. Secondly, the feasibility of correcting satellite data based on UAV data was determined using Pearson correlation analysis and spectral variation trends, and the correction of satellite data was completed using least squares-based polynomial curve fitting for both UAV data and satellite data. Finally, the reflectance received from the vegetated area did not directly reflect the surface reflectance condition, so we used the support vector machine classification method to divide the study area into two categories: bare land and vegetated area, and built a model based on the classification results to realize the advantages of complementing the accurate spectral information of UAV and large-scale satellite spectral data in the study areas. By comparing the modeling inversion results using only satellite data with the inversion results based on optimized satellite data, our method framework could effectively improve the accuracy of soil salinity inversion in large satellite areas by 6-19%. Our method can meet the needs of large-scale accurate mapping, and can provide the necessary means and reference for soil condition monitoring.

TI  - Spatial Analysis of a Rapid Intrusion Event of the East Australian Current Using High Frequency Radar Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The East Australian Current (EAC) is a highly dynamic western boundary current of the South Pacific Gyre. The EAC frequently encroaches shoreward, drives upwelling, changes coastal bio-physical dynamics, and thus exerts significant impacts on coastal marine ecosystems. In this study, with high frequency (HF) radar and mooring data, for the first time accurate daily mapping and tracking of a rapid EAC intrusion event was conducted and the impacts of the EAC intrusion on the shelf water off Coffs Harbor were monitored. The results show that, during the event, the EAC was highly dynamic with a mean daily onshore/offshore movement of -5 km/day. In addition, we found that the bottom ocean temperature and the surface current speed on the shelf varied linearly with the EAC-to-coast distance. This study thus demonstrates the value of HF remotely sensed data for the ongoing quantitative monitoring of the highly dynamic EAC fluctuations.

TI  - Impact of Saline-Alkali Land Greening on the Local Surface Temperature-A Multiscale Assessment Based on Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the conversion of saline-alkali land to rice fields has become the most dominant land use change feature in western Jilin, leading to significant surface greening. Saline-alkali land and paddy fields have distinct surface biophysical properties; however, there is a lack of systematic assessment of the moderating effect of planting rice on saline-alkali land on regional climate by changing surface properties. In this paper, multiscale data on the surface temperature of saline-alkali land and paddy fields were obtained using 1 km MODIS product, 30 m Landsat 8 satellite imagery and centimeter-scale UAV imagery in Da'an City, western Jilin as the study area, and the various characteristics of the surface temperature of saline-alkali land and paddy fields in different months of the year and at different times of the day were analyzed. Furthermore, the effect of rice cultivation in saline-alkali land on the local surface temperature was assessed using a space-for-time approach. The results based on satellite observations including both MODIS and Landsat showed that the surface temperature of saline-alkali land was significantly higher than that of paddy fields during the crop growing season, especially in July and August. The high temporal resolution MODIS LST data also indicated the paddy fields cool the daytime surface temperature, while warming the nighttime surface temperature, which was in contrast for saline-alkali land during the growing season. High-resolution UAV observations in July confirmed that the cooling effect of paddy fields was most significant at the middle of day. From the biophysical perspective, the reclamation of saline-alkali land into paddy fields leads to an increase in leaf area index, followed by a significant increase in evapotranspiration. Meanwhile, rice cultivation in saline-alkali land reduces surface albedo and increases surface net radiation. The trade-off relationship between the two determines the seasonal difference in the surface temperature response of saline-alkali land for rice cultivation. At the same time, the daily cycle of crop evapotranspiration and the thermal insulation effect of paddy fields at night are the main reasons for the intraday difference in surface temperature between saline-alkali land and paddy field. Based on the multiscale assessment of the impact of rice cultivation in saline-alkali land on surface temperature, this study provides a scientific basis for predicting future regional climate change and comprehensively understanding the ecological and environmental benefits of saline-alkali land development.

TI  - Spatial heterogeneity of first flowering date in Beijing's main urban area and its response to urban thermal environment
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Phenology - the rhythm of periodic plant life cycle events - was significantly shaped by urban climate, with flowering as one most sensitive phenophase. Apart from the widely noticed urban-rural phenological discrepancy caused by heat island effect, driven by the aggravating spatial unevenness of urban thermal environment, the spatial heterogeneity of flowering time was also found within the urbanized area of some metropolitans, bringing multiple impacts on urban ecology, landscape and public health. This research aimed to reveal the intraurban spatial variation and response characteristics of Beijing's trees flowering phenology that remained largely unclear before. We analyzed the spatial heterogeneity pattern of the first flowering date (FFD) for 42 deciduous woody species in Beijing's main urban area (MUA), and explored the species-specific phenological response to local thermal environment. The sample plots were set in 9 green spaces distributing from urban center to northwest suburb in Beijing's MUA, the FFD data was collected by ground-based phenological observation, and local thermal environment was measured with land surface temperature (LST) retrieved from MOD11A1 products. The main results are as follows: (1) A significant spatial variation for FFD existed among 9 sample plots and the maximum spatial difference of FFD reached 6.76 +/- 1.77 days in average, FFD showed an overall delay trend from urban center in 2nd Ring to outskirts beyond 5th Ring with 3rd Ring as a critical line for significant phenological difference. (2) The FFD of 35 species was found to be negatively correlated with (TL) over bar (average of daily mean LST above 0 degrees C before mean FFD) in the sample plot (p < 0.05) with a response sensitivity of 2.99 +/- 0.87 days/degrees C, which reflected the significant impact of LST variation during flower development period. Furthermore, the spatial difference and response sensitivity of FFD for a specific species were found to be negatively associated with its mean FFD value (p < 0.05), i.e., the flowering time of early-blooming species tended to be more sensitive to thermal environment variation compared with late-blooming ones. This research illustrated how flowering phenology responded to the heterogeneous intraurban thermal environment in Beijing's MUA, which can improve our understanding of the vegetation dynamics in a constantly changing urban environment. And as a critical indicator of trees' climate vulnerability assessment, the species-specific phenological response sensitivity could also guide species selection in urban forest construction.

TI  - Measuring Land Surface Deformation over Soft Clay Area Based on an FIPR SAR Interferometry Algorithm-A Case Study of Beijing Capital International Airport (China)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term settlement monitoring of infrastructure built in soft clay areas is of great importance. When using InSAR technology for soft clay settlement monitoring, deformation modeling is a key process. In most InSAR deformation modeling, each component of the total deformation is expressed directly with a fixed functional model in phase functions and assumed to occupy an equal weight. This causes equal weight assumption uncertainty and ignores the actual certain contribution of each phase component related to certain deformational factors. Moreover, the commonly used mathematical empirical models in traditional InSAR are not suitable for describing the nonlinear characteristics of the temporal settlement evolution for soft clay. To address these limitations, we propose an SAR interferometry algorithm, namely, FIPR (FastICA Poisson-curve reciprocal accumulation method), which separates the original InSAR signal based on FastICA to extract each deformation component, and then the models can each extract deformation components and estimate the unknown parameters based on a reciprocal accumulation method. Each independent component and the obtained deformation parameters are used to generate the final deformation time series. Both simulated and real data experiments were designed. The simulated experimental results indicated that the sICA (spatial independent component analysis) separated results were much closer to the original signals than those of the tICA (temporal independent component analysis), with their RMSE lower than 2 mm, and the sICA is thus more highly recommended. Beijing Capital International Airport in China was selected as the study area in the real data experiment. Using 24 high-resolution TerraSAR-X radar satellite images from January 2012 to February 2015, the time-series deformation was obtained, with the maximum cumulative subsidence of 126 mm. The modeling accuracy for the proposed model was estimated as +/- 2.6 mm, with an improvement of 36.6% compared to the EWA-LM (linear model with equal weight accumulation) algorithm and 16.1% compared to the EWA-PC (Poisson curve with equal weight accumulation) algorithm. The RMSE with external leveling measurements was estimated as +/- 1.0 mm, with 69.7% improvement compared to EWA-LM and 50% to EWA-PC. This indicated that FIPR can reduce the uncertainty of artificial assumptions in deformation modeling and improve the accuracy of deformation analysis for highways in soft clay areas, providing a reference for road maintenance and management.

TI  - The Eyes of the Gods: A Survey of Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Methods Based on Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - With the rapid development of the remote sensing monitoring and computer vision technology, the deep learning method has made a great progress to achieve applications such as earth observation, climate change and even space exploration. However, the model trained on existing data cannot be directly used to handle the new remote sensing data, and labeling the new data is also time-consuming and labor-intensive. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) is one of the solutions to the aforementioned problems of labeled data defined as the source domain and unlabeled data as the target domain, i.e., its essential purpose is to obtain a well-trained model and tackle the problem of data distribution discrepancy defined as the domain shift between the source and target domain. There are a lot of reviews that have elaborated on UDA methods based on natural data, but few of these studies take into consideration thorough remote sensing applications and contributions. Thus, in this paper, in order to explore the further progress and development of UDA methods in remote sensing, based on the analysis of the causes of domain shift, a comprehensive review is provided with a fine-grained taxonomy of UDA methods applied for remote sensing data, which includes Generative training, Adversarial training, Self-training and Hybrid training methods, to better assist scholars in understanding remote sensing data and further advance the development of methods. Moreover, remote sensing applications are introduced by a thorough dataset analysis. Meanwhile, we sort out definitions and methodology introductions of partial, open-set and multi-domain UDA, which are more pertinent to real-world remote sensing applications. We can draw the conclusion that UDA methods in the field of remote sensing data are carried out later than those applied in natural images, and due to the domain gap caused by appearance differences, most of methods focus on how to use generative training (GT) methods to improve the model's performance. Finally, we describe the potential deficiencies and further in-depth insights of UDA in the field of remote sensing.

TI  - Attribution analysis and multi-scenario prediction of NDVI drivers in the Xilin Gol grassland, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Grassland degradation is influenced by climate change and human activities, and has become a major obstacle for the development of arid and semi-arid areas, posing a series of environmental and socio-economic problems. An in-depth understanding of the inner relations among grassland vegetation dynamics, climate change, and human activities is therefore greatly significant for understanding the variation in regional environmental conditions and predicting future developmental trends. Based on MODIS (moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer) NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) data from 2000 to 2020, our objective is to investigate the spatiotemporal changes of NDVI in the Xilin Gol grassland, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China. Combined with 12 natural factors and human activity factors in the same period, the dominant driving factors and their interactions were identified by using the geographic detector model, and multiple scenarios were also simulated to forecast the possible paths of future NDVI changes in this area. The results showed that: (1) in the past 21 a, vegetation cover in the Xilin Gol grassland exhibited an overall increasing trend, and the vegetation restoration (84.53%) area surpassed vegetation degradation area (7.43%); (2) precipitation, wind velocity, and livestock number were the dominant factors affecting NDVI (the explanatory power of these factors exceeded 0.4). The interaction between average annual wind velocity and average annual precipitation, and between average annual precipitation and livestock number greatly affected NDVI changes (the explanatory power of these factors exceeded 0.7). Moreover, the impact of climate change on NDVI was more significant than human activities; and (3) scenario analysis indicated that NDVI in the Xinlin Gol grassland increased under the scenarios of reduced wind velocity, increased precipitation, and ecological protection. In contrast, vegetation coverage restoration in this area was significantly reduced under the scenarios of unfavorable climate conditions and excessive human activities. This study provides a scientific basis for future vegetation restoration and management, ecological environmental construction, and sustainable natural resource utilization in this area.

TI  - Evaluating Road Lighting Quality Using High-Resolution JL1-3B Nighttime Light Remote Sensing Data: A Case Study in Nanjing, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A good lighting environment for roads at night is essential for traffic safety. Accurate and timely knowledge of road lighting quality is meaningful for the planning and management of urban road lighting systems. Traditional field observations and mobile observations have limitations for road lightning quality evaluation at a large scale. This study explored the potential of 0.92 m resolution JL1-3B nighttime light remote sensing images to evaluate road lighting quality in Nanjing, China. Combined with synchronous field measurements and JL1-3B data, multiple regression and random forest regression with several independent variable combinations were developed and compared to determine the optimal model for surface illuminance estimation. Cross validation results showed that the random forest model with Hue, saturability, ln(Intensity), ln(Red), ln(Green) and ln(Blue) as the input independent variables had the best performance (R-2 = 0.75 and RMSE = 9.79 lux). Then, this model was used to map the surface illuminance. The spatial scopes of roads were extracted from Google Earth images, and the illuminance within roads was derived to calculate the average, standard deviation and coefficient of variation to indicate the overall brightness level and brightness uniformity of the roads. This study provides a quantitative and effective reference for road lighting evaluation.

TI  - Can Catch-Up Vaccinations Fill the Void Left by Suspension of the Governmental Recommendation of HPV Vaccine in Japan?
T2  - VACCINES
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2013, the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare (MHLW) in Japan announced a suspension of the governmental recommendation for routine HPV vaccinations. In 2020, MHLW started individual notifications of HPV vaccine to the targeted girls. In April 2022, the governmental recommendation was restarted, and catch-up vaccinations started. We evaluated the benefits and limitations of the MHLW's new vaccination strategies by estimating the lifetime risk for cervical cancer for each birth FY under different scenarios to suggest a measure for the vaccine suspension generation. It was revealed that catch-up immunization coverage among the unvaccinated must reach as high as 90% in FY2022, when the program begins, in order to reduce the risk of the females already over the targeted ages to the same level or lower than that of women born in FY1994-1999 who had high HPV vaccination rates. For women whose vaccination coverage waned because of their birth FYs, strong recommendations for cervical cancer screening should be implemented.

TI  - Reconstruction of Sentinel-2 Image Time Series Using Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-2 NDVI and surface reflectance time series have been widely used in various geoscience research, but the data is deteriorated or missing due to the cloud contamination, so it is necessary to reconstruct the Sentinel-2 NDVI and surface reflectance time series. At present, there are few studies on reconstructing the Sentinel-2 NDVI or surface reflectance time series, and these existing reconstruction methods have some shortcomings. We proposed a new method to reconstruct the Sentinel-2 NDVI and surface reflectance time series using the penalized least-square regression based on discrete cosine transform (DCT-PLS) method. This method iteratively identifies cloud-contaminated NDVI over NDVI time series from the Sentinel-2 surface reflectance data by adjusting the weights. The NDVI and surface reflectance time series are then reconstructed from cloud-free NDVI and surface reflectance using the adjusted weights as constraints. We have made some improvements to the DCT-PLS method. First, the traditional discrete cosine transformation (DCT) in the DCT-PLS method is matrix generated from discrete and equally spaced data, we reconfigured the DCT formulas to adapt for irregular interval time series, and optimized the control parameters N and s according to the typical vegetation samples in China. Second, the DCT-PLS method was deployed in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform for the efficiency and convenience of data users. We used the DCT-PLS method to reconstruct the Sentinel-2 NDVI time series and surface reflectance time series in the blue, green, red, and near infrared (NIR) bands in typical vegetation samples and the Zhangjiakou and Hangzhou study area. We found that this method performed better than the SG filter method in reconstructing the NDVI time series, and can identify and reconstruct the contaminated NDVI as well as surface reflectance with low root mean square error (RMSE) and high coefficient of determination (R-2). However, in cases of a long range of cloud contamination, or above water surface, it may be necessary to increase the control parameter s for a more stable performance. The GEE code is freely available online and the link is in the conclusions of this article, researchers are welcome to use this method to generate cloudless Sentinel-2 NDVI and surface reflectance time series with 10 m spatial resolution, which is convenient for landcover classification and many other types of research.

AB  - Land subsidence problems have become increasingly prominent. Traditional monitoring methods, such as level measurements, have high costs and low efficiency. Permanent scatterer interferometric synthetic aperture radar (PS-InSAR) has several advantages for land subsidence monitoring based on technological innovations. Aimed at resolving the key problems associated with PS-InSAR technology, the accuracy of three external digital elevations models (DEMs, namely, SRTM, ASTER GDEM, and PleiadesDEM) was analysed and compared. We found that the introduction of ground control points can significantly improve the elevation accuracy of DEMs. Herein, we introduce the specific processing steps and selection of the key parameters for IN-SAR data using the StaMPS software. We discuss the differences between IN-SAR technology and levelling measurements as well as the influence that the different external DEMs have on IN-SAR data. Based on 36 scenes of TerraSAR-X images, we obtained results for land deformation monitoring in Taiyuan City using PS-InSAR technology, which provided satisfactory monitoring results.

TI  - Land Use and Land Cover Influence on Sentinel-2 Aerosol Optical Depth below City Scales over Beijing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric aerosols can impact human health, necessitating the understanding of their distribution determinants, especially in urban areas. The study discusses the relationships between five major land cover types and aerosol optical depth (AOD) within a city combining the high-resolution satellite-derived AOD products (derived from Sentinel-2) and land cover products (60 m and 100 m, respectively) for Beijing and its surroundings from 2017 to 2019. Contribution analysis is performed to quantitatively evaluate the influences of land cover on regional AOD over the study area. Patterns of aerosol distribution remarkably vary in time and space. Statistics of seasonal average AOD peak in spring and then progressively decline from summer through autumn to winter. High AOD values coincide with a low normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and a high normalized difference built-up index (NDBI). Urban and built-up land is a major contributor to regional AOD in the study area, especially in spring; forest and grassland always reduce AOD. Anthropogenic activities have a non-negligible influence on AOD and can even reverse the contribution of a land cover type to aerosols. Insights of the study promote the comprehension of the impacts of land cover on aerosols and air pollution and contribute to the planning of land use within a city.

TI  - Analysis of Ecological Environmental Quality Change in the Yellow River Basin Using the Remote-Sensing-Based Ecological Index
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Establishing a method for characterizing spatiotemporal changes in the quality of the ecological environment in a timely and accurate manner is of great significance for the protection and sustainable development of the ecological environment in the Yellow River Basin (YRB). In this study, the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform was used as a basis for constructing the remote-sensing-based ecological index (RSEI), and the RSEI was used to evaluate the quality of the ecological environment in the YRB. The results indicated that the mean of the RSEI values showed two stages of rapid improvement and slow improvement during 1990-2020. From 1990 to 2000, the average growth trend was 0.005/a with a growth rate of 21.15%, with the main contributions of bad to poor (101,800 km(2)), poor to medium (56,900 km(2)), and medium to good (70,800 km(2)) ecological environmental quality levels. From 2000 to 2020, the average growth trend was 0.002/a with a growth rate of 2.13%, with main contributions of poor to bad (65,100 km(2)) and good to medium (35,200 km(2)) ecological environmental quality levels. From 1990 to 2020, there was a 76.38% improvement in the ecological environmental quality of the entire YRB, in which significant improvement accounted for 26.14%. The reductions in the ecological environmental quality accounted for 23.62%, of which significant reductions accounted for just 1.46%. The improvement in the ecological environmental quality of the YRB showed a trend of increasing sustainability, which is expected to continue. The distribution of the ecological environmental quality in the YRB showed obvious regional aggregation, whereby cold spots were concentrated in the northern and central regions of the YRB, which are the sandy and hilly ravine areas of the Loess Plateau. However, the areas corresponding to hot spot clusters decreased with time, and their significance also decreased. Thus, our study demonstrates that the GEE platform can be used to determine the spatiotemporal changes in the ecological environmental quality of the YRB in a timely and accurate manner.

TI  - Long-Term Changes of Land Use and Land Cover in the Yangtze River Basin from 1990-2020 Landsat Data
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Economic development and climate change drive the land use and land cover (LULC) change globally. Annual robust maps of LULC are critical for studying climate change and land-climate interaction. However, the current existing methods for optimizing and expanding the publicly available China land cover data set (CLCD) are limited. In this article, 30-m annual LULC changes are obtained from 1990 to 2020 in the Yangtze River basin (YRB). The results show an overall accuracy rate of 82.66% and better performances on Geo-Wiki test samples when compared to similar products. Based on our 30-m annual LULC data set, the drastic LULC changes are found in YRB over a 30-year period, where impervious surface area more than tripled, cropland area decreased by 6.12%, and water area decreased by 6.09%. In addi-tion, through the geographically and temporally weighted regression method, a fitting model with a goodness of fit of 0.91 well reveals that human activity plays a driving role in the LULC change of YRB.

TI  - Vegetation Dynamics in the Qinling-Daba Mountains through Climate Warming with Land-Use Policy
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Qinling-Daba Mountains in central China (also known as the north-south transitional zone) comprise an ideal area to study land cover change, climate change, and human activities. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) change and associated driving factors are highly sensitive to vegetation cover change. To discover the long-term vegetation trends in the transition zone and determine the driving factors of NDVI change in recent decades, this study analyzed the NDVI variation trend and its spatial variation with elevation, slope, and land-use type based on annual growing season NDVI data from 1990-2019 (Landsat 30 m; Google Earth Engine). The results show that NDVI values in the Qinling-Daba Mountains significantly increased and experienced a dynamic change process, involving an initial decrease and subsequent increase over this time period. The period of 2000-2005 showed a remarkable increasing stage of the NDVI in the transition zone. Such NDVI changes are sensitive to elevation and slope. For example, areas at elevations < 1500 m or with slopes of 5 degrees-25 degrees exhibited a stronger rate of NDVI increase than in other places. The NDVI change was also found to be positively affected by human land use and climate warming, both of which had a stronger impact than precipitation. The area with rapid NDVI growth was also the region with the greatest impact of human cropland and host to the Grain-for-Green project. This demonstrates that human land use has had a positive impact on the NDVI change in recent decades, although urbanization had led to a decrease in the NDVI in surrounding areas. Land-use policies have contributed to the large increase in NDVI values, especially those for forest conservation and expansion programs such as the Grain-for-Green project.

TI  - Assessment of FY-2G, FY-4A, and Himawari-8 Atmospheric Motion Vectors over Southeast Asia and Their Assimilating Impact on the Forecasts of Tropical Cyclone PABUK
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial coverage of atmospheric motion vectors (AMVs) over Southeast Asia (SEA) is mainly covered by the Himawari-8 (HIMA-8) and FengYun-2 (FY-2) series satellites in the Global Telecommunication System (GTS). With the launch of FengYun-4A (FY-4A), a new Chinese geostationary satellite, AMVs have enhanced the spatial and temporal resolution data along with allowing for more options of the spectral channels than the FY-2G. This study focuses on the preliminary quality assessments of the FY-2G, FY-4A and HIMA-8 AMVs during a three-month monsoon period, as well as the impact of assimilating AMVs on the numerical weather prediction (NWP) model over SEA. The results show that the qualities of the AMVs from the FY-2G and FY-4A are sensitive to different quality indicator (QI) values, but this is not the case for the HIMA-8. For QI values at 85%, FY-2G and FY-4A AMVs had a monthly mean feature in the monsoon period that were quite comparable to HIMA-8 AMVs, with a few exceptions in this area when three sets of AMVs were validated against NCEP/FNL operational global analysis data; however, the qualities of the AMVs from HIMA-8 were better overall than those from FY-2G and FY-4A. In addition, four experiments were conducted with and without an assimilation of AMVs with a QI at 85% available from FY-2G, FY-4A, and HIMA-8 to assess their impact on tropical cyclone (TC) PABUK from 1 to 4 January 2019. The findings demonstrate that the assimilation of three sets of AMVs diminishes the average initial position error and track forecast error after 42 h when compared to the control experiment. Nevertheless, none of the experiments' analyses or forecasts of the TC intensity showed a statistically significant development. The findings for FY-2G and FY-4A AMVs may offer a direction forward for the FY AMVs series dataset for future implementation in the global data assimilation system of NWP models, similar to HIMA-8 AMVs, which shows a favourable performance in assimilating AMVs from assorted satellites for SEA forecasts.

TI  - Scalable Crop Yield Prediction with Sentinel-2 Time Series and Temporal Convolutional Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the precepts of food security is the proper functioning of the global food markets. This calls for open and timely intelligence on crop production on an agroclimatically meaningful territorial scale. We propose an operationally suitable method for large-scale in-season crop yield estimations from a satellite image time series (SITS) for statistical production. As an object-based method, it is spatially scalable from parcel to regional scale, making it useful for prediction tasks in which the reference data are available only at a coarser level, such as counties. We show that deep learning-based temporal convolutional network (TCN) outperforms the classical machine learning method random forests and produces more accurate results overall than published national crop forecasts. Our novel contribution is to show that mean-aggregated regional predictions with histogram-based features calculated from farm-level observations perform better than other tested approaches. In addition, TCN is robust to the presence of cloudy pixels, suggesting TCN can learn cloud masking from the data. The temporal compositing of information do not improve prediction performance. This indicates that with end-to-end learning less preprocessing in SITS tasks seems viable.

TI  - Effect of the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympic Games on COVID-19 incidence in Japan: a synthetic control approach
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympic Games (23 July-8 August 2021) were held in the middle of Japan's fifth wave of COVID-19, when the number of cases was on the rise, and coincided with the fourth state of emergency implemented by the host city, Tokyo. Aim This study aimed to assess whether the hosting of the Games was associated with a change in the number of COVID-19 cases in Japan using a synthetic control method. Methods A weighted average of control countries with a variety of predictors was used to estimate the counterfactual trajectory of daily COVID-19 cases per 1 000 000 population in the absence of the Games in Japan. Outcome and predictor data were extracted using official and open sources spanning several countries. The predictors comprise the most recent country-level annual or daily data accessible during the Games, including the stringency of the government's COVID-19 response, testing capacity and vaccination capacity; human mobility index; electoral democracy index and demographic, socioeconomic, health and weather information. After excluding countries with missing data, 42 countries were ultimately used as control countries. Results The number of observed cases per 1 000 000 population on the last day of the Games was 109.2 (7-day average), which was 115.7% higher than the counterfactual trajectory comprising 51.0 confirmed cases per 1 000 000 population. During the Olympic period (since 23 July), the observed cumulative number of cases was 61.0% higher than the counterfactual trajectory, comprising 143 072 and 89 210 confirmed cases (p=0.023), respectively. The counterfactual trajectory lagged 10 days behind the observed trends. Conclusions Given the increasing likelihood that new emerging infectious diseases will be reported in the future, we believe that the results of this study should serve as a sentinel warning for upcoming mega-events during COVID-19 and future pandemics.

TI  - Forest Tree Species Classification Based on Sentinel-2 Images and Auxiliary Data
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Most research on forest tree species classification based on optical image data uses information such as spectral reflectance, vegetation index, texture, and phenology data. However, owing to the limited spectral resolution of multispectral images and the high cost of hyperspectral data, there is room for improvement in the classification of tree species in large areas based on optical images. The combined application of multispectral images and other auxiliary data can provide a new method for improving tree species classification accuracy. Hence, Sentinel-2 images were used to extract spectral reflectance, spectral index, texture, and phenological information. Data for topography, precipitation, air temperature, ultraviolet aerosol index, NO2 concentration, and other variables were included as auxiliary data. Models for forest tree species classification were constructed through feature combination and feature optimization using the random forest (RF), gradient tree boost (GTB), support vector machine (SVM), and classification and regression tree (CART) algorithms. The classification results of 16 feature combinations with the 4 classification methods were compared, and the contributions of different features to the classification models of forest tree species were evaluated. Finally, the optimal classification model was selected to identify the spatial distribution of forest tree species in the study area. The model based on feature optimization gave the best results among the 16 feature combination models. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient were increased by 18% and 0.21, respectively, compared with the spectral classification model, and by 17% and 0.20, respectively, compared with the spectral and spectral index classification model. By analyzing the feature optimization model, it was found that terrain, ultraviolet aerosol index, and phenological information ranked as the top three features in terms of importance. Although the importance of spectral reflectance and spectral index features was lower, the number of feature variables accounted for a large proportion of the total. The importance of commonly used texture features was limited, and these features were not present in the feature optimization model. The RF algorithm had the highest classification accuracy, with an overall accuracy of 82.69% and a kappa coefficient of 0.80, among the four classification algorithms. The results of GTB were close to those of RF, and the difference in overall classification accuracy was only 0.14%. However, the results of the SVM and CART algorithms were relatively weaker, with overall classification accuracies of about 70%. It can be concluded that the combined application of Sentinel-2 images and auxiliary data can improve forest tree species classification accuracy. The model based on feature optimization achieved the highest classification accuracy among the 16 feature combination models. The spectral reflectance and spectral index data extracted from optical images are useful for tree species classification, but the effect of texture features was very limited. Auxiliary data, such as topographic features, ultraviolet aerosol index, phenological features, NO2 concentration features, topographic diversity features, precipitation features, temperature features, and multi-scale topographic location index data, can effectively improve forest tree species classification accuracy. The RF algorithm had the highest accuracy, and it can be used for tree species classification space distribution identification.The combined application of Sentinel-2 images and auxiliary data can improve classification accuracy, but the highest accuracy of the model was only 82.69%, which leaves room for improvement. Thus, more effective auxiliary data and the vertical structural parameters extracted from satellite LiDAR can be combined with multispectral images to improve forest tree species classification accuracy in future research.

TI  - Factors Associated with Axillary Lymph Node Status in Clinically Node-Negative Breast Cancer Patients Undergoing Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Routine axillary surgery for lymph node staging is necessary for invasive breast cancer, according to current guidelines. However, advances in breast tumor biology and the in vivo tumor response to drugs provided by neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) have led to the development of new effective drugs and higher rates of pathological complete response (pCR) in the breast or axilla. In this retrospective study, we aimed to investigate the factors influencing axillary lymph node (ALN) status after NAC in patients initially diagnosed with clinically node-negative (cN0) breast cancer. We found that pCR of the breast was a predictor of negative ALN status, and the presence of lymphovascular invasion was a predictor of positive ALN status. Our findings support the omission of axillary surgery in patients who achieve breast-pCR and provide the rationale for trials to investigate the feasibility of breast-conserving surgery without concurrent axillary surgery in patients who meet certain criteria. Adequate axillary lymph node (ALN) staging is critical for patients with invasive breast cancer. However, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) was associated with a lower risk of ALN metastasis compared with those who underwent primary surgery among clinically node-negative (cN0) patients. This study aimed to investigate the factors associated with ALN status among patients with cN0 breast cancer undergoing NAC. A total of 222 consecutive patients with cN0 breast cancer undergoing NAC between January 2012 and December 2021 were reviewed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to compare factors associated with positive ALN status. Seventeen patients (7.7%) had ALNs metastases. Here, 90 patients (40.5%) achieved pathologic complete response in the breast (breast-pCR), and all had negative ALN status. Lymphovascular invasion (odds ratio: 29.366, p < 0.0001) was an independent risk predictor of ALN metastasis in all study populations. Among patients without breast-pCR, mastectomies were performed more frequently in patients with ALN metastasis (52.9%) than in those without metastasis (20.9%) (p = 0.013). Our findings support the omission of axillary surgery in patients who achieve breast-pCR. Prospective studies are needed to confirm the feasibility of a future two-stage surgical plan for breast-conserving surgery in patients who are likely to achieve breast-pCR during clinical evaluation.

TI  - Confirmation of Pathogen 'Burnout' in Mouse Colonies with Previous Evidence of Infection with Parvovirus and Rotavirus
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR LABORATORY ANIMAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Pathogen monitoring and colony health management are critical components of any rodent research program. From an operational perspective, rodent facilities are protected from unwanted infectious agents by facility-specific bioexclusion criteria, sanitation of the physical environment, and personal protective equipment. Another important preventative measure is the use of room health levels to provide traffic patterns for animal care and research staff as they move between rooms of differing health status. For mice, our institution uses a tiered room level system with 6 defined categories, ranging from level 1 (strictest entry criteria) to 6 (least stringent entry criteria). Level 6 is defined as rooms with mice that have tested positive for mouse parvovirus (MPV) or mouse rotavirus (MRV) or both on sentinel serology at any point in time in the past and no decontamination. Because many of our mouse rooms had historically been positive for MPV and/or MRV and because of the high financial and logistic challenges of using repeated test-and-cull for elimination, we had tolerated the potential presence of MPV and MRV and had developed management practices that would promote 'burnout' (that is, elimination of infectious agents due to absence of susceptible hosts) of these pathogens. Analysis of sentinel data showed that we had 28 rooms in 4 facilities for which excluded pathogens had not been identified in 3 y or more. We therefore developed a hybrid testing strategy involving both PCR analysis and serology and implemented it in sentinels and in select colony mice to determine whether the rooms had undergone successful burnout and were free of MPV and MRV. All test results obtained during the assessment were negative for both viruses, and the rooms were subsequently upgraded to level 5 (free from excluded pathogens and allowing two-way movement in and out of housing room). All upgraded rooms have remained negative on subsequent quarterly routine sentinel serology for over 3 y. Our testing strategy for confirming pathogen burnout may be a useful and cost-efficient model for other academic rodent research programs that face a similar situation.

TI  - Evaluation of HY-2 Series Satellites Mapping Capability on Mesoscale Eddies
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the launches of HY-2B, HY-2C and HY-2D, the National Satellite Ocean Application Service (NSOAS) successfully established the first batch of HY-2 constellation on 19 May 2021, dedicated to detecting the marine dynamic environment. While the validation and calibration of HY-2 series satellites have been well studied, using both in situ and cross-track measurements, further evaluation is required of HY-2 series satellites mapping capability on mesoscale eddies. In this study, we conducted two groups of pseudo-observations obtained by ocean models output at positions and times of the satellite along ground tracks. The two altimetry satellite combinations are the Jason-3+Sentinel-3A/B configuration (reference group) and the Jason-3+Sentinel-3A/B+HY-2B/C/D configuration (evaluation group). Three regions at different latitudes were selected as the study areas. Then, we gridded the satellite along ground tracks into synthetic SSH products for each satellite configuration group. Finally, the attributes of mesoscale eddies extracted from gridded products were analyzed to evaluate the mapping capability of HY-2 series satellites. Our results suggest that the gridded products of evaluation groups are more similar to model data compared to reference groups, with a maximum difference reduced by 23%. In terms of eddy identification, the evaluation groups using HY-2 series satellites can alleviate eddy incorrect estimation and add more details to the spatial distribution of eddy radius and amplitude. Additionally, the evaluation groups displayed better performance in mesoscale eddy detection, with a maximum enhancement of 14% and 16% in eddy recognition rate and accuracy.

TI  - Physical and Optical Properties of Clouds in the Southwest Vortex from <i>FY-4A</i> Cloud Retrievals
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The southwest vortex (SWV) is a critical weather system in China, but our knowledge of this system remains incomplete. Here, we investigate the cloud properties in the SWV. First, we search for the SWVs with time steps and center locations that are consistent between the SWV yearbook and ERA-Interim reanalysis data. Second, we supplement these SWVs' life spans and movement paths. Third, we relocate the Fengyun (FY) satellite FY-4A cloud retrievals in the 10 degrees x 10 degrees region centered on each SWV and analyze the cloud occurrence frequency (COF), cloud-top height (CTH), and cloud optical thickness (COT). A distribution mode of cloud types is summarized from the COFs, with water clouds, supercooled clouds, mixed clouds, ice clouds, cirrus clouds, and overlap clouds occurring sequentially from west to east. The CTH probability density (PD) distribution features a significant north-south difference. In addition, the COT PD distributions exhibit a common trend: with increasing COT, the PD increases rapidly and then slowly before peaking, whereupon the PD decreases abruptly. From spring to summer, the region with the highest convective COF shifts from the northeast to the northwest, and an east-west gradient of the convective COF appears in autumn and winter. Furthermore, we investigate the cloud properties during SWV-related heavy rainfall. Heavy rain occurs mainly in the west of the SWV, and convective clouds are mainly in the northwest, partly in the southwest and near the SWV center. The average CTH in heavy rainfall is generally higher than 6 km, and the average COT is greater than 20. Significance StatementThe southwest vortex (SWV) is an important weather system in China. However, we do not yet comprehensively know this weather system. The cloud properties can indicate the structures of weather systems and are key parameters in numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. Thus, investigating cloud properties is necessary and meaningful to understand the SWV and accurately predict SWV-related precipitation in NWP models. In this paper, a typical distribution mode of six cloud types in the SWV is summarized from the cloud occurrence frequency, and the distribution features of convective clouds, cloud-top height, and cloud optical thickness in the SWV are analyzed. Furthermore, the cloud properties in SWV-related heavy rain are also studied.

TI  - Postseismic Process Inversion Using Full Time Series of Surface Deformation: Full Time-Series Inversion (FTI) Theory and Its Application to the 2017 Sarpol-e Zahab Earthquake
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Postseismic processes provide important opportunities to probe into and investigate the frictional, viscous, and porous properties of the seismogenic fault and the surrounding Earth media. To accommodate the temporal and spatial resolutions and long-term baseline stability of different deformation data, we develop a full time-series inversion (FTI) technique, which jointly inverts for afterslip patterns using full time series of Global Navigation Satellite System, SAR, and strainmeter data. The FTI linearizes the inversion problem with a prescribed source evolution function to achieve efficient inversion. We conduct synthetic tests to validate the spatial and temporal resolution of the FTI algorithm. FTI outperforms static inversion techniques in terms of inversion stability under high noise level. We apply different parameterization strategies to evaluate its resolution for slip evolution parameters. The tests show that FTI can discriminate spatially separated afterslip with distinct evolution functions. Finally, we apply FTI to investigate the afterslip process following the 2017 M-w 7.3 Sarpol-e Zahab earthquake that occurred along the Iran-Iraq border in northwestern Zagros using Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry time series derived from the Sentinel-1 observations 1 year after the mainshock. Similar to the synthetic tests, the algorithm is capable to discriminate afterslip with different evolution functions in the up- and downdip portions of the coseismic rupture zone. By comparing with the stress-driven afterslip model simulated using rate-strengthening frictional law, we demonstrate the stability of FTI in resolving the afterslip process. We emphasize the importance of incorporating early postseismic observations for deciphering afterslip evolution and frictional parameters.

TI  - Prevalence of Mental Health Problems among Patients Treated by Emergency Medical Teams: Findings from J-SPEED Data Regarding the West Japan Heavy Rain 2018
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - It is crucial to provide mental health care following a disaster because the victims tend to experience symptoms such as anxiety and insomnia during the acute phase. However, little research on mental health during the acute phase has been conducted, and reported only in terms of the temporal transition of the number of consultations and symptoms. Thus, the aim of the study was to examine how mental health care needs are accounted for in the overall picture of disaster relief and how they change over time. Using data from the Japanese version of Surveillance in Post-Extreme Emergencies and Disasters (J-SPEED), we assessed the mental health of injured and ill patients to whom Emergency Medical Teams (EMTs) were providing care during the acute period of a disaster. Approximately 10% of all medical consultations were for mental health issues, 83% of which took place within the first 2 weeks after the disaster. The findings showed that, from the start of the response period to the 19th response day, the daily proportion of mental health problems declined substantially, and then gradually increased. Such a V-shaped pattern might be helpful for identifying phase changes and supporting the development of EMT exit strategies.

TI  - Two Decades of Satellite Observations of Carbon Monoxide Confirm the Increase in Northern Hemispheric Wildfires
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Biomass burning is an important and changing component of global and hemispheric carbon cycles. Boreal forest fires in Russia and Canada are significant sources of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). The influence of carbon monoxide (CO) on the greenhouse effect is practically absent; its main absorption bands of 4.6 and 2.3 mu m are far away from the climatically important spectral regions. Meanwhile, CO concentrations in fire plumes are closely related to CO2 and CH4 emissions from fires. On the other hand, satellite measurements of CO are much simpler than those of the aforementioned gases. The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) operating in the Thermal IR spectral region has provided a satellite-based CO data set since October 2002. This satellite data allow to estimate CO emissions from biomass burning north of 30 degrees N using a simple two-box mass-balance model. These results correlate closely with independently estimated CO emissions from the GFED4c bottom-up database. In 2021, both estimate record high emissions throughout the preceding two decades, double the annual emissions compared to previous periods. There have been two years with extremely high emissions (2003 and 2021) but for the rest of the data, an upward trend with a rate of 3.6 +/- 2.2 Tg CO yr(-2) (4.8 +/- 2.7% yr(-1)) was found. A similar rate of CO emissions can be seen in the GFED4c data.

TI  - Optimization of Open-Access Optical and Radar Satellite Data in Google Earth Engine for Oil Palm Mapping in the Muda River Basin, Malaysia
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuous oil palm distribution maps are essential for effective agricultural planning and management. Due to the significant cloud cover issue in tropical regions, the identification of oil palm from other crops using only optical satellites is difficult. Based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE), this study aims to evaluate the best combination of open-source optical and microwave satellite data in oil palm mapping by utilizing the C-band Sentinel-1, L-band PALSAR-2, Landsat 8, Sentinel-2, and topographic images, with the Muda River Basin (MRB) as the test site. The results show that the land use land cover maps generated from the combined images have accuracies from 95 to 97%; the best combination goes to Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 for the overall classification. Meanwhile, the best combination for oil palm classification is C5 (PALSAR-2 + Landsat 8), with the highest producer accuracy (96%) and consumer accuracy (100%) values. The combination of C-band radar images can improve the classification accuracy of oil palm, but compared with the combination of L-band images, the oil palm area was underestimated. The oil palm area had increased from 2015 to 2020, ranging from 10% to 60% across all combinations. This shows that the selection of optimal images is important for oil palm mapping.

TI  - A 35-year daily global solar radiation dataset reconstruction at the Great Wall Station, Antarctica: First results and comparison with ERA5, CRA40 reanalysis, and ICDR (AVHRR) satellite products
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar radiation drives many geophysical and biological processes in Antarctica, such as sea ice melting, ice sheet mass balance, and photosynthetic processes of phytoplankton in the polar marine environment. Although reanalysis and satellite products can provide important insight into the global scale of solar radiation in a seamless way, the ground-based radiation in the polar region remains poorly understood due to the harsh Antarctic environment. The present study attempted to evaluate the estimation performance of empirical models and machine learning models, and use the optimal model to establish a 35-year daily global solar radiation (DGSR) dataset at the Great Wall Station, Antarctica using meteorological observation data during 1986-2020. In addition, it then compared against the DGSR derived from ERA5, CRA40 reanalysis, and ICDR (AVHRR) satellite products. For the DGSR historical estimation performance, the machine learning method outperforms the empirical formula method overall. Among them, the Mutli2 model (hindcast test R ( 2 ), RMSE, and MAE are 0.911, 1.917 MJ/m(2), and 1.237 MJ/m(2), respectively) for the empirical formula model and XGBoost model (hindcast test R ( 2 ), RMSE, and MAE are 0.938, 1.617 MJ/m(2), and 1.030 MJ/m(2), respectively) for the machine learning model were found with the highest accuracy. For the austral summer half-year, the estimated DGSR agrees very well with the observed DGSR, with a mean bias of only -0.47 MJ/m(2). However, other monthly DGSR products differ significantly from observations, with mean bias of 1.05 MJ/m(2), 3.27 MJ/m(2), and 6.90 MJ/m(2) for ICDR (AVHRR) satellite, ERA5, and CRA40 reanalysis products, respectively. In addition, the DGSR of the Great Wall Station, Antarctica followed a statistically significant increasing trend at a rate of 0.14 MJ/m(2)/decade over the past 35 years. To our best knowledge, this study presents the first reconstruction of the Antarctica Great Wall Station DGSR spanning 1986-2020, which will contribute to the research of surface radiation balance in Antarctic Peninsula.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study emphasizes on the cellulase production characteristics of strain ZY7 and its collaboration with nitrate -dependent ferrous oxidizing (NFO) strain XL4 to achieve efficient denitrification at low carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) ratio. Results indicated that the denitrification efficiency increased from 65.47 to 97.99% at 24 h after co-culture at C/N of 1.0. Three-dimensional fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (3D-EEM) showed significant changes in the intensity of soluble microbial products (SMP), fulvic-like materials, and aromatic proteins after co-culture. Bio-precipitates were characterized by Scanning electron microscope (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spec-trometer (FTIR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD), which showed that cellulose structure was disrupted and the metabolites were potential carbon source for denitrification. In addition, cellulase activity suggested that the hydrolysis of 8-1,4-glycosidic bonds and oligosaccharides may be the rate-limiting steps in cellulose degradation. This work promoted the understanding of denitrification characteristics of co-culture and expanded the appli-cation of cellulose degrading bacteria in sewage treatment.

TI  - Dynamic Changes and Driving Forces of Alpine Wetlands on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau Based on Long-Term Time Series Satellite Data: A Case Study in the Gansu Maqu Wetlands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), also known as the Third Pole of the Earth, is sensitive to climate change, and it has become a hotspot area for research. As a typical natural ecosystem on the QTP, alpine wetlands are particularly sensitive to climate change. The identification of different types of alpine wetland and analysis of changes in their distributions and areas are the most direct indicators for characterizing the impact of climate change on wetlands. To understand the dynamic change process of the alpine wetlands in the QTP and their responses to climate change, the Maqu wetlands, located at the source of the Three Rivers in the eastern part of the QTP, was taken as an example; the Google Earth Engine (GEE) remote sensing cloud platform and long-term dense Landsat time series data from 1990 to 2020 were used to map the annual wetland classification and to analyze the evolution characteristics of the wetlands and their driving forces. The results revealed that (1) based on dense Landsat time series data, different alpine wetland types can be effectively distinguished, including swamp, swamp meadow, and wet meadow. (2) From 1990 to 2020, the area of the Maqu wetlands exhibited an overall fluctuating decrease, with the total area decreasing by about 23.35%, among which the swamp area decreased the most (by 27.15%). The overall type of change was from wet to dry. All of the types of wetlands were concentrated between 3400 and 3600 m above sea level, and the reduction in the wetland area was concentrated on slopes < 3 degrees, with the greatest loss of wetland area occurring on shady slopes. (3) The driving forces of the changes in the wetlands were predominantly temperature and precipitation, and the greatest correlation was between the total wetland area and the growing season temperature. The results of this study provide valuable information for the conservation of alpine wetlands.

TI  - Estimation of Suspended Sediment Concentration in the Yangtze Main Stream Based on Sentinel-2 MSI Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Suspended sediment concentration (SSC) is an important indicator of water quality that affects the biological processes of river ecosystems and the evolution of floodplains and river channels. The in situ SSC measurements are costly, laborious and spatially discontinuous, while the spaceborne SSC overcome these drawbacks and becomes an effective supplement for in situ observation. However, the spaceborne SSC observations of rivers are more challenging than those of lakes and reservoirs due to their narrow widths and the broad range of SSCs, among other factors. We developed a novel SSC retrieval method that is suitable for the rivers. Water was classified as clear or turbid based on the Forel-Ule index, and optimal SSC models were constructed based on the spectral responses to SSCs in cases of different turbidity. The estimated SSC had a strong correspondence with in situ measurements, with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 24.87 mg/L and a mean relative error (MRE) of 51.91%. Satellite-derived SSC showed good consistency with SSCs obtained from gauging stations (r(2) > 0.79). We studied the spatiotemporal variation in SSC in the Yangtze main stream from 2017 to 2021. It increased considerably from May to October each year, with the peak generally occurring in July or August (ca. 200-300 mg/L in a normal year and 800-1000 mg/L in a flood year), while it remained stable and decreased to around 50 mg/L from November to April of the following year. It was high in the east and low in the west, with local maxima in Chongqing (ca. 80-150 mg/L) and in the lower Dongting Lake reaches (ca. 80-100 mg/L) and a local minima in the downstream of the Three Gorges Dam (ca. 1-20 mg/L). Case studies in the Yibin reach and Three Gorges Reservoir determined that local variation in SSCs is due to special hydrodynamic conditions and anthropogenic activities. The procedure applied to process Sentinel-2 imagery and the novel SSC retrieval method we developed supplement the deficiencies in river SSC retrieval.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - China has entered the stage of rapid urbanization since the 1990s, resulting in a series of environmental problems. Based on the nighttime light remote sensing data and land use data from 1995 to 2020, we extracted the compound night light index (CNLI) to measure the urbanization level of mid-southern Liaoning urban agglomeration, evaluated habitat quality by InVEST model. We examined the relationship between urbanization level and habitat quality in mid-southern Liaoning urban agglomeration by using the correlation analysis method and the geographic weighted regression model. The results showed that CNLI increased by 0.14 from 1995 to 2020. The urbanization level increased continuously, with a pattern of "low in the east and high in the west". The habitat quality decreased by 0.005, showing a pattern of "high in the east and low in the west". The ecological environment became worse. There was a significant negative spatial correlation between urbanization level and habitat quality in mid-southern Liaoning urban agglomeration. The negative impact of urbanization level on habitat quality gradually decreased. In order to alleviate habitat degradation caused by urbanization and realize the coordinated and sustainable development of regional social economy, it was urgent to take a series of measures, such as delimiting the ecological protection red line, improving the intensive use of land, delimiting the urban boundary, promoting the coordinated development of regional integration.

TI  - Deep Learning-Based Water Quality Retrieval in an Impounded Lake Using Landsat 8 Imagery: An Application in Dongping Lake
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Attempts have been made to incorporate remote sensing techniques and in situ observations for enhanced water quality assessments. Estimations of nonoptical indicators sensitive to water environment changes, however, have not been fully studied, mainly due to complex nonlinear relationships between the observed values and surface reflectance. In this study, we applied a novel deep learning approach driven by a range of spectral properties to retrieve 6-year changes in water quality variables, i.e., Chl-a, BOD, TN, CODMn, NH3-N, and TP, on a monthly basis between 2013 and 2018 at Dongping Lake, an impounded lake located in the Yellow River in China. Band arithmetic was used to compute 26 predictors from Landsat 8 OLI imagery for model inputs. The results showed generally strong agreement between in situ and ConvLSTM-derived lake variables, generating R-2 of 0.92, 0.88, 0.84, 0.80, 0.83, and 0.77 for TN, NH3-N, CODMn, Chl-a, TP, and BOD, which suggest good performance of the developed model. We then used statistical analysis to identify the spatial and temporal heterogeneity. The framework established in this study has applications in effective water quality monitoring and serves as an alarming tool for water-environment management in the complex inland lake waters.

TI  - Asian Rice Calendar Dynamics Detected by Remote Sensing and Their Climate Drivers
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detecting crop calendar changes is critically important for crop monitoring and management, but the lack of annual, Asia-wide, and long-term rice calendar datasets limits our understanding of rice phenological changes and their climate drivers. In this study, we retrieved key rice phenological dates from the GLASS AVHRR LAI through combining threshold-based and inflection-based detection methods, analyzed the changes during the period 1995-2015, and identified the key climate drivers of the main rice seasons in Asia. The retrieved phenological dates had a high level of agreement with the referenced observations. All R-2 were greater than 0.80. The length of the vegetation growing period (VGP) was mostly shortened (by an average of -4 days per decade), while the length of the reproductive growing period was mostly prolonged (by an average of 2 days per decade). Moreover, solar radiation had the most significant impact on the rice calendar changes, followed by the maximum and minimum temperatures. The VGP in tropical areas is the most sensitive to climate change. Our study extends the annual rice phenology dynamics to a higher spatial-temporal resolution and provides new insights into rice calendar changes and their climate drivers, which will assist governments and researchers regarding food security and agricultural sustainability.

TI  - A CNN-LSTM Model for Soil Organic Carbon Content Prediction with Long Time Series of MODIS-Based Phenological Variables
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) serves as critical geographic information for assessing ecosystem services, climate change mitigation, and optimal agriculture management. Digital mapping of SOC is challenging due to the complex relationships between the soil and its environment. Except for the well-known terrain and climate environmental covariates, vegetation that interacts with soils influences SOC significantly over long periods. Although several remote-sensing-based vegetation indices have been widely adopted in digital soil mapping, variables indicating long term vegetation growth have been less used. Vegetation phenology, an indicator of vegetation growth characteristics, can be used as a potential time series environmental covariate for SOC prediction. A CNN-LSTM model was developed for SOC prediction with inputs of static and dynamic environmental variables in Xuancheng City, China. The spatially contextual features in static variables (e.g., topographic variables) were extracted by the convolutional neural network (CNN), while the temporal features in dynamic variables (e.g., vegetation phenology over a long period of time) were extracted by a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. The ten-year phenological variables derived from moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations were adopted as predictors with historical temporal changes in vegetation in addition to the commonly used static variables. The random forest (RF) model was used as a reference model for comparison. Our results indicate that adding phenological variables can produce a more accurate map, as tested by the five-fold cross-validation, and demonstrate that CNN-LSTM is a potentially effective model for predicting SOC at a regional spatial scale with long-term historical vegetation phenology information as an extra input. We highlight the great potential of hybrid deep learning models, which can simultaneously extract spatial and temporal features from different types of environmental variables, for future applications in digital soil mapping.

TI  - Using Sentinel-2 Imagery and Machine Learning Algorithms to Assess the Inundation Status of Nebraska Conservation Easements during 2018-2021
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Conservation easements (CEs) play an important role in the provision of ecological services. This paper aims to use the open-access Sentinel-2 satellites to advance existing conservation management capacity to a new level of near-real-time monitoring and assessment for the conservation easements in Nebraska. This research uses machine learning and Google Earth Engine to classify inundation status using Sentinel-2 imagery during 2018-2021 for all CE sites in Nebraska, USA. The proposed machine learning approach helps monitor the CE sites at the landscape scale in an efficient and low-cost manner. The results confirmed effective inundation performance in these floodplain or wetland-related CE sites. The CE sites under the Emergency Watershed Protection-Floodplain Easement (EWPP-FPE) had the highest inundated area rate of 18.72%, indicating active hydrological inundation in the floodplain areas. The CE sites under the Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP) reached a mean annual surface water cover rate area of 8.07%, indicating the core wetland areas were inundated periodically or regularly. Other types of CEs serving upland conservation purposes had a lower level of inundation while these uplands conservation provided critical needs in soil erosion control. The mean annual surface water cover rate is 0.96% for the CE sites under the Grassland Reserve Program (GRP). The conservation of the CEs on uplands is an important component to reduce soil erosion and improve downstream wetland hydrological inundation performance. The findings support that the sites with higher inundation frequencies can be considered for future wetland-related conservation practices. The four typical wetland-based CE sites suggested that conservation performance can be improved by implementing hydrological restoration and soil erosion reduction at the watershed scale. The findings provided robust evidence to discover the surface water inundation information on conservation assessment to achieve the long-term goals of conservation easements.

TI  - Mapping of PET/CT-based regional nodes distribution of recurrent/advanced breast cancer and comparison with current delineation atlas
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To localize the distribution of regional nodes in recurrent/advanced breast cancer patients based on 18-fludeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/CT (PET/CT) images and validate the coverage of clinical target volumes (CTVs) for regional nodes with current contouring guidelines.Methods: We enrolled 154 recurrent/advanced breast cancer patients with FDG-avid regional nodes who underwent PET/CT between January 2018 and June 2020. Involvement of lymph node regions including axillary lymph node level I-III (ALN-I, ALN-II, ALN-III), Rotter's nodes (RN), medial supraclavicular (SC-M), lateral supraclavicular (SC-L) and internal mammary nodes (IMN) was recorded respectively. Coverage of the CTVs in different atlases and the locations of out-of-field were evaluated.Results: A total of 348 lymph node regions containing disease were identified, including ALN-I 109, ALN-II 46, ALN-III 36, RN 17, SC-M 68, SC-L 36 and IMN 36. Recurrent ALNs mainly located cranially and ventrally to the axillary vein (AV). Ipsilateral cervical nodes were simultaneously affected in 33/76 SC positive patients. RADCOMP (306/348) and RUIJIN (291/348) guidelines had higher coverage compared with RTOG (205/348) and ESTRO (202/348) guidelines (p < 0.001, respectively). In primary non-metastastic and recurrent patients, major missings located in SC-L (7/7, 17/17) and IMN (7/10, 15/19) for RTOG guideline while SC-L (7/7, 17/17) for ESTRO guideline (p < 0.001, respectively). Among recurrent patients, SC-M (22/31) was another major missing area for ESTRO guideline (p < 0.001).Conclusion: The current guidelines effectively cover most regional nodes in postoperative breast cancer patients. SC-L and IMN were the major missing regions. Recurrent ALNs were most often seen in cranial and ventral to the AV. The CTV of patients with clinically positive SC was recommended to extend up to the hyoid level. The CTVs should be adjusted based on risks of recurrence individually.Advances in knowledge: The difference of regional nodes delineation between current guidelines mainly located in SC and IMN regions. High axilla including subclavicular nodes and the RN above AV for recurrent patients and the region between cricoid and hyoid for positive SC patients should be meticulously contoured.

TI  - Forest Height Mapping Using Feature Selection and Machine Learning by Integrating Multi-Source Satellite Data in Baoding City, North China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of forest height is crucial for the estimation of forest aboveground biomass and monitoring of forest resources. Remote sensing technology makes it achievable to produce high-resolution forest height maps in large geographical areas. In this study, we produced a 25 m spatial resolution wall-to-wall forest height map in Baoding city, north China. We evaluated the effects of three factors on forest height estimation utilizing four types of remote sensing data (Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, ALOS PALSAR-2, and SRTM DEM) with the National Forest Resources Continuous Inventory (NFCI) data, three feature selection methods (stepwise regression analysis (SR), recursive feature elimination (RFE), and Boruta), and six machine learning algorithms (k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), support vector machine regression (SVR), random forest (RF), gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and categorical boosting (CatBoost)). ANOVA was adopted to quantify the effects of three factors, including data source, feature selection method, and modeling algorithm, on forest height estimation. The results showed that all three factors had a significant influence. The combination of multiple sensor data improved the estimation accuracy. Boruta's overall performance was better than SR and RFE, and XGBoost outperformed the other five machine learning algorithms. The variables selected based on Boruta, including Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and topography metrics, combined with the XGBoost algorithm, provided the optimal model (R-2 = 0.67, RMSE = 2.2 m). Then, we applied the best model to create the forest height map. There were several discrepancies between the generated forest height map and the existing map product, and the values with large differences between the two maps were mostly distributed in the steep areas with high slope values. Overall, we proposed a methodological framework for quantifying the importance of data source, feature selection method, and machine learning algorithm in forest height estimation, and it was proved to be effective in estimating forest height by using freely accessible multi-source data, advanced feature selection method, and machine learning algorithm.

TI  - Deep Learning to Near-Surface Humidity Retrieval from Multi-Sensor Remote Sensing Data over the China Seas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Near-surface humidity (Q(a)) is a key parameter that modulates oceanic evaporation and influences the global water cycle. Remote sensing observations act as feasible sources for long-term and large-scale Q(a) monitoring. However, existing satellite Q(a) retrieval models are subject to apparent uncertainties due to model errors and insufficient training data. Based on in situ observations collected over the China Seas over the last two decades, a deep learning approach named Ensemble Mean of Target deep neural networks (EMTnet) is proposed to improve the satellite Q(a) retrieval over the China Seas for the first time. The EMTnet model outperforms five representative existing models by nearly eliminating the mean bias and significantly reducing the root-mean-square error in satellite Q(a) retrieval. According to its target deep neural network selection process, the EMTnet model can obtain more objective learning results when the observational data are divergent. The EMTnet model was subsequently applied to produce 30-year monthly gridded Q(a) data over the China Seas. It indicates that the climbing rate of Q(a) over the China Seas under the background of global warming is probably underestimated by current products.

TI  - Implementing Remote-Sensing Methodologies for Construction Research: An Unoccupied Airborne System Perspective
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - In the past four decades, remote-sensing data and methodologies have been increasingly used in many fields to improve the efficiency, accuracy, or safety of data collection, and construction management is no exception. In recent years, unoccupied airborne systems (UAS), commonly referred to as drones, have emerged as an important platform for the collection of remote-sensing data. When coupled with increasingly affordable sensors and automated image processing techniques, UAS have made the application of remote-sensing approaches to myriad construction and civil engineering problems practical and attractive to the point that UAS-based airborne imaging is becoming routine for many construction management tasks. Based on our review of literature, a comprehensive discussion on the use of UAS methodologies for collecting and analyzing data to assist with construction research is much needed. This paper was developed to discuss current best practices in UAS aerial imagery collection and processing for construction research, including defining key terms. In addition, this paper discusses a variety of methods for the analysis of UAS collected aerial imagery for the following tasks: preconstruction planning, material tracking, project progress tracking, safety, as-built documentation, and building/structure inspection. This paper also includes a perspective on the future of UAS for a variety of construction management tasks. This work contributes to the Data Management and Data Science Body of Knowledge by informing construction researchers of the state of the art of UAS data collection and analysis methodologies. This study also provides practitioners with a comprehensive guide to the use of UAS for onsite construction management tasks, which is an essential component of e-Construction.

TI  - CLASSIFICATION OF DEGRADED SPECIES IN DESERT GRASSLANDS BASED ON MULTI-FEATURE FUSION AND UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE HYPERSPECTRAL
T2  - INMATEH-AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate spatial distribution of grassland degradation indicator species is of great significance for grassland degradation monitoring. In order to realize the intelligent remote sensing grassland degradation monitoring task, this paper collects remote sensing data of three degradation indicator species of desert grassland, namely, constructive species, dominant species, and companion species, through the UAV hyperspectral remote sensing platform, and proposes a multi-feature fusion (MFF) classification model. In addition, vertical convolution, horizontal convolution, and group convolution mechanisms are introduced to further reduce the number of model parameters and effectively improve the computational efficiency of the model. The results show that the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of the model can reach 91.81% and 0.8473, respectively, and it also has better classification performance and computational efficiency compared to different deep learning classification models. This study provides a new method for high-precision and efficient fine classification study of degradation indicator species in grasslands.

TI  - A Two-Step Block Adjustment Method for DSM Accuracy Improvement with Elevation Control of ICESat-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital surface models (DSMs) have been widely utilized in various applications as fundamental geographic information data. Block adjustment is normally performed on satellite images to enhance the geometric accuracy and DSMs are then generated by stereo mapping. However, new errors may be introduced during the stereo mapping processing and geometric discrepancies between DSMs may still exist. In particular, block adjustment is difficult for multisource satellite images. Therefore, this paper presents a two-step block adjustment approach directly performed on DSMs, with high-accuracy ICESat-2 laser altimetry data used as elevation control. In the method, DSM tie-point matching, elevation control/check point selection from ICESat-2 laser points, and planar and elevation block adjustments are performed in sequence. In the experiments, ZY-3 satellite stereo images and corresponding generated DSMs, as well as SRTM and ALOS DSMs, are used for verification. The experimental results show that the absolute elevation accuracy and the relative geometric consistency of the DSMs are both significantly improved after two-step DSM block adjustment and it can efficiently improve the accuracy, not only for DSMs acquired by the same sensor type, but also for DSMs acquired by different sensor types, which demonstrates the feasibility and advantage of the proposed method.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Reconstruction of Antarctic Near-Surface Air Temperature from MODIS Observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) land surface temperature measurements in combination with in situ air temperature records from 119 meteorological stations are used to reconstruct a monthly near-surface air temperature product over the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) by means of a neural network model. The product is generated on a regular grid of 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees, spanning from 2001 to 2018. Comparison with independent in situ air temperature measurements shows low uncertainty, with a mean bias of 0.09 degrees C, a mean absolute error of 2.23 degrees C, and a correlation coefficient of 97%. Furthermore, the performance of the reconstruction is better than ERA5 (the fifth-generation ECMWF reanalysis model) against in situ measurements. For the 2001-18 period, the MODIS-based near-surface air temperature product yields annual warming in the East Antarctica, but cooling in the Antarctic Peninsula and West Antarctica. However, they are not statistically significant. This product can also be used to investigate the impact of the Southern Hemisphere annual mode (SAM) on year-to-year variability of air temperature. The enhanced positive phase of SAM in recent decades in austral summer has a cooling effect on East and West Antarctica. In addition, the dataset has the potential application for climate model validation and data assimilation due to the independence of the input of a numerical weather prediction model.

TI  - Winter Wheat Phenology Variation and Its Response to Climate Change in Shandong Province, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop phenology is considered to be an important indicator reflecting the biophysical and physiological processes of crops facing climate change. Therefore, quantifying crop phenology change and its relationship with climate variables is of great significance for developing agricultural management and adaptation strategies to cope with global warming. Based on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) product, winter wheat green-up date, heading date, jointing date, and maturity date were first retrieved by Savitzky-Golay (S-G) filtering and threshold methods and then the variation of winter wheat phenology and its correlation with mean (T-mean), minimum (T-min), and maximum (T-max) temperature and precipitation (P-re) during 2003-2019 were comprehensively analyzed in Shandong Province, China. Results showed that green-up date, jointing date, heading date, and maturity date generally ranged from 50-70 DOY, 75-95 DOY, 100-120 DOY, and 130-150 DOY. Winter wheat phenology presented a spatial pattern of the South earlier than the North and the inland earlier than the coastal regions. For every 1 degrees increase in latitude/longitude, green-up date, jointing date, heading date, and maturity date were respectively delayed by 3.93 days/0.43 days, 2.31 days/1.19 days, 2.80 days/1.14 days, and 2.12 days/1.09 days. Green-up date and jointing date were both advanced in the West and delayed in the Eastern coastal areas and the South, and heading date and maturity date respectively showed a widespread advance and a delayed tendency in Shandong Province, however, the trend of winter wheat phenological changes was generally insignificant. In addition, green-up date, jointing date, and heading date generally presented a significant negative correlation with mean/minimum temperature, while maturity date was positively associated with the current month maximum temperature, notably in the West of Shandong Province. Regarding precipitation, a generally insignificant relationship with winter wheat phenology was detected. Results in this study are anticipated to provide insight into the impact of climate change on winter wheat phenology and to supply reference for the agricultural production and field management of winter wheat in Shandong Province, China.

TI  - Off-Coast Phytoplankton Bloom in the Taiwan Strait During the Northeasterly Monsoon Wind Relaxation Period
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study applied cruise, model, and satellite data to analyze the off-coast phytoplankton blooming during the late fall to early spring monsoon period in the Taiwan Strait when northeasterly wind prevails. Based on the composite and self-organizing map analyses, the three data sets consistently show high chlorophyll-a concentration near the along-shore front during the down-front northeasterly wind relaxation period while lower concentration when relatively strong wind is persistent. Meanwhile, the off-coast blooming always coincides with intense near-surface stratification when the northeasterly wind relaxes. Diagnoses of balanced Richardson number, Ertel potential vorticity and instability energy budget from high-resolution cruise observations and model results demonstrate that vigorous submesoscale symmetric and baroclinic instabilities can develop near the along-shore front under the down-front NE wind. Diagnoses of modeled buoyancy and chlorophyll-a budget equations further suggest the submesoscale instabilities lead to rapid near-surface restratification and offshore stretching of the along-shore front within the upper 10-m of the mixed layer when the down-front NE wind relaxes, favoring the surface 10-m phytoplankton growth. As comparison, contribution of the larger-scale advection related with geostrophic adjustment and Ekman transport to the chlorophyll-a increment reached beyond the middle layer of similar to 20-m depth.

TI  - Flash Droughts Identification Based on an Improved Framework and Their Contrasting Impacts on Vegetation Over the Loess Plateau, China
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Flash drought occurs in a short timescale and has more adverse impacts on society and ecosystems than regular drought. Considering flash drought as a special type of regular drought and identifying it by the rate of the first intensification period might ignore posterior intensification periods. To this end, we introduced the combinatorial decomposable flash drought identification framework (CDFDI) to identify flash drought from the perspective of regarding it as the subphase of drought and explore the characteristics and vegetation response of flash drought in the Loess Plateau (LP), China, where is prone to drought and its ecological environment is very fragile. The neffectiveness of the framework is evaluated through the comparison analysis with a preexisting identification method proposed by Li et al. (2020, ). Results indicate that: (a) the CDFDI framework can better capture flash drought events than the Liu's method in terms of time series and spatial patterns, its rationality was further demonstrated by the obvious latitudinal pattern of correlation between flash drought and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI); (b) the correlation shows an southeast (positive) and northwest (negative) contrasting pattern in the LP; (c) such contrasting pattern was also found in the response time of GPP, which suggests a more rapid impact on vegetation of flash drought in the arid northwestern LP; and (d) flash drought shows an exacerbating trend across the LP under the background of climate warming and mainly concentrated in the southern part. In general, this study provides new insights on flash drought connotations in a changing environment.

TI  - Nearshore Bathymetry from ICESat-2 LiDAR and Sentinel-2 Imagery Datasets Using Deep Learning Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate bathymetric data is crucial for marine and coastal ecosystems. A lot of studies have been carried out for nearshore bathymetry using satellite data. The approach adopted extensively in shallow water depths estimation has recently been one of empirical models. However, the linear empirical model is simple and only takes limited band information at each bathymetric point into consideration. It may be not suitable for complex environments. In this paper, a deep learning framework was proposed for nearshore bathymetry (DL-NB) from ICESat-2 LiDAR and Sentinel-2 Imagery datasets. The bathymetric points from the spaceborne ICESat-2 LiDAR were extracted instead of in situ measurements. By virtue of the two-dimensional convolutional neural network (2D CNN), DL-NB can make full use of the initial multi-spectral information of Sentinel-2 at each bathymetric point and its adjacent areas during the training. Based on the trained model, the bathymetric maps of several study areas were produced including the Appalachian Bay (AB), Virgin Islands (VI), and Cat Island (CI) of the United States. The performance of DL-NB was evaluated by empirical method, machine learning method and multilayer perceptron (MLP). The results indicate that the accuracy of the DL-NB is better than comparative methods can in nearshore bathymetry. After quantitative analysis, the RMSE of DL-NB could achieve 1.01 m, 1.80 m and 0.28 m in AB, VI and CI respectively. Given the same data conditions, the proposed method can be applied for high precise global scale and multitemporal nearshore bathymetric maps generation, which are beneficial to marine environmental change assessment and conservation.

TI  - Inter-Calibration Between the Electron Flux Measurements of FengYun-3B and Van Allen Probe-A Based on Electron Phase Space Density Conjunctions
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cross-satellite calibration of energetic particle fluxes is essential to understanding Earth's radiation belt dynamics and modeling the space radiation environment. Using the method of comparing phase space density (PSD) conjunctions in the same set of phase space coordinates, we perform a cross-satellite calibration of energetic electron fluxes measured by the Low Earth Orbit Chinese FengYun-3B satellite (FY-3B) and the near-equatorial Highly Eccentric Orbit Van Allen Probe-A (VAP-A), respectively. VAP-A provides pitch angle resolved electron (directional) differential fluxes while FY-3B provides omnidirectional electron differential fluxes. Before calculating the PSDs from FY-3B high energy electron detector (HEED), a method is introduced to estimate the local pitch angle of FY-3B based on the installation direction information of HEED and the T89c magnetic field model. We calculate the calibration factors by using the PSD conjunctions inferred from the two satellites for three fixed sets of (mu, K, L*) during the geomagnetic storm times. The calibration factors range from 0.76 to 0.86 varying with fixed sets of (mu, K, L*), which indicates that the electron differential fluxes from FY-3B are higher than that from VAP-A. During geomagnetic quiet times, we perform calibration by using independent Gaussian fitting analysis of the number of points with the unaveraged PSDs of FY-3B and VAP-A for three fixed sets of (mu, K, L*), with the corresponding calibration factors of 0.78, 0.72, and 0.46. The calibrated electron differential fluxes of FY-3B measured at the high magnetic latitudes, can be used in the future modeling of the radiation belt electron dynamics.

TI  - In-Flight Cross Radiometric Calibration of DPC/GaoFen-5 and MODIS/Aqua
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The directional polarimetric camera ( DPC) on the GaoFen-5 satellite is not equipped with an on-board calibrator, and thus it requires different alternative methods for the in-flight radiometric calibration. For this purpose, an inflight cross radiometric calibration method is developed, and the real-time surface directional reflectance and spectral response differences are considered to realize the in-flight cross radiometric calibration of DPC/GaoFen-5 and MODIS (moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer)/Aqua. In this method, MODIS/Aqua with a high accuracy on-board calibration ability is selected as the reference sensor, and the observation data over the pseudo-invariant calibration site in North Africa is used. By inputting the real-time satellite bidirectional reflection product and calculating the atmospheric radiative transfer, this paper accurately corrects the apparent radiation deviation caused by the sun-observation geometry and spectral response differences between the two sensors and finally obtains the in-flight cross radiometric calibration coefficient of the sensor to be calibrated. Theoretical analysis results show that the calibration uncertainty of this method is 2. 41%-3. 70% at the non-absorption band of DPC. The preliminary results of the cross radiometric calibration between DPC/GaoFen-5 and MODIS/Aqua show that they have a good radiometric consistency, and the apparent radiation difference of each band is less than 4%.

TI  - A Systematic Review of Morphological Transformation of Urban Open Spaces: Drivers, Trends, and Methods
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Review
AB  - Ongoing urbanization has led to the continuous expansion of built-up areas; as a result, open space is under great threat. Despite the wealth of studies conducted on open spaces, there is still a further need to further investigate the morphology of open space, particularly in an effort to understand the trends and drivers of open space morphological transformation that remain under-researched. Besides, although the previous literature has highlighted several factors influencing urban space morphology, it remains unclear how those key drivers interact. In this article, the PRISMA methodology was used to conduct a systematic literature review, screening and selecting articles from three primary databases (Web of Science, Elsevier, and Scopus). In total, 47 journal articles covering the years 2000 to 2022 were selected for the final review to identify key factors that influence open space morphology, including natural geographical factors, socioeconomic factors, and government policy factors. The results indicate that, as cities developed, the size of green spaces decreased, their structure fragmented, and their distribution became progressively less connected. Meanwhile, socioeconomic determinants played a greater role in influencing changes in green spaces than natural geographical factors and policy management factors. In addition, carrying out the present study confirmed that Landsat remote-sensing data with landscape metrics is a powerful research method for studying green space change. A research framework is offered in this paper to illustrate an understanding of which factors influence the dynamics of green spaces, identify the interaction mechanisms, and provide an optimization strategy of urban open space for urban planners or policymakers.

TI  - PRIMITIVIST TENDENCIES IN THE ART OF SVERDLOVSK - YEKATERINBURG IN THE 1960S-1990S: THE CREATIV-ITY OF THE MEMBERS OF THE ARTISTS' UNION AND INFORMAL ARTISTS
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-KULTUROLOGIYA I ISKUSSTVOVEDENIE-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES AND ART HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to an important period in the art history of Sverdlovsk Yekaterinburg and of the country in general, when the dogmas of socialist realism were ruining and new artistic thinking was forming, noted by bold innovation and at the same time by interest in diverse traditions. The phenomena that represented the local art of the 1960-1990s are considered in the con-text of all-Russian tendencies; during research, the peculiarities of the searches for Ural artists are traced. The author's attention is focused on creativity of members of the Artists' Union, mostly to its "left" wing, and the representatives of an alternative creative environment - informal artists. The formation in the Soviet period of an alternative artistic community not only in the culture of the center - in Moscow and Leningrad, but also in a provincial situation is an independent significant fact. In the text links to the researches connected with studying of this phenomenon, including those initiated by the author of this article are given.The identification of the close tendencies in the art of the Masters of the Artists' Union and in-formal artists, in this case - of appealing to the stylistic of primitive, makes us return to the problem of "convergence" and "divergence" in their searches, which already had been touched upon by scientists. Such "convergences" in practice of official and unofficial art, according to the author, do not belong to the defining features, do not allow to level the existing differences and the borders themselves between the indicated areas. The confirmation of the stated position, which re-quired consideration of the heritage of the local underground and official art, and became the purpose of the research. The lack of special researches close to our topic determines the scientific novelty of this work.The development of primitivistic tendencies in local art is considered on a wide material from the appearance the stylistic of primitive in book illustrations related to the Ural theme, including the tales of Pavel Bazhov, to easel works made in different decades. A circle of topics that are characteristic of official and unofficial art is outlined, special features that are manifested in the works of artists - primitivists are highlighted. On the example of close tendencies the author highlights common features and differences in the creativity of the Masters of the Artists' Union and informal artists.The comparison of creativity of the members of the Artists' Union and informal artists, under-taken in a research, allowed to reveal essential differences in their searches, - in the themes of works, artistic solutions. It is noted that the ideas of the Soviet mentality appear in a smaller measure in the art of informal artists, the theme of "daily occurrence" is more consistently embodied, interest in the "unofficial" Sverdlovsk is manifested in urban motifs, etc. The originality of the artistic solutions inherent to the works of informal artists is associated, inter alia, with their installation on experiment and greater radicalism.The main conclusion of this research is as follows. Behind the closeness of stylistic tendencies in the searches of representatives of official and unofficial art, is manifested more significant differences, arising from their belonging to different artistic areas, different social and creative experience, worldview, which in turn determined and the behavioral strategies.

TI  - Antipredator behaviors in urban settings: Ecological experimentation powered by citizen science
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Animal behaviors are often modified in urban settings due to changes in species assemblages and interactions. The ability of prey to respond to a predator is a critical behavior, but urban populations may experience altered predation pressure, food supplementation, and other human-mediated disturbances that modify their responsiveness to predation risk and promote habituation. Citizen-science programs generally focus on the collection and analysis of observational data (e.g., bird checklists), but there has been increasing interest in the engagement of citizen scientists for ecological experimentation. Our goal was to implement a behavioral experiment in which citizen scientists recorded antipredator behaviors in wild birds occupying urban areas. In North America, increasing populations of Accipiter hawks have colonized suburban and urban areas and regularly prey upon birds that frequent backyard bird feeders. This scenario, of an increasingly common avian predator hunting birds near human dwellings, offers a unique opportunity to characterize antipredator behaviors within urban passerines. For two winters, we engaged citizen scientists in Chicago, IL, USA to deploy a playback experiment and record antipredator behaviors in backyard birds. If backyard birds maintained their antipredator behaviors, we hypothesized that birds would decrease foraging behaviors and increase vigilance in response to a predator cue (hawk playback) but that these responses would be mediated by flock size, presence of sentinel species, body size, tree cover, and amount of surrounding urban area. Using a randomized control-treatment design, citizen scientists at 15 sites recorded behaviors from 3891 individual birds representing 22 species. Birds were more vigilant and foraged less during the playback of a hawk call, and these responses were strongest for individuals within larger flocks and weakest in larger-bodied birds. We did not find effects of sentinel species, tree cover, or urbanization. By deploying a behavioral experiment, we found that backyard birds inhabiting urban landscapes largely maintained antipredator behaviors of increased vigilance and decreased foraging in response to predator cues. Experimentation in citizen science poses challenges (e.g., observation bias, sample size limitations, and reduced complexity in protocol design), but unlike programs focused solely on observational data, experimentation allows researchers to disentangle the complex factors underlying animal behavior and species interactions.

TI  - Flood vulnerable zones mapping using geospatial techniques: Case study of Osogbo Metropolis, Nigeria
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Several Areas within Osogbo, the capital city of Osun State in Nigeria, have suffered severely from inces-sant flood occurrences, which necessitated flood vulnerability mapping. This research aimed to map out flood vulnerable areas within Osogbo Metropolis using geospatial techniques to facilitate fitting planning and proffer lasting solutions to the frequent damage that humans and their properties suffer from flood-ing within the city. Satellite data of Osogbo Metropolis were processed and analyzed in a GIS environ-ment for flood vulnerable zones mapping. Eight (8) flood causative factors were combined in this study using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The factors are Stream Proximity (SP), Drainage Density (DD), Elevation, Slope, Stream Power Index (SPI), Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Land Use/Land Cover (LULC). Results revealed that approxi-mately 24% of the total area of study falls within the high flood vulnerable zones, while 21% and 55% fall within the moderate and low flood vulnerable zones, respectively. A close agreement between the flood vulnerable zones and previous flood incidences across the study area established the accuracy of the methodology. This study's established flood vulnerable zones will guide the respective policymakers dur -ing discussions on preventing flood disasters within the Osogbo metropolis.

TI  - Aerosol characterisation in the subtropical eastern North Atlantic region using long-term AERONET measurements
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - A comprehensive characterisation of atmospheric aerosols in the subtropical eastern North Atlantic has been carried out using long-term ground-based Aerosol Robotic NETwork (AERONET) photometric observations over the period 2005-2020 from a unique network made up of four stations strategically located from sea level to 3555m on the island of Tenerife. This site can be considered a sentinel for the passage of airmasses going to Europe from Africa, and therefore the aerosol characterisation performed here adds important information for analysing their evolution during their path toward Northern Europe. Two of these stations (Santa Cruz de Tenerife - SCO - at sea level and La Laguna - LLO - at 580ma.s.l.) are located within the marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL), and the other two (Izana - IZO - at 2373ma.s.l. and Teide Peak - TPO - at 3555ma.s.l.) are high mountain stations within the free troposphere (FT). Monthly climatology of the aerosol optical depth (AOD), Angstrom exponent (AE), aerosol concentration, size distribution and aerosol optical properties has been obtained for the MABL and FT. Measurements that are quite consistent across the four sites have been used to categorise the main atmospheric scenarios, and these measurements confirm an alternation between predominant background conditions and predominant dust-loaded Saharan air mass conditions caused by seasonal dust transport over the subtropical North Atlantic. Background conditions prevail in the MABL and FT for most of the year, while dust-laden conditions dominate in July and August.The MABL under background conditions appears as a well-mixed layer with a low aerosol concentration (the volume concentration, VolCon, ranges from 0.02 +/- 0.01 to 0.04 +/- 0.02 mu m(3) mu m(-2)), a predominance of coarse-mode marine aerosols (the effective radius, R-eff, changes from 1.60 +/- 0.19 to 1.91 +/- 0.34 mu m), and a volume contribution of the fine-mode fraction Vf/Vt < 0 :35. The clean FT is characterised by remarkably low aerosol loading and a predominant impact of fine-mode aerosols throughout the year ( Vf/Vt has a maximum value of 0.93 +/- 0.13), with an average R-eff of 0.16 +/- 0.02 mu m. However, under dust-laden conditions and mainly in summer, we observe a predominance of coarse-mode aerosols with maximum VolCon values of 0.26 +/- 0.23 mu m(3) mu m(-2) for the MABL and 0.16 +/- 0.12 (0.06 +/- 0.05) mu m(3) mu m(-2) for IZO (TPO), and a similar and quite consistent fine-mode fraction of 0.12 +/- 0.03 in the vertical within the MABL and FT. Similarities in micro-physical and optical intensive aerosol properties confirm that the Saharan Air Layer (SAL) is a well-mixed layer in terms of the particulate composition. An estimation of the difference in the aerosol loading in the 1 km layer between IZO and TPO (in terms of VolCon and AOD) is performed in this study, and this shows that aerosol loading at IZO is double that at TPO, but they have similar fine-mode fractions, effective radii and intensive optical properties. The long-term trend analysis at SCO shows a significant negative trend in the fine-mode AOD between 2005 and 2020 ( -1.8 +/- 0.5) x 10(-5) yr(-1), which might be linked to the large reduction in oil-refining SO2 emissions from the SCO refinery in 2012.

TI  - Detecting slow-moving landslides using InSAR phase-gradient stacking and deep-learning network
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are a major geohazard that endangers human lives and properties. Recently, efforts have been made to use Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) for landslide monitoring. However, it is still difficult to effectively and automatically identify slow-moving landslides distributed over a large area due to phase unwrapping errors, decorrelation, troposphere turbulence and computational requirements. In this study, we develop a new approach combining phase-gradient stacking and a deep-learning network based on YOLOv3 to automatically detect slow-moving landslides from large-scale interferograms. Using Sentinel-1 SAR images acquired from 2014 to 2020, we developed a burst-based, phase-gradient stacking algorithm to sum up phase gradients in short-temporal-baseline interferograms along the azimuth and range directions. The stacked phase gradients clearly reveal the characteristics of localized surface deformation that is mainly caused by slow-moving landslides and avoids the errors due to phase unwrapping in partially decorrelated areas and atmospheric effects. Then, we trained the improved Attention-YOLOv3 network with stacked phase-gradient maps of manually labeled landslides to achieve quick and automatic detection. We applied our method in an similar to 180,000 km(2) area of southwestern China and identified 3,366 slow-moving landslides. By comparing the results with optical imagery and previously published landslides in this region, the proposed method can achieve automatic detection over a large area precisely and efficiently. From the derived landslide density map, we determined that most landslides are distributed along the three large rivers and their branches. In addition to some counties with known high-density landslides, approximately 10 more counties with high landslide density were exposed, which should attract more attention to their risks for geohazards. This application demonstrates the potential value of our newly developed method for slow-moving landslide detection over a nation-wide area, which can be employed before applying more time-consuming time-series InSAR analysis.

TI  - Osmotic adjustment, production, and post-harvest quality of mini watermelon genotypes differing in salt tolerance
T2  - SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE
M3  - Article
AB  - The mini watermelon is a crop with high yield potential in the Brazilian semiarid region; however, some problems, such as the salinity of irrigation water, can cause physiological and biochemical changes in the species, compromising production and post-harvest quality of the fruits. In the present study, two genotypes of mini watermelon (Citrullus lanatus L.) cultivated in a hydroponic system were evaluated for the effects of nutrient solution salinity on yield, fruit quality, and solutes content. The experimental design used was completely randomized, in a factorial scheme (5 x 2), with four replicates, each consisting of three plants. The mini watermelon genotypes 'Champagne' (CP) and 'Fancy' (FY) were cultivated in nutrient solutions with different electrical conductivity levels -ECsol (2.5 -control, 3.5, 4.5, 5.5, and 6.5 dS m-1). Production components, post-harvest variables of fruit quality and the contents of organic and inorganic solutes were evaluated. The increase in ECsol reduced the production variables, with the emphasis on the CP genotype, which stood out for comparatively mall production losses (45% -fruit mass); being considered tolerant to salt stress when compared to FY (57% -fruit mass). Fruit production showed a linear decrease, with a salinity threshold at 2.5 dS m-1 in both genotypes. The salinity increased the contents of total soluble solids (TSS) in both genotypes: for 9.5 to 10.6 Brix (11.6%) in the CP genotype and from 9.7 to 12.1 Brix (24.7%) in the FY. Contents of organic and inorganic solutes, except proline, can act as indicator for the selection of salinity-tolerant mini watermelon genotypes. Despite the changes induced by salt stress in the physicochemical characteristics, the fruits remained within acceptable commercial standards for both genotypes. The FY genotype, though salt-sensitive is more suitable for hydroponic cultivation up to ECsol of 4.5 dS m-1, and both the genotypes can be used in systems up to with ECsol 6.5 dSm- 1.

TI  - Combining community observations and remote sensing to examine the effects of roads on wildfires in the East Siberian boreal forest
T2  - ARCTIC SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper is aimed at assessing the associations between the road networks geography and dynamics of wildfire events in the East Siberian boreal forest. We examined the relationship between the function of roads, their use, and management and the wildfire ignition, propagation, and termination during the catastrophic fire season of 2016 in the Irkutsk Region of Russia. Document analysis and interviews were utilized to identify main forest users and road infrastructure functional types and examine wildfire management practices. We combined community observations and satellite remotely sensed data to assess relationships between the location, extent, and timing of wildfires and different types of roads as fire sources, barriers, and suppression access points. Our study confirms a strong spatial relationship between the wildfire ignition points and roads differentiated by their types with the highest probability of fire ignition near forestry roads and the lowest near subsistence roads. Roads also play an important role in wildfire suppression, working as both physical barriers and access points for firefighters. Our research illustrates the importance of local and Indigenous observations along the roads for monitoring and understanding wildfires, including "zombie fires". It also has practical implications for fire management collectively developed by authorities and local communities.

TI  - Analysis of Vegetable Waste Pollution Risk and Resource Potential Based on Geographical Information System and Remote Sensing
T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land resources are an important foundation for human survival and development. In recent years, land resources have experienced rapid industrialization and urbanization. With the expansion of urban construction land and the sharp decline of natural and agricultural landscapes, ecological and social problems have gradually surfaced. Based on the intuitive interpretation of LandsatTM/ETM +/OLI image data from 2016 to 2020, this work created an annual land use reference database. The use of resources and the recovery of nutrients from vegetable waste are necessary measures to achieve sustainable and environmentally friendly agriculture. Collecting and analyzing data from the literature are to determine the risk of vegetable waste pollution and the possibility of resource utilization. The amount of vegetable waste produced and the total amount of nitrogen, total phosphorus, and total potassium pollution in the study area are estimated, and ArcGIS is used to characterize TN (total nitrogen) and TP (total phosphorus). The spatial distribution of TK (total potassium) pollution intensity and pollution risk comprehensive index determines the key areas of vegetable waste nonpoint source pollution control in the region and compares the resource utilization potential of vegetable waste based on the demand for fertilizer. This paper combines the research of the subject; takes cultivated land as the research object; clarifies the main pollutants, contaminated area, content, and distribution of cultivated land; uses factor analysis method to conduct a preliminary study on the causes of heavy metal contaminated soil in the study area; and adopts a source-sink balance model, analyze the cumulative characteristics of soil pollution. Based on geographical information system (GIS) and remote sensing technology, this paper investigates the risk assessment of vegetable waste pollution and discusses the analysis of resource potential.

TI  - Evaluating GOES-16 ABI surface brightness temperature observation biases over the central Sierra Nevada of California
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermal infrared imagery from NOAA's Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) R-series presents an opportunity to observe mountain surface temperatures at high temporal resolution. These observations are needed to better understand the transient surface energy balance, influenced by near-surface air temperatures and water fluxes ranging from evapotranspiration to snowmelt. From geostationary orbit, the GOES Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) instrument views the Earth from a fixed longitude above the equator. ABI images therefore have increasingly off-nadir view angles and increasingly larger pixel dimensions the further a point on the Earth's surface is from the sub-satellite point. In thermal infrared imagery from ABI, these 2+ km pixels blur together the different surface temperatures of heterogeneous mountain landscapes. We compared GOES-16 ABI band 14 (11.2 mu m) brightness temperatures to 90 m spatial resolution ASTER band 14 (11.3 mu m) and 1 km spatial resolution MODIS band 31 (11.03 mu m) brightness temperatures and investigated how differences change over space and time for a study region in the central Sierra Nevada of California for the 2017-2020 snow seasons. We demonstrated the necessity of orthorectifying ABI imagery of mountain terrain to correct for the parallax effect in off-nadir imagery. This reduced the mean difference between ABI and ASTER similar to 11 mu m brightness temperatures from 1.6 degrees C to 1.0 degrees C and increased the r-squared value between ABI and ASTER thermal infrared brightness temperatures from 0.43 to 0.93. The ABI brightness temperatures were found to more closely match those of forest canopy temperatures than snow surface (with RMS differences of 1.2 degrees C and 3.0 degrees C respectively), and those of sunlit slopes as opposed to slopes facing away from the sun (with RMS differences of 1.6 degrees C and 3.4 degrees C respectively), in coincident ASTER imagery. This work demonstrates the use of GOES ABI, and associated challenges, for observing surface temperatures of forested mountain environments with seasonal snow.

TI  - Direct Shock Experience vs. Tangential Shock Exposure: Indirect Effects of Flood Shocks on Well-Being and Preferences
T2  - WORLD BANK ECONOMIC REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - With extreme weather events on the rise, the question of how witnessing adverse weather events may affect individuals' perception, and consequently their subjective well-being, gains in relevance. To identify events that have been witnessed, i.e., tangential exposure to a weather shock, satellite-based data on flooding is linked to an extensive household panel survey from rural Southeast Asia. Contrasting direct shock experience with tangential shock exposure, we find that mere proximity to a potentially adverse shock, without reporting any actual direct shock experience, could be sufficient to reduce subjective well-being. This effect is not only restricted to the present but can also impinge on expected future well-being dynamics. Eventually, such a persistent effect from witnessing a weather shock may have further politico-economic repercussions, for instance, by altering support for redistribution policies.

TI  - Evaluation of decadal land degradation dynamics in old coal mine areas of Central India
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study attempts to understand land use land cover change dynamics in an area subjected to opencast and underground coal mining for the last few decades in Kotma Coalmines of Anuppur District in Madhya Pradesh, India through geospatial techniques. Land use and land cover (LULC) change detection analysis was performed digitally classifying LANDSAT-5 (2001) as well as LANDSAT-8 (2020) satellite data using a maximum likelihood algorithm. Results revealed that area under dense native vegetation decreased drastically (by 13.74 km(2)) with the gradual and consistent expansion in the activities of coal mines which showed the highest increase in area over time (15.84 km(2)). Bivariate regression analysis showed the positive empirical relationships between vegetation indices and soil physico-chemical parameters. Studies suggested that soil and vegetation is degraded over the large mining areas consistently over a long time period. Despite the continuous reforestation activities on mined areas, the decline area under dense vegetation and sparse vegetation over the twenty-year time-scale indicates that the reclamation activities are still in its infancy. A land degradation vulnerability Index (LDVI) map was generated to understand the extent of decadal land degradation trends and it shows that 8.60% of the area is highly vulnerable to degradation. The land degradation index (LDI) inputs will help the planners to develop alternate strategies to tackle vulnerability zones for safe mining. Monthly estimation of various meteorological parameters was also recorded to generate heat plots for the period 2001-2020. The study concludes that monitoring and assessment of fragile ecosystems are indispensable for holistic environmental management.

TI  - Experimental Exposure to Tebuconazole Affects Metabolism and Body Condition in a Passerine Bird, the House Sparrow (<i>Passer domesticus</i>)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Triazole compounds are among the most widely used fungicides in agroecosystems to protect crops from potential fungal diseases. Triazoles are suspected to have an impact on nontarget species due to their interactions with nonfungal sterol synthesis, and wild birds are likely to be contaminated by triazole fungicides because many of them live in agroecosystems. We experimentally tested whether exposure to environmental concentrations of a triazole could alter key integrative traits (metabolic rates and body condition) of an agroecosystem sentinel species, the house sparrow (Passer domesticus). Wild-caught adult sparrows were maintained in captivity and exposed (exposed group) or not (control group) for 7 continuous months to tebuconazole through drinking water. The metabolic rates of exposed and control sparrows were then measured at two different temperatures (12 degrees C and 25 degrees C), which correspond, respectively, to the thermoregulation and thermoneutrality temperatures of this species. We found that exposed sparrows had lower resting metabolic rates (i.e., measured at thermoneutrality, 25 degrees C) than controls. However, the thermoregulatory metabolic rates (i.e., measured at 12 degrees C) did not differ between exposed and control sparrows. Although the body mass and condition were not measured at the beginning of the exposure, sparrows at the time of the metabolic measurements 7 months after the onset of such exposure had a higher body condition than controls, supporting further the idea that tebuconazole affects metabolic functions. Our study demonstrates for the first time that the use of tebuconazole can alter metabolism and could potentially lead to adverse effects in birds. Environ Toxicol Chem 2022;00:1-12. (c) 2022 SETAC

TI  - Research on temporal and spatial evolution of land use and landscape pattern in Anshan City based on GEE
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Frequent mining activities can bring about problems such as soil erosion and environmental pollution, which are detrimental to the efficient use of land and the sustainable development of cities. Existing studies have paid little attention to mining areas and lack comparative analysis of landscape changes in multiple mining pits. In this paper, the main urban area of Anshan City, where the mining areas are concentrated, was used as the research area, and the Landsat TM/OLI surface reflectance (SR) data of the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform and the random forest algorithm were used to map the land use in 2008, 2014, and 2020. On this basis, land use dynamics and landscape pattern indices were used to analyze the changes in land use and landscape patterns in the Anshan City area. In addition, a moving window method was combined to further analyze and compare the landscape changes between different pits. The results show that:1. From 2008 to 2020, the construction land in Anshan urban area continued to decline, the forest land continued to expand, and the construction land was shifted to the forest land and cultivated land. Mining land increased before 2014 and remained almost unchanged after 2014, which is in line with the actual situation. 2. During the study period, the landscape fragmentation degree and landscape heterogeneity in the urban area of Anshan kept increasing. The high value areas of landscape fragmentation were the urban-rural combination areas and the mining areas. Among them, the reclamation of Dagushan and Donganshan is better, while the reclamation of Anqian, Yanqianshan and Xiaolingzi mines needs to be strengthened. 3. The random forest algorithm based on GEE shows a high degree of accuracy for land use classification. The overall classification accuracy in 3 years exceeds 90% and the kappa coefficient exceeds 0.85. The study results can be used as an essential reference for optimizing the urban ecological environment and provide technical backing for the urbanization construction and rational use of land in Anshan City.

TI  - Nomogram models for stratified prediction of axillary lymph node metastasis in breast cancer patients (cN0)
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENDOCRINOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectivesTo determine the predictors of axillary lymph node metastasis (ALNM), two nomogram models were constructed to accurately predict the status of axillary lymph nodes (ALNs), mainly high nodal tumour burden (HNTB, > 2 positive lymph nodes), low nodal tumour burden (LNTB, 1-2 positive lymph nodes) and negative ALNM (N0). Accordingly, more appropriate treatment strategies for breast cancer patients without clinical ALNM (cN0) could be selected. MethodsFrom 2010 to 2015, a total of 6314 patients with invasive breast cancer (cN0) were diagnosed in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database and randomly assigned to the training and internal validation groups at a ratio of 3:1. As the external validation group, data from 503 breast cancer patients (cN0) who underwent axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University between January 2011 and December 2020 were collected. The predictive factors determined by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to construct the nomograms. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and calibration plots were used to assess the prediction models' discrimination and calibration. ResultsUnivariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that tumour size, primary site, molecular subtype and grade were independent predictors of both ALNM and HNTB. Moreover, histologic type and age were independent predictors of ALNM and HNTB, respectively. Integrating these independent predictors, two nomograms were successfully developed to accurately predict the status of ALN. For nomogram 1 (prediction of ALNM), the areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve in the training, internal validation and external validation groups were 0.715, 0.688 and 0.876, respectively. For nomogram 2 (prediction of HNTB), the areas under the ROC curve in the training, internal validation and external validation groups were 0.842, 0.823 and 0.862. The above results showed a satisfactory performance. ConclusionWe established two nomogram models to predict the status of ALNs (N0, 1-2 positive ALNs or >2 positive ALNs) for breast cancer patients (cN0). They were well verified in further internal and external groups. The nomograms can help doctors make more accurate treatment plans, and avoid unnecessary surgical trauma.

TI  - A machine learning approach to mapping canopy gaps in an indigenous tropical submontane forest using WorldView-3 multispectral satellite imagery
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Selective logging in tropical forests may lead to deforestation and forest degradation, so accurate mapping of it will assist in forest restoration, among other ecological applications. This study aimed to track canopy tree loss due to illegal logging of the important hardwood tree Ocotea usambarensis in a closed-canopy submontane tropical forest by evaluating the mapping potential of the very-high-resolution WorldView-3 multispectral dataset using random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) with radial basis function kernel classifiers. The results show average overall accuracies of 92.3 +/- 2.6% and 94.0 +/- 2.1% for the RF and SVM models, respectively. Average kappa coefficients were 0.88 +/- 0.03 for RF and 0.90 +/- 0.02 for SVM. The user's and producer's accuracies for both classifiers were in the range of 84-100%. This study further indicates that vegetation indices derived from bands 5 and 6 helped detect canopy gaps in the study area. Both variable importance measurement in the RF algorithm and pairwise feature selection proved useful in identifying the most pertinent variables in the classification of canopy gaps. These findings could allow forest managers to improve methods of detecting canopy gaps at larger scales using remote sensing data and relatively little additional fieldwork.

TI  - Modeling the sea-surface <i>p</i>CO<i>2</i> of the central Bay of Bengal region using machine learning algorithms
T2  - OCEAN MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study explores the capabilities of advanced machine learning algorithms in predicting the sea -surface pCO(2 )(partial pressure of carbon dioxide) in the open oceans of the Bay of Bengal (BoB). We collect the available observations (outside EEZ (Exclusive Economic Zone)) from the cruise tracks and the mooring stations. Due to the paucity of data in the BoB, we attempt to predict pCO(2 )based on the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and the Sea Surface Salinity (SSS). Comparing the MLR, the ANN, and the XGBoost algorithm against a common dataset reveals that the XGBoost performs the best for predicting the sea-surface pCO(2 )in the BoB. Using the satellite-derived SST and SSS, we predict the sea-surface pCO(2) using the XGBoost model and compare the same with the in-situ observations. The model performs satisfactorily, having a correlation of 0.75 and the RMSE of +/- 12.23 mu atm. Further using this model, we emulate the monthly variations in the sea-surface pCO(2) for the central BoB between 2010-2019. Using the satellite data, we show that the central BoB is warming at a rate of 0.0175 ?C per year, whereas the SSS decreases at a rate of-0.0088 PSU per year. The modeled pCO(2 )shows a declination at a rate of -0.4852 mu atm per year. We perform sensitivity experiments to find that the variations in SST and SSS contribute asymptotic to 41% and asymptotic to 37% to the declining trends of the pCO(2 )for the last decade. Seasonal analysis shows that the pre-monsoon season has the highest rate of decrease of the sea-surface pCO(2).

TI  - Spaceborne InSAR mapping of landslides and subsidence in rapidly deglaciating terrain, Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve and vicinity, Alaska and British Columbia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Glacier Bay area in southeastern Alaska and British Columbia, encompassing Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve, has experienced rapid glacier retreat since the end of the Little Ice Age in the mid-1800s. The impact that rapid deglaciation has had on the slope stability of valley walls and on the sedimentation of fans and deltas adjacent to fjords and inlets is an ongoing research topic. Using 3-year (2018-2020) Sentinel-1 datasets, and an automated time-series persistent scatterer interferometric synthetic aperture radar (PSInSAR) processing method, we detected landslides or delta subsidence at 27 sites within a vast 180 x 180 km remote region encompassing Glacier Bay proper. Most of the sites that we identified had not been previously identified. We categorized the hazard source areas that we identified into three general types:1) slow-moving landslides on steep rocky slopes not near (> 2 km away from) present-day glacier termini (e.g., Tidal Inlet landslide), 2) slow -moving landslides directly adjacent to (< 2 km away from), and associated with glacier thinning and retreat, and 3) subsidence of glacial outwash fan deltas. In categories 1 and 2, we observed 22 landslides moving at velocities ranging from 0.5 to 4 cm/yr. In category 3, we detected five fan deltas subsiding at velocities ranging from 0.5 to 6 cm/yr. Within our measurement error, these velocities were consistent during the monitoring period. Because acceleration was not observed, the issuance of warnings of imminent rapid failure is not warranted, however, continued remote monitoring is warranted. Our interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) results could be combined with other data sets including field observations, subaerial and submarine landslide inventories, bedrock fabric mapping from newly available light detection and ranging (lidar) data, and geologic maps to produce an inherent susceptibility map for landslides in bedrock and fan deltas. This map could be used to forecast susceptibility for both earthquake and climatically induced landslides.

TI  - Influences of tropical monsoon and El Nino Southern Oscillations on surface chlorophyll-a variability in the Gulf of Thailand
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the seasonal variability of surface chlorophyll-a (chl-a) and the influence of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) related to environmental parameters in the Gulf of Thailand (GoT). Monthly chl-a data from MODIS from 2002 to 2020 as well as sea surface temperature (SST), wind, precipitation, and river discharge were used in this analysis. Results from seasonal climatology and Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) described high chl-a concentration areas along the western to the southern coasts and near Ca Mau Cape during the northeast monsoon (NEM), and the upper GoT (UGoT), eastern coast, and the GoT mouth during the southwest monsoon (SWM), while low chl-a took place during the non-monsoon (NON). The GoT was divided into six areas based on the EOFs of chl-a, and then the correlation between chl-a variability and environmental parameters was also examined. The results suggested that chl-a in coastal and offshore areas were controlled by different mechanisms. Chl-a in coastal areas responded to precipitation and river discharge as well as the shoreward wind; meanwhile, chl-a in offshore areas correlated with SST and wind magnitude indicating the importance of water mixing and upwelling. The fluctuation of chl-a in each season related to ENSO was captured by EOF based on the seasonal anomaly. The influence of ENSO was strong during NEM and NON but minimal during SWM. El Nino/La Nina generally caused low/high precipitation and high/low SST. Moreover, El Nino/La Nina caused anomalously weak/strong wind during NEM contrary to during NON. Anomalous high/low chl-a were observed in shallow regions during El Nino/La Nina corresponding to strong/weak wind in NON. Abnormal wind under ENSO also created the shifting in the high chl-a area near Ca Mau Cape. These results have improved our understanding of monsoons and ENSO variabilities as the crucial drivers of changes in the tropical marine ecosystem in both seasonal and interannual time scales.

TI  - Mapping of mafic-ultramafic rocks in SMUC-SGT, India using ASTER & Sentinel-2A satellite images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Salem Mafic-Ultramafic Complex (SMUC) is a major complex in southern Granulite Terrane (SGT), in the northern part of the Cauvery Suture Zone (CSZ), India, also known as the Chalk Hills of Salem. The present study aims to review the efficiency of satellite image processing and related techniques to map the Mafic-Ultramafic rocks in Salem Mafic-Ultramafic Complex (SMUC). This mapping is done using atmospherically corrected Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and Sentinel-2A satellite image data. The processes employed were image enhancement techniques like Band Combinations (BC), Principal Component Analy-sis (PCA), and Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) to map the various rock types. Band combinations constructed from the output of PCA and MNF in RGB format showed promising results in discrim-inating various rock units. The Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifications techniques were used to classify ASTER and Sentinel-2A satellite images for the study area. The classified lithologies showed strong match with the lithology map published by the Geological Survey of India (GSI), other researches, and field investigation. Particularly, SVM classification of Sentinel-2A MNF + DEM showed 90% overall accuracy when compared with field investigation. The study proved that the processing of VNIR and SWIR bands of ASTER and Sentinel-2A Satellite images coupled with DEM and ground investigation has excellent potential in mapping Mafic-Ultramafic rocks in SMUC SGT.

TI  - How does social complexity facilitate coping flexibility? The mediating role of dialectical thinking
T2  - ANXIETY STRESS AND COPING
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and objective : Past research has shown that worldviews can influence coping strategies but coping is often regarded as a stable person-based behavioral characteristic. The present research aims to examine how one component of worldviews - social complexity - influences the flexibility of coping strategies across situations.Design: In two cross-sectional studies and one prospective study, we tested a mediation model in which the perceived complexity of the social world (i.e., social complexity) predicted coping flexibility through dialectical thinking.Results: Across three studies, social complexity consistently facilitated dialectical thinking, which in turn fostered the cross-situational flexibility of coping strategies at a single time point and over 12 months.Conclusions: Believing in complex causes of phenomena and multiple solutions to problems facilitates a cognitive style of viewing issues from multiple perspectives and tolerating contradictions, which are conducive to the flexible evaluation and implementation of effective strategies to cope with problems. Theoretical and practical implications of the present research are discussed.

TI  - Omission of axillary surgery for ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence with negative nodes after previous breast-conserving surgery: is it oncologically safe?
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Salvage mastectomy is traditionally recommended for patients who developed ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) in light of previous breast irradiation. However, it remains controversial whether surgical axillary staging (SAS) is necessary for IBTR patients with negative nodes. This study aimed to evaluate the oncologic safety of omitting SAS for IBTR. Methods We retrospectively identified patients who developed invasive IBTR with negative nodes after undergoing breast-conserving surgery (BCS) from 2010 to 2018. Patterns of care in nodal staging were analyzed based on prior axillary staging status. Clinicopathologic characteristics and adjuvant treatment of the initial tumor, as well as the IBTR, were compared between the SAS and no SAS groups. Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression model were utilized to compare the locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRRFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and overall survival (OS) rates after IBTR removal between the two groups. Results A total of 154 IBTR patients were eligible for final analysis. Compared to the no SAS group, SAS group was less likely to undergo ALND (15.1 vs 73.3%, p < 0.001) at initial BCS, had a longer recurrence interval (2.8 vs 2.1 years, p = 0.03), and were more likely to have discordant molecular subtype (35.8 vs 12.9%, p = 0.001) and different quadrant location (37.7 vs 19.8%, p = 0.02) with primary tumor. However, the extent of axillary staging did not affect systemic or radiation recommendations. In the subgroup of patients without previous ALND, the clinicopathologic characteristics were roughly comparable. No significant differences were observed in LRRFS, DMFS or OS between the two groups. Conclusion For node-negative IBTR patients, we observed selection bias on the basis of prior ALND, shorter recurrence interval, and concordant molecular subtype favoring no SAS but comparable LRRFS, DMFS, and OS. These results support a wider consideration of sparing SAS in the management of IBTR, especially in patients without previous ALND.

TI  - Satellite multispectral indices to estimate canopy parameters and within-field management zones in super-intensive almond orchards
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuous canopy status monitoring is an essential factor to support and precisely apply orchard management actions such as pruning, pesticide and foliar treatment applications, or fertirrigation, among others. For that, this work proposes the use of multispectral vegetation indices to estimate geometric and structural orchard parameters from remote sensing images (high temporal and spatial resolution) as an alternative to more time-consuming processing techniques, such as LiDAR surveys or UAV photogrammetry. A super-intensive almond (Prunus dulcis) orchard was scanned using a mobile terrestrial laser (LiDAR) in two different vegetative stages (after spring pruning and before harvesting). From the LiDAR point cloud, canopy orchard parameters, including maximum height and width, cross-sectional area and porosity, were summarized every 0.5 m along the rows and interpolated using block kriging to the pixel centroids of PlanetScope (3 x 3 m) and Sentinel-2 (10 x 10 m) image grids. To study the association between the LiDAR-derived parameters and 4 different vegetation indices. A canonical correlation analysis was carried out, showing the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI) to have the best correlations. A cluster analysis was also performed. Results can be considered optimistic both for PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 images to delimit within-field management zones, being supported by significant differences in LiDAR-derived canopy parameters.

TI  - Spatiotemporal changes in tropospheric nitrogen dioxide hotspot due to emission switch-off condition in the view of lockdown emergency in India
T2  - AIR QUALITY ATMOSPHERE AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The COVID-19 outbreak has elicited forced lockdown conditions for all anthropogenic emissions across the globe. It has brought an opportunity for the researchers to sort out the relative contribution of the environmental pollutants which are emerged from the coal-based thermal power plants and other industrial sectors. In countries like India, some industrial sectors and thermal power plants coexist; henceforth, they mutually produce NO2 concentration canopy in the upper atmosphere in raised form. Focusing on this issue, the present work intends to explore the NO2 emission hot-spots' foci using switch-off conditions in consequence of emergency lockdown. Our results indicate that stable (CV (low) and NO2(max)) and large NO2 concentration canopy is noticeable in the inter-state border areas among Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and Jharkhand (around "Govind Ballabh Part Sagar" reservoir) where a cluster of thermal power plant is located. The "OFF" situation also proposes a close correspondence between the NO2 richness column and installed capacity (R-2 value > 0.7 with 0.0002 p value). States that are situated in the eastern part of the country and megacities like Delhi and Kolkata represent a crucial role in NO2 emission while in certain regions of south India are more or less safe from NO2 emission. As a consequence, the lockdown has created a temporary pollution baseline for tropospheric NO2 that offers research prospects to think of alternate sources of energy that can maintain environmental health as well as human well-being.

TI  - Impact of urbanization on land surface temperature and surface urban heat Island using optical remote sensing data: A case study of Jeju Island, Republic of Korea
T2  - BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization changes the existing form of land use and cover (LULC) which can influence the land surface temperature (LST). Therefore, it is important to present the causes of urban heat island (UHI) which is usually linked with anthropogenic activities. There are very few studies on thermal behavior of Korean cities in litera-ture. Hence, in this study we have estimated the LULC of Jeju island and analyzed LST using Landsat (TM/ ETM+/OLI) images for the last two decades. The supervised image classification method employed with maximum likelihood classifier algorithm was used to classify the images and thermal band was used to calculate the LST. We have used simplified urban extent (SUE) algorithm to calculate the surface urban heat island (SUHI) and eventually we have correlated the SUHI with mean wind speed of Jeju Island. The results of LULC revealed that urban area increased from 8.69% in 2002 to 20.81% in 2021 and in this period barren land decreased by 34.88% due to urban expansion. Interestingly forest region has been slightly increased which is influenced by decreasing barren land. The accuracy was assessed using confusion matrix for the classified images and results revealed an overall accuracy of 0.87, 0.85 and 0.92 with kappa coefficient of 79.02%, 76.45% and 88.05% for the years of 2002, 2011, and 2021 respectively. The LST of all LULC classes were calculated which revealed the highest temperature for urban class which is followed by barren land. However, the forest cover and water body have the lowest temperature in the island. The intensity of surface urban heat island (SUHI) was increased from 2.47 C (2002) to 3.10 C (2021). We have correlated the wind speed and SUHI which revealed that SUHI and wind speed has inverse relationship. The outcome of this research can be utilized by the policymakers, urban planners, architects, and climatologist to develop policy related to climate-resilient cities.

TI  - Analysis of land use and land cover changes and their impact on temperature using landsat satellite imageries
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban growth and the changing scenario of Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) have been an increasing trend in both towns and cities. The higher rate of transformation from non-built up land to the impervious area becomes a warning symbol of Land surface temperature variations. In this study, an attempt has been made to determine the transition of natural land area and its impact on Land surface temperature (LST) in Vellore district, Tamil Nadu, India. According to the current statistics, the study area records the hottest climate crossing 40 degrees mark in recent years. This is mainly due to the minimum rainfall, the ground level is 200 m just above the sea level, and the pollution caused by tanneries. Landsat imageries are collected for three different years 1994, 2002, and 2018 that map the LULC into agricultural, water bodies, built-up land, and barren land classes. The major purpose of this research is to (i) analyze changes of LULC in and around Vellore city, (ii) categorize the images into various classes like vegetative and non-vegetative land, (iii) Assessment of Spatio-temporal variations in LST and link with classes and urbanization growth using satellite images. The LULC impact on LST is analyzed with the widely used Getis-Ord statistics. The simulation result shows that the built-up area raises to 81%, vegetation land decline by about -65% for the years 1994-2018 respectively. It is observed that LST has attained the highest degree in the built-up class due to the unplanned LULC changes and the conversion of built-up areas. The overall accuracy is achieved at about 92, 89, and 91% for three different years respectively. Based on the obtained result, this can be adopted for the development of rural, and urban areas in the coming future.

TI  - Satellite retrieval of oceanic particulate organic nitrogen concentration
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past several decades, satellite ocean color remote sensing has greatly improved our understanding of the biogeochemical properties of the global ocean. Particulate organic nitrogen (PON) refers to the nitrogen contained in biological or other debris particles, and it plays important roles in the ecosystem functions and biogeochemical processes of the marine biology. However, few studies have focused on the satellite retrieval of oceanic PON concentrations. With an attempt to fill the gap, this study aimed to explore the feasibility of retrieving oceanic PON concentrations from remote sensing data, determine the bio-optical proxies for satellite PON retrievals, and develop satellite oceanic PON retrieval models for the global ocean. In situ PON data collected over the global ocean and Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Level-3 products were used. Three different types of models were tested: (1) apparent optical property (AOP)-based models, 2) inherent optical property (IOP)-based models, and 3) biological property-based models. Results showed that ocean color remote sensing could be used for oceanic PON concentration retrieval in the global ocean, and AOP-based models calibrated produced better fitting performance than the other two types; models based on blue-to-green band ratio (BG) and normalized difference nitrogen index (NDNI) produced comparable and better fitting and validation performance; and IOP-based and biological property-based models produced lower but also acceptable performance. With the PON models developed, the monthly variations of PON concentrations in the global ocean were also explored. In further studies, PON models will be used to explore oceanic PON spatiotemporal variations and the underlying driving forces.

TI  - Cyanobacteria bloom hazard function and preliminary application in lake taihu, China
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, due to the intensification of human activities, water ecological problems are gradually increasing. As the third largest freshwater lake in China, Lake Taihu is an important drinking water source for several densely populated cities in China. The prominent water ecological problem in this area is mainly Cya-nobacteria Bloom. Cyanobacterial blooms have been erupting which have affected local residents' drinking water and caused losses to the national economy. Based on the interpretation results of MODIS data in the Lake Taihu region from 2004 to 2014, this paper analyzes the main driving factors of cyanobacterial bloom are phosphorus and potassium through the correlation analysis of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and cyanobacteria area, normalizes nutrient, and identifies that the water level of Lake Taihu is the influencing factor of cyanobacterial bloom. A Lake Taihu cyanobacteria bloom hazard function is constructed to quantitatively assess the losses (economic losses) caused by cyanobacterial blooms from 2001 to 2012, supporting for cyanobacteria control management in Lake Taihu.

TI  - Satellite derived bathymetry based on ICESat-2 diffuse attenuation signal without prior information
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Bathymetric information is critical for environmental monitoring and maintenance of marine safety. The signal received by passive optical remote sensors contains the reflectance information from the seabed, which then forms the informational basis of bathymetry; however, passive optical bathymetry models often require partial prior information. Although spaceborne active lidar has been shown to accurately detect bathymetry within narrow range of tracks, for some small islands or coastal sites, these tracks may not accurately traverse the shallow ocean area. To this end, a satellite derived bathymetry method based on ICESat-2 diffuse attenuation signal without prior information was proposed here. The diffuse attenuation coefficients of the water column were estimated according to the ICESat-2 lidar signal of deep areas near the target shallow water area, and the parameters for the bathymetry algorithm without prior depth information were obtained. Combined with the Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery, accurate large-scale bathymetric information of Zhongye Island and Reefs, Guam, and Ngau were obtained. Bathymetric data from ICESat-2 of multiple tracks were used for verification, and the results showed that the new model performed well, as mean absolute error (MAE) for the three study areas ranged 0.35-1.52 m, and root Mean square error (RMSE) fell between 0.74 and 1.89 m. In the absence of any bathymetric information, the new method can achieve higher or similar accuracy to the more commonly employed Stumpf model.

T2  - JOURNAL OF VIROLOGICAL METHODS
M3  - Article
AB  - Pear chlorotic leaf spot associated virus (PCLSaV) belongs to the genus Emaravirus and possesses a genome composed of five negative-sense single-stranded RNA (-ssRNA) segments. This study developed a SYBR green -based reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assay for the detection of PCLSaV infecting pear trees. A set of two primers q5-F2/q5-R2 designed based on the viral RNA5 sequences showed high specificity and feasibility for PCLSaV detection. The standard curve was established. RT-qPCR assays showed that PCLSaV content was greatly higher in diseased branch and symptomatic leaf samples than that in un-diseased branch and asymptomatic leaf samples. The RT-qPCR was reliability in the detection of the virus in field and in-vitro cultured pear samples. This technique would be useful for the supervision of the viral disease and the certification of pear planting materials.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Repeated fires may slow the recovery process in burned areas, thus affecting ecological succession. Aims This paper explores the changes in likelihood of reburn and fire behaviours in various phases of vegetation recovery. Methods We used field survey data and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) to assess vegetation recovery in boreal forests after fires at both landscape and field scales. The Burn-P3 model was used to simulate burn probability and fire behaviours and then evaluate the overall fire likelihood and potential behaviours in different recovery phases. Key results Vegetation began to recover in most burned areas within the first year after fire and reached prefire levels after 10-15 years of recovery. Vegetation in areas with steep slopes (> 25 degrees) and thin soil had not recovered after 20 years, accounting for 0.3% of the total burned area. The average burn probability and fire behaviour indices of the study area decreased significantly after fire owing to lower fuel levels. Conclusions Burned areas with steep slopes and thin soil showed slower recovery rates after fire. The recovered vegetation in most burned areas still had low burn likelihood and fire behaviours 20 years post burn. Implications Artificial regeneration and fire prevention should be carried out at highly vulnerable sites for rehabilitating forest ecosystems.

TI  - Rice ponding date detection in Australia using Sentinel-2 and Planet Fusion imagery
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice is unique, in that yields are maximized when it is grown under ponded (or flooded) conditions. This however has implications for water use (an important consideration in water-scarce environments) and green house gas emissions. This work aimed to provide precise predictions of the date when irrigated rice fields were ponded, on a per-field basis. Models were developed using Sentinel-2 data (with the advantage of inclusion of water-sensitive shortwave infrared bands) and Planet Fusion data (which provides daily, temporally consistent, cross-calibrated, gap-free data). Models were trained with data from both commercial farms and research sites in New South Wales, Australia, and over four growing seasons (harvest in 2018-2021). Predictions were tested on the 2022 harvest season, which included a variety of sowing and water management strategies. A time-series method was developed to provide models with features including satellite observations from before and after the date being classified (as ponded or non-ponded). Logistic regression models using time-series features produced mean absolute errors for ponding date prediction of 4.9 days using Sentinel-2 data, and 4.3 days using Planet Fusion data. The temporal frequency of the Planet Fusion data compensated for the lack of spectral bands relative to Sentinel-2.

TI  - Long-Term Outcomes After Atrial Switch Operation for Transposition of the Great Arteries
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CARDIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND For patients with d-loop transposition of the great arteries (d-TGA) with a systemic right ventricle after an atrial switch operation, there is a need to identify risks for end-stage heart failure outcomes.OBJECTIVES The authors aimed to determine factors associated with survival in a large cohort of such individuals.METHODS This multicenter, retrospective cohort study included adults with d-TGA and prior atrial switch surgery seen at a congenital heart center. Clinical data from initial and most recent visits were obtained. The composite primary outcome was death, transplantation, or mechanical circulatory support (MCS).RESULTS From 1,168 patients (38% female, age at first visit 29 +/- 7.2 years) during a median 9.2 years of follow-up, 91 (8.8% per 10 person-years) met the outcome (66 deaths, 19 transplantations, 6 MCS). Patients experiencing sudden/arrhythmic death were younger than those dying of other causes (32.6 +/- 6.4 years vs 42.4 +/- 6.8 years; P < 0.001). There was a long duration between sentinel clinical events and end-stage heart failure. Age, atrial arrhythmia, pacemaker, biventricular enlargement, systolic dysfunction, and tricuspid regurgitation were all associated with the primary outcome. Independent 5-year predictors of primary outcome were prior ventricular arrhythmia, heart failure admission, complex anatomy, QRS duration >120 ms, and severe right ventricle dysfunction based on echocardiography.CONCLUSIONS For most adults with d-TGA after atrial switch, progress to end-stage heart failure or death is slow. A simplified prediction score for 5-year adverse outcome is derived to help identify those at greatest risk. (C) 2022 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation.

TI  - Thoracic outlet syndrome: a review for the primary care provider
T2  - JOURNAL OF OSTEOPATHIC MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Context: Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) symptoms are prevalent and often confused with other diagnoses. A PubMed search was undertaken to present a comprehensive article addressing the presentation and treatment for TOS.Objectives: This article summarizes what is currently published about TOS, its etiologies, common objective findings, and nonsurgical treatment options.Methods: The PubMed database was conducted for the range of May 2020 to September 2021 utilizing TOS-related Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms. A Preferred Reporting Itemsfor Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) systematic literature review was conducted to identify the most common etiologies, themost objective findings, and the most effective nonsurgical treatment options for TOS.Results: The search identified 1,188 articles. The automated merge feature removed duplicate articles. The remaining 1,078 citations were manually reviewed, with articles published prior to 2010 removed (n=771). Of the remaining 307 articles, duplicate citations not removed by automated means were removed manually (n=3). The other exclusion criteria included: non-English language (n=21); no abstracts available (n=56); and case reports of TOS occurring from complications of fractures, medical or surgical procedures, novel surgical approaches, or abnormal anatomy (n=42). Articles over 5 years old pertaining to therapeutic intervention (mostly surgical) were removed (n=18). Articles pertaining specifically to osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) were sparse and all were utilized (n=6). A total of 167 articles remained. The authors added a total of 20 articles that fell outside of the search criteria, as they considered themto be historic in naturewith regards to TOS (n=8), were related specifically toOMT (n=4), or were considered sentinel articles relating to specific therapeutic interventions (n=8). A total of 187 articles were utilized in the final preparation of this manuscript. A final search was conducted prior to submission for publication to check for updated articles. Symptoms of hemicranial and/or upper-extremity pain and paresthesias should lead a physician to evaluate for musculoskeletal etiologies that may be contributing to the compression of the brachial plexus. The best initial provocative test to screen for TOS is the upper limb tension test (ULTT) because a negative test suggests against brachial plexus compression. A positive ULTT should be followed up with an elevated armstress test (EAST) to further support the diagnosis. If TOS is suspected, additional diagnostic testing such as ultrasound, electromyography (EMG), or magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance angiography (MRI/MRA) might be utilized to further distinguish the vascular or neurological etiologies of the symptoms. Initial treatment for neurogenic TOS (nTOS) is often conservative. Data are limited, therefore there is no conclusive evidence that any one treatment method or combination ismore effective. Surgery in nTOS is considered for refractory cases only. Anticoagulation and surgical decompression remain the treatment of choice for vascular versions of TOS.Conclusions: The most common form of TOS is neurogenic. The most common symptoms are pain and paresthesias of the head, neck, and upper extremities. Diagnosis of nTOS is clinical, and the best screening test is the ULTT. There is no conclusive evidence that any one treatment method is more effective for nTOS, given limitations in the published data. Surgical decompression remains the treatment of choice for vascular forms of TOS.

TI  - A step toward considering the return period in flood spatial modeling
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in spatial modeling, and flood hazard prediction is a major area of interest within the field of hydrology. It is necessary to consider return periods for identifying the flood hazard zones. In hydraulic modeling such as HEC-RAS, this is usually done, but in spatial modeling by machine learning (ML) models, this has not been taken into account so far. This study seeks to obtain data that will help to address this research gap. The Sentinel-1 Radar images have been used for identifying the flooded locations in different return periods. An embedded feature selection algorithm (i.e., recursive feature elimination random forest; RFE-RF) was used in the current research for key feature selection. Then, three ML models of neural networks using model averaging, classification and regression tree, and support vector machine were employed. The flood hazard prediction demonstrated a great performance for all the applied models (i.e., accuracy and precision > 90%, Kappa > 88%). Sensitivity analysis disclosed that the variables of elevation and distance from stream are in the first importance order, the variables of precipitation, slope, and land use are in the second importance order, and other variables are in the third importance order in all return periods. The modeling results indicated that among man-made land uses the irrigated area between 17.7 and 31.4%, dry farming from 0.5 to 2.4%, and residential areas between 8.3 and 25.1% are exposed to high and very high flood hazard areas. The current findings add to a growing body of literature on the spatial modeling of floods.

TI  - Dynamics and Prediction of Land Use and Land Cover Changes Using Geospatial Techniques in Abelti Watershed, Omo Gibe River Basin, Ethiopia
T2  - ADVANCES IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ethiopia is a growing country which is in need of scientific ground for land use planning and agricultural-based economy. Evaluation of land use/land cover (LULC) changes helps for proper scheduling and use of natural resources with safe administration in accordance with time and dynamic population growth of the country, specifically in the study area. One of the detailed and useful ways to develop land use evaluation and classification maps is the use of geospatial techniques such as remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS). The main focus of this study is to evaluate the dynamics of land use and land cover (LULC) changes in the Abelti Watershed, Omo-Gibe River basin, Ethiopia. Maximum likelihood algorithm approach supervised classification method was used for identifying the LULC changes using satellite data to know LULC changes in the watershed. Quantifications of spatial and temporal dynamics of land use/cover changes were accomplished by using three satellite images of 2000, 2010, and 2017 and classifying them via a supervised classification algorithm by using Earth Resources and Development System (ERDAS) software and finally applying the postclassification change detection technique was performed by using ArcGIS 10.3. From the LULC analysis, the increase was observed in the agricultural area and settlement area from 2000 to 2017. On the other hand, shrub land followed a declining trend during the study period. However, forest and bare land followed variable trends during the study period in which forest declined from 2000 to 2010 but increased from 2010 to 2017 and bare land increased from 2000 to 2010 and declined from 2010 to 2017. Generally, the driving force behind this change was population growth, rapid urbanization, and deforestation which resulted in a wide range of environmental impacts, including degraded habitat quality in the watershed.

TI  - A novel knowledge base method in Riparian Buffer Zone (RBZ) delineation with remote sensing imagery
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The importance of Riparian Buffer Zones (RBZs) on riverine landscapes has recently received growing attention, which has led to studying, mapping, and monitoring RBZs areas. Additionally, several studies have examined their influence on water quality, vegetation cover, wild life, sediment, and pollution sources. The Riparian Buffer Zones, which are terrestrial areas located between fluvial water bodies and land, provide several ecosystem services and have a rich biodiversity. The present study aimed to identify and monitor the Riparian Buffer Zones in the Gorganroud basin which is located in the north of Iran and south eastern side of the Caspian Sea. This region is one of the largest basins and one of the most precious regions in Iran due to its humid climate and famous forests. RBZs were monitored in four corners of the basin within three selected sub-basins. Land-use map of the Riparian Buffer Zones was extracted in each part within dense vegetation, low-density vegetation, and water, and the area and percentage of each Buffer class were derived for each sub-basin. Two indexes of NDVI and NDWI were calculated and applied for identifying water and green cover pixels of the region and their dispersion. These two indicators helped extract an accurate map of the buffer zones. The results showed that the water buffer area in the north part was significant in comparison with the southern and eastern parts, which could be due to due to more rice fields. Furthermore, low-density vegetation was higher in the south since it is a mountainous area. Further, dense vegetation was high in the center of the watershed due to forests, which was confirmed by the NDVI index.

TI  - Improving typhoon predictions by assimilating the retrieval of atmospheric temperature profiles from the FengYun-4A's Geostationary Interferometric Infrared Sounder (GIIRS)
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Geostationary Interferometric Infrared Sounder (GIIRS) onboard China's FengYun-4A geostationary satellite provides an unprecedented opportunity to observe the three-dimensional thermodynamic structure of typhoons in the western North Pacific Ocean with high spatiotemporal resolutions. Field campaigns of targeting observation based on the conditional nonlinear optimal perturbation (CNOP) sensitivity were carried out utilizing the GIIRS on FY-4A for five typhoons: Chanhom, Maysak, and Higos in 2020 and typhoons Chanthu and Conson in 2021 and collected temporally continuous observations for the thermodynamic structure of typhoons and their environments. This study investigated the impact of atmospheric temperature profile retrieved from the collected GIIRS radiance on typhoon analysis and prediction in a regional Hurricane WRF (HWRF) model using the ensemble-variational data assimilation scheme. Despite the case dependence, the assimilation of the additional satellite retrieval generally improves the typhoon track forecasts relative to those with simply the operational observations assimilated. The improvement mainly occurs beyond two days and the average reduction of track errors reaches up to 100 km at about day 3. Diagnostics show that the improvement of initial temperature condition influences the geopotential height and wind fields roughly through the hydrostatic relationship. The assimilation of temperature retrieval also shows some potential in improving wind forecasts in the near-coast areas at upper and lower levels and the precipitation forecasts on land.

TI  - Respiratory Syncytial Virus Outbreak Without Influenza in the Second Year of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic: A National Sentinel Surveillance in Korea, 2021-2022 Season
T2  - JOURNAL OF KOREAN MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: This study aimed to investigate whether respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus (IFV) infections would occur in 2021-2022 as domestic nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are easing. Methods: Data were collected from the Korean Influenza and Respiratory Virus Monitoring System database. The weekly positivity rates of respiratory viruses and number of hospitalizations for acute respiratory infections were evaluated (January 2016-2022). The period from February 2020 to January 2022 was considered the NPI period. The autoregressive integrated moving average model and Poisson analysis were used for data analysis. Data from 14 countries/regions that reported positivity rates of RSV and IFV were also investigated. Results: Compared with the pre-NPI period, the positivity and hospitalization rates for IFV infection during 2021-2022 significantly decreased to 0.0% and 1.0%, respectively, at 0.0% and 1.2% of the predicted values, respectively. The RSV infection positivity rate in 2021-2022 was 1.8-fold higher than that in the pre-NPI period at 1.5-fold the predicted value. The hospitalization rate for RSV was 20.0% of that in the pre-NPI period at 17.6% of the predicted value. The re-emergence of RSV and IFV infections during 2020-2021 was observed in 13 and 4 countries, respectively. Conclusion: During 2021-2022, endemic transmission of the RSV, but not IFV, was observed in Korea.

TI  - Correlation of UAV and satellite-derived vegetation indices with cotton physiological parameters and their use as a tool for scheduling variable rate irrigation in cotton
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Current irrigation management zones (IMZs) for variable rate irrigation (VRI) systems are static. They are delineated in the beginning of the season and used thereafter. However, recent research has shown that IMZ boundaries are transient and change with time during the growing season. The primary goal of this study was to explore the potential of using vegetation indices (VIs) developed from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and satellite images to predict cotton physiological parameters that can be used to delineate in-season boundaries of IMZs. A 2 year study was conducted in a 38 ha commercial cotton field in southwestern Georgia, USA. Throughout the two growing seasons, VIs were calculated from UAV, PlanetScope, and Sentinel-2 images. Predawn leaf water potential (LWPPD) and plant height were measured at 37 locations in the field on the same day as the flights and correlated with UAV and satellite based-VIs. GNDVI (Green normalized difference vegetation index) was the best predictor of plant height with correlation values of 0.72 (p < .0001) and 0.84 (p < .0001) for 2019 and 2020, respectively. A secondary goal was to compare the performance of dynamic VRI (DVRI) to conventional irrigation. The field was divided into alternating parallel conventional, and DVRI strips to compare the two scheduling methods. The conventional strips were irrigated using the farmer's standard method and individual IMZs within the DVRI strips were irrigated based on soil water tension (SWT) measured with a wireless soil moisture sensor network. LWP and SWT measurements correlated well. IMZs were initially delineated using soil texture, apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECa), and yield maps and satellite images from previous years and were modified in-season to reflect patterns observed in the plant height maps. In 2020, the DVRI system prescribed an average irrigation amount of 50.8 mm while conventional irrigation applied an average of 58.4 mm. Average yields for DVRI and conventional were 1248 and 1191 kg ha(-1), respectively. The DVRI system resulted in average yield 4.6% higher than conventional irrigation, while applying 14.0% less water. Despite the lower water application by the DRVI system, the performance comparison between the DRVI and the conventional irrigation was not conclusive.

TI  - Multiscale spatiotemporal dynamics analysis of urban green space: Implications for green space planning in the rapid urbanizing Hefei City, China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Under the pressure of rapid urbanization, the spatiotemporal dynamics of urban green spaces (UGS) have enormous impacts on the local ecological system and environment at different scales. In this study, UGS in Hefei City, which has experienced rapid urbanization from 1995 to 2015, were extracted based on time-series Landsat-5 TM and Landsat-8 OLI images, and different types of parks were mapped based on GF-2 images combined with multi-source metadata. Dynamic patterns of green space were examined by drawing the spatial variations of green space at the city, inner city, and park scales. Results revealed that: (1) At the city level, UGS decreased with the rapid urbanization, especially farmland sharply lost in areas around existing urban areas and along the transportation corridors. (2) At the inner-city level, concentric analyses showed that UGS changes in different rings had unique trends, and the dynamic changes were the most significant in Rings 2 and 3. Comparative analysis of old and new districts showed that the common characteristics of UGS changes were the transfer-out of farmland and the transfer-in of built-up land, and the newer the region, the more intense the changes. (3) At the park level, the number and area of urban parks were increasing from the center to the periphery, and the type of park gradually changed from single to rich. Significant spatial heterogeneity was identified in the landscape patterns of urban parks based on fishnet cell analysis. It is fundamental to assign urban construction land for socio-economic development, while planning UGS at different scales; moreover, integrating different green space-related policies could protect the UGS and maintain its stability. Only in this way can UGS combine economic, social, and ecological benefits under the background of rapid urbanization.

TI  - Seagrass mapping using high resolution multispectral satellite imagery: A comparison of water column correction models
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing is an efficient and economical technique for studying coastal bottoms in clear and shallow waters. Accordingly, the main objective of this study is the generation of benthic maps using high spatial resolution multispectral images from the WorldView-2/3 satellites. In this context, one of the main challenges consists of eliminating the disturbances caused in the signal by the atmosphere, the sea surface, and the water column. Regarding the water column correction, there is controversy about its effectiveness to improve the results achieved. To assess the impact of the water column correction in seagrass mapping, two coastal areas with different characteristics have been selected. Specifically, an analysis has been carried out consisting of the assessment of the Lyzenga and Sagawa water column correction models to identify the algorithm that provides the best mapping precision and, additionally, to seek if this pre-processing stage is helpful when classifying the seabed. The classification models selected for the study were: Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Subspace KNN (S-KNN). Machine learning techniques have proven to achieve better results and, in particular, SVM and KNN models provide the best overall accuracy. The results after benthic mapping have demonstrated, that image classification without water column corrections provides better accuracy (95.36% and 99.20%) than using Lyzenga (73.49% and 97.80%) or Sagawa (82.04% and 99.10%), for Case 2 and 1 waters, respectively.

AB  - Phenological responses of vegetation to global warming impact ecosystem gross primary production and evapotranspiration. However, high resolution and large spatial scale observational evidence of such responses in undisturbed core forest areas is lacking. Here, we analyse MODIS satellite data to assess monthly trends in gross primary productivity and evapotranspiration across undisturbed core forest areas in Europe between 2000 and 2020. Both parameters increased during the early spring and late autumn in nearly half of the total undisturbed core forest area (3601.5 km2). Enhanced productivity drove increased water-use-efficiency (the ratio of gross primary productivity to evapotranspiration). However, productivity increases during spring and autumn were not sufficient to compensate for summertime decreases in 25% of core forest areas. Overall, 20% of total gross primary productivity across all European forest core areas was offset by forest areas that exhibited a net decrease in productivity.Enhanced gross primary productivity and water use efficiency during spring and autumn may not offset summertime reductions in carbon assimilation in 25% of undisturbed European forest cores, according to satellite-remotely sensed time series data between 2000 and 2020.

TI  - Representation of seasonal land use dynamics in SWAT plus for improved assessment of blue and green water consumption
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In most (sub)-tropical African cultivated regions, more than one cropping season exists following the (one or two) rainy seasons. An additional cropping season is possible when irrigation is applied during the dry season, which could result in three cropping seasons. However, most studies using agro-hydrological models such as the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to map blue and green evapotranspiration (ET) do not account for these cropping seasons. Blue ET is a portion of crop evapotranspiration after irrigation application, while green ET is the evapotranspiration resulting from rainfall. In this paper, we derived dynamic and static trajectories from seasonal land use maps to represent the land use dynamics following the major growing seasons to improve simulated blue and green water consumption from simulated evapotranspiration in SWAT+. A comparison between the default SWAT+ set-up (with static land use representation) and a dynamic SWAT+ model set-up (with seasonal land use representation) is made by a spatial mapping of the ET results. Additionally, the SWAT+ blue and green ET were compared with the results from the four remote sensing data-based methods, namely SN (Senay), EK (van Eekelen), the Budyko method, and soil water balance method (SWB). The results show that ET with seasonal representation is closer to remote sensing estimates, giving higher performance than ET with static land use representation. The root mean squared error decreased from 181 to 69 mm yr(-1), the percent bias decreased from 20 % to 13 %, and the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency increased from -0.46 to 0.4. Furthermore, the blue and green ET results from the dynamic SWAT+ model were compared to the four remote sensing methods. The results show that the SWAT+ blue and green ET are similar to the van Eekelen method and performed better than the other three remote sensing methods. It is concluded that representation of seasonal land use dynamics produces better ET results, which provide better estimations of blue and green agricultural water consumption.

TI  - Investigating the quality of HIV rapid testing practices in public antenatal health care facilities, South Africa
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring HIV prevalence using antenatal HIV sentinel surveillance is important for efficient epidemic tracking, programme planning and resource allocation. HIV sentinel surveillance usually employs unlinked anonymous HIV testing which raises ethical, epidemiological and public health challenges in the current era of universal test and treat. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that countries should consider using routine prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) data for surveillance. We audited antenatal care clinics to assess the quality of HIV rapid testing practices as the first step to assess whether South Africa is ready to utilize PMTCT programme data for antenatal HIV surveillance. In 2017, we conducted a cross-sectional survey in 360 randomly sampled antenatal care clinics using the adapted WHO Stepwise-Process-for-Improving-the-Quality-of-HIV-Rapid-Testing (SPI-RT) checklist. We calculated median percentage scores within a domain (domain-specific median score), and across all domains (overall median percentage scores). The latter was used to classify sites according to five implementation levels; (from 0:<40% to 4: 90% or higher). Of 346 (96.1%) facilities assessed, an overall median percentage score of 62.1% (inter-quartile range (IQR): 50.8-71.9%) was obtained. The lowest domain-specific median percentage scores were obtained under training/certification (35% IQR: 10.0-50.0%) and external quality assurance (12.5% IQR: 0.0-50.0%), respectively. The majority (89%) of sites had an overall median score at level 2 or below; of these, 37% required improvement in specific areas and 6.4% in all areas. Facilities in districts implementing the HIV Rapid Test Quality Improvement Initiative and supported by the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) had significantly higher median overall scores (65.6% IQR: 53.9-74.2%) (P-value from rank sum test: <0.001) compared with non-PEPFAR-supported facilities (56.6% IQR:47.7-66.0%). We found sub-optimal implementation of HIV rapid testing practices. We recommend the expansion of the PEPFAR-funded Rapid Test Continuous Quality Improvement (RTCQI) support to all antenatal care testing sites.

TI  - Soil Moisture Retrieval Using Sail Squirrel Search Optimization-based Deep Convolutional Neural Network with Sentinel-1 Images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMAGE AND GRAPHICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Soil Moisture (SM) is an environmental descriptor, which acts as the affiliation between the atmosphere and the earth's surface. Various SM retrieval methods are developed to abolish the influence of vegetation cover attenuation, surface roughness, and scattering to find an association among SM and backscatter coefficient. To understand the relationship between various vegetation parameters and backscatter coefficient poses a great challenge in SM retrieval. Hence, an efficacious SM retrieval method is afforded using the proposed Sail Squirrel Search Optimization-based Deep Convolutional Neural Network (SSSO-based Deep CNN). Here, the proposed SSSO is derived by concatenating the Sail Fish Optimization (SFO) with Squirrel Search Algorithm (SSA). The Deep CNN performs the process of SM retrieval using vegetation indices. The fitness measure of the proposed optimization enables to find the best solution to update the weights of the classifier for increasing the efficiency of the retrieval mechanism. By training Deep CNN with the proposed optimization, the soil moisture of an area is effectively retrieved. However, the proposed SSSO-based Deep CNN obtained minimal estimation error and minimal RMSE of 0.550 and 0.726 using sentinel-1 data, respectively.

TI  - Investigation of post fire vegetation regrowth under different burn severities based on satellite observations
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the crucial components in improving the quality of forests is post-fire vegetation regrowth monitoring. This is done by analyzing the time series of satellite data and studying the severity of forest fires to improve the ability to monitor the dynamic changes of the forest. This study investigates the regeneration process of existing vegetation types in different severities of The Rim fire in Sierra Nevada, California, using the time series of vegetation indices obtained from the MODIS sensor. The Vegetation Return Period (VRP) and the Recovery Rate (RR) after the fire were evaluated to monitor the regrowth of vegetation types. According to the results, the VRP values of the species for low, moderate, and high severity were estimated to be between 22 to 33 months, 33 to 47 months, and about 5 years, in this area. The 8-year changes in the time series of vegetation indices confirm that some vegetation types in this region have not fully recovered. In addition, spatio-temporal variations of the burned regions were examined with Landsat images at 2-year post-fire intervals until 2021. The results showed that in three 2-year periods after the fire, 16,074 hectares, 48,722 hectares, and 27,391 hectares of land were, respectively, converted into unburned areas, and until 2019, about 60% of the burned areas were recovered. Researchers and land managers can use the results of such studies to identify areas that need more attention after a fire.

TI  - Spatial impact of urban expansion on lake surface water temperature based on the perspective of watershed scale
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - As an important ecological environmental factor, the lake water surface temperature (LSWT) has an important impact on the ecological diversity of lakes and watersheds. With the acceleration of urbanization in China, the impact of urban expansion on LSWT can not be ignored. In this study, we introduced the spatial influence(G) equation, selected MOD11A2, impervious surface (IS), digital elevation model (DEM) and Landsat series remote sensing images as data sources, and took six lakes with rapid urban expansion in China as the empirical research object to explore the variation characteristics of urban expansion and LSWT in six lake watersheds and the spatial influence of urban expansion on LSWT. Finally, the following conclusions can be drawn: The results show that 1) The IS in the six watersheds all experienced significant expansion, with an increase of 1.80-3.91 times. 2) From the annual average LSWT from 2001 to 2018, only Poyang Lake's LSWT-night shows a cooling trend, while other lakes, whether LSWT-day or LSWT-night, show a warming trend. 3) G is used to comprehensively consider the area change of IS in the watershed, the influence of distance and the change of lake area, which can quantify the impact of IS on LSWT, so as to further explain and describe the spatial influence process and characteristics of IS expansion on LSWT.

TI  - Linking remote sensing and insect defoliation biology-A cross-system comparison
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The success of space-based forest defoliation monitoring beyond thematic classification hinges on the ability to link units of continuous foliar change with associated units of spectral or vegetation index change across different systems. To explore this, we used multi-temporal Landsat sensor data with respect to three defoliation metrics (shoot-based estimates (%), frass biomass (kg.ha(-1)), and proportion of foliar loss) across three different forest systems in the United States. While shoot-based defoliation was measured in the field, the later two defoliation metrics were estimated based on the insect phenology model, BioSIM. The systems include spruce budworm (SBW, Choristoneura fumiferana C). in heterogenous mixed forests, Minnesota, jack pine budworm (JPBW, Cho-ristoneura pinus F). in homogenous pine forests, Wisconsin, and spongy moth (SGM, Lymantria dispar dispar L). in mixed broad-leaved forests, Maryland. Our generalized annual defoliation model for budworm was poor (R-adj(2) = 0.35, RMSE = 23.70%) due to difficulty in detecting SBW defoliation in Minnesota. Thus, individual annual JPBW shoot-based defoliation models (R-adj(2) = 0.27 to 0.75 and RMSE = 19.16% to 11.32%) outperformed the SBW models (R-adj(2) = 0.08 to 0.27, RMSE = 23.18% to 34.13%). Cross-system differences between rates of change in ground-based metrics of defoliation with respect to observed change in spectral index values (dVI) were significant for shoot-based estimates of percent annual defoliation for SGM vs. JPBW (p-values < 1.00 x 10(-4)) and SGM vs. SBW (p-values < 4.60 x 10(-3)). However, such comparison between SGM and JPBW were not significant when either frass biomass (kg.ha(-1), p-value = 0.46) or proportion of foliage loss was used (p-value = 0.67). For a given unit of defoliation, the magnitude of vegetation index change, dVI, was significantly different between SGM and JPBW for each defoliation metric used (p-values < 1.00 x 10(-4)), but not between SGM and SBW (p-value = 0.47) or between JPBW and SBW (p-value = 0.06) when shoot-based annual defoliation metrics were used. This study is first to report that, for a given quantity of defoliation, substantial differences in both the magnitude and direction of vegetation index change exists for different defoliator systems, which currently precludes the development of a viable, unified defoliation model. However, outcomes of this research provide an important step in our understanding of these defoliator systems that may enable specific scaling of continuous defoliation at landscape levels and across defoliator systems in the future.

TI  - Permafrost thaw drives surface water decline across lake-rich regions of the Arctic
T2  - NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes constitute 20-40% of Arctic lowlands, the largest surface water fraction of any terrestrial biome. These lakes provide crucial habitat for wildlife, supply water for remote Arctic communities and play an important role in carbon cycling and the regional energy balance. Recent evidence suggests that climate change is shifting these systems towards long-term wetting (lake formation or expansion) or drying. The net direction and cause of these shifts, however, are not well understood. Here, we present evidence for large-scale drying across lake-rich regions of the Arctic over the past two decades (2000-2021), a trend that is correlated with increases in annual air temperature and autumn rain. Given that increasing air temperatures and autumn rain promote permafrost thaw, our results indicate that permafrost thaw is leading to widespread surface water decline, challenging models that do not predict a net decrease in lake area until the mid-twenty-first or twenty-second centuries.The Arctic lowlands are characterized by a large number of lakes that cover a substantial part of the surface in some regions. Here, the authors apply a machine learning approach to satellite data to show that permafrost thaw since 2000 has caused a decline in surface water in these regions.

TI  - Uncertainty analysis of multiple terrestrial gross primary productivity products
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim Gross primary productivity (GPP) of vegetation is an important component of the carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems. With the development of science and technology, there has been a proliferation of multiple GPP products, yet large uncertainties exist in the global GPP estimated by different GPP products. The objectives of this study were to assess the uncertainty of 45 GPP products in 4 different categories (machine learning, Fluxnet, light use efficiency, land surface model) and to perform an attribution analysis. Location Global. Time period 2003-2010. Major taxa studied Terrestrial ecosystems. Methods The three-cornered hat (TCH) method was used to assess GPP uncertainty because it does not require a priori knowledge of the true GPP values. We also used generalized additive models to explore the contribution of different factors to GPP uncertainty. Results The results show that the magnitude of absolute uncertainty (AU) is generally higher in the GPP high-value region and also indicate large spatial variability of relative uncertainty (RU) among products. Deciduous broadleaf forest (20.2 g C/m(2)/year) and deciduous needleleaf forest (27.2 g C/m(2)/ year) have lower uncertainty compared to that of woody savanna (128.4 g C/m(2)/ year) and savanna (128.7 g C/m(2)/year). The RU in machine learning (ML) products overall is low (average value = 14.3%), with ORCHIDEE-CNP (weight = 4.19%), being more recognized by GPP products are more consistent in the magnitude of spatial variability (similar in the standard deviations) and more uncertain in spatial distribution patterns. Excluding the combined effects of other factors, soil moisture (15.2%) and precipitation (8.3%) are the two factors that contribute most to GPP uncertainty, indicating that focusing on water constraints is a guarantee of GPP product quality. Main conclusions The TCH approach quantifies the uncertainty of GPP products well and the spatial distribution pattern variability contributes more uncertainty compared to the magnitude of spatial variability. Future GPP estimates could consider combining the advantages of different GPP products to limit uncertainty.

TI  - Spatiotemporal water dynamic modelling of Ramsar-listed lakes on the Victorian Volcanic Plains using Landsat, ICESat-2 and airborne LiDAR data
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal dynamic information on surface water area and level is a prerequisite for effective wetland conservation and management. However, such information is either unavailable or difficult to obtain. In this study, for the first time, we leverage Landsat imagery, ICESat-2 and airborne LiDAR data to develop time series of water body dynamics over the last 35 years (1987-2021) using machine learning method on a cloud computing platform for lakes identified as international importance in the Western District Lakes Ramsar site in Victoria, Australia. Our results reveal distinct seasonal (dry and wet) variation patterns and long-term changes in trends of lake water areas and levels in response to seasonal rainfall variations and regional climate changes for the periods of before, during and after the Millennium Drought when southeast Australia experienced unprecedented dry conditions. Lake water bodies have not recovered to the status of pre-Millennium Drought, and many per-manent Ramsar-listed lakes in the region have become to ephemeral lakes due to climate change. The outcome of this study provides a baseline to help understand the historical and ongoing status of the Ramsar-listed lakes in a warming and drying climate in support of the development of strategic plan to implement international obli-gations for wetlands protection under the Ramsar Convention.

TI  - Deriving vertical profiles of chlorophyll-<i>a</i> concentration in the upper layer of seawaters using ICESat-2 photon-counting lidar
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll-a concentration (chl-a) is a great indicator for estimating phytoplankton biomass and productivity levels and is also particularly useful for monitoring the water quality, biodiversity and species distribution, and harmful algal blooms. A great deal of studies investigated to estimate chl-a concentrations using ocean color remotely sensed data. With the development of photon-counting sensors, spaceborne photon-counting lidar can compensate for the shortcomings of passive optical remote sensing by enabling ocean vertical profiling in low-light conditions (e.g., at night). Using geolocated photons captured by the first spaceborne photon-counting lidar borne on ICESat-2 (Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2), this research reported methods for deriving vertical profiles of chl-a concentration in the upper layer of ocean waters. This study first calculates the average numbers of backscattered subaqueous photons of ICESat-2 at different water depths, and then estimates the optical parameters in water column based on a discrete theoretical model of the expected number of received signal photons. With the estimated optical parameters, vertical profiles of chl-a concentration are calculated by two different empirical algorithms. In two study areas (mostly with Type I open ocean waters and small part of Type II coastal ocean waters), the derived chl-a concentrations are generally consistent when validated by BGC-Argo (Biogeochemical Argo) data in the vertical direction (MAPEs<15%) and compared with MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data in the along-track direction (average R-2>0.86). Using globally covered ICESat-2 data, this approach can be used to obtain vertical profiles of chl-a concentration and optical parameters at a larger scale, which will be helpful to analyze impact factors of climate change and human activities on subsurface phytoplankton species and their growth state.

TI  - Integrating an attention-based deep learning framework and the SAFY-V model for winter wheat yield estimation using time series SAR and optical data
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on the spatial distribution of yields can be obtained over a large area by using remote sensing (RS) data. Combining Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), being sensitive to above ground biomass and soil moisture in all weather conditions, and optical data can improve the usability of RS data and provide a basis for pixel-based crop yield estimation (YE). In this study, an Upscaled Convolutional Gated Recurrent Unit model incorporated an attention mechanism (UpSc-AConvGRU model) was proposed to improve the estimation accuracy of the winter wheat growth parameter, Leaf Area Index (LAI). Gap filling the time series of optical data was done with backscatter coefficients, local incidence angles and polarimetric decomposition information from Sentinel-1 SAR imagery. The time series LAI estimated by the UpSc-AConvGRU model and Vegetation Temperature Condition Index (VTCI) retrieved from Sentinel-3 optical imagery were then used as state variables of the SAFY-V model to estimate winter wheat yield. The results showed that the proposed UpSc-AConvGRU model incorporated the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) can effectively improve the accuracy of LAI estimation, with RMSEs ranging from 0.413 to 0.699 m2 m2 for LAI estimated within main growth stages (MGSs) of winter wheat. The correlation between estimated LAI and Sentinel-3 retrieved LAI was generally higher at irrigated farmland compared to rain-fed farmland. The estimated LAI was closest to Sentinel-3 retrieved LAI at the green-up and late heading-filling stage of winter wheat, followed by the jointing and early heading-filling stage, and finally the milk maturity stage. There was good agreement between the SAFY-V model estimated and field measured winter wheat yields (R2 = 0.546, RMSE = 0.757 t ha-1), and the estimated yields at the pixel scale in the Guanzhong Plain, PR China were satisfactory. This study combined deep learning and crop growth modeling, proposed a new pixel scale winter wheat YE method.

TI  - Geospatial analysis for the identification and mapping of groundwater potential zones using RS and GIS at Eastern Gojjam, Ethiopia
T2  - GROUNDWATER FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater, an impressive source of quality water particularly for potable and irrigation. Geospatial analysis of identifying and mapping groundwater potential zones significantly reduce the costs and time of exploration and proper allocation of dried boreholes that helps to avoid failure of groundwater withdrawal planning and development. This research aimed to analysis geospatial identification and mapping of groundwater potential zones. In this study, Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data used to prepare a slope and drainage density map. Lineaments (automatically extracted with PCI Geomatica) and land use/land cover maps were derived from Sentinel 2A data. Supervised classification (maximum likelihood classifier) was applied with an overall accuracy of 84.34% and kappa coefficient of 0.825. Rainfall data from twenty-two meteorological stations was used to prepare rainfall thematic map using Inverse Distance Weight interpolation method. All factors were reclassified based on their class value into five classes, namely: 'very high', 'high', 'moderate', 'low', and 'very low'. A Multi- Criteria Decision Analysis with Analytical Hierarchy Process was implemented with a consistency ratio (CR) value of 0.0098, which is < 0.1. Findings were obtained using a weighted sum overlay analysis of each factor's value multiplied by its corresponding weight. Therefore, 12.78% and 24.1% of the total area has 'very high' and 'high' potential for groundwater, respectively. Whereas, 29.2%, 24.26%, and 9.65% of the zone have 'moderate', 'low' and 'very low' potential, respectively. Finally, the result was validated with borehole data and the overall accuracy was found to be 87.17%. In conclusion, the application of RS and GIS are powerful tools to identify and map groundwater potential areas with a combination of different groundwater contributing factors.

TI  - Feasibility of targeted axillary dissection for de-escalation of surgical treatment after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer
T2  - SURGICAL ONCOLOGY-OXFORD
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Targeted axillary dissection, which combines sentinel lymph node biopsy with removal of the proven involved node noted during the staging process, has been shown to improve axillary staging and decrease false negative rates after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer.Objective(s): The main goal of this study was to assess the ability to identify and remove the clipped node and the false negative rate of targeted axillary dissection.Methods: We performed a prospective study among patients with biopsy-confirmed nodal metastases who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. A clip was placed on the sample node prior systemic therapy. After neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, all patients underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy (dual tracer), localization and excision of the clipped node and axillary lymph node dissection. The clipped node was preoperatively localized in all cases placing an iodine-125 seed guided by ultrasound. The pathology of the sentinel nodes and clipped node was compared with other nodes.Results: A total of 455 patients with invasive breast cancer were studied. Of the 148 patients with NAC, 32 met the eligibility criteria and were enrolled in the study. Mean age at diagnosis was 52.3 years. Systematic lym-phadenectomy was performed in all patients, with an average of 14.3 lymph nodes removed. Detection rate of the clipped node alone was 96.9%, and 100% for targeted axillary dissection. Ability of clipped node alone to predict nodal status showed a FNR of 10,5% while SLNB alone performed by dual tracer and targeted axillary dissection, showed FNRs of 5.3% and 5.0%, respectively. Sentinel lymph nodes matched clipped node in 23 patients (74.2%). Conclusion (s): In node positive breast cancer patients, targeted axillary dissection is a reliably approach for axillary staging after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The preoperative location of the clipped node is mandatory to increase the detection rate and optimize the results of the technique.

TI  - Centennial-scale study on the spatial-temporal evolution of riparian wetlands in the Yangtze River of China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands play a crucial role in maintaining the ecosystem function and ecological security of the Yangtze River. This study collected multi-source remote sensing image data, including historical topographic maps, Landsat, and Gaofen-2, and established a set of classification and interpretation standards for riparian wetlands in the Yangtze River. The artificial visual interpretation was used to reconstruct the spatial-temporal evolution process of ri-parian wetlands in the Yangtze River over the past century, clarified its characteristics, and analyzed the impact of climate change, damming, and land development and wetland policies. The results showed that: (1) Riparian wetlands in the Yangtze River generally showed a decreasing trend. Among them, those in the upper reaches showed a decreasing trend, those in the middle reaches increased during 1930-1980 s and decreased since the 1980 s, and those in the lower reaches fluctuated. (2) The spatial-temporal evolution can be divided into three characteristic areas. In the estuary (Shanghai and the coastal), riparian wetlands first decreased and then increased, and changed significantly. The three provinces in the downstream (Jiangsu, Anhui, and Jiangxi) and Chongqing showed a decreasing trend with great changes. The three provinces in the middle and upstream first increased and then decreased with little change. (3) The impact of wetland exploitation and protection policies can be divided into three stages: no wetland protection policies (before 1986), wetland protection policy development (1986-1998), and strict protection (1998-present). This study provides an important scientific foundation for the implementation of coordinated protection of the Yangtze River.

TI  - A new framework for prognosing forest resources under intensified disturbance impacts: Case of the Czech Republic
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest management decisions increasingly rely on modelling tools, which help identify future risks, optimize management decisions, and provide a suite of indicators beyond timber production. Here we developed and tested a novel simulation and upscaling framework (SUF) and used it for prognosing forest resources of the Czech Republic (Central Europe), which is currently one of Europe's hotspots of disturbance intensification. The SUF is based on an empirical forest model that simulates the development of 8 240 forest stands representing forest conditions in 206 administrative districts of the Czech Republic. The effect of natural disturbances is considered via empirical species-and age-specific mortality probability (MP) functions parameterized based on the national forest damage reports and remote sensing data. An upscaling procedure was developed to obtain district-and country-wide estimates. We tested this framework for its ability to (i) reproduce the initial forest conditions from the year 2003, (ii) reproduce forest dynamics in 2003-2016 (i.e., before the recent disturbance wave), (iii) reproduce the recent mortality pulse in 2017-2020, and (iv) generate plausible and consistent outputs under several disturbance and management settings in 2003-2050. The SUF reliably reproduced forest dynamics in both testing periods. The country-wide growing stock (GS) simulated for 2004-2050 oscillated around the initial value of 661 mill. m3 if the reference MP and management were considered. Using the elevated MP (corresponding with the recent disturbance period) increased the mean annual mortality rate from 0.78 % to 1.19 % and caused GS to decrease by 21 % in 2050. The wave of elevated mortality lasted 16 years, ceasing in 2033 due to the depletion of vulnerable stands. Reducing the rotation length by 40 % increased the harvests temporarily and caused GS to decrease by 29 and 33 % in 2050 under reference and elevated MP, respectively. At the same time, mortality was reduced by up to 18 % due to the removal of potentially vulnerable stands. The presented SUF is able to accommodate diverse forestry data, reproduce real forest dynamics, and generate outputs that correspond with the national forestry statistics. Flexible adoption of different mortality and management regimes makes it a versatile tool for supporting management decisions and policies. The presented simulations highlighted the negative prospects of the regional forests and the need for a profound transformation of management practices and the regional forest-based sector.

TI  - Countrywide classification of permanent grassland habitats at high spatial resolution
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - European grasslands face strong declines in extent and quality. Many grassland types are priority habitats for national and European conservation strategies. Countrywide, high spatial resolution maps of their distribution are often lacking. Here, we modelled the spatial distribution of 20 permanent grassland habitats at the level of phytosociological alliances across Switzerland at 10x10 m resolution. First, we applied ensemble models to provide distribution maps of the individual habitat types, using training data from various sources. Copernicus Sentinel satellite imagery and variables describing climate, soil and topography were used as predictors. The performance of these models was assessed based on the true skill statistics with a split-sampling of the data. Second, the individual maps were combined into countrywide maps of the most and second most likely habitat type, respectively, using an expert-based weighting approach. The performance of the combined map for the most likely habitat type was assessed via an independent testing dataset and a comparison of the predicted habitat-type proportions with extrapolations from field surveys. Most individual maps had useful to excellent predictive performance (TSS > 0.6). For most grid cells in the combined maps, the most and second most likely habitat types were either ecologically closely related or representing two grassland types along a nutrient gradient. The same was true for omission errors. We found good agreement between the predicted and estimated proportions from field surveys. The area of raised bogs appears to be underestimated, while dry grasslands showed highest agreement. This work highlights the potential of earth observation data at fine spatial and temporal resolution to map habitats at broad scales, thereby providing the foundation for diverse conservation applications. A particular challenge remains in capturing the transition from nutrient-poor to nutrient-rich grasslands, which is highly important for biodiversity conservation.

TI  - A novel solution for stereo three-dimensional localization combined with geometric semantic constraints based on spaceborne SAR data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Improved resolution and geolocation accuracy of spaceborne SAR images make refined digital surface model extraction and delicate three-dimensional reconstruction promising. Currently, extracting a refined digital sur-face model by stereo SAR remains challenging due to the significant matching errors. In this paper, we quan-titatively analyze the effect of matching errors on stereo SAR based on a simulation method. Subsequently, a novel stereo SAR approach combined with geometric semantic constraints is proposed to reduce the effect of matching errors on localization. In this approach, a stereo localization model combined with geometric semantic constraints is utilized to jointly locate a group of points with planar or linear structures. The least squares so-lution of the system of equations will be solved by an iterative method based on correcting characteristic values. Finally, the simulation experiments show that the planar and linear semantic constraints improve the relative positioning accuracy by about 26% and 70%, respectively. Experiments based on real data also demonstrate that the proposed method is significantly better than traditional stereo SAR.

TI  - Spatiotemporal bias adjustment of IMERG satellite precipitation data across Canada
T2  - ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Recently developed remote sensing data including satellite-based products show promising performance in estimating precipitation at high spatiotemporal resolution. However, the inherent uncertainties associated with indirect precipitation measurements can limit their applications. In this study, a novel approach based on regression-based quantile mapping (RQM) combined with spatial interpolation and a clustering algorithm is proposed to adjust the spatial and temporal biases of Integrated Multi-satEllite Retrievals for Global precipitation measurement (IMERG-V06) Final Run across Canada from 2014 to 2018 at a daily time scale. Ground precipitation observed at a total of 530 gauges is provided by Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC). A set of invariant and time-varying topographic and climatic explanatory variables are selected and resampled to the satellite grid spatial resolution (0.1 degrees) to develop the RQM model. The bias adjustment method is applied at gauged sites to estimate the parameters for different quantile levels of precipitation amounts. The parameters are then interpolated for the ungauged grids based on the climatic similarities between different locations and the spatial distribution of rain gauges. The proposed method shows promising results, reducing the overall relative bias (RBias) by similar to 32% and increasing the correlation by similar to 0.31 for 2014-2018. The correlation coefficient (CC) values averaged over the clusters during the cold (November to March) and warm (April to October) months are improved by 167% (from 0.3 to 0.8) and 50% (from 0.6 to 0.9), respectively. In terms of probability of detection (POD) and false alarm ratio (FAR), bias-adjusted data indicates more than 50% improvement for all seasons. The results indicate that the proposed approach can be applied for the bias correction of other remotely sensed products worldwide.

TI  - Exploring characteristics of national forest inventories for integration with global space-based forest biomass data
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - National forest inventories (NFIs) are a reliable source for national forest measurements. However, they are usually not developed for linking with remotely sensed (RS) biomass information. There are increasing needs and opportunities to facilitate this link towards better global and national biomass estimation. Thus, it is important to study and understand NFI characteristics relating to their integration with space-based products; in particular for the tropics where NFIs are quite recent, less frequent, and partially incomplete in several countries. Here, we (1) assessed NFIs in terms of their availability, temporal distribution, and extent in 236 countries from FAO's Global Forest Resources Assessment (FRA) 2020; (2) compared national forest biomass estimates in 2018 from FRA and global space-based Climate Change Initiative (CCI) product in 182 countries considering NFI availability and temporality; and (3) analyzed the latest NFI design characteristics in 46 tropical countries relating to their integration with space-based biomass datasets. We observed significant NFI availability globally and multiple NFIs were mostly found in temperate and boreal countries while most of the single NFI countries (94 %) were in the tropics. The latest NFIs were more recent in the tropics and many countries (35) implemented NFIs from 2016 onwards. The increasing availability and update of NFIs create new opportunities for integration with space-based data at the national level. This is supported by the agreement we found between country biomass estimates for 2018 from FRA and CCI product, with a significantly higher correlation in countries with recent NFIs. We observed that NFI designs varied greatly in tropical countries. For example, the size of the plots ranged from 0.01 to 1 ha and more than three-quarters of the countries had smaller plots of <= 0.25 ha. The existing NFI designs could pose specific challenges for statistical integration with RS data in the tropics. Future NFI and space-based efforts should aim towards a more integrated approach taking advantage of both data streams to improve national estimates and help future data harmonization efforts. Regular NFI efforts can be expanded with the inclusion of some super-site plots to enhance data integration with currently available space-based applications. Issues related to cost implications versus improvements in the accuracy, timeliness, and sustainability of national forest biomass estimation should be further explored.

TI  - Spatial ordering of informal sector activities in African cities: perspectives and lessons from the development of informal sector in Nigeria
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Informal Sector Activities (ISAs) dominate the economy in most African cities, and they continue to proliferate without consideration for environmental sustainability. This study analysed spatial ordering of ISAs in four Nigerian cities, selected for their differential urban forms and social practices. The study assessed the conformity of the spatial ordering of ISAs with industrial location principles, the implications of urban spatial form and government/policy makers' awareness of environmental consequences of ISAs spatial ordering. The ISAs were identified, classified and sampled, and their GPS coordinates were used in mapping the ISAs on Landsat images in an ArcGIS environment. Findings show that the existing ISAs do not conform to locational principles. Poor governance and environmental awareness of policy/decision makers explains the poor spatial ordering of ISAs.

TI  - Sentinel-1 Persistent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PS-InSAR) for Long-Term Remote Monitoring of Ground Subsidence: A Case Study of a Port in Busan, South Korea
T2  - KSCE JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Reclamation has allowed rapid land expansions for economic zones, residential areas, airports, industrial parks, and seaports. Meanwhile, the reclaimed lands often pose a risk of ground subsidence, jeopardizing functions of aboveground infrastructures, buildings, and facilities and threatening human lives. Therefore, it is critical to systematically monitor and manage the reclaimed lands after construction and minimize geohazard risks. This paper presents a case study on long-term remote monitoring of ground subsidence in reclaimed land using satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data and the Persistent Scatterer Interferometric SAR (PS-InSAR) technique. The case study explores the excessive and persistent ground subsidence in Busan New Port, South Korea, which occurred since 2007. We employ large stacks of Sentinel-1 data acquired from the ascending and descending tracks for reliable estimation of ground subsidence and utilize the hyperbolic model, providing an updated prediction tool. A benchmarking and media fact-checking approach consistently supports our PS-InSAR analysis results. The time-series results show that the maximum subsidence rate is approximately -85 mm/yr along the radar line-of-sight (LOS). PS-InSAR can assist in saving expensive and laborious mapping and operational field-survey services and offers essential guidance for the next phase of future construction of Busan New Port.

TI  - Bamboo Mapping Using Earth Observation Data: A Systematic Review
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Bamboo is considered one of the world's highest-yielding renewable natural resources. International Network of Bamboo and Rattan has identified that the effective utilization of bamboo resources can help in realizing at least six United Nations sustainable development goals. Therefore, the information about the spatial distribution and area under bamboo is essential for its better management and conservation. Hence, this paper systematically reviewed and compiled the published literature around the globe which rigorously focussed on mapping bamboo resources worldwide using remote sensing. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework was adopted and a total of 46 papers published between 1991 and 2021 were evaluated based on the relevant criteria. It was observed that most of the studies on bamboo mapping were carried out using medium-resolution freely available satellite images. Around 47% of the studies utilized Landsat MSS, TM, ETM+ & OLI data. The classification methods widely used for mapping bamboo were found to be the visual interpretation and maximum likelihood classifiers. However, after 2014 the studies emphasized more on using machine learning algorithms for accurate mapping of bamboo. In addition to that, the use of the Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform showed great potential for bamboo mapping by accessing a plethora of freely available datasets and classification algorithms. Spectral bands and vegetation indices were the most common variables used for bamboo mapping. The global overview highlighted that very little research on bamboo mapping has been carried out in bamboo-rich countries, except in China. This compilation will help in understanding the gaps related to the mapping and monitoring of this important natural resource worldwide.

TI  - Quantifying the influence of Chashma Right Bank Canal on land-use/land-cover and cropping pattern using remote sensing
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The goal of this research is to employ remote sensing to assess the influence of the Chashma Right Bank Canal (CRBC) on land-use/land-cover (LULC) changes and cropping patterns in the Dera Ismail Khan District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. LULC changes and cropping patterns were quantified using multi-temporal Landsat images from 1990 to 2018. Our finding revealed that between 1990 and 2018, agriculture, build-up, and water bodies increased by 52.22%, 5.44%, and 2.06% respectively, at the cost of decreasing barren land (50.27%), sand (5.05%), and shrubland (4.41%). Similarly, between 1997 and 2017, crop types such as sugarcane, and rice field increased by 19.77%, and 1.79%, whereas wheat decreased by 22.23%. We found that CRBC significantly altered the LULC of the study area, resulting in favorable changes in land-cover and cropping patterns, emphasizing the relevance of irrigation projects.

TI  - Deterministic seismic hazard and landslide hazard zonation of Arunachal Pradesh
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a seismically induced landslide hazard assessment for the state of Arunachal Pradesh, India, based on GIS techniques. A comprehensive earthquake catalog was prepared with data from various sources like USGS, ISC, etc., within a rectangular enclosure having a distance of 500 km in four cardinal directions from the Arunachal Pradesh state boundary. The catalog was homogenized in a unified moment magnitude scale. The earthquake data were collected for a period ranging from the 1500s to the year 2020. The earthquakes having a magnitude >= 4 are considered for this study as they are mainly responsible for inducing enough horizontal movement along the slopes for landslides. Considering the linear source model, the deterministic seismic hazard analysis was performed to estimate peak horizontal acceleration (PHA) at the bedrock level. The log-likelihood method was employed to decide the most efficient and reliable ground motion prediction equation (GMPE) for the Arunachal Pradesh region. Then peak ground acceleration (PGA) values generated at the surface due to the shaking of bedrock were calculated using a non-linear site amplification (considering the soil nature as B-type NHERP classification). The PGA values were considered to induce driving force on slopes, thus causing a landslide. The topographical slope map of Arunachal Pradesh was developed from CARTOSAT Digital Elevation Model Data (30m resolution). The study region was divided into 50 x 50 m(2) grids. The seismically induced landslide hazard assessment was performed using Newmark's methodology using PGA values and slope angles at the center of each grid. The critical factor of safety necessary to counter the landslide for corresponding PGA values was determined, and its spatial variation in the state is presented as contour maps. For any grid point in the study region, if the in-situ (available) static factor of safety is higher than the static factor of safety necessary to counter the landslide as predicted in the current study, that slope is regarded to be safe.

TI  - Mapping of <i>Prosopis juliflora</i> rate of expansion and developing species-specific allometric equations to estimate its aboveground biomass in the dry land of Ethiopia
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Prosopis juliflora, one of the most invasive species in arid and semi-arid environments, can sequester considerable amounts of carbon and provide fuel wood for domestic consumption. However, the lack of species-specific allometric models limits efforts to estimate forest biomass and its potential to store carbon. We conducted this study to determine the rate of expansion of this Prosopis in arid environments and develop robust allometric models to precisely predict tree-level biomass and its carbon storage potential. The satellite image analysis showed that Prosopis continues to expand rapidly along riverbanks and accounted for 69% of the available vegetation cover in the study area. The spatial coverage of Prosopis increased by 40% within 5 years from 2016 to 2021 and has been expanding at a rate of 8% per year. The rate of Prosopis expansion calls for the application of new utilization systems like massive charcoal production which may be a great blessing to the region. For such purpose, quantification of the biomass of Prosopis from easily measured variables is essential. Hence, after destructive sampling of 45 individual trees, the relationships between three variables (diameter at stump height, DSH; height, H; and wood density, rho) and their total biomass of the aboveground parts were used to fit regression models in R software. These models were developed using DSH alone, DSH and height or in a combination of DSH, H and rho. Although DSH alone explained most of the variations (91%), adding H and rho as additional independent variables resulted in a much better prediction of biomass estimation with the lowest values of bias. Therefore, the best-selected model for the above-ground biomass (AGB) estimation of the species Prosopis is M9 (AGB = exp(-3.053 + 0.919 x ln(DSH2 x H x rho)) which presented the highest adj. R-2 value (0.985) and the lowest values of Akaike information criteria. Given narrow diameter ranges, the model can be applied beyond their valid data ranges and to other similar growth forms across the arid regions of Ethiopia.

TI  - De novo or secondary metastatic prostate cancer management in France: Observational study from "sentinel multidisciplinary meeting" of the French Association of Urology
T2  - PROGRES EN UROLOGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction. - Metastatic prostate cancer (mPCa) is an heterogeneous disease. Metachronous mPCa (MM) seems to have a better prognosis than synchronous mPCa (SM). However, it is difficult to analyze their specificities from national registries. Data from the so-called "sentinel multidisciplinary meeting" (SMDM) would represent a "real life" data collection. The objective of this national pilot study was to evaluate the concept of SMDM through the description and comparison of the diagnosis, management and follow-up of patients with synchronous or metachronous mPCa in 2018.Methods. - A survey covering clinical, biological, radiological data as welt as treatment initiated and follow-up at 3 and 6 months was sent to the SMDM. All patients diagnosed with metastatic disease (SM or MM) between 01/01/2018 and 11/30/2018 were included.Results. - In total, 780 patients from 39 centers were included, 408 SM and 372 MM. SM were more symptomatic and had a higher metastatic burden than MM. PET were mostly performed in MM without a prior standard staging. SM patients received more chemotherapy than MM patients whereas new generation androgen deprivation therapy was mostly given to MM patients. At 6 months, there were no more significant difference in clinical presentation between the two groups.Conclusion. - Specificities of SM and MM patients in terms of clinical presentation, metastatic burden and management were described, validating the concept of SMDM as a source of reliable informations.

TI  - AEROsol generic classification using a novel Satellite remote sensing Approach (AEROSA)
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerous studies (hereafter GA: general approach studies) have been made to classify aerosols into desert dust (DD), biomass-burning (BB), clean continental (CC), and clean maritime (CM) types using only aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Angstrom exponent (AE). However, AOD represents the amount of aerosol suspended in the atmospheric column while the AE is a qualitative indicator of the size distribution of the aerosol estimated using AOD measurements at different wavelengths. Therefore, these two parameters do not provide sufficient information to unambiguously classify aerosols into these four types. Evaluation of the performance of GA classification applied to AErosol Robotic NETwork (AERONET) data, at sites for situations with known aerosol types, provides many examples where the GA method does not provide correct results. For example, a thin layer of haze was classified as BB and DD outside the crop burning and dusty seasons respectively, a thick layer of haze was classified as BB, and aerosols from known crop residue burning events were classified as DD, CC, and CM by the GA method. The results also show that the classification varies with the season, for example, the same range of AOD and AE were observed during a dust event in the spring (20th March 2012) and a smog event in the autumn (2nd November 2017). The results suggest that only AOD and AE cannot precisely classify the exact nature (i.e., DD, BB, CC, and CM) of aerosol types without incorporating more optical and physical properties. An alternative approach, AEROsol generic classification using a novel Satellite remote sensing Approach (AEROSA), is proposed to provide aerosol amount and size information using AOD and AE, respectively, from the Terra-MODIS (MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) Collection 6.1 Level 2 combined Dark Target and Deep Blue (DTB) product and AERONET Version 3 Level 2.0 data. Although AEROSA is also based on AOD and AE, it does not claim the nature of aerosol types, instead providing information on aerosol amount and size. The purpose is to introduce AEROSA for those researchers who are interested in the generic classification of aerosols based on AOD and AE, without claiming the exact aerosol types such as DD, BB, CC, and CM. AEROSA not only provides 9 generic aerosol classes for all observations but can also accommodate variations in location and season, which GA aerosol types do not.

TI  - Predictive factors of melanoma thickness
T2  - ANAIS BRASILEIROS DE DERMATOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Melanoma thickness is a relevant prognostic marker that is crucial for staging and its calculation relies on the histopathological examination. There is a risk of thickness underestimation with an incisional biopsy if the latter is not performed on a tumor area where the thickness is maximal. This occurrence may have an impact on a therapeutic decision, particularly regarding the excision margins and the need for sentinel lymph node biopsy.Objective: To assess the association between melanoma thickness and dermoscopic, demographic, epidemiological and clinical variables, aiming to identify predictive factors of thickness >1 mm.Methods: This was an observational and cross-sectional study, carried out on patients diagnosed with melanoma, from a single center over a time span of four years. Anatomopathological (thickness), dermoscopic, demographic, epidemiological, and clinical variables were collected. The associations between the variables with melanoma thickness were assessed.Results: A total of 119 patients were included. The presence of atypical vessels on the dermoscopic examination was an independent predictive factor of thickness >1 mm. Conversely, an atypical reticular pattern predicted melanoma thickness <1 mm. The presence of ephelides and a previous history of sunburn were also associated with melanomas thinner than 1 mm in the univariate analysis.Study limitations: The lack of data related to some variables and the absence of an optimal correlation between the dermoscopic and the anatomopathological examination constituted study limitations.Conclusion: An atypical vascular pattern on dermoscopy is associated with thickness >1 mm, helping with the choice of the optimal site to perform an incisional biopsy when an excisional biopsy is not feasible.

TI  - Post-typhoon forest damage estimation using multiple vegetation indices and machine learning models
T2  - WEATHER AND CLIMATE EXTREMES
M3  - Article
AB  - The frequency and intensity of typhoons have increased due to climate change. These climate change-induced disasters have caused widespread damage to forests. Evaluation of the effects of typhoons on forest ecosys-tems is often complex and challenging, mainly because of their sporadic nature. In this paper, we compared existing forest damage estimation techniques with the goal of identifying their respective advantages and suit-able use cases. We considered Hokkaido in northern Japan as a case study, where three typhoons successively struck in 2016 and led to forest destruction. Forest damage was estimated from Landsat 8 imagery by three approaches, namely using vegetation damage indices (DVDI, DNDVI and & UDelta;EVI), using supervised classification with Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) and finally by using the commercial CLASlite software with built-in methods to detect forest disturbance. Machine learning classifiers obtained the highest damage assessment accuracy, but intensive computation and complex processing steps were required. The RF and SVM classifiers gave the highest accuracies when using Fractional Cover as a predictor variable (Overall Accuracy = 80.36% in both cases, and ROC AUC values of 0.89 and 0.88, respectively.) Among the vegetation damage indices, DNDVI produced the highest accuracy (AUC = 0.85, OA = 77.68%).The most damaged areas were on the windward slopes, where forest patches were exposed to the brunt of the typhoon winds. Forest damage also peaked at the highest elevations in the study area, possibly representing exposed hilltops. Methods and findings presented in this study can help stakeholders to implement more effective forest damage monitoring after typhoons and other extreme weather events in the future.

TI  - Assessment and Prediction of Urban Expansion Using CA-Based SLEUTH Urban Growth Model: A Case Study of Kolkata Metropolitan Area (KMA), West Bengal, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Unplanned and rapidly increasing urbanization has been observed worldwide, especially in developing countries which causes manifest many environmental issues. The Indian cities have experienced rapid urban growth due to increased population, migration activities, economic development, capitalization, and rising of services and amenities over the last few decades which would led to the expansion of the city structure toward peri-urban areas. Therefore, it causes environmental degradation like landscape fragmentation, adverse effects on urban ecological balance, urban climate change, etc. This paper aims to study the spatiotemporal urban dynamics of the Kolkata Metropolitan Area (KMA) in terms of urban development trends over the year 2031. The research study has focused on land use/land cover change and incorporated it with an open-source SLEUTH model to predict future urban scenarios. SLEUTH was applied two two parts of KMA such as North KMA and South KMA to compare the urban growth. The model initiation with calibration showed a high value of the spreading coefficient indicating the organic type of growth has happened. New urban centers have grown along with the road networks in the northern part of KMA. Spontaneous growth is noticed in the study area. Urban growth is spreading toward the peripheral areas of Kolkata city over the periods. Therefore, the city and suburban areas have become compact. SLEUTH urban growth model can be considered as a planning-oriented model that would help planners to plan the Kolkata agglomeration city based on future scenarios. Sustainable policies can be introduced in those areas where the compact urbanization challenges are more.

TI  - Assessing evapotranspiration in a lettuce crop with a two-source energy balance model
T2  - IRRIGATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Winter vegetables, including lettuce, are a significant consumptive use of water in the Lower Colorado River Basin. Precise irrigation management is needed to increase water use efficiency and reduce the negative impacts of suboptimal irrigation, including nutrient leaching, crop stress, and crop pathogens. However, lettuce has multiple features that make accurate evapotranspiration (ET) modeling difficult, including asynchronicity with meteorological evaporative demand, short growing seasons, and a shallow root zone that increases the risk of using an incorrect ET value. To improve ET modeling and understand applied irrigation effectiveness for lettuce in this region, we used an energy and water balance bio-physical model, Backward-Averaged Iterative Two-Source Surface temperature and energy balance Solution (BAITSSS) on arid farmlands in the lower Colorado River basin. The study was conducted between 2016 and 2020 at twelve eddy covariance (EC) sites in lettuce with a wide range of soil physical properties. BAITSSS was implemented using ground-based weather and irrigation data, and remote sensing-based vegetation indices (Sentinel-2). The model accuracy varied among sites, with a mean cumulative seasonal ET of similar to 3% and mean RMSE of 1.1 mm d(-1) when compared to EC. The results showed that accurate timing and amount of applied water (irrigation and precipitation) were critical to capturing ET spikes right after irrigation and tracking the continuous decrease of ET. This study highlighted the dominant factors that influence the ET of lettuce and how BAITSSS can improve ET modeling for irrigation management.

TI  - Black carbon and particulate matter mass concentrations in the Metropolitan District of Caracas, Venezuela: An assessment of temporal variation and contributing sources
T2  - ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric aerosols play an important role in atmospheric processes and human health. Characterizing atmospheric aerosols and identifying their sources in large cities is relevant to propose site-specific air pollution mitigation strategies. In this study, we measured the mass concentration of atmospheric aerosols with an aerodynamic diameter smaller than 2.5 mm (PM2.5) in the city of Caracas (urban) and in a tropical montane cloud forest (suburban site, located in a mountainous area 11 km far from Caracas) between June 2018 and October 2019. We also measured equivalent black carbon (eBC) mass concentration in PM2.5 in Caracas during the same period. Our goal is to assess PM2.5 and eBC temporal variation and identify their major sources in the area. eBC showed a pronounced diurnal cycle in the urban site, mainly modulated by traffic circulation and the diurnal changes of the mixing layer height. In contrast, PM2.5 showed stable median values during the day with slight variations like that of eBC. In the forest site, PM2.5 values were higher in the afternoons due to the convective transport of aerosols from Caracas and other surrounding urban areas located in adjacent valleys. The annual median for eBC and PM2.5 was 1.6 and 9.2 mg m(-3), respectively, in the urban site, while PM2.5 in the forest site was 6.6 mg m(-3). To our knowledge, these are the first measurements of this type in the northernmost area of South America. eBC and PM2.5 sources identification during wet and dry seasons was obtained by percentiles of the conditional bivariate probability function (CBPF). CBPF showed seasonal variations of eBC and PM2.5 sources and that their contributions are higher during the dry season. Biomass burning events are a relevant contributing source of aerosols for both sites of measurements inferred by fire pixels from satellite data, the national fire department's statistics data, and backward trajectories. Our results indicate that biomass burning might affect the atmosphere on a regional scale, contribute to regional warming, and have implications for local and regional air quality and, therefore, human health.

TI  - Surface deformation simulation for InSAR detection using a machine learning approach on the hantangang river volcanic field: A case study on the orisan mountain
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent developments in remote sensing research have resulted in a large amount of variability in the data provided by researchers. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a tool used to measure surface deformation and assess changes in the Earth's surface. Here, we consider the usefulness of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) in assessing past volcanic activity as a key to learning the characteristics of the deformation around a volcano. The Hantangang River volcanic field (HRVF) is a geoheritage site in the Korean Peninsula that has interesting geological characteristics. This volcanic field has formed along 110 km of the paleochannel of the Hantangang River. Since the eruptions occurred from 0.15 to 0.51 Ma, the source is limited, which has raised interest in the assessment of volcanic landforms. The recent integration of machine learning and InSAR processing has shown promising results for many purposes, such as classifying, modeling, and detecting surface deformation. To examine the future impact based on information from the past, we utilized a synthetic interferogram with the Okada model and transferred it to a machine learning algorithm. The synthetic interferogram was formed based on Sentinel-1 C-band satellite data to simulate the deformation phases. The orbital errors, the topographical data errors, and the atmospheric effect were also simulated and added to the synthetic interferogram to enrich the learning input. A convolutional neural network (CNN) trained with the unwrapped simulated interferogram data and its performance was evaluated. Our proposed method exhibits the capability to detect volcanic activity's deformation patterns with synthetic interferogram data. The results show that an overall accuracy of more than 80% was achieved using the CNN algorithms on the validation dataset. This study is the first to use machine learning approaches for detecting prehistorical volcanic deformation and demonstrates potential techniques for developing an approach based on satellite imagery. In addition, this study has introduced the possibility of developing a rapid detection of surface deformation using InSAR data based on a machine learning approach.

TI  - The modern Epimetheus: Carl Schmitt's katechontism as reactionary chronopolitics
T2  - FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper deals with the reactionary form of chronopolitics that characterizes the work of the German jurist, political theorist, and radical conservative intellectual Carl Schmitt (1888-1985). Called both the latest classic of political thought and the Crown Jurist of the Third Reich, Schmitt remains a controversial figure, not least because of his practical support of the Nazi regime and his authoritarianism. Another controversial aspect of Schmitt's work are his unabashed and outspoken references to theology as a resource for legal and political thought. Many commentators regard Schmitt's support for the Nazi regime, his general authoritarianism, and his recourse to theology as expressions of an apocalyptic worldview that is taken to form the basis for his alleged decisionism. This in turn matches an analysis of twentieth-century totalitarianisms as constituting innerworldly forms of radical millenarian faith. However, the structure of Schmitt's politico-theological reason should be understood in a very different way. Rather than affirming the apocalyptic and millenarian energies of totalitarian movements, Schmitt attempted to formulate a theory aimed at containing them and averting their revolutionary fervor in defense of the state. At the heart of this endeavor was the Biblical figure of the katechon, "the restrainer" of the Antichrist and lawlessness as described in the Second Letter to the Thessalonians. Focusing particularly on a short but dense essay published in 1950, the paper lays bare the basis for Schmitt's avertive apocalypticism, or katechontism, which can be regarded as the politico-theological emblem of what Schmitt himself in contrast to decisionism described as concrete order thinking. The form of reactionary chronopolitics Schmitt expresses there is analyzed with the help of theories of modern historical temporality and contextualized through his own references to contemporary conservative thinkers like Hans Freyer, Karl Lowith, and Konrad Weiss.

AB  - Oysters have been extensively employed for monitoring of metal pollution in dynamic aquatic ecosystems. Therefore, the use of specific biomarkers can assist in discriminating the ecotoxicological implications of different elements in such complex environments. In this study, we revisited the sequencing data of gills and digestive glands transcripts in the mangrove oyster Crassostrea gasar and generated a reference transcriptome assembly from multiple assemblers, seven in total. Overall, we were able to identify a total of 11,917 transcripts, with 86.6% of them being functionally annotated and 1.4 times more than the first annotation. We screened the annotated transcripts to identify genes potentially involved in metals' transport, storage, and detoxification. Our findings included genes related to Zn distribution in cells (Zn transporters -ZIP, ZnT), metallothionein (MT-I and MT-IV), GSH biosynthesis, Ca+ transporter (NCX and ATP2B), and Cu distribution in cells (ATP7, ATOX1, CCS, and laccase-like). These results provided a reference transcriptome for additional insights into the transcriptional profile of C. gasar and other bivalves to better understand the molecular pathways underpinning metal tolerance and susceptibility. The study also provided an auxiliary tool for biomonitoring metal contamination in dynamic environments as estuaries.

TI  - Evaluating NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> emissions and their effect on O<sub>3</sub> production in Texas using TROPOMI NO<sub>2</sub> and HCHO
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on the Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) satellite is a valuable source of information to monitor the NOx emissions that adversely affect air quality. We conduct a series of experiments using a 4 x 4 km(2) Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions (CAMx) simulation during April-September 2019 in eastern Texas to evaluate the multiple challenges that arise from reconciling the NO(x)( )emissions in model simulations with TROPOMI. We find an increase in NO2 (+17 % in urban areas) when transitioning from the TROPOMI NO2 version 1.3 algorithm to the version 2.3.1 algorithm in eastern Texas, with the greatest difference (+25 %) in the city centers and smaller differences (+5 %) in less polluted areas. We find that lightning NOx emissions in the model simulation contribute up to 24 % of the column NO2 in the areas over the Gulf of Mexico and 8% in Texas urban areas. NOx emissions inventories, when using locally resolved inputs, agree with NOx emissions derived from TROPOMI NO2 version 2.3.1 to within 20 % in most circumstances, with a small NOx underestimate in Dallas-Fort Worth (-13 %) and Houston (-20 %). In the vicinity of large power plant plumes (e.g., Martin Lake and Limestone) we find larger disagreements, i.e., the satellite NO2 is consistently smaller by 40 %-60 % than the modeled NO2, which incorporates measured stack emissions. We find that TROPOMI is having difficulty distinguishing NO2 attributed to power plants from the background NO2 concentrations in Texas - an area with atmospheric conditions that cause short NO2 lifetimes. Second, the NOx/NO2 ratio in the model may be underestimated due to the 4 km grid cell size. To understand ozone formation regimes in the area, we combine NO2 column information with formaldehyde (HCHO) column information. We find modest low biases in the model relative to TROPOMI HCHO, with -9 % underestimate in eastern Texas and -21 % in areas of central Texas with lower biogenic volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions. Ozone formation regimes at the time of the early afternoon overpass are NOx limited almost everywhere in the domain, except along the Houston Ship Channel, near the Dallas/Fort Worth International airport, and in the presence of undiluted power plant plumes. There are likely NOx-saturated ozone formation conditions in the early morning hours that TROPOMI cannot observe and would be well-suited for analysis with NO2 and HCHO from the upcoming TEMPO (Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring Pollution) mission. This study highlights that TROPOMI measurements offer a valuable means to validate emissions inventories and ozone formation regimes, with important limitations.

TI  - Abrupt drainage of Lago Greve, a large proglacial lake in Chilean Patagonia, observed by satellite in 2020
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacial lakes are increasing in number and extent under a warming climate. Despite demand for lake monitoring and understanding outburst mechanisms, studies of large outburst events are sparse. Here we report an outburst of Lago Greve, a large proglacial lake in Chilean Patagonia. During the event in April-July 2020, the lake level dropped by 18.3 +/- 1.2 m and the area decreased by 14.5 +/- 0.02 km(2). The total water discharge was 3.7 +/- 0.2 km(3), which is one of the largest glacial lake outbursts ever reported in satellite era. Satellite data indicated the collapse of a bump near the lake outlet triggered the event, by initiating erosion of the bank and bed of the outlet stream. Satellite gravimetry captured a signal of the event, although the magnitude of the corresponding mass change was inconsistent with the drained water mass. Our study demonstrated the potential for observing lake outburst using satellite imagery, altimetry, photogrammetry, and gravimetry.An April 2020 glacial lake outburst flood from Lago Greve, Chilean Patagonia, released approximately 3.7 +/- 0.2 km(3) of water, according to space-borne altimetry and optical observations, and represents one of the largest such events of the satellite era.

TI  - Improving aboveground biomass estimation of natural forests on the Tibetan Plateau using spaceborne LiDAR and machine learning algorithms
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural forests have the most complex structure and richest biodiversity among terrestrial ecosystems and are essential for maintaining the carbon balance and stability of the biosphere. Aboveground biomass (AGB) is a primary indicator used to evaluate forests and can directly measure forest growth and the quality of natural forests. Accurate and rapid AGB estimations can significantly improve the efficiency of forest management and deepen the understanding of the forest carbon cycle. The Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2), one of the most recently launched spaceborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) instruments, can penetrate forest canopies and obtain accurate, large-scale forest vertical parameter measurements. However, the discrete footprints offered by ICESat-2 cannot provide comprehensive spatial AGB distribution data. In this study, an optimized extreme learning machine (ELM) method was proposed to estimate the AGB of natural forests on the eastern Qinghai-Xizang Plateau, China. The synthetic Sentinel-2 images acquired from the Google Earth Engine (GEE) were synergized with ICESat-2 to realize continuous AGB mapping. To verify the effectiveness of the optimized method, support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (kNN), and backpropagation (BP) neural network models were also established for comparison. The measured AGB data extracted from the forest management inventory (FMI) were used for model accuracy evaluation. The results show that the optimized ELM achieved the best estimation effect among all the analyzed models, with an R-2 value of 0.68 and a root mean square error (RMSE) value of 25.14 mg/ha. The optimized ELM obtained the minimum RMSE and greatly improved the AGB prediction efficiency. These findings prove the ability of ICESat-2 in estimating the AGB of natural forests, which can provide a new way for large-scale forest resources investigation in high-altitude areas with a harsh environment.

TI  - The ECRG4 cleavage product augurin binds the endotoxin receptor and influences the innate immune response during otitis media
T2  - FRONTIERS IN GENETICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Otitis media (OM), the most common disease of childhood, is typically characterized by bacterial infection of the middle ear (ME). Prominent features of OM include hyperplasia of the ME mucosa, which transforms from a monolayer of simple squamous epithelium with minimal stroma into a full-thickness respiratory epithelium in 2-3 days after infection. Analysis of the murine ME transcriptome during OM showed down-regulation of the tumor suppressor gene Ecrg4 that was temporally related to mucosal hyperplasia and identified stromal cells as the primary ECRG4 source. The reduction in Ecrg4 gene expression coincided with the cleavage of ECRG4 protein to release an extracellular fragment, augurin. The duration of mucosal hyperplasia during OM was greater in Ecrg4 ( -/- ) mice, the number of infiltrating macrophages was enhanced, and ME infection cleared more rapidly. ECRG4-null macrophages showed increased bacterial phagocytosis. Co-immunoprecipitation identified an association of augurin with TLR4, CD14 and MD2, the components of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) receptor. The results suggest that full-length ECRG4 is a sentinel molecule that potentially inhibits growth of the ME stroma. Processing of ECRG4 protein during inflammation, coupled with a decline in Ecrg4 gene expression, also influences the behavior of cells that do not express the gene, limiting the production of growth factors by epithelial and endothelial cells, as well as the activity of macrophages.

TI  - The promising roles of macrophages in geriatric hip fracture
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CELL AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - As aging becomes a global burden, the incidence of hip fracture (HF), which is the most common fracture in the elderly population and can be fatal, is rapidly increasing, and its extremely high fatality rate places significant medical and financial burdens on patients. Fractures trigger a complex set of immune responses, and recent studies have shown that with aging, the immune system shows decreased activity or malfunctions in a process known as immune senescence, leading to disease and death. These phenomena are the reasons why elderly individuals typically exhibit chronically low levels of inflammation and increased rates of infection and chronic disease. Macrophages, which are key players in the inflammatory response, are critical in initiating the inflammatory response, clearing pathogens, controlling the innate and adaptive immune responses and repairing damaged tissues. Tissue-resident macrophages (TRMs) are widely present in tissues and perform immune sentinel and homeostatic functions. TRMs are combinations of macrophages with different functions and phenotypes that can be directly influenced by neighboring cells and the microenvironment. They form a critical component of the first line of defense in all tissues of the body. Immune system disorders caused by aging could affect the biology of macrophages and thus the cascaded immune response after fracture in various ways. In this review, we outline recent studies and discuss the potential link between monocytes and macrophages and their potential roles in HF in elderly individuals.

TI  - Comparing Outcomes of the Veterans Health Administration's Traumatic Brain Injury and Mental Health Screening Programs: Types and Frequency of Specialty Services Used
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROTRAUMA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) screens veterans who deployed in support of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq for traumatic brain injury (TBI) and mental health (MH) disorders. Chronic symptoms after mild TBI overlap with MH symptoms, for which there are already established screens within the VHA. It is unclear whether the TBI screen facilitates treatment for appropriate specialty care over and beyond the MH screens. Our primary objective was to determine whether TBI screening is associated with different types (MH, Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation [PM&R], and Neurology) and frequency of specialty services compared with the MH screens. A retrospective cohort design examined veterans receiving VHA care who were screened for both TBI and MH disorders between Fiscal Year (FY) 2007 and FY 2018 (N = 241,136). We calculated service utilization counts in MH, PM&R, and Neurology in the six months after the screens. Zero-inflated negative binomial regression models of encounters (counts) were fit separately by specialty care type and for a total count of specialty services. We found that screening positive for TBI resulted in 2.38 times more specialty service encounters than screening negative for TBI. Compared with screening positive for MH only, screening positive for both MH and TBI resulted in 1.78 times more specialty service encounters and 1.33 times more MH encounters. The TBI screen appears to increase use of MH, PM&R, and Neurology services for veterans with post-deployment health concerns, even in those also identified as having a possible MH disorder.

TI  - Association Study between the Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy and the Clinicopathological Features of Patients with Cervical Cancer
T2  - DISEASE MARKERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. The incidence of cervical cancer is increasing year by year, which seriously threatens the health of female patients. This study is aimed at investigating the association of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) with clinicopathological features in cervical cancer patients. Methods. Patients diagnosed with cervical cancer in our hospital from February 1, 2019, to June 30, 2021, were selected as the research subjects. Statistical analysis was performed on the SLN examination of patients with cervical cancer with different pathological characteristics and the correlation between the positive rate of SLN detection and the pathological characteristics of cervical cancer. Results. A total of 59 patients with cervical cancer were included in this study, the SLNB detection rate was 94.92%, 15 patients had lymph node metastasis, and the metastasis rate was 25.42% confirmed by histopathology. Thirteen of them had SLN metastases, and the other 2 had non-SLN metastases. The sensitivity of SLNB was 86.67%, and the false negative rate was 13.33%. Statistical analysis results showed that there was no significant difference in the positive rate of SLN among cervical cancer patients with different FIGO stages, pathological types, degree of differentiation, depth of invasion, and tumor size. In addition, the results of Pearson's correlation analysis showed that the positive rate of SLN was not significantly correlated with the FIGO stage, pathological type, degree of differentiation, depth of invasion, and tumor size of cervical cancer. Conclusion. SLNB has a high sensitivity, safety, and feasibility in the diagnosis and evaluation of lymph node metastasis in cervical cancer. There is no significant correlation between SLNB and the clinicopathological features of cervical cancer.

TI  - Estimating ground-level PM<sub>2.5</sub> over Bangkok Metropolitan Region in Thailand using aerosol optical depth retrieved by MODIS
T2  - AIR QUALITY ATMOSPHERE AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - A number of previous studies have shown that statistical model with a combination of satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) and PM2.5 measured by the monitoring stations could be applied to predict spatial ground-level PM2.5 concentration, but few studies have been conducted in Thailand. This study aimed to estimate ground-level PM2.5 over the Bangkok Metropolitan Region in 2020 using linear regression model that incorporates the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) AOD measurements and other air pollutants, as well as various meteorological factors and greenness indicators into the model. The 12-fold cross-validation technique was used to examine the accuracy of model performance. The annual mean (standard deviation) concentration of observed PM2.5 was 22.37 (+/- 12.55) mu g/m(3) and the mean (standard deviation) of PM2.5 during summer, winter, and rainy season was 18.36 (+/- 7.14) mu g/m(3), 33.60 (+/- 14.48) mu g/m(3), and 15.30 (+/- 4.78) mu g/m(3), respectively. The cross-validation yielded R-2 of 0.48, 0.55, 0.21, and 0.52 with the average of predicted PM2.5 concentration of 22.25 (+/- 9.97) mu g/m(3), 21.68 (+/- 9.14) mu g/m(3), 29.43 (+/- 9.45) mu g/m(3), and 15.74 (+/- 5.68) mu g/m(3) for the year round, summer, winter, and rainy season, respectively. We also observed that integrating NO2 and O-3 into the regression model improved the prediction accuracy significantly for a year round, summer, winter, and rainy season over the Bangkok Metropolitan Region. In conclusion, estimating ground-level PM2.5 concentration from the MODIS AOD measurement using linear regression model provided the satisfactory model performance when incorporating many possible predictor variables that would affect the association between MODIS AOD and PM2.5 concentration.

TI  - Optimized 1D-CNN model for medicinal Psyllium Husk crop mapping with temporal optical satellite data
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep Learning models are preferred for complex image analysis-based solutions to application-oriented prob-lems. However, the architecture of such models largely influences the results which includes several hyper -parameters that need to be tuned. This study aims at developing an optimized 1D-CNN model for medicinal Psyllium Husk crop mapping using open source temporal optical Sentinel-2A/2B satellite data. In this study, a sequential 1D-CNN model architecture was developed by optimizing hyperparameters which includes convo-lution layers, number of neurons, activation function, and batch size. Psyllium Husk crop fields were mapped in the Jalore district of Rajasthan using Sentinel 2A/ 2B (10 m) optical data. For spectral dimensionality reduction of the data, Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI2) was used to maintain the data dimensionality since temporal data was utilized. The dataset was subsequently refined to include the target crop's specific phenological stages that distinguish it from other closely resembling species. The information corresponding to these specific crop stages was fed to the 1D-CNN model to carry out the classification. A range of training sample sizes were explored to determine the optimal number of training data points. As the output from the model, fractional images are obtained consisting of values proportional to the probability of a pixel lying in the target class. Accuracy assessment was carried out using fuzzy error matrix (FERM) by generating fractional output images from temporal optical PlanetScope data (3m) which was used as a reference. The best overall accuracy among the test cases came out to be 89.85% using conventional MSAVI2 with 1000 training samples.

TI  - Multisource forest inventories: A model-based approach using <i>k</i>-NN to reconcile forest attributes statistics and map products
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest map products are widely used and have taken benefit from progresses in the multisource forest inventory approaches, which are meant to improve the precision of forest inventory estimates at high spatial resolution. However, estimating errors of pixel-wise predictions remains difficult, and reconciling statistical outcomes with map products is still an open and important question. We address this problem using an original approach relying on a model-based inference framework and k -nearest neighbours (k-NN) models to produce pixel-wise estimations and related quality assessment. Our approach takes advantage of the resampling properties of a model-based estimator and combines it with geometrical convex-hull models to measure respectively the precision and accuracy of pixel predictions. A measure of pixel reliability was obtained by combining precision and accuracy. The study was carried out over a 7,694 km2 area dominated by structurally complex broadleaved forests in centre of France. The targeted forest attributes were growing stock volume, basal area and growing stock volume increment. A total of 819 national forest inventory plots were combined with auxiliary data extracted from a forest map, Landsat 8 images, and 3D point clouds from both airborne laser scanning and digital aerial photo-grammetry. k-NN models were built independently for both 3D data sources. Both selected models included 5 auxiliary variables, and were generated using 5 neighbours, and most similar neighbours distance measure. The models showed relative root mean square error ranging from 35.7% (basal area, digital aerial photogrammetry) in calibration to 63.4% (growing stock volume increment, airborne laser scanning) in the validation set. At pixel level, we found that a minimum of 86.4% of the predictions were of high precision as their bootstrapped co-efficient of variation fall below calibration's relative root mean square error. The amount of extrapolation varied from 4.3% (digital aerial photogrammetry) to 6.3% (airborne laser scanning). A relationship was found between extrapolation and k-NN distance, opening new opportunities to correct extrapolation errors. At the population level, airborne laser scanning and digital aerial photogrammetry performed similarly, offering the possibility to use digital aerial photogrammetry for monitoring purposes. The proposed method provided consistent estimates of forest attributes and maps, and also provided spatially explicit information about pixel predictions in terms of precision, accuracy and reliability. The method therefore produced high resolution outputs, significant for either decision making or forest management purposes.

TI  - Extranodal extension, an international survey on its evaluation and reporting in breast cancer patients
T2  - PATHOLOGY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Lymph node metastasis is the most important prognostic factor for breast cancer patients. In addition to the number of nodes involved and the largest metastatic focus, extranodal extension (ENE) is also used to subclassify breast cancer patients into different risk groups. More recently, pathologists are required to report the size/extent of ENE per the new CAP guideline, as it seems to be associated with more axillary nodal burden and/or a worse prognosis. Although the definition of ENE is largely understood and agreed upon among pathologists around the world, evaluation and reporting for the size of ENE are not. To understand current practice, we conducted an international survey among pathologists who are interested in breast pathology. A total of 70 pathologists responded. The results showed that (1) 98% of the participants reported the presence or absence of ENE and 61% also reported the size of ENE in millimeter (mm). (2) There was no uniform method of measuring the size of ENE; 47% measured the largest dimension regardless of orientation, while 30% measured the largest perpendicular distance from the capsule. (3) The most common factors affecting the accuracy in diagnosis of ENE are the presence of lymphovascular invasion (LVI), lack of capsule integrity, and the presence of fatty hilar or fatty replacement of a lymph node. (4) 71% felt that the H&E stain is adequate to evaluate ENE, deeper levels and IHC analysis for vascular and cytokeratin markers can be helpful if needed. (5) 75% agreed that there is an urgent need to standardize the measurement and reporting for ENE. Our survey highlights the variation in ENE evaluation and the need for its standardization in breast cancer patients with axillary node metastasis.

T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Phycocyanin (PC) is an indicator pigment of cyanobacteria in water. Monitoring the dynamic variation of PC concentration in lakes by satellite remote sensing is of great significance for the effective prevention and control of cyanobacterial blooms (CBs). Few studies have quantitatively monitored the long-term PC concentration variation in water and explored the relationship between PC concentration and CBs based on the advantages of the high temporal and spectral resolution of Sentinel-3 OLCI images. In this study, a retrieval model of PC concentration suitable for Sentinel-3 OLCI images was constructed and applied to the Sentinel-3 image dataset from May 2016 to November 2021 to analyze the spatiotemporal PC concentration variations in Chaohu Lake of China. The factors influencing PC concentration and its indicative significance for CBs outbreak were also explored. The results show that the PC concentration retrieval model based on the gradient boosting regression algorithm has the best performance (R-2 = 0.86, root mean square error = 45.44 ug/L, and mean absolute percentage error = 26.27 %), which has great application potential in the retrieval of other water quality parameters. In summer and autumn, the PC concentration in western Chaohu Lake was higher than that in other lake parts, which was mainly related to the higher nutrient concentration and prevailing wind direction in this part. During 2016-2021, the average PC concentration in Chaohu Lake in 2019 was the highest, and that in 2017 was the lowest, mainly affected by air temperature and precipitation. The variation of PC concentration in Chaohu Lake has a high temporal consistency with the proportion of CBs area, and the PC concentration of 303.9 mu g/L is a necessary condition for CBs outbreak. This study revealed that Sentinel-3 OLCI images could provide a useful data source for high-frequency dynamic monitoring of PC concentrations in lakes and reservoirs, and the quantitative monitoring of PC concentrations in water has relevant indicative significance for early warning of CBs in inland water.

TI  - Decolonizing the Curriculum: Who Were the Ancient Europeans?
T2  - JOURNAL OF BLACK STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The current international decolonizing debate is floundering. Despite well intentioned optimism that the debate would lead to an interrogation of the current schooling system and deepen the taught curriculum beyond "Black history month" and the slave trade, this is not happening. "They (power structure/policy makers) don't want you to study ancient history because they want you to study slavery and colonialism to lock down your first frequency. The deeper they dig the blacker the planet.". The two focal points of this paper to address this theme are inter-related and analyze interpretations of the phrase "decolonizing the curriculum." They are, firstly, the European (white(1)) socially engineered paradigm which still dominates global education conceptualization, curriculum content, and teaching and learning models, and secondly, evidence of the natural migrations of Melanated populations out of Africa into Europe, including the United Kingdom. The paper draws upon the author's research of ancient material culture to provide the primordial evidence of advanced geometry in the British Isles, supported by Mazama's concept of a paradigm, its function, and change in worldview.

TI  - Imminent threat of rock-ice avalanches in High Mountain Asia
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Upsurge of glacier-related hazards in High Mountain Asia (HMA) has been evident in recent years due to global warming. While many glacial-related hazards are instantaneous, some large landslides were preceded by slow gravitational deformation, which can be predicted to evade catastrophes. Here, we present robust evidence of historical deformation in 2021 Chamoli rock-ice avalanche of Himalaya using space imaging techniques. Multi-temporal satellite data provide evidence of a precursor event in 2016 and expansion of a linear fracture along joint planes, indicating 2021 rock-ice avalanche is a retrogressive wedge failure. The deformation history shows that the fracture propagated at a velocity of similar to 0.07 m day(-1) until September 2020, and with an accelerated velocity (similar to 0.14 m day(-1) on average) lately. Analysis of recent similar cases in HMA supported our inference on global warming-induced glacier retreat and thermomechanical effects in enhancing the weakening of fractured rock masses in tectonically active mountain belts. Recent advances in Earth observation and seismic monitoring system can offer clues to the location and timing of impending catastrophic failures in high mountain regions.

TI  - Application of machine learning algorithms in predicting HIV infection among men who have sex with men: Model development and validation
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundContinuously growing of HIV incidence among men who have sex with men (MSM), as well as the low rate of HIV testing of MSM in China, demonstrates a need for innovative strategies to improve the implementation of HIV prevention. The use of machine learning algorithms is an increasing tendency in disease diagnosis prediction. We aimed to develop and validate machine learning models in predicting HIV infection among MSM that can identify individuals at increased risk of HIV acquisition for transmission-reduction interventions. MethodsWe extracted data from MSM sentinel surveillance in Zhejiang province from 2018 to 2020. Univariate logistic regression was used to select significant variables in 2018-2019 data (P < 0.05). After data processing and feature selection, we divided the model development data into two groups by stratified random sampling: training data (70%) and testing data (30%). The Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied to solve the problem of unbalanced data. The evaluation metrics of model performance were comprised of accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Then, we explored three commonly-used machine learning algorithms to compare with logistic regression (LR), including decision tree (DT), support vector machines (SVM), and random forest (RF). Finally, the four models were validated prospectively with 2020 data from Zhejiang province. ResultsA total of 6,346 MSM were included in model development data, 372 of whom were diagnosed with HIV. In feature selection, 12 variables were selected as model predicting indicators. Compared with LR, the algorithms of DT, SVM, and RF improved the classification prediction performance in SMOTE-processed data, with the AUC of 0.778, 0.856, 0.887, and 0.942, respectively. RF was the best-performing algorithm (accuracy = 0.871, precision = 0.960, recall = 0.775, F-measure = 0.858, and AUC = 0.942). And the RF model still performed well on prospective validation (AUC = 0.846). ConclusionMachine learning models are substantially better than conventional LR model and RF should be considered in prediction tools of HIV infection in Chinese MSM. Further studies are needed to optimize and promote these algorithms and evaluate their impact on HIV prevention of MSM.

TI  - Assessing the Clinical and Socioeconomic Burden of Respiratory Syncytial Virus in Children Aged Under 5 Years in Primary Care: Protocol for a Prospective Cohort Study in England and Report on the Adaptations of the Study to the COVID-19 Pandemic.
T2  - JMIR research protocols
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) commonly causes lower respiratory tract infections and hospitalization in children. In 2019-2020, the Europe-wide RSV ComNet standardized study protocol was developed to measure the clinical and socioeconomic disease burden of RSV infections among children aged <5 years in primary care. RSV has a recognized seasonality in England.OBJECTIVE: We aimed to describe (1) the adaptations of the RSV ComNet standardized study protocol for England and (2) the challenges of conducting the study during the COVID-19 pandemic.METHODS: This study was conducted by the Oxford-Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre-the English national primary care sentinel network. We invited all (N=248) general practices within the network that undertook virology sampling to participate in the study by recruiting eligible patients (registered population: n=3,056,583). Children aged <5 years with the following case definition of RSV infection were included in the study: those consulting a health care practitioner in primary care with symptoms meeting the World Health Organization's definition of acute respiratory illness or influenza-like illness who have laboratory-confirmed RSV infection. The parents/guardians of these cases were asked to complete 2 previously validated questionnaires (14 and 30 days postsampling). A sample size of at least 100 RSV-positive cases is required to estimate the percentage of children that consult in primary care who need hospitalization. Assuming a swab positivity rate of 20% in children aged <5 years, we estimated that 500 swabs are required. We adapted our method for the pandemic by extending sampling planned for winter 2020-2021 to a rolling data collection, allowing verbal consent and introducing home swabbing because of increased web-based consultations during the COVID-19 pandemic.RESULTS: The preliminary results of the data collection between International Organization for Standardization (ISO) weeks 1-41 in 2021 are described. There was no RSV detected in the winter of 2020-2021 through the study. The first positive RSV swab collected through the sentinel network in England was collected in ISO week 17 and then every week since ISO week 25. In total, 16 (N=248, 6.5%) of the virology-sampling practices volunteered to participate; these were high-sampling practices collecting the majority of eligible swabs across the sentinel network-200 (43.8%) out of 457 swabs, of which 54 (N=200, 27%) were positive for RSV.CONCLUSIONS: Measures to control the COVID-19 pandemic meant there was no circulating RSV last winter; however, RSV has circulated out of season, as detected by the sentinel network. The sentinel network practices have collected 40% (200/500) of the required samples, and 27% (54/200) were RSV positive. We have demonstrated the feasibility of implementing a European-standardized RSV disease burden study protocol in England during a pandemic, and we now need to recruit to this adapted protocol.INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): DERR1-10.2196/38026.

TI  - Analysis on geolocation error of FY-3D MERSI imaging
T2  - CHINESE SPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate gcolocation of Fengyun-3D(FY-3D) medium resolution spectral imager (MERSI) images improves the remote sensing performance. Given that the coastline of the images after gcolocating generates a periodically oscillating error in this stage, the gcolocation error was systemically analyzed based on the attitude and orbit control of satellites. Firstly, the FY-3D satellite's dynamic model and the imaging model were established. Then, based on real images from the FY-3D/MERSI,the gcolocation errors resulting from the attitude and orbit control sub-system were analyzed. Finally, the source of geolocation error was validated in numerical simulations by comparing the results with real images. The study indicates that on-board attitude and orbit propagation errors and payload mounting error of the attitude and orbit control sub-system can cause the deviation of the imaging reference, thereby leading to the periodically oscillating error of the images after gcolocating.

TI  - Developing a new wind dataset by blending satellite data and WRF model wind predictions
T2  - RENEWABLE ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents an approach to improve wind datasets developed using the regional atmospheric model Weather Research Forecasting by combining its predictions with remotely sensed wind observations in enhanced wind speed analyses that leads to blended winds. In this study, satellite data derived from scatterometers, ra-diometers, and synthetic aperture radar are used. The spatial and temporal features of each wind product are thoroughly analysed. For the probabilistic evaluation of their skill, comprehensive comparisons with available buoy data are carried out. The statistical analysis shows that the combined use of satellite and numerical weather prediction model data improves the agreement with buoy measurements, demonstrating the added value of using the blended product. As an application of the method, new improved satellite wind speeds are presented in the form of a wind energy assessment along the Iberian coastal area. From inspection of the provided wind power maps, northern and central regions emerge as the most promising areas for wind harnessing offshore despite some seasonal variations. Finally, potential wind farm sites are provided, along with insights into multi-year wind speed distribution. The results show how the new dataset can be used for the selection of promising areas for wind exploitation.

TI  - Object-centered sensorimotor bias of torque control in the chronic stage following stroke
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - When lifting objects whose center of mass (CoM) are not centered below the handle one must compensate for arising external torques already at lift-off to avoid object tilt. Previous studies showed that finger force scaling during object lifting may be impaired at both hands following stroke. However, torque control in object manipulation has not yet been studied in patients with stroke. In this pilot study, thirteen patients with chronic stage left hemispheric stroke (SL), nine patients with right hemispheric stroke (SR) and hand-matched controls had to grasp and lift an object with the fingertips of their ipsilesional hand at a handle while preventing object tilt. Object CoM and therewith the external torque was varied by either relocating a covert weight or the handle. The compensatory torque at lift-off (Tcom) is the sum of the torque resulting from (1) grip force being produced at different vertical finger positions ( increment CoP x GF) and (2) different vertical load forces on both sides of the handle ( increment Fy x w/2). When having to rely on sensorimotor memories, increment CoP x GF was elevated when the object CoM was on the ipsilesional-, but decreased when CoM was on the contralesional side in SL, whereas increment Fy x w/2 was biased in the opposite direction, resulting in normal Tcom. SR patients applied a smaller increment CoP x GF when the CoM was on the contralesional side. Torques were not altered when geometric cues were available. Our findings provide evidence for an object-centered spatial bias of manual sensorimotor torque control with the ipsilesional hand following stroke reminiscent of premotor neglect. Both intact finger force-to-position coordination and visuomotor control may compensate for the spatial sensorimotor bias in most stroke patients. Future studies will have to confirm the found bias and evaluate the association with premotor neglect.

TI  - National Practice Patterns in the Management of the Regional Lymph Node Basin After Positive Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy for Cutaneous Melanoma
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Immediate completion lymph node dissection (CLND) for patients with sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis from cutaneous melanoma has been replaced largely by ultrasound nodal surveillance since the publication of two landmark trials in 2016 and 2017. National practice patterns of CLND remain poorly characterized. Methods Patients with a diagnosis of cutaneous melanoma in 2016 and 2018 without clinical nodal disease who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) were identified from the National Cancer Database (NCDB). Characteristics associated with CLND were analyzed by uni- and multivariate logistic regression. Overall survival (OS) was estimated using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards regression analyses. Results Of the 3517 patients included in the study, 1405 had disease diagnosed in 2016. The patients with cutaneous melanoma diagnosed in 2016 had a median age of 60 years and a tumor thickness of 2.3 mm compared to 62 years and 2.4 mm, respectively, for the patients with cutaneous melanoma diagnosed in 2018. According to the NCDB, 40 % (n = 559) of the patients underwent CLND in 2016 compared with 6 % (n = 132) in 2018. The factors associated with receipt of CLND in 2018 included younger age (odds ratio [OR], 0.97; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0.95-0.99; p = 0.001), rural residence (OR, 3.96; 95 % CI, 1.50-10.49; p = 0.006), head/neck tumor location (OR, 1.88; 95 % CI, 1.10-3.23; p = 0.021), and more than one positive SLN (OR, 1.80; 95 % CI, 1.17-2.76; p = 0.007). The 5-year OS did not differ between the patients who received SLNB only and those who underwent CLND (hazard ratio [HR], 0.93; p = 0.54). Conclusion The rates of CLND have decreased nationally. However, patients with head/neck primary tumors who live in rural locations are more likely to undergo CLND, highlighting populations for which treatment may be non-uniform with national practice patterns.

TI  - Deep residual U-Net for automatic detection of Moroccan coastal upwelling using SST images
T2  - MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Upwelling phenomenon is one of the most important dynamic process in the ocean, which brings nutrients from the depths of the ocean into the surface layer, leading to an enhancement of the primary production and playing a considerable role in the coastal ecosystem. Deep learning (DL) based segmentation methods have been providing state-of-the-art performance in the last few years. These methods have been successfully applied to oceanic remote sensing image segmentation, classification, and detection tasks. In particular, U-Net, has become one of the most popular for these applications. This paper proposes UpwellRes-Net, a deep fully convolutional neural network architecture, for automatic upwelling detection and pixel-segmentation on sea surface temperature (SST) images. The proposed model is based on U-Net structure and residual learning, thus, combining the strengths of both approaches. The main objective of this study is to investigate the performance of deep learning in the extraction of upwelling area. Hence, UpwellRes-Net is trained and optimized on satellite-derived SST database provided by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Experiments on the southern Atlantic Moroccan coast show the superiority of the proposed model to a transfer learning based model developed for the same. Deep learning based upwelling detection system can be a cost effective, accurate and convenient way for objective analysis of upwelling phenomenon.

TI  - Performance study of imageries from MODIS, Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 on measuring shoreline change at regional scale
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In monitoring shoreline change, remote sensing data plays a pivotal role. Although different freely accessible satellite data are used in studies of shoreline change at various scales, it is imperative to identify their effectiveness at a regional scale. This study aims to determine how effectively MODIS, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2 satellite images measure regional shoreline change. Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS), an ArcGIS extension, was utilized to analyze the changes in the shoreline of Ganges deltaic coast in Bangladesh. The Shoreline Change Envelope (SCE) technique was applied to compare the shorelines extracted from MODIS, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2 for the year 2016 with high-resolution Google Earth image. Next, using the End Point Rate (EPR) method, shoreline change rates between 2016 and 2019 were calculated separately from each satellite data. The study points out which satellite data was more accurate in delin-eating shoreline. Due to a higher spatial resolution, Sentinel-2 data were more effective than Landsat and MODIS data at a regional scale. In addition, MODIS, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2 data indicate that the Ganges deltaic coast experiences landward movements of 54.65 m/yr, 12.56 m/ yr, and 1.79 m/yr, respectively. Hence, it can be concluded that if the spectral resolution is coarse, shoreline change is overestimated. Therefore, in order to analyze or predict shoreline change (even at a regional scale), priority should be given to using images with fine spatial resolution. The spectral analysis of MODIS, Landsat and Sentinel showed a similar pattern of separability among the land cover classes observed along the Ganges deltaic coast. The separa-bility is higher in NIR (Near Infrared) and SWIR (Short Wave Infrared) bands. This study will direct researchers in the selection of remote sensing data sources for shoreline change detection within a regional scale.

TI  - Trends and regional variations of gonococcal antimicrobial resistance in the Netherlands, 2013 to 2019
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Gonococcal antimicrobial resistance is emerging worldwide and is monitored in the Netherlands in 18 of 24 Sexual Health Centres (SHC). Aim: To report trends, predictors and regional variation of gonococcal azithromycin resistance (AZI-R, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ) 1 mg/L) and ceftriaxone decreased susceptibility (CEF-DS, MIC ) 0.032 mg/L) in 2013-2019. Methods: SHC reported data on indi-vidual characteristics, sexually transmitted infection diagnoses, and susceptibility testing (MIC, measured by Etest). We used multilevel logistic regression analy-sis to identify AZI-R/CEF-DS predictors, correcting for SHC region. Population differences' effect on regional variance of AZI-R and CEF-DS was assessed with a separate multilevel model. Results: The study included 13,172 isolates, predominantly (n = 9,751; 74%) from men who have sex with men (MSM). Between 2013 and 2019, annual proportions of AZI-R isolates appeared to increase from 2.8% (37/1,304) to 9.3% (210/2,264), while those of CEF-DS seemed to decrease from 7.0% (91/1,306) to 2.9% (65/2,276). Among SHC regions, 0.0-16.9% isolates were AZI-R and 0.0-7.0% CEF-DS; population characteristics could not explain regional variance. Pharyngeal strain origin and consultation year were significantly associated with AZI-R and CEF-DS for MSM, women, and heterosexual men. Among women and heterosexual men ??? 4 partners was associated with CEF-DS, and ??? 10 with AZI-R. Conclusions: No resist-ance or decreasing susceptibility was found for CEF, the first line gonorrhoea treatment in the Netherlands. Similar to trends worldwide, AZI-R appeared to increase. Regional differences between SHC support nationwide surveillance with regional-level reporting. The increased risk of resistance/decreased susceptibil-ity in pharyngeal strains underlines the importance of including extragenital infections in gonococcal resist-ance surveillance.

TI  - Monitoring of urban ecological environment including air quality using satellite imagery
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanisation has highlighted problems in the urban ecological environment and stimulated research on the evaluation of urban environments. In previous studies, key factors such as greenness, wetness, and temperature were extracted from satellite images to assess the urban ecological environment. Although air pollution has become increasingly serious as urbanisation proceeds, information on air pollution is not included in existing models. The Sentinel-5P satellite launched by the European Space Agency in 2017 is a reliable data source for monitoring air quality. By making full use of images from Landsat 8, Sentinel-2A, and Sentinel-5P, this work attempts to construct a new remote sensing monitoring index for urban ecology by adding air quality information to the existing remote sensing ecological index. The proposed index was tested in the Beijing metropolitan area using satellite data from 2020. The results obtained using the proposed index differ greatly in the central urban region and near large bodies of water from those obtained using the existing remote sensing monitoring model, indicating that air quality plays a significant role in evaluating the urban ecological environment. Because the model constructed in this study integrates information on vegetation, soil, humidity, heat, and air quality, it can comprehensively and objectively reflect the quality of the urban ecological environment. Consequently, the proposed remote sensing index provides a new approach to effectively monitoring the urban ecological environment.

TI  - The Hapuku Rock Avalanche: Breaching and evolution of the landslide dam and outflow channel revealed using high spatiotemporal resolution datasets
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslide dams have been recognised as significant components of multi-hazard cascading systems, linking slopes and rivers. Despite the potential for catastrophic consequences, landslide dam breaching and evolution remain under-researched and poorly understood, often due to the remoteness of large volume, valley-blocking landslides and the general lack of high resolution pre- and post-failure survey data. The Hapuku Rock Avalanche presents a unique opportunity to study landslide dam evolution and breaching timelines due to the accessibility of the site and the availability and resolution of pre- and post-failure remote sensing data. Field observations and mapping, sampling, geophysical surveying, and 27 remote sensing surveys from 2016 to 2022 have provided detailed data on the dam. The Hapuku landslide was the largest rock avalanche triggered by the 2016 M-w 7.8 Kaikoura earthquake sequence, occurring & SIM;9 km upstream of the main highway and rail corridor on the South Island of New Zealand. It dammed the Hapuku River, which rapidly formed a lake behind the 80 m-high deposit. Four major erosion events and three significant partial breach events, identified through observations and remote sensing data differencing, resulted in water outflow from the lake, significant erosion of the dam and deposition of sediment into the river. The partial breaches correspond with less than 1 in 10-year rainfall events in 2017 and 2018, and the first occurred 141 days after dam formation. Seepage and internal erosion of the dam were observed to be progressing upstream before the partial breaches, in which water overtopped the dam. The third partial breach event, 2 years after dam formation, was the most significant erosional event in the last 6 years. The dam has eroded episodically and more locally since 2018, and the degree of erosion appears to be decreasing with time, despite more intense storms. A small lake remains. The evolution of the Hapuku Rock Avalanche dam emphasises the complexity of dam and breaching evolution, which are often oversimplified.

TI  - Modelling the Significance of Value-Belief-Norm Theory in Predicting Solid Waste Management Intention and Behavior
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization and rapid use of natural resources worldwide led to a massive increase in the solid waste produced daily. The processing of solid waste is significantly lower than solid waste production. Sustainable solid waste processing requires collective efforts and a change in the general public mindset to reduce and effectively process solid waste. The current work aims to interpret the intention and behavior to mitigate the climatic issue of solid waste management among Malaysian adults under the value-belief-norm framework, which was extended with social norms. This study adopted a cross-sectional design and collected quantitative data through an online survey from 1571 household heads in Malaysia. Data were analyzed with the partial least square-structure equation modelling (PLS-SEM) technique given that the data were non-normal. Other relevant common method bias analyses were conducted to evaluate the influence of common method variance. The analyses demonstrated that the biospheric and altruistic values were essential for promoting the ecological worldview among the individuals. Following the VBN framework, the ecological worldview promotes the awareness of consequences, which facilitates the ascription of responsibility to perform corrective actions for the climate. Moreover, ecological worldview, awareness of consequences, and ascription of responsibility result in the personal norms towards the pro-climate behaviors. The social and personal norms effectively nurture the intention to engage in solid waste management practices. The VBN framework provides a guideline to promote the intention and behavior to adopt effective solid waste management practices, while education and public policy could harness public beliefs and norms to engage in pro-climatic behaviors.

TI  - Healthcare-Seeking Behavior for Respiratory Illness Among Flu Near You Participants in the United States During the 2015-2016 Through 2018-2019 Influenza Seasons
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - The overall age-adjusted percentage of Flu Near You participants who sought healthcare for influenza-like illness symptoms varied by season and ranged from 22.8% to 35.6%. This percentage also varied by geographical region, age group, and sex.Background Flu Near You (FNY) is an online participatory syndromic surveillance system that collects health-related information. In this article, we summarized the healthcare-seeking behavior of FNY participants who reported influenza-like illness (ILI) symptoms. Methods We applied inverse probability weighting to calculate age-adjusted estimates of the percentage of FNY participants in the United States who sought health care for ILI symptoms during the 2015-2016 through 2018-2019 influenza season and compared seasonal trends across different demographic and regional subgroups, including age group, sex, census region, and place of care using adjusted chi (2) tests. Results The overall age-adjusted percentage of FNY participants who sought healthcare for ILI symptoms varied by season and ranged from 22.8% to 35.6%. Across all seasons, healthcare seeking was highest for the <18 and 65+ years age groups, women had a greater percentage compared with men, and the South census region had the largest percentage while the West census region had the smallest percentage. Conclusions The percentage of FNY participants who sought healthcare for ILI symptoms varied by season, geographical region, age group, and sex. FNY compliments existing surveillance systems and informs estimates of influenza-associated illness by adding important real-time insights into healthcare-seeking behavior.

TI  - Mapping the albedo of the active surface at different stages of the growing season using data from various sources
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The albedo of active surfaces, such as soil, plant cover, or anthropogenic objects, is one of the most important components of the Earth's energy balance. It is most often determined based on satellite data; however, such data are characterized by relatively low resolution, and the possibility of acquisition is limited to cloudless days. The development of the UAV technology offers new possibilities of albedo measurement. In this study, an attempt was made to use a UAV equipped with a standard RGB sensor for albedo mapping. The results of the measurements and calculations were compared with Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 satellite data. It has been shown that the commonly used and readily available UAVs can be applied for mapping the broadband albedo of the active surface with the use of appropriate validation algorithms developed by direct measurements on the ground with a precise high spectral resolution spectroradiometer. The quality of collected results can be improved using different conversion algorithms for the individual phases of the growing season.

TI  - Benchmarking global hydrological and land surface models against GRACE in a medium-sized tropical basin
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing reliance on global models to address climate and human stresses on hydrology and water resources underlines the necessity for assessing the reliability of these models. In river basins where availability of gauging information from terrestrial networks is poor, models are increasingly proving to be a powerful tool to support hydrological studies and water resources assessments (WRA). However, the lack of in situ data hampers rigorous performance assessment, particularly in tropical basins where discordance between global models is considerable. Remotely sensed data of the terrestrial water storage obtained from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission can provide independent data against which the performance of such global models can be evaluated. However, how well GRACE data represents the dynamics of terrestrial water storage depends on basin scale and hydrological characteristics. Here we assess the reliability of six global hydrological models (GHMs) and four land surface models (LSMs) available at two resolutions. We compare the dynamics of modelled Total Water Storage (TWS) with TWS derived from GRACE data over the Magdalena-Cauca basin in Colombia. This medium-sized tropical basin has a well-developed gauging network when compared to other basins at similar latitudes, providing unique opportunity to contrast modelled TWS and GRACE data across a range of scales. We benchmark monthly TWS changes from each model against GRACE data for 2002-2014, evaluating monthly variability, seasonality, and long-term variability trends. The TWS changes are evaluated at basin level, as well as for selected sub-basins with decreasing basin size. We find that the models poorly represent TWS for the monthly time series, but they improve in representing seasonality and long-term variability trends. The high-resolution GHM World-Wide Resources Assessment (W3RA) model forced by the Multi-Source Weighted Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP) is most consistent in providing the best performance at almost all basin scales, with higher-resolution models generally outperforming lower-resolution counterparts. This is, however, not the case for all models. Results highlight the importance of basin scale in the representation of TWS by the models, as with decreasing basin area, we note a commensurate decrease in the model performance. A marked reduction in performance is found for basins smaller than 60 000 km(2). Although uncertainties in the GRACE measurement increase for smaller catchments, the models are clearly challenged in representing the complex hydrological processes of this tropical basin, as well as human influences. We conclude that GRACE provides a valuable dataset to benchmark global simulations of TWS change, in particular for those models with explicit representation of the internal dynamics of hydrological stocks, offering useful information for continued model improvement in the representation of the hydrological dynamics in tropical basins.

TI  - Snow Avalanche Frequency Estimation (SAFE): 32 years of monitoring remote avalanche depositional zones in high mountains of Afghanistan
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow avalanches are the predominant hazards in winter in high-elevation mountains. They cause damage to both humans and assets but cannot be accurately predicted. Here we show how remote sensing can accurately inventory large avalanche depositional zones every year in a large basin using a 32-year snow index derived from Landsat satellite archives. This Snow Avalanche Frequency Estimation (SAFE) built in an open-access Google Engine script maps snow hazard frequency and targets vulnerable areas in remote regions of Afghanistan, one of the most data-limited areas worldwide. SAFE correctly detected the actual depositional zones of avalanches identified in Google Earth and in the field (probability of detection 0.77 and positive predictive value 0.96). A total of 810 000 large depositional zones of avalanches have occurred since 1990 within an area of 28 500 km(2) with a mean frequency of 0.88 avalanches per square kilometre per year, damaging villages and blocking roads and streams. Snow avalanche frequency did not significantly change with time, but a northeast shift of these hazards was evident. SAFE is the first robust model that can be used worldwide and is especially capable of filling data voids in snow avalanche impacts in inaccessible regions.

TI  - A phenology- and trend-based approach for accurate mapping of sea-level driven coastal forest retreat
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid replacement of upland forest by encroaching marshland is a striking manifestation of global sea-level rise (SLR). Timely and high-resolution information on the location and extent of transition forest (the ecotone between upland forest and marsh where tree mortality due to seawater intrusion begins) is fundamental to understanding the processes and patterns of SLR-driven landscape reorganization. Despite its significance, accurate characterization of salt-impacted transition forest remains challenging due to the complexity of coastal environments, scarcity of ground-truth data, and the lack of effective mapping algorithms. Here we use the full archive of Landsat images between 1984 and 2021 to investigate the spectral, temporal, and phenological characteristics of transition forest, and develop a robust framework for monitoring coastal vegetation shifts in the mid-Atlantic U.S., a global SLR hotspot. We found that transition forest exhibits strong negative NDVI trends and a deviation of land surface phenology from marsh and upland forest that distinguishes itself from surrounding vegetation. By integrating temporal trends and land surface phenology, our results demonstrate superior discrimination between marsh and coastal forests to existing map products (e.g. NOAA Coastal Change Analysis Program, National Land Cover Database) that allows a reliable identification of the coastal treeline. We applied the approach to map regional land cover in 1985, 2000 and 2020 (overall classification accuracy > 92%) and found that the area of coastal forest decreased by 22.0% from 1985 to 2020, the majority of which transitioned to marshland (92.3%, 5.3 x 10(3) ha). Based upon fine-scale patterns of coastal transgression, we created a practical workflow for spatially explicit quantification of forest retreat rates. Concurrent with rising sea level, coastal forests migrated upslope from 0.63 (+/- 0.27) m above sea level in 1985 to 0.78 (+/- 0.32) m above sea level in 2020, and horizontal forest retreat rates accelerated from 3.1 (range of 0-36) m yr(-1) during 1985-2000 to 4.7 (0-55) m yr(-1) during 2001-2020. As SLR continues to accelerate, our study may serve as a scalable solution for consistent tracking of coastal landscape evolution that is urgently needed for sustainable forest and wetland management.

TI  - Evaluating the accuracy of satellite-based methods to estimate residential proximity to agricultural crops
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPOSURE SCIENCE AND ENVIRONMENTAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Background Epidemiologic investigations increasingly employ remote sensing data to estimate residential proximity to agriculture as a means of approximating individual-level pesticide exposure. Few studies have examined the accuracy of these methods and the implications for exposure misclassification. Objectives Compare metrics of residential proximity to agricultural land between a groundtruth approach and commonly-used satellite-based estimates. Methods We inspected 349 fields and identified crops in current production within a 0.5 km radius of 40 residences in Idaho. We calculated the distance from each home to the nearest agricultural field and the total acreage of agricultural fields within a 0.5 km buffer. We compared these groundtruth estimates to satellite-derived estimates from three widely used datasets: CropScape, the National Land Cover Database (NLCD), and Landsat imagery (using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index thresholds). Results We found poor to moderate agreement between the classification of individuals living within 0.5 km of an agricultural field between the groundtruth method and the comparison datasets (53.1-77.6%). All satellite-derived estimates overestimated the acreage of agricultural land within 0.5 km of each home (average = 82.8-148.9%). Using two satellite-derived datasets in conjunction resulted in substantial improvements; specifically, combining CropScape or NLCD with Landsat imagery had the highest percent agreement with the groundtruth data (92.8-93.8% agreement). Significance Residential proximity to agriculture is frequently used as a proxy for pesticide exposure in epidemiologic investigations, and remote sensing-derived datasets are often the only practical means of identifying cultivated land. We found that estimates of agricultural proximity obtained from commonly-used satellite-based datasets are likely to result in exposure misclassification. We propose a novel approach that capitalizes on the complementary strengths of different sources of satellite imagery, and suggest the combined use of one dataset with high temporal resolution (e.g., Landsat imagery) in conjunction with a second dataset that delineates agricultural land use (e.g., CropScape or NLCD).

TI  - Warming lake surface water temperatures in Lake Qiandaohu, China: Spatiotemporal variations, influencing factors and implications for the thermal structure
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term lake surface water temperature (LSWT) products are valuable for understanding the responses of lake ecosystems to climate warming and for proposing suitable policies to protect lake ecosystems. Here, using Landsat satellite data and various in situ data, we documented 36 years (1986-2021) of spatiotemporal variations in LSWT in Lake Qiandaohu, a subtropical deep-water lake in China, and explored the potential driving factors of these variations. We validated the performances of the practical single-channel (PSC) algorithm, the generalized single-channel algorithm and the Landsat Level 2 land surface temperature product on Lake Qiandaohu with long-term in situ buoy data. Overall, the PSC algorithm had the best performance, with a mean absolute percent error (MAPE) of 7.5% and root mean square difference (RMSE) of 1.7 degrees C. With 36 years of Landsat data and the PSC algorithm, the spatiotemporal variations in LSWT were constructed. The Landsat-derived 36-year mean LSWT in Lake Qiandaohu ranged from 18.2 to 23.1 degrees C, with a mean value of 20.2 degrees C. The northeast and southwest subsegments had the minimum (19.7 degrees C) and maximum (20.6 degrees C) mean LSWT values, respectively. The spatial variations in LSWT could be explained in part by the water depth. From 1986 to 2021, a significant warming trend was observed in Lake Qiandaohu, with a warming rate of 0.07 degrees C/year. The warming rate of Lake Qiandaohu was faster than that of the local air temperature (warming rate = 0.04 degrees C/year). The LSWT warming in Lake Qiandaohu can mainly be attributed to the warming air temperatures. Lake warming has increased the thermal stability in Lake Qiandaohu and has had negative impact on the lake ecosystem. Our work highlights the importance of using satellite data to understand the responses of lake ecosystems to climate change.

TI  - Remote sensing to detect harmful algal blooms in inland waterbodies
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are an issue of concern for water management worldwide. As such, effective monitoring strategies of HAB spatio-temporal variability in waterbodies are needed. Remote sensing has become an increasingly important tool for HAB detection and monitoring in large lakes. However, accurate HAB detection in small-medium waterbodies via satellite data remains a challenge. Current barriers include the waterbody size, the limited freely available high resolution satellite data, and the lack of field calibration data. To test the applicability of remote sensing for detecting HABs in small-medium waterbodies, three satellites (Planetscope, Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8) were used to understand how spatial resolution, the availability of spectral bands, and the waterbody size itself effect HAB detection skill. Different algorithms and a non-parametric method, Self-Organizing Map (SOM), were tested. Curvature Around Red and NIR minus Red had the best HAS detection skill of the 20 existing algorithms that were tested. Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 were the best satellites for HAS detection in small to medium waterbodies. The most critical attribute for detecting HABs were the available satellite bands, which determine the detection algorithms that can be used. Importantly, algorithm performance was mostly unrelated to waterbody size. However, there remain some barriers in utilizing satellite data for HAB detection, including algae dynamics, macrophyte cover within the waterbody, weather effects, and the correction models for satellite data. Moreover, it is important to consider the match time between satellite overpass and sampling activities for calibration. Given these challenges, integrating regular sampling activities and remote sensing is recommended for monitoring and managing small-medium waterbodies.

TI  - Downscaling CLDAS Soil Moisture Product by Integrating Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Data over Agricultural Area
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil Moisture (SM) plays a key role in the energy exchange between the atmosphere and the land surface. Most of the SM products retrieved from satellite remote sensing data are not suitable for drought monitoring and irrigation management in smart agriculture applications due to their coarse spatial resolution. We propose an SM downscaling method named Water Cloud Change Detection (WCCD) that effectively combines the Water-Cloud Model (WCM) and the Change Detection Method (CDM) to downscale the China Land Data Assimilation System soil moisture (CLDAS_SM, 6000-m resolution) product. The WCM is used to retrieve the soil backscattering at a fine spatial resolution by deducting the canopy backscattering from the surface total backscattering, and the linear regression relationship between soil backscattering and CLDAS_SM is established for each pixel at the coarse scale under the assumption that the surface roughness does not change for dozens of days. The performance of the algorithm is tested in an agricultural crop region in Hebei province of China with Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images. The validation results show that the downscaled SM at different spatial resolutions are in good agreement with the in-situ measurements with the correlation coefficient (R) higher than 0.71 and the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) lower than 0.042 cm(3)xcm(-3).

TI  - Outcomes of flucytosine-containing combination treatment for cryptococcal meningitis in a South African national access programme: a cross-sectional observational study
T2  - LANCET INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Although flucytosine is a key component of WHO-recommended induction treatment for HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis, this antifungal agent is not widely available in low-income and middle-income countries due to limited production and cost. In 2018, a national flucytosine access programme was initiated in South Africa. We aimed to determine the effectiveness of flucytosine-containing induction regimens in routine care to motivate for the urgent registration of flucytosine and its inclusion in treatment guidelines.Methods In this cross-sectional study, we compared outcomes of adults aged 18 years and older with incident laboratory-confirmed cryptococcal meningitis treated with or without flucytosine-containing regimens at 19 sentinel hospitals in South Africa. A case of cryptococcosis was defined as illness in an adult with: (1) positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) India ink microscopy; (2) a positive CSF cryptococcal antigen test; or (3) culture of Cryptococcus neoformans or Cryptococcus gattii from CSF or any other specimen. We excluded patients without a case report form, those with an unknown or negative HIV serology result, those with a recurrent episode, and those who did not receive antifungal treatment in hospital. We assessed cumulative in-hospital mortality at 14 days and 30 days and calculated the overall crude in-hospital case-fatality ratio. We used random-effects logistic regression to examine the association between treatment group and in-hospital mortality.Findings From July 1, 2018, to March 31, 2020, 10 668 individuals were diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed cryptococcal meningitis, 7787 cases diagnosed at non-enhanced surveillance sites and 567 cases from eight enhanced surveillance sites with no access to flucytosine were excluded. Of 2314 adults with a first episode of cryptococcosis diagnosed at 19 facilities with access to flucytosine, 1996 had a case report form and of these, 1539 received induction antifungal treatment and were confirmed HIV-seropositive first-episode cases. Of 1539 patients who received antifungal therapy, 596 (38.7%) individuals received a flucytosine-containing regimen and 943 (61.3%) received another regimen. The median age was 36 years (IQR 32-43) and 906 (58.9%) participants were male and 633 (41.1%) were female. The crude in-hospital case-fatality ratio was 23.9% (95% CI 20.0-27.0; 143 of 596) in those treated with flucytosine-containing regimens and 37.2% (95% CI 34.0-40.0; 351 of 943) in those treated with other regimens. Patients admitted to non-academic hospitals (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.95 [95% CI 1.53-2.48]; p<0.0001) and those who were antiretroviral treatment-experienced (aOR 1.30 [1.02-1.67]; p=0.033) were more likely to receive flucytosine. After adjusting for relevant confounders, flucytosine treatment was associated with a 53% reduction in mortality (aOR 0.47 [95% CI 0.35-0.64]; p<0.0001). Among survivors, the median length of hospital admission in the flucytosine group was 11 days (IQR 8-15) versus 17 days (13-21) in the comparison group (p=0.0010).Interpretation In-hospital mortality among patients treated with a flucytosine-containing regimen was comparable to reduced mortality reported in patients receiving a flucytosine-containing regimen in a recent multicentre African clinical trial. Flucytosine-based treatment can be delivered in routine care in a middle-income country with a substantial survival benefit. Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Assessment of Oncologists' Perspectives on Omission of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy inWomen 70 Years and Older With Early-Stage Hormone Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer
T2  - JAMA NETWORK OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - IMPORTANCE Randomized clinical trial data have demonstrated that omission of surgical axillary evaluation does not affect overall survival in women 70 years and older with early-stage (clinical tumor category 1 [cT1] with node-negative [N0] disease) hormone receptor (HR)-positive and erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (ERBB2; formerly HER2)-negative breast cancer. Therefore, the Choosing Wisely initiative has recommended against routine use of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in this population; however, retrospective data have revealed that more than 80% of patients eligible for SLNB omission still undergo the procedure. Multidisciplinary factors involved in these patterns remain unclear.OBJECTIVE To describe surgical, medical, and radiation oncologists' perspectives on omission of SLNB in women 70 years and older with cT1N0 HR-positive, ERBB2-negative breast cancer.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This qualitative study used in-depth semi-structured interviews to explore the factors involved in oncologists' perspectives on providing care to older women who were eligible for SLNB omission. Purposive snowball sampling was used to recruit a sample of surgical, medical, and radiation oncologists representing a wide range of practice types and number of years in practice in the US and Canada. A total of 29 oncologists who finished training and were actively treating patients with breast cancer were interviewed. Interviews were conducted between March 1, 2020, and January 17, 2021.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Recordings from semi-structured interviews were transcribed and deidentified. Thematic analysis was used to identify emergent themes.RESULTS Among 29 physicians (16 women [55.2%] and 13 men [44.8%]) who participated in interviews, 16 were surgical oncologists, 6 were medical oncologists, and 7 were radiation oncologists. Data on race and ethnicity were not collected. Participants had a range of experience (median [range] years in practice, 12.0 [0.5-30.0]) and practice types (14 academic [48.3%], 7 community [24.1%], and 8 hybrid [27.6%]). Interviews revealed that the decision to omit SLNB was based on nuanced patient- and disease-level factors. Wide variation was observed in oncologists' perspectives on SLNB omission recommendations and supporting data. In addition, participants' statements suggested that the multidisciplinary nature of cancer care may increase oncologists' anxiety regarding SLNB omission.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, findings from interviews revealed that oncologists' perspectives may have implications for the largely unsuccessful deimplementation of SLNB in women 70 years and older with cT1N0 HR-positive, ERBB2-negative breast cancer. Interventions aimed at educating physicians, improving patient-physician communication, and facilitating preoperative multidisciplinary conversations may help to successfully decrease SLNB rates in this patient population.

TI  - Computer-aided clinical image analysis as a predictor of sentinel lymph node positivity in cutaneous melanoma
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND Delays in sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy may affect the positivity of non-SLNs. For these reasons, effort is being directed at obtaining reliable information regarding SLN positivity prior to surgical excision. However, the existing tools, e.g., dermoscopy, do not recognize statistically significant predictive criteria for SLN positivity in melanomas. AIM To investigate the possible association of computer-assisted objectively obtained color, color texture, sharpness and geometry variables with SLN positivity. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed and analyzed the computerized medical records of all patients diagnosed with cutaneous melanoma in a tertiary hospital in Germany during a 3-year period. The study included patients with histologically confirmed melanomas with Breslow > 0.75 mm who underwent lesion excision and SLN biopsy during the study period and who had clinical images shot with a digital camera and a handheld ruler aligned beside the lesion. RESULTS Ninety-nine patients with an equal number of lesions met the inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. Overall mean (& PLUSMN; standard deviation) age was 66 (15) years. The study group consisted of 20 patients with tumor-positive SLN (SLN+) biopsy, who were compared to 79 patients with tumor-negative SLN biopsy specimen (control group). The two groups differed significantly in terms of age (61 years vs 68 years) and histological subtype, with the SLN+ patients being younger and presenting more often with nodular or secondary nodular tumors (P < 0.05). The study group patients showed significantly higher eccentricity (i.e. distance between color and geometrical midpoint) as well as higher sharpness (i.e. these lesions were more discrete from the surrounding normal skin, P < 0.05). Regarding color variables, SLN+ patients demonstrated higher range in all four color intensities (gray, red, green, blue) and significantly higher skewness in three color intensities (gray, red, blue), P < 0.05. Color texture variables, i.e. lacunarity, were comparable in both groups. CONCLUSION SLN+ patients demonstrated significantly higher eccentricity, higher sharpness, higher range in all four color intensities (gray, red, green, blue) and significantly higher skewness in three color intensities (gray, red, blue). Further prospective studies are needed to better understand the effectiveness of clinical image processing in SLN+ melanoma patients.

TI  - Spatial heterogeneity in boundary layer dynamism and PM2.5 surface concentration over the complex terrain of Brahmaputra valley
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite its importance, comprehensive investigation of the variation of particulate matter <= 2.5 mu m (PM2.5), Aerosol Optical Depth at 550 nm (AOD 550 nm) and Planetary Boundary Layer Height (PBLH) for diurnal, seasonal and valley scales is virtually non-existent in the Brahmaputra Valley (BV). PBLH data obtained from MERRA-2 and ERA5 ECMWF were validated with reference to collocated radiosonde PBLH estimates of the Dibrugarh station in BV. MERRA-2 PBLH showed good agreement with radiosonde PBLH estimates with R-2 = 0.48 and RMSE = 1.08 m. Remarkable diurnal synergism between PBLH and PM2.5 was demonstrated; deep daytime PBLH (1199-2100 m) coincident with lowered PM2.5 concentration (12.39-93.06 mu g/m(3)); while shallow night-time PBLH (328-1233 m) co-existed with heightened PM2.5 concentration (46-142 mu g/m(3)). Pre-monsoon PBLH was deepest (1414.07 m-939.40 m), declined in the monsoon (817 m-487 m) and post-monsoon (818 m-622 m), and increased in winter (1180 m-588 m). Turbulence and valley wind breezes generated in the PBLH, are effective in reducing PM2.5 surface concentration. Changes in spatial and seasonal PBLH reflected changes in PM2.5 and AOD 550 nm. Further, results of PBLH-PM2.5 relationship revealed an unusual weak to strong positive pan-seasonal correlation (r = 0.52 to 0.91). The rough eastern BV topography evinced a relatively strong correlation than western and central parts. To our best knowledge, this is the first report on diurnal and seasonal variability of PBLH, AOD 550 nm and PM2.5-PBLH relationship at the valley-site scale for BV.

TI  - Markets and the Future of the Circular Economy.
T2  - Circular economy and sustainability
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The circular economy stands at a crossroads between true systemic change and rebranded business-as-usual. It will either evolve to become functional-optimizing technical capabilities to mimic resilient ecosystems-or dysfunctional-reinforcing current destructive, destabilizing structures and incentives despite appearing to make marginal progress. This paper offers a unique critique of the circular economy: we argue that the circular economy is set up for failure precisely because it is required to conform to our current socio-econo-political system-that is, a market system. We identify four core characteristics of market systems: private property, competition, a market for labor, and value determined by price. Together, these characteristics create incentives that are antithetical to a functional circular economy: a requirement for infinite growth, short product lifetimes and limited material circularity, technically suboptimal products and systems, ineffective reverse logistics networks, and misplaced priorities from distorted notions of value. We then show that the fundamental organizing principle of market systems is market efficiency, which is based on a false assumption of scarcity. In contrast, we suggest a competing worldview of sustainable abundance based on a principle of technical efficiency, which optimizes technical and environmental outcomes. Using this lens, we suggest alternatives to the core market characteristics, including an ecology of complementary currencies, a new understanding of private property, an adjusted balance of competition and cooperation, labor market alternatives, a reevaluation of true value, and lessons from Indigenous peoples. If-and only if-we embrace technical efficiency over market efficiency, we can unshackle the circular economy to create meaningful system change and a future of sustainable abundance.

TI  - Monitoring greenhouse gases (GHGs) in China: status and perspective
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to establish a creditable greenhouse gas (GHG) monitoring network to support the goals of carbon peak/neutrality, it is necessary to know what we have done and what we have to do in the future. In this study, we summarize an overview of the status and perspective of GHG monitoring in China. With decades of effort, China has made a great breakthrough in GHG monitoring capacity and steadily improved the performance of homemade GHG monitoring instruments. However, most GHG monitoring studies have been research-oriented, temporal, sparse, and uncoordinated. It is suggested to take full advantage of various monitoring technologies, monitoring platforms, numerical simulations, and inventory compilation techniques to form a creditable GHG stereoscopic monitoring and assessment system at an operational level. We envisage that this system can routinely quantify GHGs on national, provincial, regional, and even individual scales with high spatiotemporal resolution and wide coverage to support low-carbon policy in China.

TI  - Improved retrieval of SO<sub>2</sub> plume height from TROPOMI using an iterative Covariance-Based Retrieval Algorithm
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of sulfur dioxide layer height (SO2 LH) is important to understand volcanic eruption processes, the climate impact of SO2 emissions and to mitigate volcanic risk for civil aviation. However, the estimation of SO2 LH from ground-based instruments is challenging in particular for rapidly evolving and sustained eruptions. Satellite wide-swath nadir observations have the advantage to cover large-scale plumes and the potential to provide key information on SO2 LH. In the ultraviolet, SO2 LH retrievals leverage the fact that, for large SO2 columns, the light path and its associated air mass factor (AMF) depends on the SO2 absorption (and therefore on the vertical distribution of SO2), and SO2 LH information can be obtained from the analysis of measured back-scattered radiances coupled with radiative transfer simulations. However, existing algorithms are mainly sensitive to SO2 LH for SO2 vertical columns of at least 20 DU. Here we develop a new SO2 LH algorithm and apply it to observations from the high-spatial-resolution TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI). It is based on an SO2 optical depth look-up table and an iterative approach. The strength of this scheme lies in the fact that it is a Covariance-Based Retrieval Algorithm (COBRA; Theys et al., 2021). This means that the SO2-free contribution of the measured optical depth is treated in an optimal way, resulting in an improvement of the SO2 LH sensitivity to SO2 columns as low as 5 DU, with a precision better than 2 km. We demonstrate the value of this new data through a number of examples and comparison with satellite plume height estimates (from IASI and CALIOP), and back-trajectory analyses. The comparisons indicate an SO2 LH accuracy of 1-2 km, except for some difficult observation conditions, in particular for optically thick ash plumes or partially SO2-filled scenes.

TI  - Reconstruction of 0.05° all-sky daily maximum air temperature across Eurasia for 2003-2018 with multi-source satellite data and machine learning models
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Eurasian continent is highly vulnerable to climate change. However, there is a lack of high spatiotemporal resolution temperature datasets to support climate change analysis in this region. In this study, an all-sky daily maximum air temperature (Tmax) product at 0.05 degrees spatial resolution across Eurasia for 2003-2018 was devel-oped. This product is generated using a satellite-derived model, including parameters such as daytime and nighttime land surface temperature (LST), downward shortwave radiation, net radiation, leaf area index, enhanced vegetation index, and albedo. The study area, Eurasia, was divided into seven regions using a data -driven method. Four machine learning methods, histogram-based gradient boosting (HGB), extremely ran-domized trees (ET), random forest (RF), and deep belief network (DBN) were employed to train Tmax estimation models using 4476 stations from GHCN, GSOD, and CMDC. HGB was finally selected since it exhibited the highest estimation accuracy, the determination coefficient (R2) and root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of the HGB model are 0.984 and 1.736 degrees C with non-missing values in datasets and 0.985 and 1.812 degrees C with missing values respectively. The impact of the different situations of LST features on HGB models was tested. LST features containing interpolated LST and GLDAS Ta are considered the best. The spatial and temporal accuracy of HGB models was then examined across different land cover types, latitudes, elevations, and months. The permutation test was employed to examine the contributions of different features. Finally, HGB models trained using the best LST features were used to generate the Tmax products. In comparison with existing temperature products, the R2 and RMSE values were reported as 0.980 and 2.177 degrees C, indicating strong competition among existing Tmax products. In summary, our study provides a scheme for estimating parameters with missing feature values in a consistent manner and provides a solid foundation for the environmental and climate changes studies.

TI  - Modelling and evaluation of land use changes through satellite images in a multifunctional catchment: Social, economic and environmental implications
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Floods are recurrent phenomena with significant environmental and socio-economic impacts. The risk of flooding increases when land use changes. The objective of this research is to detect land cover changes via Sentinel-2 images in the Umia Basin (Galicia, NW Spain) in 2016-2021 and to analyse the associated flood risk. This study focuses on how forest use and nature-based solutions (NBS) can reduce the risk and hazard of flooding in cities and crops in the high-risk area. A flood simulation was performed with the land use obtained from Sentinel-2 (Observed) and three more simulations were performed changing the location of afforestation and NBS, i.e. "S-Upstream", "S-Downstream" and "S-Total". Finally, the environmental, economic and social impacts of the scenarios designed and estimated are analysed and discussed. Land cover change was successfully monitored with Sentinel-2 imagery. The catchment area showed noteworthy changes in land use, most notably for the category of trees, which covered 6700 ha in 2016 and 10,911 ha in 2021. However riparian vegetation decreased by almost 11%. For the flood hazard simulations, an average reduction in peak discharge was obtained for all three scenarios (9.3% for S-Up; 8.6% for S-Down and 13% for S-Total). From the economic perspective, all three scenarios show a positive net present value for the period studied. However, S-Down is the scenario with the lowest benefits (euro15,476,487), while S-Up and S-Total show better values at euro29,580,643 and euro65,158,130 respectively. However, investment cost is much higher for the S-Total scenario, and upstream actions affect the whole catchment, so S-Up is the best decision. This study concludes that the information provided by satellites is a large-scale analysis tool for small heterogeneous plots that facilitates the comprehensive analysis of a territory. This information can be incorporated into flood analysis models, facilitating simulation through the use of NBS. It has been proven that the use of reforestation upstream only is almost as beneficial as reforestation in the entire catchment and is economically more viable. This confirms that the methodology used reduces flood hazard, despite the territorial complexity, facilitating decision making on the use of NBS.

TI  - Art Bell's Open Forum: Conspiracy Talk on <i>Coast to Coast AM</i> and its Legacy in the Internet Age
T2  - HISTORICAL JOURNAL OF FILM RADIO AND TELEVISION
M3  - Article
AB  - This article examines the late-night call-in talk radio show Coast to Coast AM and its creator and host, Art Bell. One of the most popular radio shows in America at the turn of the 21(st) century, the show dealt with pseudoscience, conspiracy theories, and the paranormal. From its policy against screening callers to its 'anything goes' theme, the show anticipated several consequential characteristics of the Internet. This paper uses Bell's comments about his show as well as analysis of several episodes from the 1990s to examine Bell's strategy as host and the larger cultural and historic significance of the show, particularly as it relates to conspiracy culture that has since proliferated on the Internet. The article argues that Bell played the role of a simultaneously open-minded yet sceptical host, and saw himself as curating a forum for free expression and creating entertainment. Bell, who died in 2018, failed to consider, much less appreciate, the consequences of his approach. The article concludes by suggesting how the show is an example of contemporary Gnosticism in presenting a worldview that assumes reality hides many hidden truths that only a few can ever access.

TI  - Sea surface temperature prediction model for the Black Sea by employing time-series satellite data: a machine learning approach
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - High temporal resolution remote sensing images provide continuous data about the marine environment, which is critical for gaining extensive knowledge about the aquatic environment and marine species. Sea surface temperature (SST) is one of the basic parameters that can be obtained with the help of remote sensing. Long-term alterations in the SST can affect the aquatic environment and marine species, such as the life expectancy of anchovies in the Black Sea. Forecasting the dynamics of SSTs is crucial for detecting and eliminating the SST-oriented impacts. The goal of the current study is to construct a predictive model to estimate the daily SST value for the mid-Black Sea using a machine learning approach by employing time-series satellite data from 2008 to 2021. Turkey's mid-Black Sea coastal line, comprising Ordu, Samsun, and Sinop stations, was chosen as the study area. The SST predictive model was represented by applying the recurrent neural network (RNN) long- and short-term memory (LSTM). Adam stochastic optimization was used for validation, and the mean square error (MSE) for each location was found to be 0.914, 0.815, and 0.802, respectively. The findings indicate that our model is significantly promising for accurate and effective short- and midterm daily SST prediction.

TI  - Soil moisture content retrieval over meadows from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data using physically based scattering models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture content (SMC) information at field scale could have important applications in agricultural and regional water management. This study presents an operationally applicable scheme for SMC retrieval over meadows from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscatter (sigma(0)) observations. We parameterized the vegetation scattering and absorption model developed at the Tor Vergata University of Rome (TV) and the integral equation method (IEM) surface scattering model for grass-covered soil surfaces. Leaf area index (LAI) estimates from a Sentinel-2 product provide field-scale vegetation information, as is demonstrated by validation against in situ measurements. The SMC retrieval scheme is applied with field-averaged Sentinel-1 sigma(0) observations from November 2015 to November 2018 and evaluated on 21 meadows against adjacent in situ station measurements, without (IEM) and with a vegetation correction (TV-IEM). Masking the IEM and TV-IEM SMC retrievals for dense vegetation conditions improves their performance, but this is a trade-off with the number of retrievals. By setting the SMC retrievals that exceed the upper retrieval limit of 0.75 m(3) m(-3) during the wet period to the maximum SMC, the performance metrics improve to mean Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.55 for IEM and 0.64 for TV-IEM, root mean square deviations (RMSD) of 0.14 m(3) m(-3) for IEM and 0.13 m(3) m(-3) for TV-IEM, and RMSDs relative to the range of the SMC references of 24 % for both IEM and TV-IEM. The slightly better SMC retrieval performance with TV-IEM is caused by invalid SMC retrievals under dense vegetation conditions, and the performance metrics for IEM and TV-IEM are practically equal by considering the same retrieval-reference pairs. The IEM and TV-IEM retrieval performances are also similar to the performances of two other Sentinel-1 based products at field scale. They are, on average, outperformed by NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) 9 km and 36 km products evaluated at field scale, but these products are expected to deviate if larger regional differences are present and in field-specific situations.

TI  - Clinical significance of umbilical artery intermittent vs persistent absent end-diastolic velocity in growth-restricted fetuses
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Umbilical artery absent end-diastolic velocity indicates increased placental resistance and is associated with increased risk of perinatal demise and neonatal morbidity in fetal growth restriction. However, the clinical implications of intermittent vs persistent absent end-diastolic velocity are unclear.OBJECTIVE: We compared umbilical artery Doppler velocimetry changes during pregnancy and neonatal outcomes between pregnancies with fetal growth restriction and intermittent absent end-diastolic velocity and those with persistent absent end-diastolic velocity.STUDY DESIGN: In this retrospective study of singletons with fetal growth restriction and absent end-diastolic velocity, umbilical artery Doppler abnormalities were classified as follows: intermittent absent enddiastolic velocity (<50% of cardiac cycles with absent end-diastolic velocity) and persistent absent end-diastolic velocity (>= 50% of cardiac cycles with absent end-diastolic velocity). The primary outcome was umbilical artery Doppler progression to reversed end-diastolic velocity. Secondary outcomes included sustained umbilical artery Doppler improvement, latency to delivery, gestational age at delivery, neonatal morbidity composite, rates of neonatal intensive care unit admission, and length of neonatal intensive care unit stay. Outcomes were compared between intermittent absent end-diastolic velocity and persistent absent end-diastolic velocity. Multivariate logistic regression was used to adjust for confounders. A receiver operating characteristic curve was generated to assess the sensitivity and specificity of the percentage of waveforms with absent end-diastolic velocity in predicting the neonatal composite. The Youden index was used to calculate the optimal absent end-diastolic velocity percentage cut-point for predicting the neonatal composite.RESULTS: Of the 77 patients included, 38 had intermittent absent enddiastolic velocity and 39 had persistent absent end-diastolic velocity. Maternal characteristics, including age, parity, and preexisting conditions did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. Progression to reversed end-diastolic velocity was less common in intermittent absent enddiastolic velocity than in persistent absent end-diastolic velocity (7.9% vs 25.6%; odds ratio, 0.25; 95% confidence interval, 0.06-0.99). Sustained umbilical artery Doppler improvement was more common in intermittent absent end-diastolic velocity than in persistent absent end-diastolic velocity (50.0% vs 10.3%; odds ratio, 8.75; 95% confidence interval, 2.60-29.5). Pregnancies with intermittent absent end-diastolic velocity had longer latency to delivery than those with persistent absent end-diastolic velocity (11 vs 3 days; P<.01), and later gestational age at delivery (33.9 vs 28.7 weeks; P<.01). Composite neonatal morbidity was less common in the intermittent absent end-diastolic velocity group (55.3% vs 92.3%; P<.01). Neonatal death occurred in 7.9% of intermittent absent end-diastolic velocity cases and 33.3% of persistent absent end-diastolic velocity cases (P<.01). The differences in neonatal outcomes were no longer significant when controlling for gestational age at delivery. The percentage of cardiac cycles with absent end-diastolic velocity was a modest predictor of neonatal morbidity, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.71 (95% confidence interval, 0.58-0.84). The optimal percentage cut-point for fetal cardiac cycles with absent end-diastolic velocity observed at the sentinel ultrasound for predicting neonatal morbidity was calculated to be 47.7%, with a sensitivity of 65% and specificity of 85%.CONCLUSIONS: Compared with persistent absent end-diastolic velocity, diagnosis of intermittent absent end-diastolic velocity in the setting of fetal growth restriction is associated with lower rates of progression to reversed end-diastolic velocity, higher likelihood of umbilical artery Doppler improvement, longer latency to delivery, and higher gestational age at delivery, leading to lower rates of neonatal morbidity and death. Our data support using an absent end-diastolic velocity percentage cut-point in 50% of cardiac cycles to differentiate intermittent absent end-diastolic velocity from persistent absent end-diastolic velocity. This differentiation in growth-restricted fetuses with absent end-diastolic velocity may allow further risk stratification.

TI  - Internal mammary node involvement in patients with axilla-negative early breast cancer: a narrative review
T2  - ANZ JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Early breast cancer staging involves radiological and pathological evaluation of the tumour and regional lymph nodes. The internal mammary nodes (IMN) are an important site of possible metastasis and influence disease stage and prognosis. However, the recommendation for routine IMN assessment remains unclear. Internal mammary sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is associated with increased morbidity and an unknown survival benefit. Furthermore, the IMN are traditionally thought to be involved only synchronous with, or following, axillary node (AXN) metastasis. The aim of this review is to determine the prevalence of IMN metastasis in patients with axilla-negative early breast cancer. A narrative review of studies assessing IMN metastasis was performed. The literature search was completed using the database Medline (Ovid). Twenty-two retrospective studies were identified. The studies included data from SLNB, US, MRI, PET/CT and opportunistic biopsy during free-flap reconstruction (FFR). The prevalence of isolated IMN metastasis ranged from 1.2% to 17.9%.

TI  - Lidar-based daytime boundary layer height variation and impact on the regional satellite-based PM2.5 estimate
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) is popularly used to infer ground-level PM2.5 concentration due to its wide coverage. The fact that aerosols are largely confined in the atmospheric boundary layer makes boundary layer height (BLH) an important scale factor for AOD-based PM2.5 estimates. Our recent ground-based lidar observations, nevertheless, indicate that aerosol particles are heterogeneously mixed within the boundary layer, and even frequently reside above BLH, forming the residual layers (RL)-like pattern. To better sort out the underlying mechanism behind the above-mentioned phenomenon and the impact on hourly ground-level PM2.5 estimates from satellite-based AOD, we firstly propose a novel notion of haze layer height (HLH), which is calculated from Micro-Pulse Lidar (MPL) profile. Combined analysis of 3.5-year ground-based lidar profiles, CE318 AOD, and PM2.5 measurements show that the coefficient of determination (R2) between PM2.5 and AOD normalized with HLH increases from 0.49 to 0.61 for 90% of the dataset. Second, we applied HLH to an Autoencoder-based Deep Residual Network (ADRN) and tested the effect on satellite AOD-based PM2.5 estimation within a 300 km range surrounding the MPL station. With the aid of the AOD imputation technique, a similar improvement of using HLH instead is found on the regional scale PM2.5 estimation, which can be demonstrated by the comparison with air quality measurements and other machine learning models. The results show that using ADRN with HLH achieves the highest performance (mean R2 = 0.87, RMSE = 10.12 mu g/m3) among 4 machine learning models. This new approach, largely combining active and passive remote sensing data through artificial neural networks (CAPTA), shows improved accuracy and coverage of hourly PM2.5 estimation with aerosol vertical information and AOD calculation under clouds. In addition, further analysis showed that the average difference between morning and daily PM2.5 concentration could equate to an accuracy of 0.19-2.57 yrs. in terms of life expectancy, indicating that our new approach to the determination of PM2.5 from space sheds new insight into the assessment of the aerosol impact on public health.

TI  - Upland reclamation promotes forest evaporative losses in the Boreal Plains of Canada: A comparison of carbon and water fluxes
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Reclaiming upland boreal forests as part of post-mining watershed construction in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region (AOSR) requires evaluation criteria as these novel ecosystems develop. Here, we analyzed 55 site-years of eddy covariance observations of constructed forests and soils on formally pit-mined landscapes (9 sites) and contrasted them to 18 site-years of post-harvested ecosystems (3 sites) and 38 site-years of mature Boreal Plains ecosystems (3 sites). After approximately 5 years, the post-harvested sites had fluxes of gross primary produc-tivity (GPP), evapotranspiration (ET), and water use efficiency (WUE) within the variability of the widely studied mature Boreal Plains BERMS FLUXNET sites. However, even after 10 years the constructed forests had signifi-cantly lower WUE than the mature sites. High ET fluxes drove low WUE in the constructed upland conifer sites despite similar rates of GEP. Conversely, in the constructed broadleaf forests low GEP, despite similar ET, resulted in low WUE. A climate sensitivity analysis showed that there was little impact of abnormal hot, cold, wet, or dry growing seasons on GEP or evapotranspiration (ET) at the constructed forests. It is presumed that the high moisture retaining properties of the soils used in reclamation produced the low WUE and resilience to dry and hot conditions in constructed forests. Placing moisture retaining soils incorporates a degree of resilience to climate variability but also limits downgradient water yields to low lying wetlands in the relatively dry AOSR climate. This highlights a potential shortcoming of reclamation objectives developed for specific ecosystems when scaling from ecosystem to watershed scale construction. Finally, robust relationships between satellite observed greenness (MODIS EVI and NDVI) and ecosystem scale fluxes highlight how remote sensing-based metrics can be used by land managers to identify regions within landscape units that may be under performing.

TI  - Monitoring, evaluation, accountability, and learning (MEAL) in anticipatory action-earth observation as a game changer
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - For many decades, humanitarian assistance relied on emergency response, triggering both funding and operational activities only after disaster impacts had been recorded. In recent years, many humanitarian actors have joined forces to complement traditional, reactive mechanisms with a forward-looking approach that can be activated before a disaster strikes. Anticipatory action (AA) uses forecasts of extreme weather events and combines them with risk information to identify and implement locally-led early actions with the goal of protecting lives and livelihoods more efficiently. AA is still a relatively new approach. Hence, monitoring, evaluation, accountability and learning (MEAL) is crucial to measure its effectiveness and adjust where necessary, as well as for (government) donors that want to see the added value of their investment maximized. However, evidence-based studies that investigate potential limitations and the exact impact pathway of AA at household level are time-consuming, costly, and therefore scarce. Satellite earth observation can become a game changer in AA by strengthening the evidence base via rapid, low-cost assessments. Both commercial and freely available satellite-derived data have reached an unprecedented level of quality, spatial, and temporal resolution. Simultaneously, there are major uncertainties regarding where, when, how, and under what conditions satellite data can support MEAL for AA at all. We argue that satellite data for an advanced MEAL framework should be considered already in the design phase of AA projects and that the translation of satellite data into actionable information will require a cross-cutting community of practice.

TI  - Estimates of species-level tolerance of urban habitat in North American birds
T2  - ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Species vary in their responses to urban habitat; most species avoid these environments, whereas others tolerate or even thrive in them. To better characterize the extent to which species vary in their responses to urban habitat (from this point forwards "urban tolerance"), we used several methods to quantify these responses at a continental scale across all birds. Using open access community science-derived data from the eBird Status and Trends Products and two different types of high-resolution geospatial data that quantify urbanization of landscapes, we calculated urban tolerance for 432 species with breeding ranges that overlap large cities in Canada or the USA. We developed six different calculations to characterize species-level urban tolerance, allowing us to assess how each species' relative abundance across their breeding range varied with estimates of urban habitat use and intensity. We assessed correlations among these six indices, then compressed the two best-performing indices into a single principal component (multivariate urban tolerance index) that captured variation in urban tolerance among species. We assessed the accuracy of our single and multivariate urban tolerance indices using 24 test species that have been well characterized for their tolerance or avoidance of the urban habitat, as well as with previously published, independent urban tolerance estimates. Here, we provide this new dataset of species-level urban tolerance estimates that improves upon previous metrics by incorporating continental-scale, continuous estimates that better differentiate species' tolerance of urban habitat compared with existing, categorical methods. These refined metrics can be used to test hypotheses that link ecological, life history, and behavioral traits to avian urban tolerance. The dataset is licensed as CC-By Attribution 4.0 International. Users must appropriately cite the data paper and dataset if used in publications and scientific presentations.

TI  - Health burden and economic loss attributable to ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> in Iran based on the ground and satellite data
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - We estimated mortality and economic loss attributable to PM2 center dot 5 air pollution exposure in 429 counties of Iran in 2018. Ambient PM2.5-related deaths were estimated using the Global Exposure Mortality Model (GEMM). According to the ground-monitored and satellite-based PM2.5 data, the annual mean population-weighted PM2 center dot 5 concentrations for Iran were 30.1 and 38.6 mu g m(-3), respectively. We estimated that long-term exposure to ambient PM2.5 contributed to 49,303 (95% confidence interval (CI) 40,914-57,379) deaths in adults >= 25 yr. from all-natural causes based on ground monitored data and 58,873 (95% CI 49,024-68,287) deaths using satellite-based models for PM2.5. The crude death rate and the age-standardized death rate per 100,000 population for age group >= 25 year due to ground-monitored PM2.5 data versus satellite-based exposure estimates was 97 (95% CI 81-113) versus 116 (95% CI 97-135) and 125 (95% CI 104-145) versus 149 (95% CI 124-173), respectively. For ground-monitored and satellite-based PM2.5 data, the economic loss attributable to ambient PM2.5-total mortality was approximately 10,713 (95% CI 8890-12,467) and 12,792.1 (95% CI 10,652.0-14,837.6) million USD, equivalent to nearly 3.7% (95% CI 3.06-4.29) and 4.3% (95% CI 3.6-4.5.0) of the total gross domestic product in Iran in 2018.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE FORMOSAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Risk factors of lymphatic and hematogenous metastasis in cutaneous melanoma remained unclear in Asian population. This study aimed to identify clinical and histopatholog-ical factors to predict metastatic pathways in cutaneous melanoma in Taiwan. Methods: A total of 247 patients diagnosed as stage I and II melanoma, followed at National Taiwan University Hospital were included in this retrospective study from 1980 to 2020. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards regression were utilized to identify risk factors. Results: During a median follow-up of 143 months, 48 (19.4%) and 62 (25.1%) patients devel-oped lymphatic and hematogenous metastasis respectively. In the univariate analysis, age> 70 years, greater Breslow thickness, ulceration, neurotropism, and NRAS mutation were signif-icant risk factors for lymphatic metastasis in all subtypes of melanoma. Age >70 years, head and neck location, thickness, ulceration, higher mitotic rate, neurotropism, and NRAS muta-tion were significant predictors of hematogenous metastasis in all subtypes. In the multivariate analysis, greater thickness (HR for 2.0-4.0 mm, 4.5; p = .009 and HR for >4.0 mm, 5.7; p = .003) retained its significance as an independent risk factor for lymphatic metastasis in all subtypes of melanoma. Thickness (HR for >4.0 mm, 5.7; p < .001) and ulceration (HR, 2.5; p = .001) were independent risk factors for hematogenous metastasis.

TI  - Predictability and transferability of local biodiversity environment relationships
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Biodiversity varies in space and time, and often in response to environmental heterogeneity. Indicators in the form of local biodiversity measures-such as species richness or abundance-are common tools to capture this variation. The rise of readily available remote sensing data has enabled the characterization of environmental heterogeneity in a globally robust and replicable manner. Based on the assumption that differences in biodiversity measures are generally related to differences in environmental heterogeneity, these data have enabled projections and extrapolations of biodiversity in space and time. However so far little work has been done on quantitatively evaluating if and how accurately local biodiversity measures can be predicted. Methods: Here I combine estimates of biodiversity measures from terrestrial local biodiversity surveys with remotely-sensed data on environmental heterogeneity globally. I then determine through a cross-validation framework how accurately local biodiversity measures can be predicted within ( "predictability ") and across similar ( "transferability ") biodiversity surveys. Results: I found that prediction errors can be substantial, with error magnitudes varying between different biodiversity measures, taxonomic groups, sampling techniques and types of environmental heterogeneity characterizations. And although errors associated with model predictability were in many cases relatively low, these results question-particular for transferability-our capability to accurately predict and project local biodiversity measures based on environmental heterogeneity. I make the case that future predictions should be evaluated based on their accuracy and inherent uncertainty, and ecological theories be tested against whether we are able to make accurate predictions from local biodiversity data.

TI  - Residents' perception and worldview about radon control policy in Canada: A pro-equity social justice lens
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Radon is a potent indoor air pollutant, especially in radon prone areas and in countries with long winters. As the second top lung carcinogen, radon is disproportionately affecting certain population subgroups. While many provinces have taken sporadic actions, the equity issue has remained unaddressed across all policy measures. Attempts to enforce radon guidelines and enact building regulations without considering residents' views have proved ineffective. Research linking residents' radon risk perception and worldviews regarding radon control policy is lacking in Canada. We applied mixed (quantitative and qualitative) methods in a pro-equity social justice lens to examine the variations in residents' risk perception, access to risk communication messages, and worldviews about risk management across the sociodemographic strata. Triangulation of the quantitative and qualitative findings strengthened the evidence base to identify challenges and potential solutions in addressing the health risk through upstream policy actions. Enacting radon control policy requires actions from all levels of governments and relevant stakeholders to ensure equal opportunities for all residents to take the preventive and adaptive measures. Small sample size limited the scope of findings for generalization. Future studies can examine the differential impacts of radon health risk as are determined by various sociodemographic variables in a representative national cohort.

Change detection methods provide access to recovery trajectories of trend and seasonality and detect abrupt changes in LST time series, but a comprehensive evaluation of the published methods is lacking. In this study, simulated LST data with a temporal resolution of 8 days under different scenarios were used to evaluate the performance of three commonly used methods: Detecting Breakpoints and Estimating Segments in Trend (DBEST), Breaks for Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST), and Bayesian Estimator of Abrupt change, Seasonal change, and Trend (BEAST). The results obtained using the simulated data indicated that BEAST was the best method for decomposing LST time series into trend and seasonality (mean RMSEs were 0.28 K and 0.27 K, respectively) and for detecting abrupt changes in these two components (mean F1 scores were 0.83 and 0.95, respectively). BFAST was less robust to high-complexity data (F1: 0.56 and 0.52, RMSE: 1.34 K and 1.46 K). 0.91 K and 1.29 K). DBEST is recommended to capture component details because it yields the least generalized output (F1 for trend: 0.37, RMSE: 0.64 K and 1.37 K). Both BFAST and DBEST exhibited reduced accuracy when the time-series data has long-lasting continuous missing data. An application using the 20-year MODIS LST time series supports the results obtained using the simulated data. BEAST exhibited the highest detection accuracy for land cover change (13 correct detections among 15 true changes), followed by DBEST (9) and BFAST (7). All three methods were ineffective for detecting low-magnitude disturbances: wildfires, heatwaves, and cold spells due to their low intensity or short duration. To reduce the non-negligible commission error of BEAST, this study proposes an improved BEAST, which eliminates the false breakpoints in BEAST using a set of thresholds. Compared with BEAST, the user accuracy of the improved BEAST was significantly increased by 13.9% in the simulated data, resulting in an F1 increase of 0.04, and 15 false breakpoints were eliminated among 53 detected disturbances in the MODIS LST time series. This study outlines commonly used change detection methods and offers guidance for choosing the optimal method to detect changes in LST time series. Furthermore, suggestions on the determination of parameters and false breakpoints elimination in the improved BEAST enable it more practical.

TI  - A hybrid generative adversarial network for weakly-supervised cloud detection in multispectral images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud detection is a crucial step in the optical satellite image processing pipeline for Earth observation. Clouds in optical remote sensing images seriously affect the visibility of the background and greatly reduce the usability of images for land applications. Traditional methods based on thresholding, multi-temporal or multi-spectral information are often specific to a particular satellite sensor. Convolutional Neural Networks for cloud detection often require labeled cloud masks for training that are very time-consuming and expensive to obtain. To overcome these challenges, this paper presents a hybrid cloud detection method based on the synergistic combination of generative adversarial networks (GAN) and a physics-based cloud distortion model (CDM). The proposed weakly-supervised GAN-CDM method (available online https://github.com/Neooolee/GANCDM) only requires patch-level labels for training, and can produce cloud masks at pixel-level in both training and testing stages. GAN-CDM is trained on a new globally distributed Landsat 8 dataset (WHUL8-CDb, available online doi:https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6420027) including image blocks and corresponding block-level labels. Experimental results show that the proposed GAN-CDM method trained on Landsat 8 image blocks achieves much higher cloud detection accuracy than baseline deep learning-based methods, not only in Landsat 8 images (L8 Biome dataset, 90.20% versus 72.09%) but also in Sentinel-2 images ( "S2 Cloud Mask Catalogue " dataset, 92.54% versus 77.00%). This suggests that the proposed method provides accurate cloud detection in Landsat images, has good transferability to Sentinel-2 images, and can quickly be adapted for different optical satellite sensors.

TI  - Mangroves in Gulf of Khambhat, Gujarat: a case study
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE INDIAN NATIONAL SCIENCE ACADEMY
M3  - Review
AB  - The present study is mainly focused on studying the mangroves in the Gulf of Khambhat and exploring the previous research work done over the area for mapping and monitoring of mangrove ecosystem, which will further help to analyze the future scope of mangrove research in this area. To study the status and distribution of mangroves in the Gulf of the Khambhat region, mainly three ground truth locations are selected to collect ground truth data, which are Ghogha (Bhavanagar), Dahej (Bharuch), and Kantiyajal (Bharuch). All three locations are analyzed for the study of the mangroves and their species distribution. Furthermore, the Land Use / Land Cover change in all three areas is also analyzed to find mangrove cover change. The resultant data can be further used for training mangrove monitoring models using remote sensing data. The study also highlights that the current research done over the gulf of Khambhat area is not using the full strength of remote sensing as only multispectral optical imageries are used in various studies along with visual interpretation techniques. The study highly recommends the use of remote sensing with multi-sensor, multitemporal along with state-of-the-art machine learning and computer vision-based techniques for the mapping and monitoring of the Mangrove ecosystem in the Gulf of Khambhat region.

TI  - Simulation and risk assessment of a possible glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) in the Bhilangna Valley, central Himalaya, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Catastrophic hyper-concentrated flow during the glacial lake outburst flood (GLOFs) and its far-reaching consequences on life, property and infrastructure are the foremost concern throughout the high mountain areas. The present investigation focuses on a potentially dangerous moraine-dammed proglacial lake in the Bhilangna Valley, central Himalaya, India, which has been expanding at an alarming rate during the last two decades. This lake has expanded from similar to 0.15 to similar to 0.35 km(2) during 1999-2020 at the cost of loss in the associated glacier area by 0.21 km(2) during the same time period. We have tried to understand the possible trigger and simulated the worst-case outburst scenario and its impact on the settlements and infrastructure in the downstream valley. Two breaching scenarios: (1) overtopping and (2) piping which may be caused by the ice calving into the lake or through avalanches, have been generated, and a maximum possible discharge amount of similar to 4377 cumec has been estimated considering the lake depth as 30 m. The discharge can inundate an area of similar to 19 km(2) along the river channel with a mean water depth of similar to 38 m and an average velocity of similar to 16 m/s. The MODIS-based land surface temperature analysis from 2002 to 2020 suggests that similar to 19% of the total area of the Bhilangna Basin has biennial surface temperature <0 degrees C, indicating possible permafrost zone. Both the temperature analysis and the surface features surrounding the lake suggest the region to be dominated by permafrost.

TI  - VTEC observations of intense geomagnetic storms above Nepal: comparison with satellite data, CODE and IGSG models
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - In this article, we analyze vertical total electron content (VTEC) over Nepal for 4 periods: March 14-25, 2015, June 18-29, 2015, May 24-June 4, 2017, and September 3-14, 2017. In each period, there are quiet geomagnetic days and intense geomagnetic stormy days. The VTEC observed during these periods has observed both positive and negative ionospheric storms. We compared VTEC Receiver-Independent Exchange Format (RINEX) observations with the Global Ionospheric Map (GIM), Centre for Orbit Determination in Europe (CODE), and IGS working group (IGSG). We found in RINEX observation of the VTEC a noon bite out profile with predominance of morning and afternoon peaks and a nighttime peak, but this was not noticeable clearly with CODE and IGSG models. The comparison between RINEX TEC, CODE, and IGSG models shows that the GIM model does not estimate RINEX VTEC over Nepal. The disagreement between VTEC CODE/IGSG and VTEC RINEX is important during geomagnetically quiet periods, while there is good agreement between VTEC CODE/IGSG and VTEC RINEX during strong geomagnetic storms. We also find a greater disagreement between the models and the data at the equinoxes when the VTEC is larger. It is, therefore, necessary to introduce data from Nepal stations into the models CODE and IGSG in order to improve them.

TI  - 'Unite behind the Science!' Climate movements' use of scientific evidence in narratives on socio-ecological futures
T2  - SCIENCE AND PUBLIC POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Following Greta Thunberg's school strike in Stockholm in August 2018 and the October 2018 'declaration of rebellion' by activists in the UK, 2019 saw several climate protest movements rise to public attention, including Fridays for Future (FFF), Extinction Rebellion (XR), and the US Sunrise Movement. What is striking about them is that they rather bluntly refer to science in their campaigns. In this paper, we present an in-depth and comparative study of how the new climate protest movements relate to scientific evidence. Employing a narrative analysis of different types of data (websites, press releases, and media coverage), we study the movements' understandings of 'the science' as well as of science's role in policy processes. We find that the movements in their initial phase predominantly rely on science for their legitimation and adopt a scientific worldview with very little 'green ambivalence'. Notably, FFF and XR hold a deficit model of existing climate communication and enact roles as science communicators.

TI  - Improved maps of surface water bodies, large dams, reservoirs, and lakes in China
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Data and knowledge of surface water bodies (SWB), including large lakes and reservoirs (surface water areas > 1 km(2)), are critical for the management and sustainability of water resources. However, the existing global or national dam datasets have large georeferenced coordinate offsets for many reservoirs, and some datasets have not reported reservoirs and lakes separately. In this study, we generated China's surface water bodies, Large Dams, Reservoirs, and Lakes (China-LDRL) dataset by analyzing all available Landsat imagery in 2019 (19 338 images) in Google Earth Engine and very-high spatial resolution imagery in Google Earth Pro. There were similar to 3.52 x 10(6) yearlong SWB polygons in China for 2019, only 0.01 x 10(6) of them (0.43 %) were of large size (> 1 km(2)). The areas of these large SWB polygons accounted for 83.54 % of the total 214.92 x 10(3) km(2) yearlong surface water area (SWA) in China. We identified 2418 large dams, including 624 off-stream dams and 1794 on-stream dams, 2194 large reservoirs (16.35 x 10(3) km(2)), and 3051 large lakes (73.38 x 10(3) km(2)). In general, most of the dams and reservoirs in China were distributed in South China, East China, and Northeast China, whereas most of lakes were located in West China, the lower Yangtze River basin, and Northeast China. The provision of the reliable, accurate China-LDRL dataset on large reservoirs/dams and lakes will enhance our understanding of water resources management and water security in China. The China-LDRL dataset is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.16964656.v3 (Wang et al., 2021b).

TI  - Reconstructing all-weather daytime land surface temperature based on energy balance considering the cloud radiative effect
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) has been used in many applications as its strong relationships with land surface processes. However, the greatest limitation of the use of LST is the missing data caused by cloud contamination and weather conditions. In this study, we first used the XGBoost method to describe complex relationships of LST with surface characteristics from clear-sky pixels, and applied the model to retrieve hypothetical clear-sky LST under cloudy sky. Secondly, cloud radiative effect (CRE) on the LST was calculated based on energy balance using the reanalysis data. The models were applied to reconstruct the all-weather LST over the Tibetan Plateau (TP). The spatial patterns of reconstructed LST indicated that our model could produce completely spatial -seamless LST and depict the detailed information. The accuracy of the XGBoost LST was validated against the clear-sky MODIS LST (average R2 = 0.92, MAPE = 0.52, RMSE = 2.32 K). The CRE-EB LST was evaluated using data from six in-situ sites from the TP. The validation results were separated into three conditions: clear sky (RMSE = 3.01 K-3.52 K, R2 = 0.88-0.93, bias =-1.08 K-1.88 K), cloudy sky (RMSE = 3.31 K-4.06 K, R2 = 0.87-0.92, bias =-0.21 K-1.11 K), and overall (RMSE = 3.31 K-3.82 K, R2 = 0.88-0.93, bias =-0.42 K-1.24 K). Compared to existing all-weather LST datasets, the temporal variability of our LST data shows similar seasonal and daily changes, and the CRE-EB LST has advantages in terms of image quality and accuracies under cloudy condition. This study demonstrated the utility of proposed models to reconstruct all-weather LST.

TI  - Generating 5 km resolution 1981-2018 daily global land surface longwave radiation products from AVHRR shortwave and longwave observations using densely connected convolutional neural networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface longwave radiation (SLWR) components, including downward longwave radiation (DLR), upward longwave radiation (ULR), and net longwave radiation (NLR), are major contributors to the Earth's surface radiation budget and play important roles in ecological, hydrological, and atmospheric processes. Previous SLWR products have different drawbacks, such as being temporally short (after 2000), spatially coarse (>= 25 km), and instantaneous values, which hinder their in-depth applications in land surface process modeling and climate trends analysis. Here, we reported the Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)-based Global LAnd Surface Satellites (GLASS-AVHRR) SLWR products over the global land surface at a 5 km spatial resolution and 1 day temporal resolution between 1981 and 2018. These products were generated using multiple densely connected convolutional neural networks (DesCNNs) from the AVHRR top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflected and emitted observations and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) fifth generation reanalysis (ERA5) near-surface meteorological data. DesCNNs were trained using integrated SLWR samples derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based GLASS, Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System Synoptic (CERES-SYN), and ERA5 SLWR products. In situ measurements from 231 globally distributed sites were used to evaluate the GLASS-AVHRR SLWR estimates. The results illustrated the overall high accuracies of GLASS-AVHRR SLWR products with root-mean-square-errors (RMSEs) of 18.66, 14.92, and 16.29 Wm(-2), and mean bias errors (MBEs) of-2.69,-3.77, and 0.49 Wm(-2) for all-sky DLR, ULR, and NLR, respectively. We found good correlation and consistency between GLASS-AVHRR and both CERES-SYN and ERA5 in terms of spatial patterns, latitudinal gradient, and temporal evolution. Our results revealed the significant contribution of shortwave observations to SLWR estimation owing to the high amounts of clouds over polar regions and water vapor and clouds in tropical areas, which was not previously widely recognized by the remote sensing community. GLASS-AVHRR SLWR products were updated, documented, and made available to the public at www.glass.umd.edu and www.geodata.cn.

TI  - Machine Learning as a Downscaling Approach for Prediction of Wind Characteristics under Future Climate Change Scenarios
T2  - COMPLEXITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessment of climate change impacts on wind characteristics is crucial for the design, operation, and maintenance of coastal and offshore infrastructures. In the present study, the Model Output Statistics (MOS) method was used to downscale a Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) with General Circulation Model (GCM) results for a case study in the North Atlantic Ocean, and a supervised machine learning method (M5' Decision Tree model) was developed for the first time to establish a statistical relationship between predicator and predicant. To do so, the GCM simulation results and altimeter remote sensing data were employed to examine the capabilities of the M5'DT model in predicting future wind speed and identifying spatiotemporal trends in wind characteristics. For this purpose, three classes of M5' models were developed to study the annual, seasonal, and monthly variations of wind characteristics. The developed decision tree (DT) models were employed to statistically downscale the Beijing Normal University Earth System Model (BNU-ESM) global climate model output. The M5' models are calibrated and successfully validated against theGCMsimulation results and altimeter remote sensing data. All the proposed models showed firm outputs in the training section. Predictions from the monthly model with a 70/30 training to test ratio demonstrated the best model performance. The monthly prediction model highlighted the decreasing trend in wind speed relative to the control period in 2030 to 2040 for the case study location and across all three future climate change scenarios tested within this study. This reduction in wind speed reduces wind energy by 13% to 19%.

TI  - Coupling localized Noah-MP-Crop model with the WRF model improved dynamic crop growth simulation across Northeast China
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Northeast China is an important commodity grain base in China and plays an important role in maintaining national and local food security. The intensifying climate variability and strengthening of extreme weather events threaten crop growth and yields in this region. The dynamic crop model coupled into the land surface models showed advances in simulating crop phenology and crop growth response to climate change, however, which was mainly validated for the United States. By comparing with the satellite observed crop growth cycles, we firstly calibrated the parameters for the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) coupled Noah-MP-Crop model. Then, we evaluated the performance of the calibrated WRF-Noah-MP-Crop model with the default crop models and the dynamic vegetation models coupled with WRF by comparing our simulations with corre-sponding satellite measurements and meteorological observations. Our results indicated the augmentation of the Noah-MP-Crop model in WRF significantly improved the crop phenology simulation at the beginning and ending time of the growing season compared with the dynamic vegetation model using unmanaged crops. The satellite -calibrated crop parameters substantially improved the simulation of crop growth, plant physiology, and biomass accumulation for both corn and soybean. Coupling the localized dynamic crop model into the WRF led to considerable decreases in the simulated mean-absolute-errors (MAEs) and biases of the leaf area index, evapo-transpiration, and gross primary production compared with the MODIS observed values. Compared with the statistical yield from each province, the modified crop model underestimated the corn yield from 11.1% to 48.6%, whereas overestimated the soybean yield from 16.5% to 162.6%. The coupled WRF-Noah-MP-Crop model with flexible resolutions holds unmatched advantages in estimating and projecting crop growth and yield under future climate change scenarios, which would be critical in ensuring sustainable agricultural development and maintaining future food security.

TI  - An integrated framework for wide-area active landslide detection with InSAR observations and SAR pixel offsets
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Jinsha River flows through one of the most geologically complex regions in western China with extremely high altitudes and capricious climates. Frequent landslides (e.g., the Baige landslides on 11 October and 3 November 2018) occurred along its stretch which posed severe damage to bridges, dams, and roads, and put the safety of local residents at risk. Systematic and comprehensive landslide detection has been rarely carried out in the Jinsha River corridor because it is a wide and hard-to-reach region. With 30 years of development, InSAR has become an effective way to map ground motion, which in turn makes it feasible to detect active landslides over wide regions. However, several challenges remain in applying InSAR in the Jinsha River corridor, such as low coherence due to dense vegetation and/or large gradient surface movements, and atmospheric effects due to the spatio-temporal variations of the atmosphere (especially the part due to tropospheric water vapor). In this paper, we propose a framework to overcome the limitations of conventional InSAR through the integration of GACOS-assisted InSAR, advanced SBAS InSAR, and SAR pixel offset tracking techniques. This integrated framework enables us to detect active landslides under complex topographic and climate conditions. Our results show that the detected active landslides are largely controlled by active faults, most of them are found at elevations of 2500-4000 m, their slopes fall between 25 and 45 degrees facing southwest and northwest, and 83.3% of the active landslides have a NDVI value of less than 0.3. Furthermore, precipitation is one critical triggering factor of active landslides, evidenced by the high temporal correlation between average precipitation and surface displacement time series.

Although this is the case in Lebanon, Lebanese political activists and youth movements advocate for secularism as the only alternative to the present consociational political system. The article introduces the worldview theory of the German philosopher Karl Jaspers and deconstructs the concept of secularism by focusing on philosophical and anthropological academic debates on the topic. The goal is to discover why Lebanese support of secular movements and parties is remarkably limited despite the massive support of civil society for a radical critique of the present political system. The article ends with a discussion of two concepts: "radical secularism," coined by the philosopher Charles Taylor; and "asecular power," introduced by the anthropologist Hussein al Agrama. It concludes that the Lebanese case teaches us that the relation been worldviews and secularism must be reformulated in new ways to solve the secularism dilemma.

AB  - Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) based data are used to evaluate the effects of the COVID-19 lockdown on the concentrations of pollutants such as aerosol optical depth (AOD) and tropospheric columns of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) along with sulfur dioxide (SO2) respectively for the period of January 2017 to September 2021 over the capital city of Assam, Guwahati. In India lockdown due to COVID-19 was first imposed from 24th March to 14th April as phase I and then it extended from 15th April to 3rd May as phase II in the year 2020. The concentration of all pollutants was usually fall during the lockdown period as compared to their average during the 5-year period over the study area. The results showed that Pre-monsoon (March-May) seasonal AOD for the pandemic year 2020 was decreased by ti 23% after lockdown as compared to same season of normal years over the study location. The seasonally averaged AOD reached its peak value in pre-monsoon (0.78 +/- 0.09), followed by winter (0.59 +/- 0.10) and monsoon (0.52 +/- 0.05), with the minimum taking place in post-monsoon (0.38 +/- 0.08) season. The monthly average AOD varies from its highest value (0.82 +/- 0.18) in May to its lowest value (0.36 & PLUSMN; 0.10) in October for the study period over Guwahati. Tropospheric column NO2 exhibits same seasonality as AOD with highest value (0.21 x 1016- molecules cm2) in pre-monsoon and lowest value (0.13 x 1016 molecules cm-2) in post-monsoon sea -son which may be due to same source of origination of both NO2 and AOD. Conversely, SO2 does not vary much from the five-year average value during the lockdown period. Significant reduction in PM2.5 mass concentration value during Covid-19 lockdown months has been observed which indicates short term improvement of air quality over Guwahati.Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Inferring plant-plant interactions using remote sensing
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Rapid technological advancements and increasing data availability have improved the capacity to monitor and evaluate Earth's ecology via remote sensing. However, remote sensing is notoriously 'blind' to fine-scale ecological processes such as interactions among plants, which encompass a central topic in ecology. Here, we discuss how remote sensing technologies can help infer plant-plant interactions and their roles in shaping plant-based systems at individual, community and landscape levels. At each of these levels, we outline the key attributes of ecosystems that emerge as a product of plant-plant interactions and could possibly be detected by remote sensing data. We review the theoretical bases, approaches and prospects of how inference of plant-plant interactions can be assessed remotely. At the individual level, we illustrate how close-range remote sensing tools can help to infer plant-plant interactions, especially in experimental settings. At the community level, we use forests to illustrate how remotely sensed community structure can be used to infer dominant interactions as a fundamental force in shaping plant communities. At the landscape level, we highlight how remotely sensed attributes of vegetation states and spatial vegetation patterns can be used to assess the role of local plant-plant interactions in shaping landscape ecological systems. Synthesis. Remote sensing extends the domain of plant ecology to broader and finer spatial scales, assisting to scale ecological patterns and search for generic rules. Robust remote sensing approaches are likely to extend our understanding of how plant-plant interactions shape ecological processes across scales-from individuals to landscapes. Combining these approaches with theories, models, experiments, data-driven approaches and data analysis algorithms will firmly embed remote sensing techniques into ecological context and open new pathways to better understand biotic interactions.

TI  - Radar and multispectral remote sensing data accurately estimate vegetation vertical structure diversity as a fire resilience indicator
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The structural complexity of plant communities contributes to maintaining the ecosystem functioning in fire-prone landscapes and plays a crucial role in driving ecological resilience to fire. The objective of this study was to evaluate the resilience to fire off several plant communities with reference to the temporal evolution of their vertical structural diversity (VSD) estimated from the data fusion of C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscatter (Sentinel-1) and multispectral remote sensing reflectance (Sentinel-2) in a burned landscape of the western Mediterranean Basin. We estimated VSD in the field 1 and 2 years after fire using Shannon's index as a measure of vertical heterogeneity in vegetation structure from the vegetation cover in several strata, both in burned and unburned control plots. Random forest (RF) was used to model VSD in the control (analogous to prefire scenario) and burned plots (1 year after fire) using as predictors (i) Sentinel-1 VV and VH backscatter coefficients and (ii) surface reflectance of Sentinel-2 bands. The transferability of the RF model from 1 to 2 years after wildfire was also evaluated. We generated VSD prediction maps across the study site for the prefire scenario and 1 to 4 years postfire. RF models accurately explained VSD in unburned control plots (R-2 = 87.68; RMSE = 0.16) and burned plots 1 year after fire (R-2 = 80.48; RMSE = 0.13). RF model transferability only involved a reduction in the VSD predictive capacity from 0.13 to 0.20 in terms of RMSE. The VSD of each plant community 4 years after the fire disturbance was significantly lower than in the prefire scenario. Plant communities dominated by resprouter species featured significantly higher VSD recovery values than communities dominated by facultative or obligate seeders. Our results support the applicability of SAR and multispectral data fusion for monitoring VSD as a generalizable resilience indicator in fire-prone landscapes.

TI  - Factors associated with emergency readmissions after acute stroke: A retrospective audit of two hospitals
T2  - JOURNAL OF EVALUATION IN CLINICAL PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rationale, Aims and Objectives Emergency hospital readmissions within 30 days of discharge from hospital are considered a marker for the quality of hospital care, patient experience, the discharge process and integration with community services. This paper describes the frequency and variations in cause of emergency readmissions at 30 and 90 days following discharge after acute stroke from two stroke units. Methods Retrospective data collection of Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES) and Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme (SSNAP) of consecutive acute stroke hospital discharges over 24 months from 2017 to 2019 from two specialist stroke units in England. HES data were used to calculate the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI). Covariates were analysed for their association with readmission rate, including: age; gender; CCI; length of stay for first stroke admission; living alone; discharge to a care home; discharge receiving stroke specialist early supported discharge (ESD) rehabilitation and stroke severity as determined by National Institute for Health Stroke Scale on stroke admission. Results From 2017 to 2019 there were 1999 live discharges with a primary diagnosis of stroke. Both hospitals had a trend of increasing readmission rates with increasing stroke severity and comorbidity. Longer length of stroke admission, especially for patients with increasing stroke severity, and patients receiving ESD rehabilitation after discharge reduced 90-day readmissions. This association was stronger at 90 days than at 30 days. Different readmission event rates were found at 30 and 90 days and when events were compared between the two hospitals. Conclusion Understanding differences in readmission event rates between hospitals at 30 and 90 days can support local planning of patient needs in the first weeks after stroke discharge and to investigate ways for hospital to reduce the impact of readmission. It is recommended that stroke services use both 30 and 90-day readmissions to inform service evaluation and improvement.

TI  - Investigating the relationship between land alteration and the urban heat island of Seville city using multi-temporal Landsat data
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change and anthropogenic activities are affecting the entire earth, where urban areas are not an exception, being affected by extreme weather conditions and environmental disturbances. Urban expansion and industrial development have negatively affected the local climatic condition due to green space deficiency, soil moisture loss, soil erosion, land subsidence, high runoff, and low infiltration rate. Megacities are needed proper management and awareness for healthy ecosystem. The study investigated the properties of land alteration on the urban heat island (UHI) in the city of Seville, Spain. Earth observational Landsat 5 TM and 8 OLI/TIRS remote sensing datasets were used for generating the urban expansion and related land alteration. The study results indicate that built-up land increased by 139.2 Km(2) while agricultural land decreased by 104.07 Km(2). Open space and plantation areas also decreased by 62.33 Km(2) and 30.76 Km(2), respectively. The average temperature increase was around 0.13 degrees C per year between 1991 and 2021. Megacities need appropriate development, design, and supervision for sustainable urban development to avoid further UHI intensification. UHI map indicates that thermal variation increased from 2.21 degrees C (1991) to 3.42 degrees C (2021). The ecological disturbances also identified using UTFVI and the maps denoted that UTFVI values increased by 0.005 from 1991 to 2021. The present study outcomes are obliging for planners, researchers, and other participants for future evidence-based disaster planning and management.

TI  - Assessing variation in the effectiveness of IUCN protected area categorisation. What remotely sensed forest integrity and human modification reveals across the major tropical forest biomes
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the major threats facing protected areas (PAs) in hyper-diverse tropical forest ecosystems is human modification of their natural habitats. With a focus on forested PAs situated across three of the world's major tropical regions, the Congo Basin, insular Indonesia Malaysia and the Tropical Andes. We analyse their repre-sentation of identified ecoregions and remote sensing data of human modification and forest integrity levels within PAs and used a generalized linear modelling approach to estimate the influences on these pressures, with a particular focus on IUCN management categorisation, PA size, and geographic location. Representation of key ecoregions varied with 7%, 11% and 22% of named ecoregions being unprotected within each major region. Overall, the IUCN management category allocation played a minor role in influencing the modification and forest integrity observed within PAs. Instead, PA size was the most important determinant of these variables across the different regions under consideration. This work provides further evidence to suggest that the assignment of PAs to IUCN categories in their current form is not interpreted consistently across different regions and does not correspond to the conservation benefits expected to be conferred by this categorisation.

TI  - Redefining "abandoned" agricultural land in the context of reforestation
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Global mapping efforts to date have relied on vague and oversimplified definitions of "abandoned" agricultural land which results in overestimates of the land area that is likely to support persistent increases in forest cover and associated carbon sequestration. We propose a new conceptualization of abandoned agricultural land that incorporates changes in landholding status over time into determining whether land should be considered as abandoned. In order to develop more realistic estimates of the amount of land available for reforestation, we recommend clearly defining how abandoned land is categorized, discerning who owns and has rights to use the land, and combining remotely sensed data with household/stakeholder surveys to understand landowner motivations for not cropping or grazing land.

TI  - Activating faith: pro-environmental responses to a Christian text on sustainability
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - With growing attention on the importance of values, beliefs and worldviews in shaping environmental outcomes, there remains little research on religion and sustainability transformations. We explored the impact of the Archbishop of Canterbury's environmentally themed Lent Book 2020 "Saying Yes to Life" on environmental values, attitudes and behaviours of lay Christians. An online survey administered before and after reading the book assessed environmental values, New Ecological Paradigm (NEP), connectedness to nature and environmental behaviours, and collected open responses to questions about participants' perceptions. Follow-up focus groups were also held to understand experiences of cognitive and behavioural change. Analysis of paired data revealed significant increases in environmental behavioural intentions after completing the book, especially for energy use, food and recycling. Some evidence for strengthening of NEP scores and connectedness to nature was also found. Open text responses corroborated with quantitative measures of behaviour change. Additionally, the majority of participants reported some form of reinforcement, confirmation, or further development or change in their beliefs and attitudes. This included a reduction in anthropocentric beliefs and greater appreciation of and obligation towards the natural world. Focus group discussions revealed diverse participant experiences, including having pre-existing theological beliefs affirmed, responding with new practical actions, connecting with spiritual experiences, and discovering systemic origins of unsustainability. Findings suggest potential for environmental interventions within religious contexts to shape mindsets, integrate theological views with environmental concerns, activate latent beliefs, and initiate and sustain pro-environmental behaviour. More intentional engagement with religion may facilitate transformative change for sustainability internally and externally, and across individual, organisational and societal domains.

TI  - Farasan Island of Saudi Arabia confronts the measurable impacts of global warming in 45 years
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal vulnerability assessment is the key to coastal management and sustainable development. Sea level rise (SLR) and anthropogenic activities have triggered more extreme climatic events and made the coastal region vulnerable in recent decades. Many parts of the world also noticed increased sediment deposition, tidal effects, and changes in the shoreline. Farasan Island, located in the south-eastern part of Saudi Arabia, experienced changes in sediment deposition from the Red Sea in recent years. This study used Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) to delineate the shoreline changes of Farasan Island during 1975-2020. Multi-temporal Landsat data and DSAS were used for shoreline calculation based on endpoint rate (EPR) and linear regression. Results revealed an increase in vegetation area on the island by 17.18 km(2) during 1975-1989 and then a decrease by 69.85 km(2) during 1990-2020. The built-up land increased by 5.69 km(2) over the study period to accommodate the population growth. The annual temperature showed an increase at a rate of 0.196 degrees C/year. The sea-level rise caused a shift in the island's shoreline and caused a reduction of land by 80.86 km(2) during 1975-2020. The highly influenced areas by the environmental changes were the north, central, northwest, southwest, and northeast parts of the island. Urban expansion and sea-level rise gradually influence the island ecosystem, which needs proper attention, management, policies, and awareness planning to protect the environment of Farasan Island. Also, the study's findings could help develop new strategies and plan climate change adaptation.

TI  - Spatial point patterns generation on remote sensing data using convolutional neural networks with further statistical analysis
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuous technological growth and the corresponding environmental implications are triggering the enhancement of advanced environmental monitoring solutions, such as remote sensing. In this paper, we propose a new method for the spatial point patterns generation by classifying remote sensing images using convolutional neural network. To increase the accuracy, the training samples are extended by the suggested data augmentation scheme based on the similarities of images within the same part of the landscape for a limited observation time. The image patches are classified in accordance with the labels of previously classified images of the manually prepared training and test samples. This approach has improved the accuracy of image classification by 7% compared to current best practices of data augmentation. A set of image patch centers of a particular class is considered as a random point configuration, while the class labels are used as marks for every point. A marked point pattern is regarded as a combination of several subpoint patterns with the same qualitative marks. We analyze the bivariate point pattern to identify the relationships between points of different types using the features of a marked random point pattern.

TI  - Analysing frequent extreme flood incidences in Brahmaputra basin, South Asia
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study is focused on the flood inundation in Brahmaputra Basin, which is one of the most recurrent and destructive natural disasters of the region. The flood inundation was assessed using C-Band Sentinel 1 A synthetic aperture radar (SAR) during 2015-2020 with precipitation patterns, runoff discharge, and their impacts on land cover in the basin. The study exhibited a very high precipitation during monsoon in the upper catchment resulting in severe flood inundation in downslopes of Brahmaputra Basin. A very high (900-2000 mm) to extremely high (>2000 mm) monthly cumulative precipitation in the south and south-eastern parts of basin led to high discharge (16,000 to 18,000 m(3) s(-1)) during July-August months. The river discharge increases with cumulative effects of precipitation and melting of snow cover during late summer and monsoon season, and induced flood inundation in lower parts of basin. This flood has largely affected agricultural land (>77% of total basin), forests (similar to 3%), and settlement (426 to 1758 km(2)) affecting large wildlife and livelihood during 2015-2020. The study highlights the regions affected with recurrent flood and necessitates adopting an integrated, multi-hazard, multi-stakeholder approach with an emphasis on self-reliance of the community for sustenance with local resources and practices.

TI  - Evaluation of MOPITT and TROPOMI carbon monoxide retrievals using AirCore in situ vertical profiles
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - AirCore in situ vertical profiles sample the atmosphere from near the surface to the lower stratosphere, making them ideal for the validation of satellite tropospheric trace gas data. Here we present intercomparison results of AirCore carbon monoxide (CO) measurements with respect to retrievals from MOPITT (Measurements of Pollution In The Troposphere; version 8) and TROPOMI (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument), on board the NASA Terra and ESA Sentinel 5-Precursor satellites, respectively. Mean MOPITT/AirCore total column bias values and their standard deviation (0.4 +/- 5.5, 1.7 +/- 5.6, and 0.7 +/- 6.0 for MOPITT thermal-infrared, near-infrared, and multispectral retrievals, respectively; all in %) are similar to results obtained in MOPITT/NOAA aircraft flask data comparisons from this study and from previous validation efforts. MOPITT CO retrievals are systematically validated using in situ vertical profiles from a variety of aircraft campaigns. Because most aircraft vertical profiles do not sample the troposphere's entire vertical extent, they must be extended upwards in order to be usable in validation. Here we quantify, for the first time, the error introduced in MOPITT CO validation by the use of shorter aircraft vertical profiles extended upwards by analyzing validation results of MOPITT with respect to full and truncated AirCore CO vertical profiles. Our results indicate that the error is small, affects mostly upper tropospheric retrievals (at 300 hPa: similar to 2.6, 0.8, and 3.2 percent points for MOPITT thermal-infrared, near-infrared, and multispectral, respectively), and may have resulted in the overestimation of MOPITT retrieval biases in that region. TROPOMI can retrieve CO under both clear and cloudy conditions. The latter is achieved by quantifying interfering trace gases and parameters describing the cloud contamination of the measurements together with the CO column; then, the reference CO profiles used in the retrieval are scaled based on estimated above-cloud CO rather than on estimated total CO. We use AirCore measurements as the reference to evaluate the error introduced by this approach in cloudy TROPOMI retrievals over land after accounting for TROPOMI's vertical sensitivity to CO (relative bias and its standard deviation = 2.02 % +/- 11.13 %). We also quantify the null-space error, which accounts for differences between the shape of TROPOMI reference profiles and that of AirCore measured profiles (for TROPOMI cloudy e(null)=0.98 % +/- 2.32 %).

TI  - Integration of geospatial technologies with multiple regression model for urban land use land cover change analysis and its impact on land surface temperature in Jimma City, southwestern Ethiopia
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization and population growth are the main problems faced by developing countries that lead to natural resource depletion in the periphery of the city. This research attempts to analyze the impacts of urban land use land cover (LULC) change on land surface temperature (LST) from 1991 to 2021 in Jimma city, southwestern Ethiopia. Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) 1991, Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM +) 2005, and Landsat-8 Operational land imagery (OLI)/Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) 2021 were used in this study. Multispectral bands and thermal infrared bands of Landsat images were used to calculate LULC change, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), and LST. The LULC of the study area was classified using a supervised classification method with the maximum likelihood algorithm. The results of this study clearly showed that there is a negative correlation between vegetation cover and LST. The decrease in vegetation coverage and expansion of impervious surfaces lead to elevated LST in urban areas. The loss of vegetation cover contributed to the increasing trend of LST. Moreover, the conversion of vegetation cover to impervious surfaces aggravates the problem of LST. The results revealed that the built-up area was increased at a rate of 0.4 km(2)/year from 1991 to 2021. The vegetation cover in the city declined due to urban expansion to the periphery of the city. Consequently, the dense vegetation and sparse vegetation were converted into built-up areas by approximately 5.2 km(2) during the study period. The mean LST of the study area increased by 10.3 degrees C from 1991 to 2021 during the winter season in daytime. To improve the problems of climate change around urban areas, all stakeholders should work together to increase the urban green space coverage, which will contribute a significant role in mitigating LST and the urban heat island effect. More specifically, all residents could be accessible to public green spaces around big cities.

TI  - Clustering of bivariate satellite time series: A quantile approach
T2  - ENVIRONMETRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Clustering has received much attention in statistics and machine learning with the aim of developing statistical models and autonomous algorithms which are capable of acquiring information from raw data in order to perform exploratory analysis. Several techniques have been developed to cluster sampled univariate vectors only considering the average value over the whole period and as such they have not been able to explore fully the underlying distribution as well as other features of the data, especially in presence of structured time series. We propose a model-based clustering technique that is based on quantile regression permitting us to cluster bivariate time series at different quantile levels. We model the within cluster density using asymmetric Laplace distribution allowing us to take into account asymmetry in the distribution of the data. We evaluate the performance of the proposed technique through a simulation study. The method is then applied to cluster time series observed from Glob-color satellite data related to trophic status indices with aim of evaluating their temporal dynamics in order to identify homogeneous areas, in terms of trophic status, in the Gulf of Gabes.

TI  - Crop type classification in Southern Brazil: Integrating remote sensing, crop modeling and machine learning
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop type mapping is essential for agricultural monitoring, but lack of terrestrial labels (herein termed as ground truth data) limit these models around the globe. In this study, we tested different methods for creating crop type maps for soybean (Glycine max L.) and corn (Zea mays L.), with aims of i) compare ground truth data related to crop modeling; ii) evaluate agricultural field masks generated by Environmental Rural Register, MapBiomas product, and random forest model; iii) evaluate models of a) unsupervised classification, b) supervised classification with ground truth data of 1 year, c) with ground truth data of 2 years, d) supervised classification with crop modeling only, e) with the combination of crop modeling and ground truth data of 1 year, and f) with ground truth data of 2 years; iv) test sample size for training the model utilizing ground truth data and crop modeling in transfer learning approach; and v) examine spatial remote sensing features to guide crop data collection. The APSIM-NG crop model was utilized for generate crop modeling simulations to compare with satellite images harmonic regression of ground truth data. We found similarity of harmonic regression coefficients derived from crop modeling and satellite imagery of Sentinel-2 of the labeled ground truth data for both soybean and corn crops. Agricultural masks showed efficiency for crop area estimation for soybean, with highest accuracy with random forest model. Crop modeling aggregated with growing season data as input for supervised learning presented the greater model performance with overall accuracy of 0.94. Crop area prediction was most accurate for soybean [R-2 = 0.93, and mean absolute error (MAE) = 2,052 ha] for the model with the combination of crop modeling and ground truth data of 2 years, and least for corn, [R-2 = 0.18, and MAE = 1,146 ha] when only using crop modeling. Model performance was influenced by sample size, with greater accuracy (0.93) for aggregating crop modeling (150 samples) and year data (100 samples). In addition, considering spatial field data variability as model input increased overall accuracy from 0.84 to 0.93, with higher impact when only ground truth data was utilized for input in the model. Our results suggest that these methods offer options for crop type classification when less adequate ground truth data is available and with unsupervised learning. On the other hand, supervised learning utilizing crop modeling with presence of field data did improve model performance overall.

TI  - Determining metamorphic grade from greenschist to amphibolite using Hyperion data: the case of an inverted metamorphic gradient of Almora nappe (lesser Himalaya)
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The intricate nature of metamorphic terrain remains a complex problem for many remote sensing scientists. The metamorphic rock assemblages are composed by intrinsic mixtures of index minerals which are defined at different pressure and temperature zones. Metamorphic assemblage's nature and geothermal gradient can be identified using reflectance spectroscopy. The study aims to determine the nature and gradient of metamorphism using spectral identification of the index mineral phases. A model for metamorphic assemblage was developed to predict the nature and grade of metamorphism in order to address the problem with the inadequate quantification of mineral spectral mixing. The study addresses the problem by incorporating semi-empirical method of classification of metamorphic rock assemblage based on reflectance characteristics. We use the simulated spectral library of Hyperion satellite data which is favourable for classifying geological outcrops in metamorphic terrain of the Almora nappe of lower Himalayas. The Hyperion data analysis reveals the nature and trend of change of the metamorphic grades within different zones based on mass proportion of index mineral assemblages. An inverse thermal grade of the metamorphic Almora group is observed along North Almora Thrust and South Almora Thrust, where reverse thrusting might have resulted in lowering of pressure and temperature condition. The developed model can be utilized for geological survey's involving metamorphic terrain in inaccessible areas.

AB  - This article lays out an argument for relocating worldview analysis from the margins of conflict analysis to its center. While we may understand worldviews as an integral part of most escalated conflicts-which may seem to be about something else as well (e.g., energy, borders, economic grievances)-worldviews conflict can also be described as a particular form of conflict. This duality is important to recognize for the further development of the field of conflict analysis. The article also lays out the relevance of worldview analysis to conflict analysis, and how it can enhance our understanding of escalatory conflict dynamics.

TI  - Time series change detection using reservoir computing networks for remote sensing data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a multivariate time series forecasting model applicable to high-dimensional short-term forecasting is proposed. The Reservoir Computing Network (RCN) state reduction method is investigated to address the dimensionality arising from high-dimensional data. To enable the states to express very distant dependencies in time so that the RCN satisfies the echo state property, a bidirectional RCN model is investigated to capture the dependencies of the data forward and backward in time. To solve the short-term data prediction, the spatiotemporal transformation theory is combined with the RCN to exploit the conjugate property between delayed and nondelayed embeddings of dynamical systems, and the correlation between variables in high-dimensional systems is used to compensate for the shortcomings of short-term series, design the method of the RCN training, and complete the prediction of future states. In the experiments, four existing models based on two different data sets were used for comparison, and the results showed that our method has better prediction performance.

T2  - ENERGY & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The availability of accurate and reliable solar radiation data is very important to explore solar energy potential for commercial power plants. This study presents the validation of global horizontal irradiance (GHI) from McClear model under clear-sky and all-sky conditions against measured data for complex topography of Pakistan. The McClear GHI shows good agreement with measured GHI under clear-sky conditions for nine stations and good correlation was achieved with correlation coefficient ranging from 0.972 to 0.992. The relative mean bias error (rMBE) and relative root mean square error (rRMSE) using GHI data having temporal resolution of 10 minutes was ranging from -2.3 to 6.4% and 3.6 to 7.8% respectively. A seasonal statistical analysis shows variation of errors during seasons, significant variation of errors was observed for monthly statistical analysis, the overall errors for all stations were maximum in January and minimum in June. Cloud fraction (CF) from three state-of-the-art datasets (ERA-5, MERRA-2 and MODIS) was incorporated into McClear clear-sky GHI (GHI(MC,clear-sky)) to derive commercially resourceful all-sky GHI data (GHI(MC,all-sky)) using a noval approach. The rMBE of GHI(MC,all-sky) using CF from ERA-5, MERRA-2 and MODIS ranges from 0.1 to 8.4%, 0.1 to 14.1% and 0.2 to 16.8% respectively. The application of ERA-5 cloud fraction shows good correlation with correlation coefficient ranging from 0.871 to 0.966 and gave best results as rMBE for all stations is less than 4% except one station, the long-term GHI(MC,all-sky) data can be used for the solar resource assessment of Pakistan in the absence of measured data.

TI  - Generative Adversarial Networks in the built environment: A comprehensive review of the application of GANs across data types and scales
T2  - BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a type of deep neural network that have achieved many state-of-the-art results for generative tasks. GANs can be useful in the built environment, from processing large-scale urban mobility data and remote sensing images at the regional level, to performance analysis and design generation at the building level. We analyzed 100 articles to provide a comprehensive state-of-the-art review on how GANs are currently applied to solve challenging tasks in the built environment. Our results show that: (i) GANs are replacing older methods in some problems and setting state-of-the-art performances; (ii) GANs are opening new frontiers in previously overlooked problems, such as automatically generating spatially accurate floorplan layouts; (iii) GANs can be applied to different scales in the built environment, from entire cities to neighborhoods and buildings; and (iv) GANs are being used in a variety of problems and data types, from remote sensing data augmentation, vector data generation, spatio-temporal data privacy protection, to building design generation. In total, there are 26 unique application domains enabled by GANs; (v) however, one common challenge in this field currently is the lack of high-quality datasets curated specifically for problems in the built environment. With more data in the future, GANs could potentially produce even better results than today.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem water use efficiency (eWUE) can be used to obtain a better comprehension of the ecosystem water-carbon cycle. This study aimed to characterize the regional-scale responses and adaptations of different vegetation categories to drought changes and the spatiotemporal characteristics of WUE and associated drought factors for nine vegetation categories in Inner Mongolia, China, from 2000 to 2020. This study estimated drought, the association between drought and eWUE among varying vegetation categories, and the differences in eWUE between the drought stage and the post-drought stage by analyzing the spatiotemporal variations in eWUE of different vegetation categories based on MODIS ET (evapotranspiration), GPP (gross primary productivity), and temperature vegetation drought index data. The results illustrated the following: (1) the multi-year mean eWUE from 2000 to 2020 was 1.03 g center dot m(-2)center dot mm(-1), with an overall significantly increasing trend of 0.008 g center dot m(-2)center dot mm(-1) and eWUE decreasing from northeast to southwest. (2) The rank of vegetation types in Inner Mongolia according to multi-year mean eWUE was evergreen coniferous forest > savanna > evergreen broadleaf forest > forested grassland > farmland > deciduous broadleaf forest > mixed forest > closed scrub > grassland. All vegetation categories illustrated an increasing trend in eWUE over time. (3) eWUE was inversely associated with drought in the drought stage and a clear effect of drought legacy was identified in which harsh drought impacted the eWUE of the ecosystem, whereas eWUE was positively associated with drought. (4) The eWUE values of ecosystems increased significantly after drought, indicating that ecosystems that are adapted to drought show high capacity to recovery from drought stress.

TI  - Genotype distribution and evolutionary analysis of rotavirus associated with acute diarrhea outpatients in Hubei, China, 2013-2016
T2  - VIROLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Group A human rotaviruses (RVAs) annually cause the deaths of 215,000 infants and young children. To understand the epidemiological characteristics and genetic evolution of RVAs, we performed sentinel surveillance on RVA prevalence in a rotavirus-surveillance network in Hubei, China. From 2013 to 2016, a total of 2007 fecal samples from hospital outpatients with acute gastroenteritis were collected from four cities of Hubei Province. Of the 2007 samples, 153 (7.62%) were identified positive for RVA by real-time RT-PCR. RVA infection in Hubei mainly occurred in autumn and winter. The highest detection rate of RVA infection was in 1-2 years old of outpatients (16.97%). No significant difference of RVA positive rate was observed between females and males. We performed a phylogenetic analysis of the G/P genotypes based on the partial VP7/VP4 gene sequences of RVAs. G9P[8] was the most predominant strain in all four years but the prevalence of G2P[4] genotype increased rapidly since 2014. We reconstructed the evolutionary time scale of RVAs in Hubei, and found that the evolutionary rates of the G9, G2, P[8], and P[4] genotypes of RVA were 1.069 x 10(-3), 1.029 x 10(-3), 1.283 x 10(-3) and 1.172 x 10(-3) nucleotide substitutions/site/year, respectively. Importantly, using a molecular clock model, we showed that most G9, G2, P[8], and P[4] genotype strains dated from the recent ancestor in 2005, 2005, 1993, and 2013, respectively. The finding of the distribution of RVAs in infants and young children in Hubei Province will contribute to the understanding of the epidemiological characteristics and genetic evolution of RVAs in China.

TI  - Spectral features of Fe and organic carbon in estimating low and moderate concentration of heavy metals in mangrove sediments across different regions and habitat types
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil or sediment spectral reflectance do not directly reflect information of spectrally featureless heavy metals. With mangrove sediment samples collected in five regions and four habitat types, this study aimed to explore the spectral features related to spectrally active constituents (Fe and organic carbon (OC)) in estimating low and moderate concentrations of four heavy metals (Cr, Ni, Cu and Pb). A total of 27 modeling strategies using XGBoost (extreme gradient boosting) model were compared for estimating each heavy metal: three types of spectral features (Fe, OC and heavy metal) * three spectral transformation methods (Log(1/R), first derivative (FD) and continuous wavelet transform (CWT)) * three variable selection methods (genetic algorithm (GA), successive projection algorithm (SPA) and recursive feature elimination (RFE)). The results showed that the combination of CWT and RFE was recommended for heavy metal estimation, and the ranking of model accuracy was Cu > Pb > Ni > Cr. The optimal XGBoost model was found using spectral features related to Fe for Cr (R-Val(2)(determination coefficient of independent validation) = 0.42, RMSE (root mean square error) = 0.32 and RPIQ (the ratio of performance to interquartile range) = 1.53) and Cu estimation (R-Val(2)= 0.87, RMSE = 0.19 and RPIQ = 2.20), spectral features related to OC for Ni estimation (R-Val(2) = 0.63, RMSE = 0.26 and RPIQ = 2.38) and spectral features related to Pb itself for Pb estimation (R-Val(2) = 0.82, RMSE = 0.23 and RPIQ = 2.59). Moreover, the XGBoost model transferability across different habitat types outperformed that across different regions and data ranges of Fe and OC. We conclude that the modeling strategy using spectral features related to spectrally active constituents has great potentials in quantifying low and moderate concentration of sediment heavy metals, and the samples with high Fe concentration (31.62-37.29 g kg-1) are recommended to improve estimation accuracy of low and moderate concentrations of heavy metals, which could provide sampling strategy development and early warning of heavy metal pollution in mangrove ecosystem.

TI  - Assessment of forest dieback on the Moroccan Central Plateau using spectral vegetation indices
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Cork oak forests in Morocco are rich in resources and services thanks to their great biological diversity, playing an important ecological and socioeconomic role. Considerable degradation of the forests has been accentuated in recent years by significant human pressure and effects of climate change; hence, the health of the stands needs to be monitored. In this study, the Google Engine Earth platform was leveraged to extract the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and soil-adjusted vegetation index, from Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS satellite images between 2015 and 2017 to assess the health of the Sibara Forest in Morocco. Our results highlight the importance of interannual variations in NDVI in forest monitoring; the variations had a significantly high relationship (p < 0.001) with dieback severity. NDVI was positively and negatively correlated with mean annual precipitation and mean annual temperature with respective coefficients of 0.49 and - 0.67, highlighting its ability to predict phenotypic changes in forest species. Monthly interannual variation in NDVI between 2016 and 2017 seemed to confirm field observations of cork oak dieback in 2018, with the largest decreases in NDVI (up to - 38%) in December in the most-affected plots. Analysis of the influence of ecological factors on dieback highlighted the role of substrate as a driver of dieback, with the most severely affected plots characterized by granite-granodiorite substrates.

TI  - Peri-urban growth into natural hazard-prone areas: mapping exposure transformation of the built environment in Nairobi and Nyeri, Kenya, from 1948 to today
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Kenya experiences massive urban growth, also into natural hazard-prone areas, exposing settlements and the natural environment to riverine and pluvial floods and other natural hazards. While Nairobi as the capital and principal city has been extensively analysed regarding urban growth and flood hazard in some central parts, awareness of growing peri-urban areas has not been studied as much. The results are of interest to other locations in Kenya and worldwide, too, since the current research and disaster risk practice focus is still too much on megacities and city centres. Therefore, the study compares urban growth into hazard areas in urban rims of Nairobi and Nyeri, Kenya. A change assessment from 1948 to 2020 is conducted by aerial images, declassified satellite images, and recent data. Urban growth rates are 10- to 26-fold, while growth into flood exposed areas ranges from 2- to 100-fold. This study reveals unused opportunities for expanding existing land-use change analysis back to the 1940s in data-scarce environments.

TI  - An improved approach to estimating crop lodging percentage with Sentinel-2 imagery using machine learning
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - It is imperative to rapidly and precisely acquire crop lodging area and severity for disaster prevention and yield prediction. However, estimation of crop lodging area at a large scale remains challenging due to the relatively low sensitivity of remote sensing signal to the lodging variation, limited availability of remote sensing images, and lodging statistical data. This study proposes a new method for lodging area estimation based on the optimal grid cell of Sentinel-2 and crop lodging percentage, overcoming the limitation of traditional pixel-based mapping approaches that fail to obtain quantitative lodging information. Basing the spatial aggregation method, we analyzed the optimal grid size of Sentinel-2 data for lodging percentage estimation. Then we investigated the spectral response for different lodging percentage levels and analyzed the potential of lodging percentage esti-mation for Sentinel-2 metrics (including selected spectral bands and their derived vegetation indexes (VIs)). A quantitative model was established between the training set and the Sentinel-2 metrics using the random forest (RF) algorithm. Finally, around 1462.62 ha fields from six counties or districts in Heilongjiang province in China were estimated for lodging percentage. Results indicate that the proposed method can estimate the crop lodging percentage on the testing set with an R2 and RMSE of 0.64 and 25.24, respectively, which can explain around 95 % spatial variation of lodging crop. Moreover, the overall magnitude of reflectance increased with the increase in lodging percentage. Among all Sentinel-2 optimal metrics, the Green, SWIR1, and Red edge 1 bands are the most crucial indicators for lodging percentage estimation. Our results on lodging percentage estimation in the study area indicate that there is more lodging maize in the Meilisidawoerzu district than in other areas. Although typhoons passed over Fuyu and Lindian counties, the lodging percentage in these areas is relatively low. The lodging percentage map has great value in agriculture management and insurance claim.

TI  - Predicting Regional Lymph Node Recurrence in the Modern Age of Tumor-Positive Sentinel Node Melanoma: The Role of the First Postoperative Ultrasound
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The Multicenter Selective Lymphadenectomy Trial II (MSLT-II) led to a change in the management of tumor-positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) from completion node dissection (CLND) to nodal observation. This study aimed to evaluate prognostic factors for predicting sentinel node basin recurrence (SNBR) using data from MSLT-II trial participants. Methods In MSLT-II, 1076 patients were treated with observation. Patients were included in the current study if they had undergone a post-sentinel node basin ultrasound (PSNB-US) within 4 months after surgery. The study excluded patients with positive SLN by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or incomplete SLN pathologic data. Primary tumor, patient, PSNB-US, and SLN characteristics were evaluated. Multivariable regression analyses were performed to determine independent prognostic factors associated with SNBR. Results The study enrolled 737 patients: 193 (26.2%) patients with SNBR and 73 (9.9%) patients with first abnormal US. The patients with an abnormal first US were more likely to experience SNBR (23.8 vs. 5.0%). In the multivariable analyses, increased risk of SNBR was associated with male gender (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.38; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00-1.9; p = 0.049), increasing Breslow thickness (aHR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.01-1.2; p = 0.038), presence of ulceration (aHR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.42-2.6; p < 0.001), sentinel node tumor burden greater than 1 mm (aHR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.10-3.3; p = 0.022), lymphovascular invasion (aHR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.00-2.3; p = 0.048), and presence of abnormal PSNB-US (aHR, 4.29; 95% CI, 3.02-6.1; p < 0.001). Conclusions The first postoperative US together with clinical and pathologic factors may play an important role in predicting SNBR.

TI  - Spatial and temporal dynamics of desertification and its driving mechanism in Hexi region
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Investigating the spatio-temporal patterns of desertification and its driving mechanisms is crucial for efforts to improve the ecology and environment and combat desertification. Based on meteorological and satellite remote sensing data, this paper analyzed the dynamic characteristics of desertification in the Hexi region of arid and semiarid land in Northwest China from 2000 to 2018 using a dimidiate pixel model; revealed the relationship between desertification evolution characteristics and climatic variations and anthropogenic events based on the change characteristics of net primary productivity (NPP); and then clarified the response of desertification to climatic variations and anthropogenic events using a geodetector model. Outcomes show that: (1) overall desertification in Hexi region is at a serious level, but during the study period, severe desertification decreased, mainly concentrated in the east and southwest, and non-desertification increased, mainly near the Qilian Mountains and Shule River basin; (2) there were both spatial and temporal dynamics during the study period, with severe desertification decreasing by 11% and moderate, light, and non-desertification increasing by 3%, 5%, and 3% respectively; (3) during 2000-2005, human activities, climate change, and their joint contribution to desertification reversal were similar, i.e., 23%, 40%, and 36%, and the former two contributed equally to desertification expansion, 38% and 41%, respectively; climate change predominated in desertification reversal in 2005-2010 and 2015-2018, while human activities predominated in desertification expansion; human activities predominated in desertification reversal and climate change predominated in desertification expansion in 2010-2015. This research can provide a theoretical basis and technical support for ecological and environmental management and sustainable socio-economic development in arid and semiarid regions.

TI  - The incidence and features of Delphian lymph node involvement in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma
T2  - BMC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction In papillary thyroid cancer patients, the extent of dissection is still a matter of debate. Evaluating Delphian lymph nodes (DLNs) during the surgery has been speculated as a valuable tool to determine the extent of dissection. Herein, we aimed to evaluate the incidence and features of DLNs involvement in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma. Method We conducted this cross-sectional study among surgical cases of papillary thyroid cancer. Patients were divided based on their DLNs involvement status. Their age, gender, location of the mass, lymphatic involvement, tumor size, tumor characteristics, pathology report, and operation note features were compared between the two groups. Definitive pathology slides of the patients were evaluated regarding DLN features. Results Of the 61 patients (mean age: 38.2 +/- 12.0), 45 (73.8%) were females. In 13 (21.3%) patients, DLNs involvement was reported. A statistically significant relationship was noted between DLNs involvement and other lymph nodes' involvement on the same side of the mass (P < 0.001), the opposite side (P = 0.041), and also central lymph nodes (P < 0.001). Vascular invasion was also significantly higher among patients with DLNs involvement (P = 0.012). Conclusion Since DLNs involvement is significantly associated with extensive nodal involvement, intraoperative evaluation of DLNs is recommended to establish the extent to which dissection should be performed.

TI  - Predicting individual apple tree yield using UAV multi-source remote sensing data and ensemble learning
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - As one of the world's most popular fruit, apple tree yield prediction before harvest plays an important role in optimizing orchard nutrition management, especially at the individual tree level. However, few studies focus on fruit-tree yield prediction with remote-sensing technology whereas most of them aim at field crops. Current fruits identifying and counting methods often fail to produce the expected result due to light and occlusion in complex orchard conditions. Since both the spectral and morphological characteristics of tree canopy can reflect the growth and development of fruit trees and are directly related to its potential yield. In this study, we develop a channel for automatic extraction of spectral and morphological features of apple trees using light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and multispectral imagery data from unmanned aerial vehicles. The contribution of spectral and morphological characteristics to the yield prediction of individual apple trees is discussed. With the combination of spectral and morphological features, an ensemble machine learning yield prediction model was developed by combining two widely used basic learners: support vector regression (SVR) and K-nearest neighbor (KNN). Then through extrapolating the ensemble model, the yield map was produced at the orchard level and individual tree level, respectively. The results show that the data processing channels developed in this study can accurately extract the morphological and spectral features of individual apple trees. Three features (Crown Volume 1, Ratio Vegetation Index, and CPA1) contribute most in apple tree yield prediction. The ensemble learning model outperforms all base learners with R2 = 0.813 for the validation and 0.758 for the test when using the selected three features. This study thus provides a practical example of predicting the yield of individual apple trees based on multi-source remote-sensing data and ensemble learning.

T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Although valuable for discovering geographical relationships and spatial statistics, bivariate maps or colour schemes are rarely employed in soil-related studies. For high-resolution mapping of the spatial relationships and patterns between the carbon-to-nitrogen (CN) ratio and its uncertainty throughout the Czech Republic, we assessed the application of a bivariate colour scheme. A random forest (RF) model was used to forecast CN ratio levels derived from the LUCAS topsoil dataset (n = 440 topsoil samples) using a stack of 22 environmental covariates. Of these covariates, Landsat 8 predictors (i.e. b6-SWIR 1 and b2-BLUE) had the highest relative value in the RF model. Additionally, partial dependence plots (PDPs) revealed that the aforementioned predictors had a comparable marginal impact on the CN model prediction. The 30 mx 30 m pixels CN ratio and uncertainty maps (at 0-20 cm) were able to distinguish the level contents evenly across the entire country while displaying distinct spatial features for each map. The uncertainty map and CN ratio prediction were both utilized to logically construct a bivariate colour scheme at 60 m x 60 m pixels, which enabled a once-off visualization of the two maps. The approach was deemed promising and proved generalizable for large-scale geographical evaluations in the focus area. Based on the output of the bivariate map visual, the spatial relationships and patterns between the CN ratio prediction and its uncertainty could be studied.[GRAPHICS].

TI  - Multi-site assessment of the potential of fine resolution red-edge vegetation indices for estimating gross primary production
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Gross primary production (GPP) models driven by fine resolution remote sensing data characterize the spatial and temporal heterogeneities in plant photosynthesis, which is largely dependent on biome-specific maximum photosynthetic capacity. The red-edge reflectance, sensitive to leaf chlorophyll content, is a good proxy of maximum photosynthetic capacity. More importantly, studies show that the red-edge reflectance-related chlorophyll content index (CIr) multiplied by the incident photosynthetic active radiation (PAR(in)) strongly correlates to GPP estimated at carbon flux towers (GPP(flux)). Yet, to the best of our knowledge, there is no systematic study investigating the general relationship between fine spatial resolution CIr and GPP among biomes and the relationship between CIr and maximum photosynthetic capacity in GPP models. To provide an overview on incorporating space-borne CIr into a GPP model, we applied fine resolution Sentinel-2-derived CIr and GPP(flux) over 57 flux sites representative of 10 biomes. We investigated the relationship between CIr and GPP(flux), and the spatio-temporal relationship between CIr and ecosystem maximum photosynthetic capacity indicated by the potential ecosystem light use efficiency (LUEpot). We also evaluated the relationship between other five vegetation indices (VIs) and GPP(flux). Results showed that the CIr multiplied by PAR(in) has a higher agreement (R-2 > 0.5) with GPP than other VIs. A universal relationship exists between the CIr multiplied by PAR(in) and GPP, except for forest biomes. The CIr also strongly (R-2 > 0.5) relates to the LUEpot during the peak of the growing season. The CIr has a low spatial variance (CV = 0.25) among biomes, highlighting that CIr can be a proxy of maximum photosynthetic capacity in GPP models that do not require biome-dependent coefficients. This study provides insight for incorporating CIr into GPP models and better quantifying global terrestrial photosynthesis.

T2  - ACTA GEOPHYSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessment of changing groundwater storage is an important factor that needs to be assessed over both time and space to understand the regional scenarios. This study has employed Geographical Temporal Weighted Regression (GTWR) along with Geographic Weighted Regression and Ordinary Least Squares to find the impact of various variables on Groundwater Storage Anomaly (GWSA). The study has made use of satellite data of gravity change, extracted using fishnet point observation to reduce processing complexity. All three methods have been compared using correlation coefficient, Akaike information criterion, and root mean squared error. Results show that GTWR, with highest R-square of 65.3 and lowest root mean square error of 0.18, is the more comprehensive option for quantifying the effect of controlling factors among its counterparts as it incorporates both spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Runoff, population density, and soil moisture are the dominant factors controlling groundwater changes with interquartile ranges of 2.35, 0.62 and 1.58 respectively, much bigger than twice the standard error. This indicates a significant effect of anthropogenic activities including rapid urbanization and increase in extraction for irrigation. Additionally, the use of GTWR led the analysis to highlight factors that influence neighboring regions. Instead of climate change and poor management of water, the alteration to the natural course of rivers has been highlighted as the biggest cause of water table decline in the region.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Live fuel moisture content (LFMC) is an important environmental indicator used to measure vegetation conditions and monitor for high fire risk conditions. However, LFMC is challenging to measure on a wide scale, thus reliable models for estimating LFMC are needed. Therefore, this paper proposes a new deep learning architecture for LFMC estimation. The architecture comprises an ensemble of temporal convolutional neural networks that learn from year-long time series of meteorological and reflectance data, and a few auxiliary inputs including the climate zone. LFMC estimation models are designed for two training and evaluation scenarios, one for sites where historical LFMC measurements are available (within-site), the other for sites without historical LFMC measurements (out-of-site). The models were trained and evaluated using a large database of LFMC samples measured in the field from 2001 to 2017 and achieved an RMSE of 20.87% for the within-site scenario and 25.36% for the out-of-site scenario.

TI  - Towards a North Pacific Ocean long-term monitoring program for plastic pollution: A review and recommendations for plastic ingestion bioindicators
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Review
AB  - Marine debris is now a ubiquitous component of the Anthropocene global ocean. Plastic ingestion by marine wildlife was first reported in the 1960s and since that time, roughly one thousand marine species have been reported to consume this debris. This study focuses on plastic ingestion by marine invertebrates and vertebrates in the North Pacific Ocean. Specifically, we reviewed the scientific literature to assess the scope of the problem, identified key bioindicator species, and proposed guidelines for future monitoring of plastic debris in North Pacific marine ecosystems. Our meta-analysis confirmed that the North Pacific is among the most polluted ocean regions globally; roughly half of all fish and seabird specimens and more than three-quarters of sea turtles and bivalve specimens examined in this region had consumed plastic. While there are not enough standardized data to assess if these ingestion rates are changing, sampling standardization and reporting of methods are improving over time. Using a rubric-evaluation approach, we evaluated 352 species for their potential to serve as bio-indicators of the prevalence of plastic pollution in the North Pacific. This analysis revealed a suite of 12 bio-indicator species candidates which sample a variety of ecosystem components and cover a wide range of plastic size classes. Thus, we contend that these bioindicator candidates provide a key foundation for developing a comprehensive plastic monitoring program in the region. To enhance the utility of these bioindicators, we developed a framework for standardized data collection to minimize methodological variability across different studies and to facilitate the assessment of temporal trends over space and time. Tracking plastic ingestion by these bioindicators will help to assess the effectiveness of mitigation actions in the region, a critical step to evaluate progress towards sustainability and improved ocean health in the 21st century.

TI  - <SUP>???????</SUP>Internal bonding microstructures characterisation between plant nanocellulose and concrete mortar mixtures for indoor Radon-222 gas emanation reduction
T2  - CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Radon-222 (Rn-222) is a natural radioactive gas produced by the radium-226 (Ra-226) decay process, which is part of the uranium-238 (U-238) decay series. Rn-222 gas can penetrate into the respiratory system during the inhalation process and have an indirect effect on lung tissues due to energetic alpha particles. Brick is a common building material that consists of rock, water, and sand. It is the most prevalent source of Rn-222 gas emanation to humans in an indoor building environment. To reduce indoor Rn-222 gas emanation, kenaf and oil palm cellulose nano -fibrils (CNF) were mixed into bricks in certain ratios and acted as liquid fillers. CNFs were produced by using chemical pulping, bleaching, and ultrasonic techniques. Ten composite bricks with different ratios of CNF and one control brick were fabricated by following Malaysia Standard (MS 7.6:1972). The characterization of CNF was done using Fourier Transformed Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) was used to analyse the internal porosity and surface area of the fabricated bricks. Rn-222 concentrations in the bricks and humidity inside the prototype Perspex box were recorded using the Radon Sentinel Monitor Model 1030. The surface areas for control brick, 40 mL kenaf, and oil palm CNF composite bricks are 3.4473 m(2)/g, 4.449 m(2)/g, and 4.9025 m(2)/g, respectively. Meanwhile, pore sizes for control brick, 40 mL kenaf and oil palm CNF composite bricks are 2.92 nm, 0.347 nm and 2.27 nm, respectively. The highest Rn-222 con-centration was measured in control brick, which is 3.77 pCi/L, followed by 40 mL kenaf CNF brick and 40 mL oil palm CNF brick, with readings of 1.4 pCi/L and 0.93 pCi/L. The incorporation of CNFs has the ability to reduce Rn-222 emissions while increasing the physical strength of the bricks.

TI  - Albedo impacts of current agricultural land use: Crop-specific albedo from MODIS data and inclusion in LCA of crop production
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural land use and management practices affect the global climate due to greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes and changes in land surface properties. Increased albedo has the potential to counteract the radiative forcing and warming effect of emitted GHGs. Thus considering albedo could be important to evaluate and improve agricultural systems in light of climate change, but the albedo of individual practices is usually not known. This study quantified the albedo of individual crops under regional conditions, and evaluated the importance of albedo change for the climate impact of current crop production using life cycle assessment (LCA). Seven major crops in southern Sweden were assessed relative to a land reference without cultivation, represented by semi-natural grassland. Crop-specific albedo datawere obtained from a MODIS product (MCD43A1 v6), by combining its spatial response pattern with geodata on agricultural land use 2011-2020. Fluxes of GHGs were estimated using regional data and models, including production of inputs, field operations, and soil nitrogen and carbon balances. Ten-year mean albedo was 6-11% higher under the different crops than under the reference. Crop-specific albedo varied between years due to weather fluctuations, but differences between crops were largely consistent. Increased albedo countered the GHG impact from production of inputs and field operations by 17- 47% measured in GWP100, and the total climate impact was warming. Using a timedependent metric, all crops had a net cooling impact on global mean surface temperature on shorter timescales due to albedo (3-12 years under different crops), but a net warming impact on longer timescales due to GHG emissions. The methods and data presented in this study could support increasingly comprehensive assessments of agricultural systems. Further research is needed to integrate climatic effects of land use on different spatial and temporal scales, and direct and indirect consequences from a systems perspective.

TI  - A deep learning multi-layer perceptron and remote sensing approach for soil health based crop yield estimation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, Deep Learning Multi-Layer Perceptron (DLMLP) neural networks have shown remarkable success in addressing crop yield forecast related problems. The methodologies used so far for crop yield forecast with remotely sensed data were focused upon vegetation indices generated from optical data. The prediction of crop yield in an accurate manner by developing robust machine learning models based on soil health parameters is crucial since it helps keep a track of soil health as well as its impact on overall yield. This study aims to utilize remotely sensed Microwave satellite data from Sentinel-1 and optical data from Sentinel-2, and field data to estimate three important soil health parameters-Soil Moisture, Soil Salinity, and Soil Organic Carbon (SOC). The study has been carried out in the Rupnagar district of Punjab in India. The estimated soil health parameters, SAR backscatter, and optical remote sensing satellite data parameters were utilized to estimate wheat crop yield. The soil health based DLMLP model performed best in crop yield estimation and gave R-2 values of 0.723 and 0.684 in the training and testing phases, respectively, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.98 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) value of 1.24 for the 2019-20 season. The DLMLP test R-2 was 42.2% more than the Ordinary Least Squares Regressor (OLS), while the MAE and RMSE were 37.97% and 38.61% less than the OLS regressor for wheat crop yield estimation. The soil health-based DLMLP model gave satisfactory yield estimation accuracy in the absence of validation of soil health parameter values for the preceding years-2015-16 till 2018-19 wheat seasons. This study's novel feature is that it estimates soil health parameters for the early stages of wheat crop growth when soil lies mostly exposed and utilises them for crop yield prediction.

TI  - Assessing the bridge construction effect on river shifting characteristics through geo-spatial lens: A case study on Dharla River, Bangladesh
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - The key objective of the bridge structure on a river is to confirm and assist the continual communication. On the other hand, it also has a harmful effect on the hydrological and morphological behavior of the neighboring zone as of the river width contraction. The present study assessed the Bridge construction effect on river shifting characteristics for Dharla River. For doing so, this study followed two steps. First, Landsat imageries for both pre -bridge structure period (1988, 1993 and 1998) and post-bridge structure period (2003, 2008, 2013 and 2017), has been processed and used to determine the thalweg line. Then, geo-spatial environment has been used to assess the thalweg line shifting characteristics and channel width variations. The results revealed a frequent shifting of thalweg line towards both the east and west direction at the upstream side of this Bridge and also the dominating eastwards shifting at the downstream side of the Bridge. After constructing the Dharla Bridge on Dharla River (i.e. post-bridge structure period) the movement of the channel has been changed at a significant level. Particularly, it has been found that the east side shifting is higher than the west side. Thus, the existing of Dharla Bridge has an abundant effect on the shifting characteristics of thalweg line. The study concluded that the shifting of the thalweg lines of Dharla River undergoes a drastic change of study period and the River can be treated as a very dynamic one. The results of this study might supportive for the sustainable and future development of the rivers and adjacent flood plain in Bangladesh.

TI  - Developing an effective marine eDNA monitoring: eDNA detection at pre-outbreak densities of corallivorous seastar (Acanthaster cf. solaris)
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Outbreaks of the corallivorous Crown-of-Thorns Seastar (CoTS) Acanthaster cf. solaris contribute significantly to coral reef loss. Control of outbreaks is hampered because standard monitoring techniques do not detect outbreaks at early (low density) stages, thus preventing early intervention. We previously demonstrated that eDNA monitoring can detect CoTS at intermediate densities. Here, we test whether detection probability can be improved by (i) targeted site selection or collection at specific times and (ii) moving from an average eDNA copy number approach (based on the limit of quantification) to a presence/absence approach (based on the limit of detection). Using a dataset collected over three years and multiple reef sites, we demonstrated that adding water residence age, sea surface level and temperature into generalized linear models explained low amounts of variance of eDNA copy numbers. Site specific CoTS density, by contrast, was a significant predictor for eDNA copy numbers. Bayesian multi-scale occupancy modelling of the presence/absence data demonstrated that the probability of sample capture (theta) on most reefs with intermediate or high CoTS densities was >0.8. Thus, confirming CoTS presence on these reefs would only require 2-3 samples. Sample capture decreased with decreasing CoTS density. Collecting ten filters was sufficient to reliably (based on the lower 95 % Credibility Interval) detect CoTS below nominal outbreak levels (3 Ind. ha-1). Copy number-based estimates may be more relevant to quantify CoTS at higher densities. Although water residence age did contribute little to our models, sites with higher residence times may serve as sentinel sites accumulating eDNA. The approach based on presence or absence of eDNA facilitates eDNA monitoring to detect CoTS densities below outbreak thresholds and we continue to further develop this method for quantification.

TI  - Multi-source remote sensing data reveals complex topsoil organic carbon dynamics in coastal wetlands
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands are considered important stores of blue carbon, containing some of the largest stores of pedologic and biotic carbon per unit area on the planet. These ecosystems are however highly sensitive to Climate Change and changes in the management practices. It is of utmost importance to address relevant ecosystem scales in order to fully understand carbon dynamics in coastal wetlands. In this regard, Unoccupied Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can provide spatial scales detailed enough to address the fine scale patters of topsoil organic carbon accumulation in coastal wetlands. This study demonstrates the use of multispectral and photogrammetric data derived from UAVs to accurately map plant communities and topsoil organic carbon concentration in coastal wetlands. The overall accuracies from the classification of plant communities ranged from 88% to 97% whereas RMSE for topsoil organic carbon concentration ranged from 2.44% to 0.74%. By combining both models, site-specific variations in topsoil carbon concentrations among plant communities were unveiled. Open pioneer communities consistently showed the lowest topsoil organic carbon concentration, while the concentrations vary considerably across plant communities characterized by denser vegetation coverage. Furthermore, Sentinel-1 radar data was used to assess the spatial patterns of flood frequency. GAMs were used to combine flood frequency with the plant communities and topsoil organic carbon models, as well as an aboveground biomass (AGB) model from a previous study. GAMs revealed a stronger effect than flood frequency on topsoil organic carbon. Regarding flooding, increased flood frequency generally led decreased topsoil organic concentrations across communities and sites. However, the relative contribution of flood frequency to topsoil organic carbon concentration in Baltic coastal wetlands depends strongly on the location of the wetland and the nature of the floods. Higher flood frequencies could lead to increased topsoil organic carbon in wetlands subject to the input of estuarine sediments. Lastly, the integration of remote sensing platforms constitutes an effective tool for revealing spatial heterogeneity of carbon storage in coastal wetlands.

TI  - The effect of forest certification on conservation and sustainable forest management
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examined the effect of sustainable forest management schemes on forest conservation using remote sensing data on forest change. We applied fixed effect models focusing on two major sustainable forest management schemes: the Forest Stewardship Council and the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification. Contrary to the findings from previous research, the regression results showed that expansion of the sustainable forest management area was uncorrelated with forest loss when controlling for the fixed effects of country and time. These findings were robust to the different definitions of a forest and country groups' OECD membership. Our estimations suggested that sustainable forest management increased forest loss in non-certified forest areas, indicating the leakage of forest loss from certified to non-certified forest areas. This implies that leakage effects should be considered when implementing forest management or protected forest schemes.

TI  - Mapping tree species proportions from satellite imagery using spectral-spatial deep learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing can be used to collect information related to forest management. Previous studies demonstrated the potential of using multispectral satellite imagery for classifying tree species. However, methods that can map tree species in mixed forest stands on a large scale are lacking. We propose an innovative method for mapping the proportions of tree species using Sentinel-2 imagery. A convolutional neural network was used to quantify the per-pixel basal area proportions of tree species considering the neighbouring environment (spectral-spatial deep learning). A nested U-shaped neural network (UNet++) architecture was implemented. We produced a map of the entire Wallonia Region (southern Belgium). Nine species or groups of species were considered: Spruce genus, Oak genus, Beech, Douglas fir, Pine genus, Poplar genus, Larch genus, Birch genus, and remaining species. The training dataset for the convolutional neural network model was prepared using a map of forest parcels extracted from the public forest administration's geodatabase of Wallonia. The accuracy of the predicted map covering the region was independently assessed using data from the regional forest inventory of Wallonia. A robust assessment method for tree species proportions maps was proposed for assessing the (1) majority species, (2) species composition (presence or absence), and (3) species proportions (proportion values). The achieved value of indicator OA(maj )(0.73) shows that our approach can map the majority tree species in mixed and pure forest stands. Indicators MS (0.89), MPS (0.72) and MUS (0.83) support that the model can predict the species composition in most cases in the study area. Spruce genus, Oak genus, Beech, and Douglas fir achieved the best results, with PAs and UAs close to or higher than 0.70. Particularly, high performance was achieved for detecting Oak genus and Beech in low area proportions: PAs and UAs higher than 0.70 from the 0.4 proportion. Predicted proportions had a R-adj (2)of 0.50. The proposed method, which uses spectral-spatial deep learning to map the proportions of tree species, is innovative because it was adapted to the complexity of mixed forests and spatial resolution of current satellite imagery. Additionally, it optimises the use of available forest data in the model conception by considering all pixels from pure stands to highly mixed forest stands. When forest inventories are available in a broad sense, that is, georeferenced areas with the proportions of tree species, this method is highly reproducible and applicable at a large scale, offering potential for use in forest management.

TI  - Assessment of PRISMA water reflectance using autonomous hyperspectral radiometry
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) derived from PRISMA in the visible and infrared range was evaluated for two inland and coastal water sites using above-water in situ reflectance measurements from autonomous hyper- and multispectral radiometer systems. We compared the Level 2D (L2D) surface reflectance, a standard product distributed by the Italian Space Agency (ASI), as well as outputs from ACOLITE/DSF, now adapted for processing of PRISMA imagery. Near-coincident Sentinel-3 OLCI (S3/OLCI) observations were also compared as it is a frequent data source for inland and coastal water remote sensing applications, with a strong calibration and validation record. In situ measurements from two optically diverse sites in Italy, equipped with fixed autonomous hyperspectral radiometer systems, were used: the REmote Sensing for Trasimeno lake Observatory (RESTO), positioned in a shallow and turbid lake in Central Italy, and the Acqua Alta Oceanographic Tower (AAOT), located 15 km offshore from the lagoon of Venice in the Adriatic Sea, which is characterised by clear to moderately turbid waters. 20 PRISMA images were available for the match-up analysis across both sites. Good performance of L2D was found for RESTO, with the lowest relative (Mean Absolute Percentage Difference, MAPD < 25%) and absolute errors (Bias < 0.002) in the bands between 500 and 680 nm, with similar performance for ACOLITE. The lowest median and interquartile ranges of spectral angle (SA < 8(degrees)) denoted a more similar shape to the RESTO in situ data, indicating pigment absorption retrievals should be possible. ACOLITE showed better statistical performance at AAOT compared to L2D, providing R-2 > 0.5, Bias < 0.0015 and MAPD < 35%, in the range between 470 and 580 nm, i.e. in the spectral range with highest reflectances. The addition of a SWIR based sun-glint correction to the default atmospheric correction implemented in ACOLITE further improved performance at AAOT, with lower uncertainties and closer spectral similarity to the in situ measurements, suggesting that ACOLITE with glint correction was able to best reproduce the spectral shape of in situ data at AAOT. We found good results for PRISMA Rrs retrieval in our study sites, and hence demonstrated the use of PRISMA for aquatic ecosystem mapping. Further studies are needed to analyse performance in other water bodies, over a wider range of optical properties.

TI  - Reproductive cycle of two marine sentinel bivalve species<i> (Donax</i><i> trunculus</i> and<i> Scrobicularia</i><i> plana)</i> in the Agadir bay, Southern Morocco
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The reproductive cycle of two marine sentinel bivalve species, Donax trunculus and Scrobicularia plana, was studied from monthly random samples. A total of 1200 specimens were collected from January to December 2019 in two different sites of Agadir bay (Agadir beach; AG and Oued Souss estuary; OS). The analysis was based on the temporal variation of condition index, gonadal index, sex-ratio, and maturity stages of gonads through histological observation. We also studied the environmental parameters and their impact on the reproduction of those species. Results indicate that the sex-ratio was slightly unbalanced in favor of females in AG ( = 1: 1.3) and males in OS ( = 1: 0.9). Stages of gonad development maturity were identified as five stages: undifferentiated, developing, ripe, spawning, and spent. The spawning period occurred from March to July for S. plana, and from May to August for D. trunculus; the two species had one annual gonadal cycle. During the microscopic observations, no parasitic infection was detected. The physico-chemical parameters; especially temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, and precipitation, influenced the gonads maturity and the spawning process in the studied species.

TI  - Nonlinear effects of thermokarst lakes on peripheral vegetation greenness across the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau using stable isotopes and satellite detection
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermokarst lakes (TLs) widespread in thawing permafrost can degrade vegetation through thermomechanical erosion and waterlogging. However, whether TLs change water sources and alleviate water stress for plants is unknown, and previous knowledge about regional TL effects on surrounding vegetation greenness is rare. Here, we synthesized field investigations, stable isotopes, and remote sensing images from an unmanned aerial vehicle and Sentinel-2 to determine the effects of over 160,000 TLs on their surrounding growing-season normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The results are as follows: 1) With the largest water source shifting from 0 to 10 cm soil water to lake water, TL-affected plants can grow better than TL-unaffected plants, which is associated with soil texture and the development stage of the lake. 2) Overall, the median affecting distances of TLs on surrounding surface moisture (tasseled cap wetness, TCW) and NDVI were 50 m with their 25th-75th percentiles of 40-70 m and 40-60 m, respectively; compared with the unaffected areas, TLs increased peripheral TCW but reduced NDVI with their median change rates of 19.84% and -10.42%, respectively. 3) However, the nonlinear response of NDVI to the TCW gradient was dominant, which was featured by a local peak NDVI due to the coexistence of the physical destruction and improved water availability, and both TCW and NDVI at the peak area were explicitly larger than those at the unaffected area. 4) Along southeast-northwest environmental gradients (topographic, climatic, and edaphic factors), the affected range and degradation ratio of NDVI were greater under drier climate, larger lake area, sand-richer soil, fewer soil nutrients, and worse vegetation type (e.g., alpine desert). Briefly, the net adverse consequence on NDVI suggests that TLs primarily represent permafrost-supported ecosystems deteriorating, but the clear nonlinear effects advance the knowledge of this landscape; additionally, these local vegetation changes can help interpret the regional greening/browning and promote the research on the biogeochemical interaction among TL, soil, and plants under climate warming and permafrost thawing.

TI  - Postoperative hypotonia in a patient with stiff person syndrome: a case report and literature review
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ANESTHESIA-JOURNAL CANADIEN D ANESTHESIE
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose Stiff person syndrome (SPS), an autoimmune disease that manifests with episodic muscle rigidity and spasms, has anesthetic considerations because postoperative hypotonia may occur. This hypotonia has been linked to muscle relaxants and volatile anesthetics and may persist in spite of neostigmine administration and train-of-four (TOF) monitoring suggesting full reversal. We present a patient with SPS who experienced hypotonia following total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), which was promptly reversed with sugammadex. These observations are considered in light of the relevant medical literature. Clinical features A 46-yr-old female patient with SPS underwent breast lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy. Anesthesia consisted of TIVA (propofol/remifentanil) with adjunctive administration of rocuronium 20 mg to obtain adequate intubating conditions. Despite return of the TOF ratio to 100% within 30 min, hypotonia was clinically evident at conclusion of surgery two hours later. Sugammadex 250 mg reversed residual muscle relaxation permitting uneventful extubation. A literature review identified six instances of postoperative hypotonia (TIVA, n = 3; volatile anesthetics, n = 3) in spite of neostigmine administration (n = 2) and TOF monitoring suggesting full reversal (n = 4). Conclusions Patients with SPS may show hypotonia regardless of general anesthetic technique (TIVA vs inhalational anesthesia), which can persist despite recovery of the TOF ratio and may be more effectively reversed by a chelating agent than with an anticholinesterase. If general anesthesia is required, we suggest a cautious approach to administering muscle relaxants including using the smallest dose necessary, considering the importance of clinical assessment of muscle strength recovery in addition to TOF monitoring, and discussing postoperative ventilation risk with the patient prior to surgery.

TI  - Estimation of unrecorded groundwater abstractions in Jordan through regional groundwater modelling
T2  - HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Jordan suffers from water scarcity and groundwater covers the majority of Jordan's water supply. Therefore, there is an urgent need to manage this resource conscientiously. A regional numerical groundwater flow model, developed as part of a decision support system for the country of Jordan, allows for quantification of the overexploitation of groundwater resources and enables determination of the extent of unrecorded agricultural groundwater abstraction. Groundwater in Jordan is abstracted from three main aquifers partly separated by aquitards. With updated geological, structural, and hydrogeological data available in the country, a regional numerical groundwater flow model for the whole of Jordan and the southernmost part of Syria was developed using MODFLOW. It was first calibrated for a steady-state condition using data from the 1960s, when groundwater abstraction was negligible. After transient calibration using groundwater level measurements from all aquifers, model results reproduce the large groundwater-level declines experienced in the last decades, which have led to the drying out of numerous springs. They show a reversal of groundwater flow directions in some regions, due to over-abstraction, and demonstrate that documented abstractions are not sufficient to cause the observed groundwater-level decline. Only after considering irrigation water demand derived from remote sensing data, the model is able to simulate these declines. Illegal abstractions can be quantified and predictive scenarios show the potential impact of different management strategies on future groundwater resources.

TI  - Evaluating contributions of urbanization and global climate change to urban land surface temperature change: a case study in Lagos, Nigeria
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study develops a general method to evaluate the contributions of localized urbanization and global climate change to long-term urban land surface temperature (ULST) change. The method is based on the understanding that long-term annual ULST is controlled by three factors: (1) localized urbanization, (2) global climate change, and (3) interannual climate variation. Then the method removes the interannual climate fluctuations on long-term observed LST time series via linear regression and separates the contributions of urbanization and climate change to the impacts on long-term ULST via urban-rural comparison. The method is applied to Lagos, a fast-growing metropolis in the tropical West Africa, as an example for reference. Combined time-series daily daytime and nighttime MODIS Land Surface Temperature (LST) data over the years of 2003-2021 are used as the representation of land surface temperature. To avoid the potentioal interannual data biase due to uneven availability of data in the rainy seasons over years, only MODIS LST data from dry seasons are used in the study. The results are summarized as follows for Lagos: (1) long-term annual ULST is confirmed to be controlled by the three factors; (2) the proposed method can separate the contribution of the three factors to the ULST; (2) both localized urbanization and global warming are verified to contribute to the ULST increase with positive trends; (3) daytime ULST increased the most in the afternoon time at a mean rate of 1.429 degrees C per decade, with 0.985 degrees C (10 year)(-1) contributed by urbanization and 0.444 degrees C (10 year)(-1) contributed by climate warming; (4) nighttime ULST in Lagos increased the most after midnight at a rate of 0.563 degrees C (10 year)(-1), with 0.56 degrees C (10 year)(-1) contributed by urbanization and 0.003 degrees C (10 year)(-1) contributed by climate warming; and (5) urbanization is generally responsible for around 60.97% of the urban warming in Lagos. Therefore, the increasing urbaniztion-induced urban heat island effect is the major cause for more heat-related health risks and climate extremes that many urban residents are suffering. The results of this study are of useful reference for both urbanization and climate change related issues in the geo-science field.

TI  - Assessment of long-term particulate nitrate air pollution and its health risk in China
T2  - ISCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Air pollution is a major environmental and public health challenge in China and the Chinese government has implemented a series of strict air quality policies. However, particulate nitrate (NO3-) concentration remains high or even increases at monitoring sites despite the total PM2.5 concentration has decreased. Unfortunately, it has been difficult to estimate NO3- concentration across China due to the lack of a PM2.5 speciation monitoring network. Here, we use a machine learning model incorporating ground measurements and satellite data to characterize the spatiotemporal patterns of NO3-, thereby understanding the disease burden associated with long-term NO3- exposure in China. Our results show that existing air pollution control policies are effective, but increased NO3- of traffic emissions offset reduced NO3- of industrial emissions. In 2018, the national mean mortality burden attributable to NO3- was as high as 0.68 million, indicating that targeted regulations are needed to control NO3- pollution in China.

TI  - Update on sentinel node pathology in breast cancer
T2  - SEMINARS IN DIAGNOSTIC PATHOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Pathologic examination of the sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in patients with breast cancer has been impacted by the publication of practicing changing trials over the last decade. With evidence from the ACOSOG Z0011 trial to suggest that there is no significant benefit to axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in early-stage breast cancer patients with up to 2 positive SLNs, the rate of ALND, and in turn, intraoperative evaluation of SLNs has significantly decreased. It is of limited clinical significance to pursue multiple levels and cytokeratin immunohistochemistry to detect occult small metastases, such as isolated tumor cells and micrometastases, in this setting. Patients treated with neoadjuvant therapy, who represent a population with more extensive disease and aggressive tumor biology, were not included in Z0011 and similar trials, and thus, the evidence cannot be extrapolated to them. Recent trials have supported the safety and accuracy of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in these patients when clinically node negative at the time of surgery. ALND remains the standard of care for any amount of residual disease in the SLNs and intraoperative evaluation of SLNs is still of value for real time surgical decision making. Given the potential prognostic significance of residual small metastases in treated lymph nodes, as well as the decreased false negative rate with the use of cytokeratin immunohistochemistry (IHC), it may be reasonable to maintain a low threshold for the use of cytokeratin IHC in post-neoadjuvant cases. Further recommendations for patients treated with neoadjuvant therapy await outcomes data from ongoing clinical trials. This review will provide an evidence-based discussion of best practices in SLN evaluation.

TI  - Predicting spatial and temporal changes in surface urban heat islands using multi-temporal satellite imagery: A case study of Tehran metropolis
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays, predicting spatial and temporal changes of surface urban heat islands (SUHIs) is both a demanding challenge and a subject of interest for researchers working on urban thermal en-vironments. This study aimed to predict the spatial-temporal changes of SUHI in Tehran city. The research data consisted of Landsat multi-temporal images, MODIS-derived water vapor and land surface temperature (LST) products, as well as climatic data. The cellular automata (CA)-Markov model was used for predicting the spatial and temporal land cover changes. Afterward, based on the statistical and spatial information of the impact of land cover changes on LST changes, maps of the LST and SUHII were procured for future years. The results showed that the area of built-up lands increased by 88% from 1985 to 2019. The built-up lands area is expected to increase to 446.3, 463.9, and 480.1 km(2) by 2026, 2032, and 2038, respectively. The mean LST of Tehran city in 1985, 1992, 2000, 2009, and 2019 was 36.45, 41.95, 43.15, 44.95, and 47.25 degrees C, respectively. By 2026, 2032, and 2038, the mean LST may reach 48.65, 49.95, and 51.15 degrees C, respectively. Analysis of the SUHI ratio index in Tehran showed an increase from 0.01 in 1985 to 0.34 in 2019, and is expected to reach 0.38, 0.45, and 0.51 by 2026, 2032, and 2038, respectively.

TI  - When the times get tough the toughs get funny: Means by which humor buffers against death anxiety emerged during COVID-19 outbreak
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - According to Terror Management Theory (TMT), there are three common buffers that minimize the anxiety of mortality salience: affirmation of a) one's cultural worldview, b) the self and one's personal values, and c) one's significance in the context of close personal relationships. The current study aimed at examining the contents of memes, which were distributed on social media during the COVID-19 outbreak, to explore the means by which humor buffers against death anxiety. A deductive and inductive thematic analysis captured three means by which humor buffers against death anxiety, a) humor as a means for connecting to cultural worldviews; b) humor as a means for inclusion in group; c) humor as a means to gain a sense of control. These findings are discussed through the theoretical lens of TMT.

TI  - Utilising Sentinel-1's orbital stability for efficient pre-processing of sigma nought backscatter
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - For already more than seven years, the Sentinel-1 C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mission has been providing indispensable information for monitoring bio-geophysical parameters at fine temporal and spatial scales. As many applications require backscatter datacubes as input, enormous amounts of data have to be radiometrically and geometrically corrected to be in a common, Earth-fixed reference system. Pre-processing workflows accomplishing this task have already been established and are implemented in several software suites. However, typically, these workflows are computationally expensive which may lead to prohibitively large costs when generating multi-year Sentinel-1 datacubes for whole continents or the world. In this paper, we discuss existing approaches for generating sigma nought and projected local incidence angle (PLIA) data and present simplifications of the overall workflow relying on the unprecedented orbital stability of Sentinel-1. Propagating orbital deviations through the complete Sentinel-1 pre-processing pipeline helped us to simulate and identify PLIA as a static layer per relative orbit. The outcome of these simulations also provided the necessary information to replace iterative root-finding algorithms for determining the time of closest approach (TCA), i.o.w. the azimuth index, with a linear one - at no expense of radiometric accuracy. All experiments were performed using an in-house developed toolbox named wizsard, which made it possible to speed up Sentinel-1 pre-processing by approximately 4-5 times with respect to the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP). This could pave the way for producing quality-curated, large-scale backscatter datacubes at continental and global scales in acceptable time frames.

TI  - Evaluation of Simplified Lymphatic Microsurgical Preventing Healing Approach (SLYMPHA) for the prevention of breast cancer-related lymphedema after axillary lymph node dissection using bioimpedance spectroscopy
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Lymphedema is a serious complication of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) with an incidence rate of 20%. Simplified Lymphatic Microsurgical Preventing Healing Approach (SLYMPHA) is a safe and relatively simple method, which decreases incidence of lymphedema dramatically. Our initial study showed an 88% decrease in clinical lymphedema rate. In the initial study, we used arm circumference measurement for the diagnosis of lymphedema and median follow up was 15 months. The aim of this study was to confirm these results after a long-term follow up period and by using bioimpedance spectroscopy (L-Dex) technology in detecting lymphedema.Study design: All patients, undergoing ALND with or without SLYMPHA between January 2014 and November 2020 were included in the study. Patients with no postoperative L-Dex measurements were excluded. A L-Dex score outside the normal range (+/- 10 L-Dex unit) or >= 10 L-Dex unit increase above patient's baseline was considered as lymphedema. The incidence of lymphedema was compared between patients with and without SLYMPHA.Results: 194 patients were included in the study. 57% of cohort underwent SLYMPHA. Mean follow-up time was 47 +/- 37 months. Patients, who underwent SLYMPHA, had a significantly lower rate of lymphedema (16% vs 32%; p = 0.01; OR 0.4 [0.2-0.8]).Conclusion: SLYMPHA is a safe and relatively simple method, which continued its efficacy after a longterm follow up period. It should be considered as an adjunct procedure to ALND for all patients during initial surgery.

TI  - UAV-based classification of maritime Antarctic vegetation types using GEOBIA and random forest
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Development of vegetation communities in areas of Antarctica without permanent ice cover emphasizes the need for effective remote sensing techniques for proper monitoring of local environmental changes. Detection and mapping of vegetation by image classification remains limited in the Antarctic environment due to the complexity of its surface cover, and the spatial heterogeneity and spectral homogeneity of cryptogamic vege-tation. As ultra-high resolution aerial images allow a comprehensive analysis of vegetation, this study aims to identify different types of vegetation cover (i.e., algae, mosses, and lichens) in an ice-free area of Hope Bay, on the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula. Using the geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) approach, remote sensing data sets are tested in the random forest classifier in order to distinguish vegetation classes within vegetated areas. Because species of algae, mosses, and lichens may have similar spectral char-acteristics, subclasses are established. The results show that when only the mean values of green, red, and NIR bands are considered, the subclasses have low separability. Variations in accuracy and visual changes are identified according to the set of features used in the classification. Accuracy improves when multilayer infor-mation is used. A combination of spectral and morphometric products and by-products provides the best result for the detection and delineation of different types of vegetation, with an overall accuracy of 0.966 and a Kappa coefficient of 0.946. The method allowed for the identification of units primarily composed of algae, mosses, and lichens as well as differences in communities. This study demonstrates that ultra-high spatial resolution data can provide the necessary properties for the classification of vegetation in Maritime Antarctica, even in images obtained by sensors with low spectral resolution.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ROBOTICS AND COMPUTER ASSISTED SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The sentinel lymph node (SLN) procedures using indocyanine green (ICG) have recently been performed worldwide. The aim of this study was to emphasise the safety of robot-assisted modified radical hysterectomy (RAMRH) with removal of the lymphatic vessels (RLV) using ICG in endometrial cancer according to a single surgeon's experience. Methods Robot-assisted modified radical hysterectomy with RLV using ICG was performed in patients with endometrial cancer. We compared 34 cases of RAMRH with RLV, with 54 patients without RLV. Results The median (interquartile range) time for the procedure did not differ between the RAMRH with and without RLV groups (88 [80-114] vs. 88 [79-104] min, p = 0.7). The success rate of RLV was 100% when SLNs were detected. Conclusion Robot-assisted modified radical hysterectomy with RLV using ICG can completely dissect tissue from the uterus, including lymphatic vessels. This procedure using a robotic system with ICG, is simple and does not require additional time.

TI  - Estimation of building height using a single street view image via deep neural networks
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Building smart cities requires three-dimensional (3D) modelling to facilitate the planning and management of built environments. This requirement leads to high demand for data on vertical dimensions, such as building height, that are critical for the construction of 3D city models. Despite increasing recognition of the importance of such data, their acquisition in a low-cost and efficient manner remains a daunting task. Big data, particularly street view images (SVIs), provide an opportunity to efficiently solve this problem. In this study, we aim to derive information on building height from openly available SVIs by using single view metrology. Unlike other methods using multisource inputs, our method capitalizes on deep neural networks to extract a set of features - such as vanishing points, line segments, and semantic segmentation maps - for single view measurement and then es-timates the height from single SVIs. The minimal input required by the method increases its competitiveness in large-scale estimation of building heights, especially in areas with difficulty to obtain the conventional remote sensing data. In addition to experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method, we also conduct a thorough analysis of uncertainties and errors brought by the method, thereby providing guidance for its future applications.

TI  - How accurately can we retrieve irrigation timing and water amounts from (satellite) soil moisture?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - While ensuring food security worldwide, irrigation is altering the water cycle and generating numerous environmental side effects. As detailed knowledge about the timing and the amounts of water used for irrigation over large areas is still lacking, remotely sensed soil moisture has proved potential to fill this gap. However, the spatial resolution and revisit time of current satellite products represent a major limitation to accurately estimating irrigation. This work aims to systematically quantify their impact on the retrieved irrigation information, hence assessing the value of satellite soil moisture for estimating irrigation timing and water amounts.In a real-world experiment, we modeled soil moisture using actual irrigation and meteorological data, obtained from farmers and weather stations, respectively. Modeled soil moisture was compared against various remotely sensed products differing in terms of spatio-temporal resolution to test the hypothesis that high-resolution observations can disclose the irrigation signal from individual fields while coarse-scale satellite products cannot. Then, in a synthetic experiment, we systematically investigated the effect of soil moisture spatial and temporal resolution on the accuracy of irrigation estimates. The analysis was further elaborated by considering different irrigation scenarios and by adding realistic amounts of random errors in the soil moisture time series.We show that coarse-scale remotely sensed soil moisture products achieve higher correlations with rainfed simulations, while high-resolution satellite observations agree significantly better with irrigated simulations, suggesting that high-resolution satellite soil moisture can inform on field-scale (similar to 40 ha) irrigation. A thorough analysis of the synthetic dataset showed that satisfactory results, both in terms of detection (F-score > 0.8) and quantification (Pearson's correlation > 0.8), are found for noise-free soil moisture observations either with a temporal sampling up to 3 days or if at least one-third of the pixel covers the irrigated field(s). However, irrigation water amounts are systematically underestimated for temporal samplings of more than one day, and decrease proportionally to the spatial resolution, i.e., coarsening the pixel size leads to larger irrigation underestimations. Although lower spatial and temporal resolutions decrease the detection and quantification accuracies (e.g., R between 0.6 and 1 depending on the irrigation rate and spatio-temporal resolution), random errors in the soil moisture time series have a stronger negative impact (Pearson R always smaller than 0.85). As expected, better performances are found for higher irrigation rates, i.e. when more water is supplied during an irrigation event. Despite the potentially large underestimations, our results suggest that high-resolution satellite soil moisture has the potential to track and quantify irrigation, especially over regions where large volumes of irrigation water are applied to the fields, and given that low errors affect the soil moisture observations.

TI  - Moxibustion regulates T-regulatory/T-helper 17 cell balance by modulating the microRNA-221/suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 axis in a mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE-JIM
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) progression is associated with the balance of T-regulatory (Treg) and T-helper 17 (Th17) cells, while the role of microRNAs (miRs) in regulating Treg/Th17 cell balance has not been clarified. This study aimed to assess whether moxibustion could regulate Treg/Th17 cell balance by modulating the miR-221/suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) axis in the RA mouse model. Methods: A mouse model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) was established in male DBA/1J mice. Twenty-two days after CIA induction, the mice received daily treatment with moxibustion for 12 times. Pathological scores were assessed according to the levels of synovial hyperplasia. The expression levels of cytokines interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), IL-17 and IL-10 were analyzed in serum by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4(+)) splenocytes was analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. The expression levels of RA-related miRs and target genes were subsequently detected, and the target of miR-221 was confirmed by the dual-luciferase reporter assay. Results: It was revealed that moxibustion treatment decreased the pathological scores and downregulated the expression levels of IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma and IL-17, while upregulated the expression level of IL-10. The Treg/Th17 cell balance was regulated by moxibustion treatment. The expression level of miR-221 was suppressed by moxibustion treatment. Furthermore, SOCS3 was found as the direct target of miR-221, which mediated the function of moxibustion by regulating the Treg/Th17 cell balance. Conclusion: Moxibustion therapy regulated the Treg/Th17 cell balance by modulating the miR-221/SOCS3 axis in the RA mouse model. Please cite this article as: Zhao C, Li XY, Li ZY, Li M, Liu ZD.

TI  - Long-term quality of life and aesthetic outcomes after breast conserving surgery in patients with breast cancer
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Breast surgery has become less invasive without compromising survival and aimed at improving quality of life (QoL) in terms of satisfaction with cosmesis. Despite that, short-term patient -perceived aesthetic results after breast-conserving surgery (BCS) can still be displeasing. Long-term analysis regarding contentment with cosmesis are lacking and could be different, considering that over time, patients' priorities might change and a different thought-out judgment could be given. The goal of this study is to describe long-term results in QoL after BCS and to identify possible predictors for disappointing aesthetic results.Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, the long-term outcomes of QoL, patient-reported outcome measurements and aesthetic outcomes were investigated 4.5-10.8 years after BCS. In total, 104 patients received standardized questionnaires from the European Organisation of Research and Treatment of Cancer. The aesthetic results after BCS were evaluated subjectively through a diverse panel of healthcare observers. Objective assessment of the aesthetic results was done using the BCCT.core system of eval-uating standardised breast photographs. Factors influencing aesthetic outcome were statistically analysed.Results: QoL was high in around 75% of the patients. Correlation between QoL and aesthetic outcomes was found according to Spearman's correlation (r = 0.262, p = 0.007). Significant factors negatively influencing patient reported aesthetic outcomes were sentinel node procedure (p = 0.016), axillary lymph node dissection (p = 0.004), chemotherapy (p = 0.001), and hormonal therapy (p = 0.001). Conclusion: The majority of the patients have acceptable QoL after BCS during long-term follow-up. Unacceptable aesthetic outcomes after BCS are associated with lower QoL and are influenced by sentinel node procedure, axillary lymph node dissection, chemotherapy, and hormonal therapy.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd, BASO -The Association for Cancer Surgery, and the European Society of Surgical Oncology.

TI  - A simple method for estimating macroalgae area under clouds on MODIS imagery
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The presence of clouds interferes with optical remote sensing monitoring of macroalgae blooms. To solve this problem, we propose a simple method for estimating macroalgae area under clouds (Area(_cloud_GT)) on MODIS imagery using the principle behind the lowpass filter. The method is based on a rectangle with clouds and eight identical adjacent rectangles surrounding it that contain macroalgae. The cloud rectangle is a central 'pixel' (Cloud) and the eight adjacent rectangles are 'pixels' GT1-GT8. The core operation is to calculate the central 'pixel' value, i.e., the macroalgae coverage rate in the Cloud rectangle. The macroalgae area detected by semi-simultaneous fine resolution images in the same region was taken as the 'real' value. A comparison of the estimation results and the 'real' value shown that the mean relative difference between them (MRD) was 30.09% when the time interval of the images within 10 minutes. When the time interval was over 3 hours, the MRD was more than 60%. The MRD increased significantly with increasing time interval because of the constant movement of the macroalgae and the limitations of the remote sensing image. The results indicate that this simple method is effective to a certain extent. These results can provide a reference for the quantitative analysis of green tide.

TI  - Vegetation cover dynamics along two Himalayan rivers: Drivers and implications of change
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rivers are dynamic landscape features that change in response to natural and anthropogenic factors through hydrolog-ical, geomorphic and ecological processes. The severity and magnitude of human impacts on river system and riparian vegetation has dramatically increased over the last century with the proliferation of valley-spanning dams, intensifica-tion of agriculture, urbanization, and more widespread channel engineering. This study aims to determine how changes in geomorphic form and dynamics caused by these human alterations relate to changes in channels and riparian vege-tation in the lower Beas and Sutlej Rivers. These rivers are tributaries of the Indus that drain the Western Himalayas but differ in the type and magnitude of geomorphic change in recent decades. Winter season vegetation was analysed over 30 years, revealing increasing trends in vegetated land cover in the valleys of both rivers, consistent with large-scale drivers of change. Greater trends within the active channels indicate upstream drivers are influencing river flow and geo-morphology, vegetation growth and human exploitation. The spatial patterns of vegetation change differ between the rivers, emphasizing how upstream human activities (dams and abstraction) control geomorphic and vegetation commu-nity response within the landscape context of the river. The increasing area of vegetated land is reinforcing the local evo-lutionary trajectory of the river planform from wide-braided wandering to single thread meandering. Narrowing of the active channels is altering the balance of resource provision and risk exposure to people. New areas being exploited for agriculture are exposed to greater risk from river erosion, inundation, and sediment deposition. Moreover, the change from braided to meandering planform has concentrated erosion on riverbanks, placing communities and infrastructure at risk. By quantifying and evaluating the spatial variations in vegetation cover around these rivers, we can better under-stand the interaction of vegetation and geomorphology alongside the impacts of human activity and climate change in these, and many similar, large systems, which can inform sustainable development.

TI  - Molecular assays for determining sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine drug resistance in India: a systematic review
T2  - PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - A plethora of studies analyse the molecular markers of drug resistance and hence help in guiding the evidence-based malaria treatment policies in India. For reporting mutations, a number of techniques including DNA sequencing, restriction-fragment length polymorphism and mutation-specific polymerase chain reaction have been employed across numerous studies, including variations in the methodology used. However, there is no sufficient data from India comparing these methods as well as report the prevalence of polymorphisms in SP drug resistance molecular markers independently using such methods. Therefore, all data from Indian studies available for molecular marker studies of Plasmodium falciparum drug resistance to sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine was gathered, and a systematic review was performed. This systematic review identifies the molecular methods in use in India and compares each method for detecting sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine drug resistance marker. To delay the spread of drug-resistant parasite strains, a simplified and standardized molecular method is much needed which can be obtained by analysing the performance of each method in use and answering the necessity of newer methodological approaches.

T2  - RELIGION & EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - A national sample of 389 educators who identify as Christian completed a questionnaire to determine their approaches to living out their faith in public schools. Participants considered 14 possible approaches. They reported modeling Christian virtue and providing "faithful presence" as most descriptive of their practice, but they were more reluctant about approaches that involve equipping students to address societal wrongs, incorporating biblical integration and worldview, and sharing the Christian message. Differences were found based on gender, age, race/ethnicity, and level/subject taught. Implications are drawn for teacher preparation programs to nurture future educators with a broader vision of community transformation.

TI  - Characterizing the spatial distribution of multiple malaria diagnostic endpoints in a low-transmission setting in Lao PDR
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The epidemiology of malaria changes as prevalence falls in low-transmission settings, with remaining infections becoming more difficult to detect and diagnose. At this stage active surveillance is critical to detect residual hotspots of transmission. However, diagnostic tools used in active surveillance generally only detect concurrent infections, and surveys may benefit from sensitive tools such as serological assays. Serology can be used to interrogate and characterize individuals' previous exposure to malaria over longer durations, providing information essential to the detection of remaining foci of infection. We ran blood samples collected from a 2016 population-based survey in the low-transmission setting of northern Lao PDR on a multiplexed bead assay to characterize historic and recent exposures to Plasmodium falciparum and vivax. Using geostatistical methods and remote-sensing data we assessed the environmental and spatial associations with exposure, and created predictive maps of exposure within the study sites. We additionally linked the active surveillance PCR and serology data with passively collected surveillance data from health facility records. We aimed to highlight the added information which can be gained from serology as a tool in active surveillance surveys in low-transmission settings, and to identify priority areas for national surveillance programmes where malaria risk is higher. We also discuss the issues faced when linking malaria data from multiple sources using multiple diagnostic endpoints.

TI  - Changes in extent of open-surface water bodies in China's Yellow River Basin (2000-2020) using Google Earth Engine cloud platform
T2  - ANTHROPOCENE
M3  - Article
AB  - Dynamics of open surface water is of great significance to understand the impacts of global changes and human activities on water resources. However, long-term changes of open-surface water bodies in the Yellow River Basin have remained poorly characterized. In the study, 26,681 high-quality Landsat images were processed using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform to study the long-term changes of the open water bodies in the Yellow River Basin from 2000 to 2020. A percentile-based image synthesis method was used to collect training samples. The multi-index water body extraction rule (MIWER) was proposed to rapidly extract surface water bodies. The results show that (1) The MIWER is suitable for long-term and large-scale surface water mapping based on Landsat images; (2) The average area of permanent and seasonal water in the last 20 years is 9062.59 km2 and 6918.83 km(2), respectively, accounting for 56.7% and 43.3% of the total surface water in the Yellow River Basin, respectively; (3) From 2000-2020, both permanent and seasonal water in the whole Yellow River Basin and sub -basins have increased. In general, the total open surface water shows an increasing trend with obvious spatial heterogeneity; (4) The changes of surface water in the Yellow River Basin are related to climate change and intensive human activities, but the influencing factors vary in different regions. The findings of this study demonstrate a novel robust, low-cost water extraction method that satisfies the requirements of terrestrial water inundation mapping and management across the Yellow River Basin. The methodology of this study is expected to be extended to global surface waters, providing valuable information for global surface water resource planning and management.

TI  - The effects of climate on land use/cover: a case study in Turkey by using remote sensing data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Economic and industrial development results in worldwide population concentration in cities, leading to increases in impervious surfaces. Thus, the surface temperatures increase and cities are exposed to the urban heat island effect. This study analyzed the changes in the urban heat island effect in the 30 years (from 1990 to 2021) in the central district of Bartin. In this sense, there were two primary goals. Firstly, land use/land cover change, land surface temperature (LST), normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were analyzed by using remote sensing methods between 1990 and 2021. Secondly, a linear regression analysis was conducted to determine the factors associated with LST, NDVI, and NDBI. The study results revealed increases in urban surfaces and the average land surface temperature values in the past 30 years and showed a decline in the vegetation. Regression analysis results indicated a strong negative relationship between LST and NDVI and a strong positive relationship between LST and NDBI. It was also found a robust negative relationship between NDBI and NDVI. In light of the findings, it was stated that the amount of open and green areas should be increased in order to prevent the negative effects of the urban heat island in the central district of Bartin. For this purpose, it has been proposed to encourage green roof systems throughout the city, to create city parks and to create a green belt system. In addition, as a result of the study, the importance of preventing forest destruction caused by over settlement in the Mountains, which is one of the rare habitats of the world with different plant species, was emphasized. In this sense, legal sanctions should be employed to protect those areas and prevent construction.

TI  - Experimental investigation into face milling of Inconel X750 super alloy: a study on cutting force and surface topography
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Purpose This work aims to describe the face milling analysis on Inconel X-750 superalloy using coated carbides. The formed chips and tool wear were further analyzed at different cutting parameters. The various impact of cutting parameters on chip morphology was also analyzed. Superalloys, often referred to as heat-resistant alloys, have exceptional tensile, ductile and creep strength at high operating temperatures and good fatigue strength, and often better corrosion and oxidation resistance at extreme heat. Because of these qualities, these alloys account for more than half of the weight of sophisticated aviation, biomedical and thermal power plants today. Inconel X-750 is a high-temperature nickel-based superalloy that is hard to machine because of its extensive properties. At last, the discussion regarding the tool wear mechanism was analyzed and discussed in this article. Design/methodology/approach The machining parameters for the study are cutting speed, feed rate and depth of cut. One factor at a time approach was implemented to investigate the effect of cutting parameters on the cutting forces, surface roughness and material removal rate. The scatter plot was plotted between cutting parameters and target functions (cutting forces, surface roughness and material removal rate). The six levels of cutting speed, feed rate and depth of cut were taken as cutting parameters. Findings The cutting forces are primarily affected by the cutting parameters, tool geometry, work material etc. The maximum forces Fx were encountered at 10 mm/min cutting speed, 0.15 mm/rev feed rate and 0.4 mm depth of cut, further maximum forces Fy were attained at 10 mm/min cutting speed, 0.25 mm/rev feed rate and 0.4 mm depth of cut and maximum forces Fz were attained at 50 mm/min cutting speed, 0.05 mm/rev feed rate and 0.4 mm depth of cut. The maximum surface roughness value was observed at 40 mm/min cutting speed, 0.15 mm/rev feed rate and 0.5 mm depth of cut. Originality/value The effect of machining parameters on cutting forces, surface roughness, chip morphology and tool wear for milling of Inconel X-750 high-temperature superalloy is being less researched in the present literature. Therefore, this research paper will give a direction for researchers for further studies to be carried out in the domain of high-temperature superalloys. Furthermore, the different tool wear mechanisms at separate experimental trials have been explored to evaluate and validate the process performance by conducting scanning electron microscopy analysis. Chip morphology has also been evaluated and analyzed under the variation of selected process inputs at different levels.

TI  - A high spatiotemporal resolution land surface temperature research over Qinghai-Tibet Plateau for 2000-2020
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - As ???the third pole of the world???, the land surface temperature (LST) of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) has a profound impact on the climate of central Asia and even the whole earth. Studying the impact of the LST over QTP depends on long time and high spatiotemporal resolution LST dataset. However, the unavailability of such dataset has hindered LST-related researches: one of the most important reasons is that traditional spatiotemporal fusion methods such as Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) have heavy computation demands to process big data. To fill this gap, this paper outlines one new cloud spatiotemporal fusion method by combining Google Earth Engine and STARFM to develop for the first time a 3-hourly 30 m LST dataset over the QTP from 2000 to 2020 through fusing Landsat and GLDAS-2.1 derived LST data. The outlined method first fuses the LSTs obtained from Landsat and GLDAS-2.1 data within one year to synthesize the LST of the entire QTP on one base time, and then the base time LST is spatiotemporally fused with GLDAS-2.1 LSTs on the base and prediction times to derive the 3-hourly 30 m QTP???s LSTs on prediction times. The outlined method provides a promising technical scheme for batch processing big data in combining traditional spatiotemporal fusion methods with cloud computing platforms. Derived LST dataset is validated by station observations at multiple time and spatial scales to have high accuracy, which provides a guarantee for analyzing water and heat exchange and climate change over the QTP.

TI  - Investigation of pre and post environmental impact of the lockdown (COVID-19) on the water quality of the Capibaribe and Tejipi?o rivers, Recife metropolitan region, Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The coronavirus pandemic has seriously affected human health, although some improvements on environmental indexes have temporarily occurred, due to changes on socio-cultural and economic standards. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impacts of the coronavirus and the influence of the lockdown associated with rainfall on the water quality of the Capibaribe and Tejipi ' o rivers, Recife, Northeast Brazil, using cloud remote sensing on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The study was carried out based on eight representative images from Sentinel-2. Among the selected images, two refer to the year 2019 (before the pandemic), three refer to 2020 (during a pandemic), two from the lockdown period (2020), and one for the year 2021. The land use and land cover (LULC) and slope of the study region were determined and classified. Water turbidity data were subjected to descriptive and multivariate statistics. When analyzing the data on LULC for the riparian margin of the Capibaribe and Tejipi ' o rivers, a low permanent preservation area was found, with a predominance of almost 100% of the urban area to which the deposition of soil particles in rivers are minimal. The results indicated that turbidity values in the water bodies varied from 6 mg. L-1 up to 40 mg. L-1. Overall, the reduction in humanbased activities generated by the lockdown enabled improvements in water quality of these urban rivers.

TI  - Estimation of vertical land motion along the south and west coast of Turkey from multi-sensor observations
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to estimate Vertical Land Motion (VLM) using multi-sensor and in-situ data at the tide gauge stations (TG) located on the western and southern coasts of Turkey. The analysis of tide gauge data, used to determine sea level changes for centuries, was supported by modern global geodetic observations, and the effect of VLM on the sea level trend was determined. In this context, VLM was calculated from the relative sea level trends of eight TG's between 1998 and 2018 and the absolute sea level trends obtained from the CTOH Along-Track Sea Level Anomalies regional products (X-TRACK) and Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) improved altimetry data covering the same temporal period. GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) measurements give a solution of the point-wise information about VLM at TG's, whereas InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) solutions give spatial information about VLM that were calculated from Sentinel-1 data, which was put into service after 2014. The analyses carried out on Turkey's south and west coasts revealed an uplift trend at all TG's, whereas an insignificant subsidence trend was determined at the MNTS tide gauge station. When focusing on the MNTS station, in the period of 1998-2018 VLM from XTRACK minus TG and CMEMS minus TG were estimated as-0.7 +/- 0.9 mm/yr and-0.5 +/- 0.8 mm/yr, respectively and also during the period of 2014-2018 VLM from GNSS and InSAR were estimated as-0.6 +/- 0.2 mm/yr and-0.3 +/- 0.1 mm/yr, respectively.

TI  - Assessing almond response to irrigation and soil management practices using vegetation indexes time-series and plant water status measurements
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Current water scarcity scenario has led to the implementation of sustainable agricultural practices intended to improve water use efficiency. The present work evaluates during three agricultural campaigns (2018-2020) the response of a young almond orchard to two management practices in terms by combining remote sensing indexes (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, NDVI; and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Indexes, SAVI) and physiological/morphological measurement (stem water potential, Psi(stem); trunk perimeter and canopy diameter). The management practices included (i) sustained deficit irrigation and (ii) soil management. Severe deficit irrigation resulted in lower vegetation indexes (VI) values, Psi(stem )and tree dimensions (13 %, 23 % and 14 % lower, respectively) than those obtained for full irrigation strategy; whereas moderate deficit irrigation did not affect any of the parameters analysed. The presence of vegetation cover in the inter-row resulted in a VIs increase (19-42 %) and in lower tree dimensions (reductions of 7-8 % for trunk perimeter and 0.34-0.37 m for canopy diameter) when compared to bare soil treatment, but did not have any influence on Psi(stem). The present study proves the suitability of remote sensing and physiological measurements for assessing almond response to the different management practices.

TI  - Source mechanism of the 2020 Mw 6.3 Nima earthquake derived from Bayesian inversions with InSAR observations: Insight into E-W extensional activity in the central Tibet
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Normal faults and conjugate strike-slip faults have been considered to play an important role in response to the extension deformation of central Tibet. On 22 July 2020, a Mw 6.3 earthquake struck the Nima county, central Tibet, in China, which provides a rare opportunity to get insights into how the normal faults in central Tibet accommodates the east-west extension caused by the Indian-Eurasian convergence. In this study, the Sentinel-1 images are collected to measure the coseismic deformation associated with this 2020 event and image its slip distribution. To mitigate the atmospheric phase effects, the generic atmospheric correction online service (GACOS) model is used to correct the coseismic inteferograms. The final coseismic deformation results show mainly negative displacement with a maximum value of similar to 30 cm in the line of sight (LOS) direction. After that, a Bayesian inversion method is used to invert the fault model. Our results reveal the optimal seismogenic fault of this event with a strike angle of 31.3 degrees, a dip angle of 51.6 degrees, and show that its slip distribution is dominated by normal slip with a maximum value of 2.55 m at a depth of 4.79-9.53 km, which suggest it's a blind normal rupture with high east-trending dip angle. The total released geodetic moment is, equivalent to Mw 6.3. In addition, we analyze the Coulomb stress change due to the 2008 Gaize and this 2020 Nima events, suggesting the 2020 event should not be triggered by the 2008 event. Finally, we estimate an interseismic slip rate of 4.7 +/- 1.2 mm/yr on the Yibug Caka-RigainPun Co (YCRC) fault with published global navigation satellite system (GNSS) measurements. Given that these high frequent normal slip events but a low crustal extension rate of 4.7 +/- 1.2 mm/yr in this region, we speculate that the asthenosphere material upwelling should be also a possible reason for E-W extensional activities in central Tibet.

TI  - Efficient selection of SAR features using ML based algorithms for accurate FVC estimation
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Fractional vegetation cover (FVC) is a ratio of vertical projection area of green vegetation to the total area under consideration. Crops infested by pests, diseases or nutrient deficiency show their impact on the crop coverage. Therefore, FVC is a good indicator of crop health and arid soil. Recently, various models have been reported for FVC estimation using optical data, but it is still limited to different weather conditions. Therefore, it is not feasible to continue crop monitoring using optical data. On the other hand, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data is weather independent, and has a good potential for crop monitoring in all-weather conditions. SAR data has been used for many crop parameters estimation, however has not been much explored for FVC estimation. Plenty SAR features are available which are sensitive to vegetation parameters. Some of the features are sensitive during early crop stages (e.g., entropy, DpRVI-dual polarization radar vegetation index), while others are sensitive during different stages of crops (backscattering signal of VH and VV polarization). Therefore, there is a need to critically assess all the features and find the optimum combination that provides exemplary results during the entire crop cycle. For this purpose, sixteen features are considered using the different combinations of Sentinel-1 SLC data and their temporal analysis is observed for their different phenology stages. Four machine learning (ML) based models i.e., LightGBM, Xgboost, K-nearest neighbor (KNN), and Random Forest have been explored on these features for FVC estimation. The performance of each model is assessed with the error metrics. Xgboost emerges as the best model with a minimum RMSE value of 0.159. Xgboost model has the capability to recognize the most important features. Due to the stochastic nature of the algorithm, feature priority sequence may vary, therefore, algorithm runs multiple times and the probability of each feature for every position is calculated and on the basis of the highest probability, feature importance sequences is decided. Xgboost model is developed by increasing the input features in the order of their importance sequence and the RMSE value is calculated for each input combination. It is noted that initially, the RMSE value improved from 0.22 to 0.15 for the top five input features. When additional features were included, no further improvement in the RMSE was observed. Therefore; entropy, alpha, VH, VH/VV, and VV are the top five features which are used in the Xgboost model for FVC estimation instead of all sixteen features, which delivers satisfactory results.

TI  - Which is a stronger predictor of the abundance of Dorcas Gazelle, <i>Gazella dorcas</i> in the Eastern desert of Egypt: human or natural factors?
T2  - ZOOLOGY IN THE MIDDLE EAST
M3  - Article
AB  - The Dorcas Gazelle, Gazella dorcas, has lost 86% of its global historical range, and is regionally categorized as endangered by the IUCN. The factors that caused this decline have never been quantified. In this work, field and remotely sensed data were used to examine the ecological and anthropogenic factors affecting the abundance of Dorcas Gazelle within Wadi El-Gemal Protected Area in the Eastern desert of Egypt, using Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM). The species' abundance is shaped by anthropogenic activities (number of car trails and proximity to the coastal road) more than ecological factors (vegetation and wetness indices). Dorcas Gazelle is avoiding more humid and greener areas because of human disturbance. Such suitable habitats may be perceived by gazelles as too dangerous, and the animals therefore prefer less suitable but safer habitats that are further away or less frequented by humans. Moreover, an easy to conduct, cheap monitoring tool, the Kilometric Abundance Index (KAI), was devised and implemented for baseline information to be used for future monitoring of Dorcas Gazelle.

TI  - Performance of Sentinel-2 SAFER ET model for daily and seasonal estimation of grapevine water consumption
T2  - IRRIGATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessment of water consumption is a crucial task for irrigation management in grapevines, especially in areas with limited water resources, which is the case of California Central Valley. This study evaluated the utility of the Simple Algorithm for Evapotranspiration Retrievement (SAFER) model to estimate daily and seasonal actual evapotranspiration (ETa) using Sentinel 2 images at 10-m spatial resolution and 5-day revisit time in 3 vineyards located at two sites in California. A unique characteristic of this model is the estimation of "synthetic" temperature maps, which are used as part of the estimation of ET and energy balance. The SAFER energy balance results were validated with six eddy covariance (EC) flux towers as part of the Grape Remote-sensing Atmospheric Profile and Evapotranspiration eXperiment (GRAPEX). The estimated surface temperature derived from upwelling longwave radiation measurements was closely correlated with the observed sensor surface temperature with R-2 higher than 0.86 for the analyzed EC towers. After performing an internal calibration, SAFER root mean square error (RMSE) values on daily ETa were between 0.64 and 0.75 mm day(-1). Additionally, the seasonal ETa was estimated and compared with the EC observations showing an average R-2 ranging from 0.64 to 0.52 mm/season. Spatial patterns of ETa showed variability between sites and producer management activities. The results found indicate both limitations and potential utility of SAFER for irrigation management in vineyards using daily or seasonal ETa under different irrigation treatments.

TI  - Neuroimaging and clinicopathological differences between tumefactive demyelinating lesions and sentinel lesions of primary central nervous system lymphoma
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveIt is still a challenge to distinguish sentinel lesions of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) from atypical tumefactive demyelinating lesions (TDLs) in clinical practice. We aimed to investigate potential differences of clinical features, neuroimaging findings and pathological characteristics between PCNSL and TDLs, improving early accurate diagnosis. MethodsIt was a retrospective study involving 116 patients with TDLs and 150 patients with PCNSLs. All cases were pathologically confirmed. Clinical features, neuroimaging findings and pathological characteristics between two groups were analyzed. ResultsThe onset age was 37 +/- 14 years in TDLs and 58 +/- 13 years in PCNSL(p=0.000). Main onset symptom was headache in TDLs, while cognitive impairment was frequently noted in PCNSL. CT brain scan image showed hypodense lesions in most cases of TDL (110/116, 94.8%), while approximately 80% patients (120/150) with PCNSL had hyperdense lesions. Furthermore, we found that the presence of Creutzfeldt-Peters cells (might be misdiagnosed as tumor cells) may serve as an important feature in TDLs. ConclusionsOnset age of patients with TDLs was younger than PCNSL. Neuroimaging features on brain CT scan might provide clues to make a differential diagnosis. Pathological features of PCNSL with sentinel lesions or following steroids therapy might mimic TDLs. Dynamic neuroimaging pathological and follow-up information were essential for an accurate diagnosis.

TI  - Recent Ice Trends in Swiss Mountain Lakes: 20-year Analysis of MODIS Imagery
T2  - PFG-JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY REMOTE SENSING AND GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Depleting lake ice is a climate change indicator, just like sea-level rise or glacial retreat. Monitoring Lake Ice Phenology (LIP) is useful because long-term freezing and thawing patterns serve as sentinels to understand regional and global climate change. We report a study for the Oberengadin region of Switzerland, where several small- and medium-sized mountain lakes are located. We observe the LIP events, such as freeze-up, break-up and ice cover duration, across two decades (2000-2020) from optical satellite images. We analyse the time series of MODIS imagery by estimating spatially resolved maps of lake ice for these Alpine lakes with supervised machine learning. To train the classifier we rely on reference data annotated manually based on webcam images. From the ice maps, we derive long-term LIP trends. Since the webcam data are only available for two winters, we cross-check our results against the operational MODIS and VIIRS snow products. We find a change in complete freeze duration of - 0.76 and - 0.89 days per annum for lakes Sils and Silvaplana, respectively. Furthermore, we observe plausible correlations of the LIP trends with climate data measured at nearby meteorological stations. We notice that mean winter air temperature has a negative correlation with the freeze duration and break-up events and a positive correlation with the freeze-up events. Additionally, we observe a strong negative correlation of sunshine during the winter months with the freeze duration and break-up events.

TI  - Sentinel node biopsy in node negative early oral cancers: Solution to the conundrum!
T2  - ORAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ideal management of the node-negative neck in early oral cancers is a debated issue. Elective neck dissection (END) is recommended in these patients as it offers a survival benefit. However, about 50-70% of patients who do not harbor occult metastasis are overtreated with this approach. Surgery is associated with morbidity, pre-dominantly shoulder dysfunction. Numerous attempts have been made to identify true node-negative patients through imaging and prediction models but none have high diagnostic accuracy to safely spare the neck dissection. The recent publications of 2 large randomized controlled trials comparing the outcomes of sentinel node biopsy (SNB) and END have spurred interest in SNB. Both the trials reported SNB to be an oncologically safe procedure and spared unnecessary neck dissections. The functional outcomes of the trials showed that SNB limits the morbidity compared to END, which albeit evens out at the end of one-year post-surgery. Despite its benefits, SNB has failed to gain widespread acceptability due to various limitations including the need for infrastructure, equipment costs, staff, and multidisciplinary collaboration of nuclear medicine, surgical, and pathology fraternity. The labor-intensive pathology protocol with serial step sectioning and immunohistochemistry poses a challenge to the feasibility at a high-volume center. This perspective discusses these limitations and propose plausible solutions to the conundrum. To make it widely applicable and feasible across the globe efforts should be directed to understand biology better, find novel solutions, and implement the lessons learned over decades from other sites.

TI  - Impact of routine use of a cerebral protection device on the TAVR procedure and its short-term outcomes: a single-centre experience
T2  - ACTA CARDIOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Stroke is a major concern in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). The introduction of a cerebral protection devices may counteract the evolution towards minimally invasive TAVR. At this time, there is insufficient data to support the routine use of these devices.Methods: We aimed to evaluate the outcome of the routine use of the Sentinel Cerebral protection system (R) (CPS) in patients undergoing TAVR, after completing a CT-based screening process for feasibility of Sentinel implantation. We report our initial experience with the routine implementation of the Sentinel CPS in all anatomically suitable patients undergoing TAVR. We retrospectively compared the procedural characteristics and outcomes between all TAVR patients treated with (n = 78) and without (n = 79) intended Sentinel.Results: The Sentinel CPS could successfully be deployed in 99% of intended cases after CT feasibility screening. TAVR procedures with Sentinel CPS were not longer than procedures without Sentinel use (89 +/- 20 versus 120 +/- 50 min, p = 0.007). Sentinel CPS use was not associated with an increased risk of procedural complications. Stroke was observed in none (0%) of the Sentinel CPS patients, and in 6.3% of the non-Sentinel CPS patients (p = 0.05). The finding of stroke was associated with a high risk of early postprocedural mortality: 60% of stroke patients died within 3 months.Conclusion: Routine use of the Sentinel CPS in CT-screened TAVR patients is feasible with high procedural success, without significant adverse events and without counteracting the evolution towards minimally invasive TAVR. Clinically relevant stroke was observed in none of the Sentinel CPS patients.

TI  - Retrieving global leaf chlorophyll content from MERIS data using a neural network method
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) is an indicator of plant physiological function and is an important parameter in estimating the carbon and water fluxes of terrestrial ecosystems. Spatiotemporally continuous LCC products are therefore needed at scales from the site level to the globe. In this study, we developed a neural network model for LCC retrieval from ENVISAT MERIS data based on radiative transfer model simulations. By considering the influence of canopy non-photosynthetic materials and the co-variations between LCC and biophysical parameters, a synthetic database was generated using the PROSAIL model with a good approximation to the canopy reflectance collection of MERIS data. Using a neural network trained from the synthetic database, we derived more realistic seasonal patterns of LCC than those using neural network models trained from synthetic databases generated without considering the influence of canopy non-photosynthetic materials or the parameter co -variations. A new global LCC product (GLOBMAP MERIS LCC) at 300-m resolution in 2003-2012 was generated using the neural network. It shows an improvement over the previous MERIS LCC product in capturing LCC seasonal variations in different plant functional types, and is potentially useful in improving the integration of physiological information within terrestrial ecosystem modeling and ecological monitoring across a range of spatial and temporal scales.

TI  - The Role of Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping in High-grade Endometrial Cancer
T2  - CURRENT TREATMENT OPTIONS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Opinion statement Total hysterectomy with lymph node assessment is the current standard-of-care for surgical staging in apparent early-stage endometrial cancer. Compared to the traditional complete pelvic lymphadenectomy with or without para-aortic lymphadenectomy, sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping results in fewer surgical complications, decreased operative time, and lower rates of chronic lymphedema. The technique is endorsed by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and the Society of Gynecologic Oncology guidelines, and over the past two decades the majority of gynecologic oncologists worldwide have adopted SLN mapping into their practice. However, as the results of the initial SLN studies were mostly based on low-grade tumors, adoption of the technique in high-grade tumors has been slower and more controversial. In this review, we discuss the most recent studies evaluating the SLN mapping in high-grade endometrial cancers. The results of these studies suggest that the SLN detection rate is acceptably high and the negative predictive value is sufficiently low to support the use of SLN mapping in high-grade endometrial tumors to replace complete lymphadenectomy. Validity of SLN mapping techniques does, however, require following a standard algorithm, and success depends also on surgeon expertise. Moreover, the impact of SLN mapping on overall survival in high-grade tumors requires future prospective randomized studies. Finally, a transition toward near-universal SLN mapping techniques for endometrial cancers could significantly impact on the adequacy of gynecologic oncology fellows' surgical training and competency in lymphadenectomy.

TI  - A New Model for Predicting Nonsentinel Lymph Node Metastasis in Early-Stage Breast Cancer Using MMP15
T2  - JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. In early-stage breast cancer (BC) patients, 40-70% of lymph node metastases are limited to the sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). Patients at low risk for nonsentinel lymph node (NSLN) metastasis should be exempt from axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) or regional lymph node radiotherapy (RNI). Methods. The present study included 237 female early-stage BC patients with positive SLNs who received ALND. Based on the clinicopathological factors of the 158 patients in the training cohort, multivariate analysis was used to determine the independent risk factors for NSLN metastasis, which were used to establish the NSLN metastasis prediction model. The calibration and discrimination of this model were tested with the training and validation cohorts and compared to the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) model. Results. Tumor size, neural invasion, lymphovascular invasion, expression of matrix metalloproteinase 15 (MMP15) in the cytoplasm, and the number of positive SLNs were statistically significant by multivariate analysis (P < 0.05), which were used to establish the new model. The MSKCC model was verified by the training cohort, and the area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.733 (95% CI: 0.650-0.816), which was less than that of the new model (0.824; 95% CI: 0.760-0.889). The area under the ROC curve in the validation cohort for the new model was 0.773 (95% CI: 0.669-0.877), and the calibration performed well. The false-negative rates were 3.2%, 6.5%, and 14.5% for the predicted probability cut-offs of 50%, 60%, and 70%, respectively. Conclusions. The new model included five variables: tumor size, neural invasion, lymphovascular invasion, cytoplasmic MMP15 expression, and the number of positive SLNs. The model with a cut-off of 60% could accurately identify low-risk patients with NSLN metastasis.

TI  - The environmental burdens of special economic zones on the coastal and marine environment: A remote sensing assessment in Myanmar
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Special economic zones (SEZs) play a pivotal role in the development of many emerging econ-omies. However, often SEZs are located in remote locations in authoritarian states where inde-pendent environmental assessment is difficult. Few studies assess the environmental impact of SEZs and, as a result, limited empirical evidence is available. This article fills the gap by devel-oping a method for assessing the direct and indirect environmental impacts of SEZs using high -resolution satellite data and a machine learning algorithm to examine the rate and pattern of environmental changes. The method is developed through the study of SEZs in Myanmar. Land covers were quantified using very high resolution imagery orthorectified satellite images through Random Forest in Google Earth Engine. The results of the study indicate that the development of the SEZs come at the cost of valuable resources such as mangroves, forests, and agricultural lands. The impact on forests and mangroves is particularly significant. During the SEZ construction, mangrove and forest saw 35% and 12% decline respectively. The increase in area of development after SEZ construction was 83%. The methodological approach developed here may serve as a framework for studies of SEZs in inaccessible locations around the world.

TI  - Guideline-Based Context-Sensitive Decision Modeling for Melanoma Patients.
T2  - Studies in health technology and informatics
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The provision of knowledge through clinical practice guidelines and hospital-specific standard operating procedures (SOPs) is ubiquitous in the medical context and in the treatment of melanoma patients. However, these knowledge sources are only available in unstructured text form and without any contextual link to real patient data. The aim of our project is to give a modeled decision support for the next treatment step based on the actual data and position of a patient.METHODS: First, we identified passages for qualified decision-making necessary at the point of care from the SOP for melanoma. Thereby, the patient-specific contextual reference data at decision points was considered in parallel and represented by FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource) resources. The decision algorithm was then formalized using BPMN modeling with FHIR annotations. Validation was provided by medical experts, dermatooncologists from University Hospital Essen.RESULTS: The resulting BPMN model is presented here with the diagnostic procedure of sentinel lymph node excision as the example snippet from the whole algorithm. Each decision point is edited with FHIR resources covering the patient data and preparing the context sensitivity of the model.CONCLUSION: Modeling guideline-based information into a decision algorithm that can be presented at the point of care with contextual reference, may have the potential to support patient-specific clinical decision-making. For patients from a certain status like in the metastatic setting modeling becomes highly tailored to specific patient cases, alternative and individualized treatment options.

TI  - New techniques for old fires: Using deep learning to augment fire maps from the early satellite era
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Disturbances such as fire play a critical role in forest ecosystems. However, anthropogenic fires can profoundly impact forests to the point of destabilizing ecosystems. In addition, fires have legacy effects on environments which may be observed in forests for decades after the fire is extinguished. Thus, understanding the extent of historic fires in a landscape is vital to understanding current forest structure and ecological processes (e.g., carbon sequestration capacity and provision of habitat) and, therefore, essential for informing land-management decisions. However, little work has been done to map forest fires pre 1980s due to the challenges of interpreting imagery from the 1970s-era Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS) platform. MSS imagery is distinguished from recent satellite missions through lower temporal, spatial, and spectral resolutions. Recent advances in image processing have brought the goal of high-quality MSS classifications within reach. In this study, we use deep learning, specifically UNet (a fully convolutional neural network (CNN)), to detect historic forest fires in MSS imagery for the forest-dominated regions of Quebec, Canada. While other studies have applied deep learning to present-day satellite data for land cover classification, hardly any work has specifically applied deep learning to MSS data for fire detection. We trained our UNet model on 206 MSS images that were labelled by applying thresholds to the Burned Area Index inside polygons drawn by the authors around burned areas. We then used the trained model to label burns in 5104 MSS images that were compiled to generate annual burned area maps. Our results identified (with a 95% confidence interval) 3503.95 +/- 484.90 km(2) of burns not previously reported in any database; this represents a 35.30 +/- 3.94% increase in the total known burned area across the forest-dominated regions of Quebec between 1973 and 1982.

TI  - Using Sentinel-1 radar amplitude time series to constrain the timings of individual landslides: a step towards understanding the controls on monsoon-triggered landsliding
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Heavy-rainfall events in mountainous areas trigger destructive landslides, which pose a risk to people and infrastructure and significantly affect the landscape. Landslide locations are commonly mapped using optical satellite imagery, but in some regions their timings are often poorly constrained due to persistent cloud cover. Physical and empirical models that provide insights into the processes behind the triggered landsliding require information on both the spatial extent and the timing of landslides. Here we demonstrate that Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar amplitude time series can be used to constrain landslide timing to within a few days and present four techniques to accomplish this based on time series of (i) the difference in amplitude between the landslide and its surroundings, (ii) the spatial variability in amplitude between pixels within the landslide, and (iii) geometric shadows and (iv) geometric bright spots cast within the landslide. We test these techniques on three inventories of landslides of known timing, covering various settings and triggers, and demonstrate that a method combining them allows 20 %-30 % of landslides to be timed with an accuracy of 80 %. Application of this method could provide an insight into landslide timings throughout events such as the Indian summer monsoon, which triggers large numbers of landslides every year and has until now been limited to annual-scale analysis.

TI  - The Advantages, Challenges, and Future of Human-Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell Lines in Type 2 Long QT Syndrome
T2  - JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Type 2 long QT syndrome (LQT2) is the second most common subtype of long QT syndrome and is caused by mutations in KCHN2 encoding the rapidly activating delayed rectifier potassium channel vital for ventricular repolarization. Sudden cardiac death is a sentinel event of LQT2. Preclinical diagnosis by genetic testing is potentially life-saving. Traditional LQT2 models cannot wholly recapitulate genetic and phenotypic features; therefore, there is a demand for a reliable experimental model. Human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) meet this challenge. This review introduces the advantages of the hiPSC-CM model over the traditional model and discusses how hiPSC-CM and gene editing are used to decipher mechanisms of LQT2, screen for cardiotoxicity, and identify therapeutic strategies, thus promoting the realization of precision medicine for LQT2 patients.

TI  - Remote sensing identification of marine floating raft aquaculture area based on sentinel-2A and DEM data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine floating raft aquaculture forms an integral component of the monitoring of coastal marine environments. It is essential to accurately obtain the spatial distribution of marine floating raft aquaculture to gain the fullest understanding of the development of marine fishery production, optimization of the spatial layout of aquaculture, and protection of the marine environment. The Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) is used to acquire optical imagery at a high spatial and temporal resolution, sampling 13 spectral bands in the visible, near-infrared, and short-wave infrared parts of the spectrum. This research reports how a decision-tree-based procedure was developed to map marine floating raft aquaculture using Sentinel-2A MSI imagery and DEM (Digital Elevation Model) data. Three indices and spectral features were used in this algorithm to differentiate marine floating rafts from other land-cover and land-use types in Fangchenggang City, China. These included the Differential Ratio Floating Raft Index (DRRI), newly proposed in the paper, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and visible reflectance. Additionally, a comparison was made between the decision tree classification method (DT) and the random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) methods. The results demonstrate that these three methods can obtain raft information with high accuracy. Finally, the classification results were merged into aquaculture rafts and non-aquaculture rafts. The overall accuracy for DT was 98.20% and 1.28 and 4.99 percentage points higher than RF and SVM, respectively. The user accuracy for marine floating rafts for DT (98.25%) was also markedly higher than that of RF and SVM methods (93.97% and 86.50%, respectively). The producer accuracy for marine floating rafts through the DT method was 98.17%, 0.81 percent lower than that of RF, and 1.03 percent lower than that of SVM. The decision-tree method does not assume strict data distribution parameters, optimization of the application of multispectral imagery and elevation data becomes possible, and combing with the DRRI index, then results in higher classification accuracies of marine floating rafts. When using multi-source data of different types and distributions to map marine floating rafts, a decision-tree method, therefore, appears to be superior to RF and SVM classifiers.

TI  - Evolving phytoplankton primary productivity patterns in typical Tibetan Plateau lake systems and associated driving mechanisms since the 2000s
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Phytoplankton primary productivity from the surface to the euphotic depth (PPeu) is an important indicator for estimating the carbon (C) sequestration capacity of a lake system. Approximately 50% of China's lake systems are distributed throughout the Tibetan Plateau (TP), playing an important C neutrality role in China and beyond. Over the past 20 years, the PPeu of TP lake systems may undergo dramatic spatial and temporal transformation under the significant influ-ence of climate change and human activities. To reveal corresponding changing mechanisms, this study explored spatiotemporal PPeu patterns in typical TP lake systems with MODIS observations during 2002-2020. Since the 2000s, results reveal that the annual mean PPeu in TP lake systems ranges from 476.7 to 621.6 mg C/m2/d, with an average value of 553 +/- 36.2 mg C/m2/d. Spatially, PPeu was much higher on the northeastern boundary and in the south of the TP compared to its remaining northern regions. PPeu trends in TP lake systems with higher salinity levels and those at higher altitudes were lower. Temporally, 48% of lakes on the TP exhibited a significant descending PPeu trend, while 31% of lakes exhibited a significant ascending trend. PPeu in TP lake systems may have mostly been influenced by day length (decimal hours), land surface temperature, and chlorophyll -a (Chl-a) content while being mainly limited by relative humidity (RHU). Additionally, PPeu also showed a significant positive relationship with total N and P imported from wastewater in TP (especially in Tibet), indicating that anthropogenic emissions could have an important influence on PPeu. Spatiotemporal pattern and driving mechanism results from this study can help us better understand the C sequestration capacity of TP lake systems.

TI  - CHLNET: A novel hybrid 1D CNN-SVR algorithm for estimating ocean surface chlorophyll-a
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Developing a unified chlorophyll-a (Chla) inversion algorithm for cross-water types is a significant challenge owing to the insufficiency of input features and training samples. Although machine learning algorithms can build a consistent model for different trophic waters, the accuracy of the inversion is dependent on the quality of the extended features. Here, we designed a novel hybrid framework called CHLNET, which combines a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) and support vector regression (SVR). The 1D CNN is used to extract features from the original band features, and the SVR is used to perform a fit of Chla. CHLNET is trained and tested using match-up pairs of SeaWiFS remote sensing reflectance [Rrs(lambda)] in situ with Chla ranging from 0.009 mg/m(3) to 138.046 mg/m(3), which covers mostly ocean water types. Performance metrics in the log space of CHLNET were better than those of the state-of-the-art algorithms on the testing dataset, and CHLNET had the best overall performance with the largest cover area in the star plot. The frequency distribution of predicted Chla by CHLNET was more consistent with that of in situ Chla. While the spatial pattern was not smooth in low Chla concentration waters, CHLNET demonstrated excellent mapping ability at the global and local scales in high Chla concentration waters. Through the band-shift method, which transfers the Rrs(lambda) of MERIS and MODIS-Aqua to the Rrs(lambda) of SeaWiFS in the visible spectral range, CHLNET obtained better accuracy than the blended algorithm of OCx and CI on MERIS and MODIS-Aqua matchups, which validates the generalization of CHLNET on cross-sensor types. The results indicate that CHLNET avoids the drawbacks of manually constructing extended features and the need for merging water type-appropriate algorithms for Chla retrieval, as well as provides a new idea for unified Chla concentration inversion across water types. Thus, CHLNET may serve as an alternative approach for Chla inversion.

TI  - Use of InSAR data for measuring land subsidence induced by groundwater withdrawal and climate change in Ardabil Plain, Iran
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ardabil plain, with an approximate area of 1097.2 km(2) in northwestern Iran, has experienced land subsidence due to intensive groundwater withdrawal and long seasons of drought in recent years. Different techniques have been used to investigate and evaluate subsidence in this region including: Global Positioning Systems (GPS), Levelling, and Geotechnical methods. These methods are typically expensive, time-consuming, and identify only a small fraction of the areas prone to subsidence. This study employs an Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technique to measure the long-term subsidence of the plain. An open-source SAR interferometry time series analysis package, LiCSBAS, that integrates with the automated Sentinel-1 InSAR processor (COMET-LiCSAR) is used to analyze Sentinel-1 satellite images from October 2014 to January 2021. Processing of Sentinel-1 images shows that the Ardabil plain has been facing rapid subsidence due to groundwater pumping and reduced rainfall, especially between May 2018 to January 2019. The maximum subsidence rate was 45 mm/yr, measured at the southeastern part of the plain. While providing significant advantages (less processing time and disk space) over other InSAR processing packages, implementation of the LiCSBAS processing package and its accuracy for land subsidence measurements at different scales needs further evaluation. This study provides a procedure for evaluating its efficiency and accuracy for land subsidence measurements by comparing its measurements with the results of the GMTSAR and geotechnical numerical modeling. The results of geotechnical numerical modeling showed land subsidence with an average annual rate of 38 mm between 2006 and 2020, which was close to measurements using the InSAR technique. Comparison of the subsidence measurements of the Ardabil plain using the LiCSBAS package with results obtained from other techniques shows that LiCSBAS is able to accurately detect land deformation at large scales (similar to km). However, they may not be optimized for more local deformations such as infrastructure monitoring.

TI  - Analyzing spatial-temporal variability of ice motion in Northeast Greenland from 1985 to 2018
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Northeast Greenland Ice Stream (NEGIS), the largest basin in Greenland, is undergoing rapid and sustained dynamic change. However, the ice-flow behaviours over decadal timescales and the impacts of ice geometry and hydrology remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated the spatial and temporal characteristics of ice motions of three branches in NEGIS between 1985 and 2018 in response to bed topographic features and surface meltwater runoff based on 33 years of annual ice velocities derived from the satellite image of Landsat series. Spatial heterogeneities in ice velocity were found in three glaciers and were correlated with subglacial topography. Specifically, the peak velocities of both Nioghalvfjerdsfjorden and Zachariae Isstrom glaciers occur near the grounding line zone, where tidewater acts as a crucial force causing ice retreat, subglacial melting, and further acceleration. While for the Storstrommen glacier, changes in the slope of the ice bed might cause an increase in ice motion in its inland segment. The temporal variability of ice velocity for both Nioghalvfjerdsfjorden and Zachariae Isstrom glaciers shows a clear regional speedup, with a mean increase of 14.60% and 9.40% in 2001-2018 compared to 1985-2000, but a widespread slowing of Storstrommen glacier with a mean of 16.30%, which were related to a 184% surface runoff increase. This hydrodynamic coupling on ice motion over decadal timescales in these three glaciers is in line with previous studies on short-term acceleration in NEGIS induced by surface melt, not in agreement with negative feedback between enhanced surface meltwater production and ice motion previously reported in the southwest Greenland ice stream. Our work highlights crucial roles of subglacial topography and surface runoff on ice motion, which helps to promote understanding of dynamic changes of NEGIS response to changing atmospheric circumstances.

TI  - Decision-making fusion of InSAR technology and offset tracking to study the deformation of large gradients in mining areas-Xuemiaotan mine as an example
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The multi-level disturbance of underground and surface caused by coal mining activities intensifies the deterioration of the ecological environment in the mining area. Among them, the uneven settlement caused by coal mining is the most intuitive manifestation of surface environmental damage. The uneven settlement in the mining area has the characteristics of large settlement magnitude and severe deformation. Therefore, based on 15 Sentinel-1A image data, this paper uses three methods: SBAS InSAR, continuous D-InSAR and offset tracking technology to monitor the surface deformation of the mining area. The results show that the continuous D-InSAR technology SBAS-InSAR technology is applied to the small deformation in the edge area of the subsidence basin. The mining area with low gradient subsidence of SBAS-InSAR can obtain better performance than continuous D-InSAR technology. The offset tracking technique is used to monitor the large gradient deformation in the center of the subsidence basin. Therefore, this paper proposes to expand the quantitative analysis through the spatial coherence threshold and the accuracy and successful image elements of the interference fringe displacement. Combine the advantages of the three methods and overcome the shortcomings of each method, fuse the deformation information of the three methods, and obtain the deformation law of the whole surface subsidence. The results show that the mean absolute error (MAE(1-1)) of continuity D-InSAR is 0.92 m, the mean absolute error (MAE(2-1)) of SBAS-InSAR is 0.94 m, and the mean absolute error (MAE(3-1)) of Offset-tracking is 0.25 m. The results of this fusion method are in good agreement with the measured data, and the mean absolute error (MAE(4-1)) of vertical displacement is 7 cm. Therefore, the fusion method has advantages over individual methods and provides a new idea in monitoring the large gradient deformation of coal mining subsidence in mining areas.

TI  - A statistical calibration tool for methods used to sample outdoor-biting mosquitoes
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Improved methods for sampling outdoor-biting mosquitoes are urgently needed to improve surveillance of vector-borne diseases. Such tools could potentially replace the human landing catch (HLC), which, despite being the most direct option for measuring human exposures, raises significant ethical and logistical concerns. Several alternatives are under development, but detailed evaluation still requires common frameworks for calibration relative to HLC. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a statistical framework for predicting human-biting rates from different exposure-free alternatives.Methods: We obtained mosquito abundance data (Anopheles arabiensis, Anopheles funestus and Culex spp.) from a year-long Tanzanian study comparing six outdoor traps [Suna Trap (SUN), BG Sentinel (BGS), M-Trap (MTR), M-Trap + CDC (MTRC), Ifakara Tent Trap-C (ITT-C) and Mosquito Magnet-X Trap (MMX)] and HLC. Generalised linear models were developed within a Bayesian framework to investigate associations between the traps and HLC, taking intra- and inter-specific density dependence into account. The best model was used to create a calibration tool for predicting HLC-equivalents.Results: For An. arabiensis, SUN catches had the strongest correlation with HLC (R-2 = 19.4), followed by BGS (R-2 = 17.2) and MTRC (R-2 = 13.1) catches. The least correlated catch was MMX (R-2 = 2.5). For An. funestus, BGS had the strongest correlation with the HLC (R-2 = 53.4), followed by MTRC (R-2 = 37.4) and MTR (R-2 = 37.4). For Culex mosquitoes, the traps most highly correlated with the HLC were MTR (R-2 = 45.4) and MTRC (R-2 = 44.2). Density dependence, both between and within species, influenced the performance of only BGS traps. An interactive Shiny App calibration tool was developed for this and similar applications.Conclusion: We successfully developed a calibration tool to assess the performance of different traps for assessing outdoor-biting risk, and established a valuable framework for estimating human exposures based on the trap catches. The performance of candidate traps varied between mosquito taxa; thus, there was no single optimum. Although all the traps tested underestimated the HLC-derived exposures, it was possible to mathematically define their representativeness of the true biting risk, with or without density dependence. The results of this study emphasise the need to aim for a consistent and representative sampling approach, as opposed to simply seeking traps that catch the most mosquitoes.

TI  - Multi-season transmission model of Eastern Equine Encephalitis
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) is an arbovirus that, while it has been known to exist since the 1930's, recently had a spike in cases. This increased prevalence is particularly concerning due to the severity of the disease with 1 in 3 symptomatic patients dying. The cause of this peak is currently unknown but could be due to changes in climate, the virus itself, or host behavior. In this paper we propose a novel multi-season deterministic model of EEE spread and its stochastic counterpart. Models were parameterized using a dataset from the Florida Department of Health with sixteen years of sentinel chicken seroconversion rates. The different roles of the enzootic and bridge mosquito vectors were explored. As expected, enzootic mosquitoes like Culiseta melanura were more important for EEE persistence, while bridge vectors were implicated in the disease burden in humans. These models were used to explore hypothetical viral mutations and host behavior changes, including increased infectivity, vertical transmission, and host feeding preferences. Results showed that changes in the enzootic vector transmission increased cases among birds more drastically than equivalent changes in the bridge vector. Additionally, a 5% difference in the bridge vector's bird feeding preference can increase cumulative dead-end host infections more than 20-fold. Taken together, this suggests changes in many parts of the transmission cycle can augment cases in birds, but the bridge vectors feeding preference acts as a valve limiting the enzootic circulation from its impact on dead-end hosts, such as humans. Our what-if scenario analysis reveals and measures possible threats regarding EEE and relevant environmental changes and hypothetically suggests how to prevent potential damage to public health and the equine economy.

TI  - Investigating the global OH radical distribution using steady-state approximations and satellite data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a novel approach to derive indirect global information on the hydroxyl radical (OH), one of the most important atmospheric oxidants, using state-of-the-art satellite trace gas observations (key sinks and sources of OH) and a steady-state approximation (SSA). This is a timely study as OH observations are predominantly from spatially sparse field and infrequent aircraft campaigns, so there is a requirement for further approaches to infer spatial and temporal information on OH and its interactions with important climate (e.g. methane, CH4) and air quality (e.g. nitrogen dioxide, NO2) trace gases. Due to the short lifetime of OH (similar to 1 s), SSAs of varying complexities can be used to model its concentration and offer a tool to examine the OH budget in different regions of the atmosphere. Here, we use the well-evaluated TOMCAT three-dimensional chemistry transport model to identify atmospheric regions where different complexities of the SSAs are representative of OH. In the case of a simplified SSA (S-SSA), where we have observations of ozone (O-3), carbon monoxide (CO), CH4 and water vapour (H2O) from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) on board ESA's MetOp-A satellite, it is most representative of OH between 600 and 700 hPa (though suitable between 400-800 hPa) within similar to 20 %-30 % of TOMCAT modelled OH. The same S-SSA is applied to aircraft measurements from the Atmospheric Tomography Mission (ATom) and compares well with the observed OH concentrations within similar to 26 %, yielding a correlation of 0.78. We apply the S-SSA to IASI data spanning 2008-2017 to explore the global long-term inter-annual variability of OH. Relative to the 10-year mean, we find that global annual mean OH anomalies ranged from -3.1 % to +4.7 %, with the largest spread in the tropics between -6.9 % and +7.7 %. Investigation of the individual terms in the S-SSA over this time period suggests that O-3 and CO were the key drivers of variability in the production and loss of OH. For example, large enhancement in the OH sink during the positive 2015/2016 El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event was due to large-scale CO emissions from drought-induced wildfires in South East Asia. The methodology described here could be further developed as a constraint on the tropospheric OH distribution as additional satellite data become available in the future.

TI  - Estimation of euphotic zone depth in shallow inland water using inherent optical properties and multispectral remote sensing imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Euphotic zone depth (Z(eu)) is a key indicator of underwater light environment that regulates different biogeochemical and physical processes in aquatic ecosystem. Remote sensing approaches offer a unique opportunity to frequently monitor Z(eu), although its estimation from diffuse attenuation coefficient (K-d) requires depth profiles of the down-welling irradiance (E-d). Measuring E-d values at different water depths (i.e., E-d profiling) in shallow waterbodies is a challenging task with the available profiling equipment. In this study, K-d values were estimated from measured absorption coefficient (a) data at multiple locations in the Chilika lagoon, which is a shallow waterbody located in the eastern coast of India and is a prestigious Ramsar site. Specifically, remote sensing reflectance (R-rs), a values (wavelength: 400-715 nm at 4 nm interval), Secchi disc depth (Z(SD)), suspended particulate matter (SPM) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) contents were measured during Oct. 07-08, 2018 and Feb. 02-08, 2019 in the Chilika lagoon. Atmospherically corrected Sentinel 2A/2B (S2A/S2B) MSI-R-rs data (level 2A) were then used to develop algorithms for mapping Z(eu) for the entire lagoon. Modeling results showed that R-rs values at band 4 (665 nm) or band 5 (704 nm) extracted from the S2A/S2B MSI data may be used to estimate K-d of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) (observed range: 1.29 m(-1) to 10.74 m(-1)) with the root-mean-squared error (RMSE) as low as 0.81 m(-1). However, uncertainties associated with atmospheric correction of S2A/S2B MSI-single band R-rs values are high when compared with in situ R-rs. Thus, a multivariate modeling approach was adopted with R-rs- band ratio and band difference variables selected by stepwise, forward, and backward variable selection method with p < 0.05. Modeling results showed that the band differences between band 2 and band 4 and band 3 and band 5 may be used to estimate K-d(PAR) with improved mean absolute percentage difference (MAPD) while ensuring low uncertainty associated with atmospheric correction. Spatio-temporal dynamics from S2A/S2B MSI for 85 different dates during Jan. 2017 to June 2021 provided seasonal patterns for Z(eu) in the Chilika lagoon.

TI  - Analysis of surface temperature in an urban area using supervised spatial autocorrelation and Moran's I
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat ETM + imagery is useful for analyzing urban thermal environments because it provides visible and near-infrared data. However, this approach is limited by the low resolution of Landsat images compared to the unit size of buildings in urban areas, which complicates any attempt to apply these images to the urban scale in terms of district unit plans or architectural plans. This paper describes a methodology that improves the accuracy of surface temperature analysis in urban areas by using satellite imagery and associated land cover data. Land cover types in the city of Goyang, South Korea, were reclassified into biotope types and climatope types. Moran's I was then calculated for the thermal infrared images according to the land cover types. Resampling the Landsat ETM + thermal infrared images according to the pixel content ratio and performing supervised classifications based on biotope and climatope maps improved the accuracy of the surface temperature evaluation in an urban area. Moran's I values of 0.9066 and 0.9279 were found according to the classification system of biotope and climatope maps, respectively. In addition, reclassification using supervised spatial autocorrelation and Moran's I may provide better results than other methods applied to surface temperature evaluations of complex urban areas. These results verified that reclassifying the land cover type based on biotope and climatope maps and determining the spatial autocorrelation within the classified data leads to a more accurate evaluation of the surface temperature distribution by land cover type than observed for any other classification method.

TI  - On the spatio-temporal variation in <i>b</i>-value after 25 April 2015 Gorkha, Nepal earthquake
T2  - GEODESY AND GEODYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study, the spatial-temporal distribution of b-value along the five faults area (the Judi fault, Thaple fault, Kathmandu fault, Motihari-GauriShanker fault, and Motihari-Everest fault) was investigated after the Gorkha earthquake (M(w)7.8). The earthquake catalog of 10,500 events was prepared by compiling the published catalogs. The study area is bounded in the central Himalaya from 26.5 degrees to 29 degrees in latitude direction and 84 degrees to 87 degrees in longitude direction. The frequency magnitude distribution shows the variation of the b-value along with fault areas from 0.45 to 0.69, indicating a common characteristic of aftershock sequences. In particular, the Judi fault area, Thaple fault area, and Motihari-Everest fault area are characterized by the low b-values of 0.45 +/- 0.02, 0.48 +/- 0.02, and 0.55 +/- 0.04, respectively. These regions could be the source region for future earthquakes. The low b-value observed for fault areas are also consistent with the thrust faulting pattern in the region as indicated by the focal mechanism of mainshock and major aftershocks. The temporal variation of b-value shows inevitable fluctuations during 25 April to 12 May 2015. Among the area selected, the Motihari-Everest fault area is in critical strain (mechanically locked) conditions, as indicated by the stepwise energy release pattern.

TI  - Evaluation of Satellite Sensors to Compute Chlorophyll-<i>a</i> Concentration in the Northeastern Arabian Sea: A Validation Approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The primary productivity of an aquatic system like the Arabian Sea is majorly supported by the concentration of Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a/C-a) pigment. The present study is narrated to validate the Chl-a data set retrieved from the prominent ocean color sensors (OC3M-MODIS, OC-OCM2, and OC3V-VIIRS) with sea truth data, collected from 204 stations for three years (2015-2017). The in situ concentrations of Chl-a depict the geographic region under the mesotrophic and eutrophic spans with a mean of 1.36 mg m(-3) (0.1 > C-a > 1.0 mg m(-3)). The ratio of C-a(OCM2)/C-a(In-situ) was 0.97 +/- 0.27 mg m(-3) (n = 199), but the ratios were higher with C-a(VIIRS)/C-a(In-situ) is 1.75 +/- 0.79 mg m(-3) (n = 170) and C-a(MODIS)/C-a(In-situ) is 2.53 +/- 1.42 mg m(-3) (n = 158). The coefficient of determination proclaims a significant relationship for MODIS (R-2 = 0.36; p < 0.001), followed by OCM2 (R-2 = 0.32; p < 0.001) and VIIRS (R-2 = 0.19; p < 0.001). The OCM2 showed the lowest RMSE at 0.13, which is relatively lower than the reference error limit by global ocean color missions at 0.35. In overall performance among the three algorithms evaluated for the region, the OCM2 will provide a better estimation of Chl-a with a prediction of 32% accuracy and 34.37% of bias. The log bias values for MODIS (0.35) and VIIRS (0.20) algorithms indicate the overestimation of Chl-a with in situ Chl-a, but the OCM2 algorithm is suitable in the region with a negligible bias (-0.03). The biogeochemical processes and ecosystem characteristics are dynamic from region to region, as yet in its urgent need to validate global sensors to fine-tune the regional algorithms periodically.

TI  - A narrative review on the role of carbon nanoparticles in oncology
T2  - WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-NANOMEDICINE AND NANOBIOTECHNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The lymphatic system is the first site of metastasis for most tumors and is a common reason for the failure of cancer therapy. The lymphatic system's anatomical properties make it difficult to deliver chemotherapy agents at therapeutic concentrations while avoiding systemic toxicity. Carbon nanoparticles offer a promising alternative for identifying and transporting therapeutic molecules. The larger diameter of lymphatic vessels compared to the diameter of blood vessels, allows carbon nanoparticles to selectively enter the lymphatic system once administered subcutaneously. Carbon nanoparticles stain tumor-draining lymph nodes black following intratumoral injection, making them useful in sentinel lymph node mapping. Drug-loaded carbon nanoparticles allow higher concentrations of chemotherapeutics to accumulate in regional lymph nodes while decreasing plasma drug accumulation. The use of carbon nanoparticles for chemotherapy delivery has been associated with lower mortality, fewer histopathology changes in vital organs, and lower serum concentrations of hepatocellular enzymes. This review will focus on the ability of carbon nanoparticles to target the lymphatics as well as their current and potential applications in sentinel lymph node mapping and oncology treatment regimens.

TI  - Large-scale spatial variability in loess landforms and their evolution, Luohe River Basin, Chinese Loess Plateau
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Loess landform variability across large spatial extents needs to be analyzed to understand the formation and evolution of loess landscapes. This is becoming increasingly possible via the automated analysis of remotely-sensed data. Here, we quantify loess landforms using an object-based image analysis (OBIA) method and use this classification to describe the spatial variability of loess landforms. Quantitative indicators are used to drive the spatial variability analysis of loess landforms and explain their spatio-temporal evolution. Moreover, the hypsometric integral (HI) and topographic interpolation are employed to investigate soil erosion and develop-ment patterns of loess landscape. Results show that the OBIA method classified loess landforms to an accuracy of 88.7 %. The derived metrics in terms of the area, slope and complexity of landform shape allow the determi-nation of the spatial structure of the loess landscapes. The HI value of the entire basin is 0.486, representing the mature stage of landform development, with relatively severe surface erosion. Correlation analysis of HI values and related indicators in the sub-basins shows that HI is poorly correlated with the area proportion of loess landform types and the total erosion volume in the basin but shows a relatively strong correlation with the volume of erosion per unit area.

TI  - The first photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the neglected totally eclipsing contact binary NSVS 2536063
T2  - NEW ASTRONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - We firstly studied the neglected totally eclipsing contact binary NSVS 2536063 using the newly observed g'r'i' light curves of 60 cm Ningbo Bureau of Education and Xinjiang Observatory Telescope (NEXT) and some public data, which come from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), the All-Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN), the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey, and the Large sky Area Multi-Object fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST). NSVS 2536063 is determined as an A-type median contact binary with a mass ratio of q =0.308 +/- 0.001 and the contact degree of f =26 +/- 2%. The absolute parameters of the two components were calculated using the photometric parameters and Gaia distance. Then the diagrams of mass-radius and mass-luminosity indicate that the more massive star is a main sequence star and the less massive star is over-sized and over-luminous. Both the hot spot added on the primary star and magnetic emission lines of spectra indicate the possible magnetic activity of NSVS 2536063. The orbital period of NSVS 2536063 may be long-term increasing with a rate of dp/dt = 1.24(+/- 0.19) x 10(-7)d yr(-1), which is often explained by the mass transfer from the less massive star to the more massive one. Mass transfer may also be responsible for the hot spot on the primary star.

TI  - Estimation of shrub willow biophysical parameters across time and space from Sentinel-2 and unmanned aerial system (UAS) data
T2  - FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Shrub willow can be used as a perennial energy crop to produce biomass for biofuels, bioproducts, and bioenergy to help address environmental issues. Leaf chlorophyll content (LCC), leaf area index (LAI), and canopy chlo-rophyll content (CCC), which are closely related to vegetation health status, provide valuable information to assess willow vigor and crop management activities. We developed models for estimating LCC, LAI, and CCC from Sentinel-2 and unmanned aerial system (UAS) data using a number of vegetation indices (VIs) and applying four analytical tools: regression analysis, partial least squares regression (PLSR), random forest (RF), and neural networks (NNs). We investigated twenty VIs using regression analysis, finding the red-edge normalized differ-ence vegetation index (NDVIre) as the optimal VI based on predictive performance and so this was included as an input variable for the PLSR, RF, and NN methods. For RF and NN models, sensitivity analysis was implemented to help tune hyperparameters and provide information to guide future studies. Results showed that the best averaged performance of Sentinel-2 and UAS data for LCC, LAI, and CCC (normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) = 9%, 12%, and 10%) of the same site in the same year was derived from models based on the NN algorithm using blue (B), green (G), red (R), red-edge (RE), and near-infrared (NIR) bands. In order to test model transferability, we collected UAS and Sentinel-2 data across different years and sites. Based on NRMSE, NN models using B, G, R, RE, and NIR bands provided the best averaged predictive performance for LCC estimation (16%) and the regression modeling using NDVIre performed best for LAI (21%) and CCC (13%) estimation for both Sentinel-2 and UAS data. Moreover, CCC estimation had smaller NRMSE values than LCC and LAI esti-mation for both Sentinel-2 and UAS data. Based on this study, we found that UAS data has the potential to complement Sentinel-2 data by mitigating limitations caused by temporal resolution and cloud cover. We also recommend use of the CCC parameter to evaluate shrub willow health status and perform time-series monitoring across time and space.

TI  - Warm bias of cold sea surface temperatures in the East Sea (Japan Sea)
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The East/Japan Sea (ES) is regarded as a natural laboratory for predicting future changes in the global Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC) under warming climates, as the ES MOC (EMOC) changes rapidly in comparison with the global MOC. Specifically, intermediate and deep-water masses of the ES are formed in its northern reaches via wind-driven subduction of surface water, and convection from the surface to deep layers during the winter. Accordingly, it is important to investigate the variation of winter sea surface temperatures (SSTs) for characterizing and predicting the EMOC; however, global SST products must be corrected and optimized for the ES, as they fail to incorporate the local marginal sea conditions. Here, a warm bias in cold SST was identified for three SST products, such as optimally interpolated sea surface temperatures (OISSTs), microwave SSTs, and operational SST and sea ice analysis products, suggesting the potential usefulness of a correction method incorporating Argo float data. When comparing OISSTs with 5 m temperature estimates from Argo float data during 2000-2020, under the assumption that the mixed layer depth is deeper than 8 m, a nearly normalized histogram of biases was produced, and the robust warm bias (mean = 0.9 degrees C) was detected in the range of relatively cold SSTs (-2 degrees C to 10 degrees C), yet no significant bias in warm SSTs (> 10 degrees C) was found. To minimize the warm bias in cold SSTs, OISSTs were corrected with an inverse 4(th)-order polynomial fitting method. Subsequently, the mean bias between the corrected SSTs and top depth temperatures of Argo float data was significantly reduced to less than 0.1 degrees C. Moreover, the warm bias of cold SSTs resulted in severe underestimations of the outcropping area colder than 1 degrees C over the northern region, as well as the occurrence period of 1 degrees C to 5 degrees C SSTs in the north-western ES. These results highlight the importance of local bias correction for SST products, and it is expected that the newly suggested correction method will improve model predictions of EMOC change by enhancing SST data quality in the northern ES.

TI  - Mapping photovoltaic power plants in China using Landsat, random forest, and Google Earth Engine
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Photovoltaic (PV) technology, an efficient solution for mitigating the impacts of climate change, has been increasingly used across the world to replace fossil fuel power to minimize greenhouse gas emissions. With the world's highest cumulative and fastest built PV capacity, China needs to assess the environmental and social impacts of these established PV power plants. However, a comprehensive map regarding the PV power plants' locations and extent remains scarce on the country scale. This study developed a workflow, combining machine learning and visual interpretation methods with big satellite data, to map PV power plants across China. We applied a pixel-based random forest (RF) model to classify the PV power plants from composite images in 2020 with a 30 m spatial resolution on the Google Earth Engine (GEE). The resulting classification map was further improved by a visual interpretation approach. Eventually, we established a map of PV power plants in China by 2020, covering a total area of 2917 km(2). We found that most PV power plants were situated on cropland, followed by barren land and grassland, based on the derived national PV map. In addition, the installation of PV power plants has generally decreased the vegetation cover. This new dataset is expected to be conducive to policy management, environmental assessment, and further classification of PV power plants. The dataset of photovoltaic power plant distribution in China by 2020 is available to the public at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6849477 (Zhang et al., 2022).

TI  - Long-term investigation of morphodynamic variations of a tidal inlet by remote sensing: A case study of the Meidani Inlet, Hormozgan, Iran
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Barrier-island inlets are among the most common inlets worldwide. The variation of the inlets, different sediment bypassing mechanisms, and lack of data are some issues for using numerical modeling in all cases. Remote sensing techniques are helpful for analytical investigation and making time series of the study area for categorizing the inlets and defining the morphological processes. The current study employs a feasible method for investigating tidal inlets, evaluates the morphodynamic changes, and applies the method to the Meidani Inlet in Iran. In this study, Landsat images from 1972 to 2019 were acquired and corrected to investigate changes in the ebb-tidal delta by employing the shoreline determination method, performing bathymetry in shallow areas, evaluating the extracted profiles in specific locations within the ebb-tidal delta, and comparing the Landsat image series at various times (change detection). In order to illustrate the morphological changes during the study period, a conceptual model was proposed. The conceptual model presents three reiterated actions of the ebbtidal delta that varied from 15-25 years due to different environmental conditions. Regional waves, tidal, and wind data were analyzed in detail using Landsat image intervals to investigate the effects of factors causing changes and instability in the cyclic morphodynamic behavior of the Meidani Inlet and characterize the region's environmental behavior pattern. By employing the method mentioned above, preparing a temporal inlet channel profile and sedimentation trend in the ebb-tidal delta, the Meidani Inlet is determined to be a mixed-energy inlet and a possibility of long-term behavior is predicted. Eastward main inlet channel and the whole ebb-tidal delta migration is the strongest possibility based on the remote sensing investigation over the investigated period.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Ground deformation analysis caused by post-2013 earthquake in Bohol, Philippines
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - After the 2013 Mw 7.2 earthquake that occurred in Bohol, the shoreline specifically in Loon and Maribojoc was observed to shift seaward due to ground uplift. This study analyzes the post-earthquake shoreline movement, specifically a 12 km coastal strip in Loon and Maribojoc, and ground deformation of the West Bohol area through Sentinel-1 image processing techniques. From October 2014 to April 2018, the DSAS linear regression shoreline rates were - 4.36 m/yr in Loon and - 1.69 m/yr in Maribojoc, indicative of a landward movement of 91.4% and 88.8% of shoreline transects in Loon and Maribojoc, respectively. PSInSAR revealed varying rates of VLM in the study area from October 2014 to December 2018 such that Loon and Maribojoc exhibit a subsidence rate of - 2 to - 8 mm/yr. The correlation between the shoreline retreat and the land subsidence in the study area is 87%, indicating a possible elastic rebound after the earthquake. The portion of Tagbilaran City on its northern side exhibits land subsidence of - 2 to - 6 mm/yr while its southern side exhibits land uplift of 0-2 mm/yr. The relative sea level fall from TGSL measurements indicates an uplift in the location of the tide gauge in Tagbilaran City.

TI  - Increased Water Content in the Active Layer Revealed by Regional-Scale InSAR and Independent Component Analysis on the Central Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Isolating seasonal deformation from Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) time-series is critical to quantitative understanding the freeze-thaw processes in permafrost regions. Physics- or statistics-based approaches have been developed to extract seasonal deformation, yet both constraining their evolution in time domain, and thus impeded the quantification of their amplitude variability especially over large scales. By applying Independent Component Analysis (ICA) on Sentinel-1 InSAR measurements during 2015-2019 on the central Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, we reveal that the averaged seasonal deformation is increasing with a linear trend of around 0.17 cm/year. The growing seasonal amplitude is attributed to an 8 cm increase of the Equivalent Water Thickness in the active layer. The results demonstrate the capability of ICA-based decomposition on isolating freeze-thaw-related deformation from other components. The large-scale spatial distribution of varied seasonal deformation can provide new insight into quantifying the water mass balance in vast permafrost regions.Plain Language Summary Permafrost is ground that remains at or below 0 degrees C for at least 2 years. The variations of water content in the seasonally thawed layer underlain by permafrost have strong impacts on the water storage balance, the ecosystems and the infrastructure stability in cold regions. Their inter-annual variations can be reflected by ground deformation, but are hard to quantify over large scales. Here, we apply a satellite remote sensing technique to measure ground deformation during 2015-2019 on the central Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Using a multivariate statistical method, called independent component analysis, we successfully extract the ground deformation related to the inter-annual soil water variations. We infer the total water content increase in our study area and corroborate it with independent remote sensing products and in-situ measurements. This study demonstrates the potential of remote sensing measurements in characterizing the subsurface soil water variations in cold regions with permafrost.

TI  - Land Subsidence and Aquifer-System Storage Loss in Central Mexico: A Quasi-Continental Investigation With Sentinel-1 InSAR
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aquifers play an important role in addressing water needs worldwide. When overexploited, they may lose storage and compact, causing land subsidence and impacts on urban landscapes. Using Sentinel-1 satellite imagery, we perform the largest ever-made Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) survey over Mexico, across a 700,000 km(2) area hosting >85.2 million inhabitants. We estimate present-day subsidence rates for yet unmapped and well-known hotspots (e.g., -45 cm/year in Mexico City), and compute compaction volumes at >300 aquifer-systems (up to -60 hm(3)/year at Mexico City Metropolitan Area). InSAR-derived aquifer-system compaction generally correlates well with groundwater deficits, extractions and storage changes from management reports. Semi-theoretical relationships for the whole Central Mexico and hydrological-administrative regions VII, VIII, and XIII, enable the assessment of compaction rates and volumes resulting from groundwater exploitation. These could be used to inform groundwater management strategies towards adaptation to climate change and future needs of a growing population.

TI  - Individual tree crown delineation in high-resolution remote sensing images based on U-Net
T2  - NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a deep learning-based framework for individual tree crown delineation in aerial and satellite images. This is an important task, e.g., for forest yield or carbon stock estimation. In contrast to earlier work, the presented method creates irregular polygons instead of bounding boxes and also provides a tree cover mask for areas that are not separable. Furthermore, it is trainable with low amounts of training data and does not need 3D height information from, e.g., laser sensors. We tested the approach in two scenarios: (1) with 30 cm WorldView-3 satellite imagery from an urban region in Bengaluru, India, and (2) with 5 cm aerial imagery of a densely forested area near Gartow, Germany. The intersection over union between the reference and predicted tree cover mask is 71.2% for the satellite imagery and 81.9% for the aerial images. On the polygon level, the method reaches an accuracy of 46.3% and a recall of 63.7% in the satellite images and an accuracy of 52% and recall of 66.2% in the aerial images, which is comparable to previous works that only predicted bounding boxes. Depending on the image resolution, limitations to separate individual tree crowns occur in situations where trees are hardly separable even for human image interpreters (e.g., homogeneous canopies, very small trees). The results indicate that the presented approach can efficiently delineate individual tree crowns in high-resolution optical images. Given the high availability of such imagery, the framework provides a powerful tool for tree monitoring. The source code and pretrained weights are publicly available at https://github.com/AWF-GAUG/TreeCrownDelineation.

T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Bankfull river discharge shapes river morphology. The bankfull river surface planform and river width can be used to quantify river size. Regional studies of stream ecology, hydrologic modelling, river carbon emissions and geomorphology from the perspective of fluvial processes are hindered by the lack of a highly accurate spatially distributed river network that considers bankfull river geometry. Based on Sentinel-2 and Landsat 5/7/8 multispectral instrument imagery and in situ measured hydrological data, the river discharge and width of spatially distributed cross sections of six major exorheic rivers and their tributaries located on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) are calculated under bankfull conditions. Then, the bankfull river surface is extracted. Finally, a bankfull river width and surface area database is established. The provided planform river hydromorphology data can supplement global hydrography datasets and effectively represent the combined fluvial geomorphology and geological background in the study area.

TI  - Association of COVID-19 vs Influenza With Risk of Arterial and Venous Thrombotic Events Among Hospitalized Patients
T2  - JAMA-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - IMPORTANCE The incidence of arterial thromboembolism and venous thromboembolism in persons with COVID-19 remains unclear.OBJECTIVE To measure the 90-day risk of arterial thromboembolism and venous thromboembolism in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 before or during COVID-19 vaccine availability vs patients hospitalized with influenza.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective cohort study of 41443 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 before vaccine availability (April-November 2020), 44 194 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 during vaccine availability (December 2020-May 2021), and 8269 patients hospitalized with influenza (October 2018-April 2019) in the US Food and Drug Administration Sentinel System (data from 2 national health insurers and 4 regional integrated health systems).EXPOSURES COVID-19 or influenza (identified by hospital diagnosis or nucleic acid test).MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Hospital diagnosis of arterial thromboembolism (acute myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke) and venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism) within 90 days. Outcomes were ascertained through July 2019 for patients with influenza and through August 2021 for patients with COVID-19. Propensity scores with fine stratification were developed to account for differences between the influenza and COVID-19 cohorts. Weighted Cox regression was used to estimate the adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for outcomes during each COVID-19 vaccine availability period vs the influenza period.RESULTS A total of 85 637 patients with COVID-19 (mean age, 72 [SD, 13.0] years; 50.5% were male) and 8269 with influenza (mean age, 72 [SD, 13.3] years; 45.0% were male) were included. The 90-day absolute risk of arterial thromboembolism was 14.4% (95% CI, 13.6%-15.2%) in patients with influenza vs 15.8% (95% CI, 15.5%-16.2%) in patients with COVID-19 before vaccine availability (risk difference, 1.4% [95% CI, 1.0%-2.3%]) and 16.3% (95% CI, 16.0%-16.6%) in patients with COVID-19 during vaccine availability (risk difference, 1.9% [95% CI, 1.1%-2.7%]). Compared with patients with influenza, the risk of arterial thromboembolism was not significantly higher among patients with COVID-19 before vaccine availability (adjusted HR, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.97-1.11]) or during vaccine availability (adjusted HR, 1.07 [95% CI, 1.00-1.14]). The 90-day absolute risk of venous thromboembolism was 5.3% (95% CI, 4.9%-5.8%) in patients with influenza vs 9.5% (95% CI, 9.2%-9.7%) in patients with COVID-19 before vaccine availability (risk difference, 4.1% [95% CI, 3.6%-4.7%]) and 10.9% (95% CI, 10.6%-11.1%) in patients with COVID-19 during vaccine availability (risk difference, 5.5% [95% CI, 5.0%-6.1%]). Compared with patients with influenza, the risk of venous thromboembolism was significantly higher among patients with COVID-19 before vaccine availability (adjusted HR, 1.60 [95% CI, 1.43-1.79]) and during vaccine availability (adjusted HR, 1.89 [95% CI, 1.68-2.12]).CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Based on data from a US public health surveillance system, hospitalization with COVID-19 before and during vaccine availability, vs hospitalization with influenza in 2018-2019, was significantly associated with a higher risk of venous thromboembolism within 90 days, but there was no significant difference in the risk of arterial thromboembolism within 90 days.

TI  - Soil water depletion induces discrepancies between <i>in situ </i>measured vegetation indices and photosynthesis in a temperate heathland
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation indices (VIs) derived from optical sensors have been used as proxies for monitoring gross primary productivity (GPP). In contrast to satellite-based VIs, whose temporal resolution is typically limited, especially in cloudy areas, in situ derived VIs may have higher temporal resolution. This fine temporal frequency implies much larger sample sizes to test the performance of VIs by comparing with eddy covariance-based in situ GPP estimates. Here, we tested the potential of in situ measured VIs to estimate GPP in a temperate heathland ecosystem. We compared half-hourly GPP values derived from an eddy covariance CO2 flux measurements with several greenness-, structure-and chlorophyll-sensitive VIs (e.g., the Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index [TCI] and the Inverted Red-Edge Chlorophyll Index [IRECI], among others) obtained by multiband sensors mounted at the tower. Results showed that tested VIs differed in their ability to capture the temporal variability of GPP during non -drought condition, and that all VIs failed in describing GPP during an extreme drought event. After integrating a drought indicator (e.g., soil water content, precipitation/potential evapotranspiration ratio or actual/ potential evapotranspiration ratio) in the regression model, the performances of VIs drastically improved. Among all tested indices, IRECI and TCI were the most promising VIs, capturing best the temporal variation in GPP (R-2 = 0.73 and RMSE = 1.85, and R-2 = 0.77, RMSE = 1.69, respectively), provided that drought stress was properly accounted for. Our findings have implications for the development and improvement of global ecological models for drought monitoring based on proximal and remote sensing data. Our results have also a strong impact on our ability to upscale CO2 fluxes using satellite sensors (e.g. Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3) of heathland ecosystem characterized by heather vegetation which is relatively resistant to the structural changes in the canopy and strongly affects the interpretation of the remote sensing signals.

TI  - Insights Into the Aerodynamic Versus Radiometric Surface Temperature Debate in Thermal-Based Evaporation Modeling
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Global evaporation monitoring from Earth observation thermal infrared satellite missions is historically challenged due to the unavailability of any direct measurements of aerodynamic temperature. State-of-the-art one-source evaporation models use remotely sensed radiometric surface temperature as a substitute for the aerodynamic temperature and apply empirical corrections to accommodate for their inequality. This introduces substantial uncertainty in operational drought mapping over complex landscapes. By employing a non-parametric model, we show that evaporation can be directly retrieved from thermal satellite data without the need of any empirical correction. Independent evaluation of evaporation in a broad spectrum of biome and aridity yielded statistically significant results when compared with eddy covariance observations. While our simplified model provides a new perspective to advance spatio-temporal evaporation mapping from any thermal remote sensing mission, the direct retrieval of aerodynamic temperature also generates the highly required insight on the critical role of biophysical interactions in global evaporation research.

TI  - Permanganate index detection using multi-spectral images combined with BP neural network algorithm
T2  - OPTIK
M3  - Article
AB  - Permanganate index as one of the most important water quality parameters is usually used to evaluate the oxygen of water and help control the water pollution. Multi-spectral imaging tech-nology combined with BP neural network instead of traditional methods used to measure per-manganate index have the following advantages of high speed, high spatial resolution and without requiring reagent. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this method, the multi-spectral images of Hongze lake acquired by Landsat 8 (TM) and the corresponding measured water quality data (permanganate value, for example) were used to build BP neural network model. The BPNN consist of in three layers the input layer with 7 neurons presenting 7 spectral band, hidden layer with 10 neuron, and output layer with one neuron present Permanganate index. To validate the proposed model a totally of 53 samples were collected and onto 75 % (40 samples) were used as training dataset and the rest 25 % (13 samples) for testing. The cross-validation shown that the slopes of the fitted curve between the predicted value and measured value were higher than 0.89 with R2 higher than 0.74382. The left 13 samples were used to validate the model. The results shown that the slope of the fitted curve between the predicted value and measured value with this model was 0.8483 with R-2 of 0.7412 and 0.8086. All these results demonstrated that multi -spectral images combined with BP neural network algorithm is effective to monitor water quality.

TI  - A paradigm shift in the quantification of wave energy attenuation due to saltmarshes based on their standing biomass
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Most existing analytical and numerical models to quantify wave energy attenuation attributed to saltmarshes are based on the definition of a drag coefficient that varies with vegetation and wave characteristics and requires calibration, i.e., a case-specific variable. With the aim of determining a new variable to estimate wave energy attenuation without the use of calibration coefficients, wave attenuation caused by different saltmarsh species and the relationship with the ecosystem standing biomass are experimentally studied. Samples of four real saltmarshes with contrasting morphological and biomechanical properties, namely, Spartina sp., Salicornia sp., Halimione sp. and Juncus sp., are collected in the field and placed in a wave flume for testing under different regular and random wave conditions. Two meadow densities are considered, in addition to zero-density cases. Thus, wave damping coefficients are obtained in vegetated cases, beta, and bare soil cases, beta(B), and wave damping produced solely by the meadow standing biomass, beta(SB), is determined. The obtained wave damping coefficients are related to a new variable, the hydraulic standing biomass (HSB), which is defined as a function of the meadow mean height and standing biomass and incident flow characteristics. Linear fitting relationships between the wave damping coefficient and HSB are obtained, allowing beta and beta(SB) estimation without the need for calibration. Therefore, the use of these new relationships facilitates direct quantification of wave energy attenuation due to saltmarshes based on incident wave conditions, mean plant height and meadow standing biomass, variables that can be obtained from aerial images or remote sensing data, extending the applicability of the approach. Another key aspect is that this approach does not depend on any calibration coefficient and can be directly applied with knowledge of the abovementioned characteristics. This may represent a paradigm shift in the estimation of wave energy attenuation attributed to saltmarshes.

TI  - Machine learning-based meta-classifier for <i>Kharif</i> Bajra (pearl millet) discrimination in the mixed cropping environment using multi-temporal SAR data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Study on pearl millet discrimination in mixed cropping environment was carried out as it forms the major coarse cereal crop in India. The study aims at determining the capabilities of Sentinel-1A SAR data and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for pearl millet discrimination. Six ML algorithms, that is, k-nearest neighbour (k-NN), Decision Tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and Naive Bayes (NB) were evaluated and compared. Meta-classifier using majority voting technique was proposed by ensembling classifiers (RF, SVM and NB) which were diverse and have comparable accuracies. The diversity assessment was conducted using Cochran Q statistics for ensembling purpose. RF classifier (83.76%) using VH polarization produced better result indicating importance of cross-polarization in crop classification. Further, meta-classifier proposed in the study improved the accuracy to 88.15% (approximately by 5%) and class accuracies of pearl millet resulting in improved discrimination of pearl millet in mixed cropping environment.

TI  - Study on air temperature estimation and its influencing factors in a complex mountainous area
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Near-surface air temperature (Ta) is an important parameter in agricultural production and climate change. Satellite remote sensing data provide an effective way to estimate regionalscale air temperature. Therefore, taking Gansu section of the upper Weihe River Basin as the study area, using the filtered reconstructed high-quality long-time series normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), interpolated reconstructed land surface temperature (LST), surface albedo, and digital elevation model (DEM) as the input data, the back-propagation artificial neural network algorithm (BP-ANN) was combined with a multiple linear regression method to estimate regional air temperature, and the influencing factors of air temperature estimation were analyzed. This method effectively compensates for the fact that air temperature data provided by a single station cannot represent regional air temperature information. The result shows that the temperature estimation accuracy is high. In terms of interannual variation, the air temperature in the study area showed a slightly increasing trend, with an average annual increase of 0.047 degrees C. The calculation results of the interannual variation rate of temperature showed that the area with increased air temperature accounted for 75.8% of the total area. In terms of seasonal variation, compared with that in summer and winter, the air temperature rising trend in autumn was obvious, and the air temperature in the middle of the study area decreased in spring, which is prone to frost disasters. LST and NDVI in the study area were positively correlated with air temperature, and their positive correlation distribution areas accounted for 93.62% and 94.34% of the total study area, respectively. NDVI, LST and DEM influence the temperature change in the study area. The results show that there is a significant positive correlation between NDVI and air temperature, and the change of NDVI has a positive effect on the spatiotemporal variation of air temperature. The correlation coefficient between LST and air temperature in the southeast of the study area is negative, and there is a difference. In addition, the correlation coefficient between LST and air temperature in other areas of the study area is positive. The air temperature decreased with elevation, air temperature decreases by 0.27 degrees C every hundred meters.

TI  - Observed and predicted precipitation variability across Pakistan with special focus on winter and pre-monsoon precipitation
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study utilises ground, satellite and model data to investigate the observed and future precipitation changes in Pakistan. Pakistan Meteorological Department's (PMD) monthly precipitation data set along with the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) monthly dataset TRMM_3B43 (0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees resolution) and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts's (ECMWF) monthly reanalysis product ERA5 have been used to evaluate rainfall trends over the climatic zones of Pakistan through Mann-Kendall test, Sen's slope estimator and innovative trend analysis for the time period 1978-2018. Community Climate System Model (CCSM4) projections have been employed to explore the projected changes in precipitation until 2099. Furthermore, TRMM and CCSM4 projections have been correlated and validated using root mean square error (RMSE) and mean bias error (MBE). There is a good correlation between TRMM and PMD ground observation at all stations of the country for all seasons, with correlation coefficient values ranging from 0.89 (November) to 0.97 (July and August). However, ERA5 monthly precipitation tends to overestimate rainfall in the winter months. The study shows a decreasing trend in winter precipitation in all zones of the country with a significant decrease over western mountains, i.e. zone C of the country. During 2008-2018, a sharp decrease in winter precipitation is observed as compared to the baseline value of 1978-2007 in all climatic zones. Rainy days have also shown a decrease in winter and pre-monsoon seasons. There seems to be a shift in precipitation from winter towards pre-monsoon season as pre-monsoon precipitation in the last 11 years increased in all zones except for zone C. Coherently, there is a decrease in an area affected by winter precipitation and an increase in area for pre-monsoon precipitation. Future precipitation estimates from the CCSM4 model for RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 overestimate precipitation in most parts of the country for the first 9 observed years (2010-2018) and predict a rise in precipitation by 2099 which is more pronounced in the northern and western Pakistan while a decrease is predicted for the plains of the country, which might have negative consequences for agriculture.

TI  - Variability and uncertainty in flux-site-scale net ecosystem exchange simulations based on machine learning and remote sensing: a systematic evaluation
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) is an important indicator of carbon cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. Many previous studies have combined flux observations and meteorological, biophysical, and ancillary predictors using machine learning to simulate the site-scale NEE. However, systematic evaluation of the performance of such models is limited. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis of these NEE simulations. A total of 40 such studies and 178 model records were included. The impacts of various features throughout the modeling process on the accuracy of the model were evaluated. Random forests and support vector machines performed better than other algorithms. Models with larger timescales have lower average R-2 values, especially when the timescale exceeds the monthly scale. Half-hourly models (average R-2 = 0.73) were significantly more accurate than daily models (average R-2 = 0.5). There are significant differences in the predictors used and their impacts on model accuracy for different plant functional types (PFTs). Studies at continental and global scales (average R-2 = 0.37) with multiple PFTs, more sites, and a large span of years correspond to lower R 2 values than studies at local (average R-2 = 0.69) and regional (average R-2 = 0.7) scales. Also, the site-scale NEE predictions need more focus on the internal heterogeneity of the NEE dataset and the matching of the training set and validation set.

M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Purpose The purpose of the present paper is to review studies on weather index-insurance as a tool to manage the climate change impact risk on farmers and to explore the study gaps in the currently existing literature by using a systematic literature review. Design/methodology/approach This study analyzed and reviewed the 374 articles on weather index insurance (WII) based on a systematic literature search on Web of Science and Scopus databases by using the systematic literature review method. Findings WII studies shifted their focus on growing and emerging areas of climate change impact risk. The finding shows that the impact of climate change risk significantly influenced the viability of WII in terms of pricing and design of WII. Therefore, the cost of WII premium increases due to the uncertainty of climate change impact that enhances the probability of losses related to insured weather risks. However, WII has emerged as a risk management tool of climate insurance for vulnerable agrarian communities. The efficacy of WII has been significantly influenced by repetitive environmental disasters and climate change phenomena. Research limitations/implications This study will be valuable for scholars to recognize the missing and emerging themes in WII. Practical implications This study will help the policy planners to understand the influence of climate change impact on WII viability. Originality/value This study is the original work of the author. An attempt has been made in the present study to systematically examine the viability of WII for insuring the climate change risk.

TI  - A power-law relation of surface roughness and ages of alluvial fans in a hyperarid environment: A case study in the Dead Sea area
T2  - PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY-EARTH AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite recent advances in mapping and dating alluvial fans, due to the availability of high-resolution remote sensing data and Quaternary dating techniques, quantifying surface features in remote sensing data remains a challenge. Surface roughness is a time-dependent feature under stable conditions, which indicates the relative age of alluvial fans in a hyperarid environment. Although surface roughness can be quantitatively inferred from remote sensing data, determining surface roughness in a uniform index remains a complex problem. Here, we used the normalized backscatter intensity (NBI) from high-resolution ALOS PALSAR data to quantify alluvial fan surface roughness, which is further used to quantitatively map alluvial fans. We established a robust power-law relation between the NBI value (R) and the in-situ age (T) as measured with independently dated alluvial fans. Based on the R-T relation, it can be further to apply the R measurement to T estimates as old as similar to 540 ka with an average uncertainty of similar to 25% on a regional scale. The NBI value, independent of atmospheric conditions and sensitive to surface roughness variability, is an effective criterion for quickly distinguishing alluvial fans and performing age estimation. We propose that insolation weathering is an important physical weathering pattern in the Dead Sea area, which mainly controls the surface roughness in this hyperarid region.

TI  - Laparoscopic and endoscopic cooperative surgery for full-thickness resection and sentinel node dissection for early gastric cancer
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF GASTROINTESTINAL ENDOSCOPY
M3  - Letter
AB  - The endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) technique has become the gold standard for submucosal tumors that have negligible risk of lymph node metastasis (LNM), due to its minimal invasiveness and ability to improve quality of life. However, this technique is limited in stage T1 cancers that have a low risk of LNM. Endoscopic full thickness resection can be achieved with laparoscopic endoscopic cooperative surgery (LECS), which combines laparoscopic gastric wall resection and ESD. In LECS, the surgical margins from the tumor are clearly achieved while performing organ-preserving surgery. To overcome the limitation of classical LECS, namely the opening of the gastric wall during the procedure, which increases the risk of peritoneal tumor seeding, non-exposed endoscopic wall-inversion surgery was developed. With this full-thickness resection technique, contact between the intra-abdominal space and the intragastric space was eliminated.

TI  - A Mark-Release-Recapture Study to Estimate Field Performance of Imported Radio-Sterilized Male <i>Aedes albopictus</i> in Albania
T2  - FRONTIERS IN BIOENGINEERING AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The pathogen transmitting Aedes albopictus mosquito is spreading rapidly in Europe, putting millions of humans and animals at risk. This species is well-established in Albania since its first detection in 1979. The sterile insect technique (SIT) is increasingly gaining momentum worldwide as a component of area-wide-integrated pest management. However, estimating how the sterile males will perform in the field and the size of target populations is crucial for better decision-making, designing and elaborating appropriate SIT pilot trials, and subsequent large-scale release strategies. A mark-release-recapture (MRR) experiment was carried out in Albania within a highly urbanized area in the city of Tirana. The radio-sterilized adults of Ae. albopictus Albania strain males were transported by plane from Centro Agricoltura Ambiente (CAA) mass-production facility (Bologna, Italy), where they were reared. In Albania, sterile males were sugar-fed, marked with fluorescent powder, and released. The aim of this study was to estimate, under field conditions, their dispersal capacity, probability of daily survival and competitiveness, and the size of the target population. In addition, two adult mosquito collection methods were also evaluated: BG-Sentinel traps baited with BG-Lure and CO2, (BGS) versus human landing catch (HLC). The overall recapture rates did not differ significantly between the two methods (2.36% and 1.57% of the total male released were recaptured respectively by BGS and HLC), suggesting a similar trapping efficiency under these conditions. Sterile males traveled a mean distance of 93.85 +/- 42.58 m and dispersed up to 258 m. Moreover, they were observed living in the field up to 15 days after release with an average life expectancy of 4.26 +/- 0.80 days. Whether mosquitoes were marked with green, blue, yellow, or pink, released at 3.00 p.m. or 6.00 p.m., there was no significant difference in the recapture, dispersal, and survival rates in the field. The Fried competitiveness index was estimated at 0.28. This mark-release-recapture study provided important data for better decision-making and planning before moving to pilot SIT trials in Albania. Moreover, it also showed that both BG-traps and HLC were successful in monitoring adult mosquitoes and provided similar estimations of the main entomological parameters needed.

TI  - Sentinel-1 interferometric coherence as a vegetation index for agriculture
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the use of Sentinel-1 interferometric coherence data as a tool for crop monitoring has been explored. For this purpose, time series of images acquired by Sentinel-1 and 2 spanning 2017 have been analysed. The study site is an agricultural area in Sevilla, Spain, where 16 different crop species were cultivated during that year. The time series of 6-day repeat-pass coherence measured at each polarimetric channel (VV and VH), as well as their difference, have been compared to the NDVI and to the backscattering ratio (VH/VV) and other indices based on backscatter. The contribution of different decorrelation sources and the effect of the bias from the space-averaged sample coherence magnitude estimation have been evaluated. Likewise, the usage of 12 days as temporal baseline was tested. The study has been carried for three different orbits, characterised by different incidence angles and acquisition times. All results support using coherence as a measure for monitoring the crop growing season, as it shows good correlations with the NDVI (R-2 > 0.7), and its temporal evolution fits well the main phenological stages of the crops. Although each crop shows its own evolution, the performance of coherence as a vegetation index is high for most of them. VV is generally more correlated with the NDVI than VH. For crop types characterised by low plant density, this difference decreases, with VH even showing higher correlation values in some cases. For a few crop types, such as rice, the backscattering ratio outperforms the coherence in following the growth stages of the plants. Since both coherence and backscattering are directly computed from the radar images, they could be used as complementary sources of information for this purpose. Notably, the measured coherence performs well without the need of compensating the thermal noise decorrelation or the bias due to the finite equivalent number of looks.

TI  - Core Surface Flow Changes Associated With the 2017 Pacific Geomagnetic Jerk
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - A geomagnetic jerk was seen in Swarm satellite data in 2017 over the Pacific region. We invert time series of spatial gradient secular variation data between 2014 and 2020, reduced to a grid of points at satellite altitude, for spatially- and temporally-regularized core surface flow. Pacific region flow acceleration was almost constant before and after the jerk, with a sharp change, especially in the azimuthal component, at the jerk epoch, despite the temporal regularization. Azimuthal acceleration is oppositely signed either side of 160 degrees W, where it effectively vanishes, and also reverses sign at the jerk epoch. Acceleration features drift westward at about 900 km year(-1). Unlike previous studies, the evidence presented here for low latitude waves does not depend on imposing flow equatorial symmetry, quasi- or tangential geostrophy, or band-pass filtering, and has no reliance on stochastic models or numerical simulations.

TI  - Drought Legacy in Sub-Seasonal Vegetation State and Sensitivity to Climate Over the Northern Hemisphere
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Droughts affect ecosystems at multiple time scales, but their sub-seasonal legacy effects on vegetation activity remain unclear. Combining the satellite-based enhanced vegetation index MODIS EVI with a novel location-specific definition of the growing season, we quantify drought impacts on sub-seasonal vegetation activity and the subsequent recovery in the Northern Hemisphere. Drought legacy effects are quantified as changes in post-drought greenness and sensitivity to climate. We find that greenness losses under severe drought are partially compensated by a similar to+5% greening within 2-6 growing-season months following the droughts, both in woody and herbaceous vegetation but at different timings. In addition, post-drought sensitivity of herbaceous vegetation to hydrological conditions increases noticeably at high latitudes compared with the local normal conditions, regardless of the choice of drought time scales. In general, the legacy effects on sensitivity are larger in herbaceous vegetation than in woody vegetation.

TI  - Allometry-based estimation of forest aboveground biomass combining LiDAR canopy height attributes and optical spectral indexes
T2  - FOREST ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimates of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) are essential for global carbon cycle studies and have widely relied on approaches using spectral and structural information of forest canopies extracted from various remote sensing datasets. However, combining the advantages of active and passive data sources to improve estimation accuracy remains challenging. Here, we proposed a new approach for forest AGB modeling based on allometric relationships and using the form of power-law to integrate structural and spectral information. Over 60 km2 of drone light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data and 1,370 field plot measurements, covering the four major forest types of China (coniferous forest, sub-tropical broadleaf forest, coniferous and broadleaf-leaved mixed forest, and tropical broadleaf forest), were collected together with Sentinel-2 images to evaluate the proposed approach. The results show that the most universally useful structural and spectral metrics are the average values of canopy height and spectral index rather than their maximum values. Compared with structural attributes used alone, combining structural and spectral information can improve the estimation accuracy of AGB, increasing R2 by about 10% and reducing the root mean square error by about 22%; the accuracy of the proposed approach can yield a R2 of 0.7 in different forests types. The proposed approach performs the best in coniferous forest, followed by sub-tropical broadleaf forest, coniferous and broadleaf-leaved mixed forest, and then tropical broadleaf forest. Furthermore, the simple linear regression used in the proposed method is less sensitive to sample size and outperforms statistically multivariate machine learning-based regression models such as stepwise multiple regression, artificial neural networks, and Random Forest. The proposed approach may provide an alternative solution to map large-scale forest biomass using space-borne LiDAR and optical images with high accuracy.

TI  - Why Do CMIP6 Models Fail to Simulate Snow Depth in Terms of Temporal Change and High Mountain Snow of China Skillfully?
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Global climate models are important tools for investigating historical and future responses of snow under climate change. However, snow simulations from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models have not been well evaluated in terms of temporal change and mountain snow, with major error sources remaining unclear. This study synthetically uses long-term station observations, reanalysis, and remote sensing data to evaluate snow depth simulations of 31 state-of-the-art CMIP6 models in both the high mountain Tibetan Plateau and other areas of China, and analyzes the sources of error. For the first-time, the accumulated errors of precipitation and temperature of prior months are found to be crucial for explaining why CMIP6 models failed to capture trends and hotspots of snow depth change and notable time lags of the peak month. The worst snow depth performance of CMIP6 was on the Tibetan Plateau and resulted from more serious precipitation overestimates and temperature underestimates than in other regions.

TI  - A cohort study to assess risk of cutaneous small vessel vasculitis among users of different oral anticoagulants
T2  - PHARMACOEPIDEMIOLOGY AND DRUG SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Cutaneous small vessel vasculitis (CSVV) was identified as a safety signal among patients treated with direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC). This study aimed to determine if CSVV risk differed among patients with atrial fibrillation (Afib) who newly initiated warfarin or a DOAC. Methods We identified enrollees aged >= 21 years diagnosed with Afib who newly initiated rivaroxaban, dabigatran, apixaban, and warfarin in the Sentinel Distributed Database from October 19, 2010 to February 29, 2020. We selected and followed patients who did not have evidence of the following in the 183 days prior to initiating treatment: CSVV diagnosis, dispensing of other study drugs, select autoimmune diseases or autoimmune medications, cancer diagnoses or chemotherapeutic treatment, kidney dialysis or transplant, alternative anticoagulation indications, or an institutional (nursing home, hospice, hospital) stay on the treatment initiation date (index date) until CSVV outcome or pre-specified censoring. We conducted 1:1 propensity score matching in six comparisons. Results CSVV incidence rates for DOACs and warfarin ranged from 3.3 to 5.6 per 10 000-person years in our matched Afib population. The adjusted CSVV hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) was 0.94 (0.64, 1.39) for rivaroxaban versus warfarin; 1.17 (0.67, 2.06) for dabigatran vs. warfarin; 0.85 (0.62, 1.16) for apixaban vs. warfarin; 0.86 (0.49, 1.50) for rivaroxaban vs. dabigatran; 0.99 (0.68, 1.45) for rivaroxaban versus apixaban; and 1.70 (0.90, 3.21) for dabigatran versus apixaban. Conclusion We did not find significant evidence of differential CSVV risk in pair-wise comparisons of DOACs and warfarin.

TI  - Calibration and characterisation of four chlorophyll meters and transmittance spectroscopy for non-destructive estimation of forest leaf chlorophyll concentration
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll meters enable efficient and non-destructive estimation of leaf chlorophyll concentration (LCC), but require calibration against destructively-determined values to provide an absolute quantity that is comparable between different studies and species. Well-established instruments can provide accurate LCC estimates, but the performance of recent low-cost devices is less clear. Questions also remain over the choice of generic or speciesspecific calibration functions. Additionally, little attention has been paid to transmittance spectroscopy, which offers substantially increased spectral sampling, as a potential alternative. We investigated the well-established Konica Minolta SPAD-502+ and Opti-Sciences CCM-200 instruments and the low-cost atLEAF CHL PLUS and PhotosynQ MultispeQ V1.0 devices for non-destructive estimation of forest LCC. We calibrated each chlorophyll meter against destructively-determined LCC values for eight temperate deciduous broadleaf forest species, and characterised relationships between the different instruments. We also assessed whether transmittance spectroscopy could provide improved accuracy. All investigated chlorophyll meters demonstrated similarly strong relationships with destructively-determined LCC, indicating that once calibrated, even the low-cost devices represent a suitable choice for non-destructive forest LCC estimation. With the exception of oak, chlorophyll meter - LCC relationships were consistent between species, indicating that for these species, a generic calibration function may be suitable depending on required accuracy. Specifically, LCC values provided by the generic calibration functions fell within the prediction uncertainties of species-specific calibration functions for most considered species. The generic calibration functions explained between 2% and 16% less variation in LCC than the species-specific calibration functions, resulting in a mean increase in RMSE (NRMSE) of just 0.01 g m- 2 to 0.02 g m- 2 (2% to 5%). Transmittance spectroscopy was able to provide improved performance over the chlorophyll meters, indicating that they may miss some relevant spectral information at blue and green wavelengths. However, this improved performance comes at the expense of reduced practicality in the field.

TI  - Ecosystem services provided by the exotic bivalves <i>Dreissena polymorpha, D. rostriformis bugensis</i>, and <i>Limnoperna fortunei</i>
T2  - HYDROBIOLOGIA
M3  - Review
AB  - The ecosystem services approach to conservation is becoming central to environmental policy decision making. While many negative biological invasion-driven impacts on ecosystem structure and functioning have been identified, much less was done to evaluate their ecosystem services. In this paper, we focus on the often-overlooked ecosystem services provided by three notable exotic ecosystem engineering bivalves, the zebra mussel, the quagga mussel, and the golden mussel. One of the most significant benefits of invasive bivalves is water filtration, which results in water purification and changes rates of nutrient cycling, thus mitigating the effects of eutrophication. Mussels are widely used as sentinel organisms for the assessment and biomonitoring of contaminants and pathogens and are consumed by many fishes and birds. Benefits of invasive bivalves are particularly relevant in human-modified ecosystems. We summarize the multiple ecosystem services provided by invasive bivalves and recommend including the economically quantifiable services in the assessments of their economic impacts. We also highlight important ecosystem disservices by exotic bivalves, identify data limitations, and future research directions. This assessment should not be interpreted as a rejection of the fact that invasive mussels have negative impacts, but as an attempt to provide additional information for scientists, managers, and policymakers.

TI  - Residual stresses of 550 MPa high strength steel welded cruciform sections: Experimental and numerical study
T2  - STRUCTURES
M3  - Article
AB  - Residual stresses significantly affect the buckling behavior of welding cruciform section column. In this study, an experimental study is presented to investigate the residual stresses distribution of 550 MPa high strength steel welded cruciform sections using the sectioning method. Four cruciform sections with different width-to-thickness ratios of plates are tested to analyze the magnitudes and the distribution zone of residual stresses. A three-dimensional finite element method is developed to the effects of the width-to-thickness ratios of plates on re-sidual stresses distribution. It is concluded that the compressive residual stresses at the center of plate ranges from 0.10 f(y) to 0.42f(y), and they decrease as the width-to-thickness ratios of plates increase. The width-to -thickness ratios of plates have no obvious influence on the tensile residual stresses. The effects of artificial error on the residual stresses are not obvious. All component plates satisfy the self-equilibrium conditions. A distribution model of residual stresses is suggested on the basis of experimental and numerical results, and a good agreement between the proposed distribution model and test data is made.

TI  - Combining multi-indicators with machine-learning algorithms for maize at the-level in China
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate and timely prediction of crop yield at a large scale is important for food security and the development of agricultural policy. An adaptable and robust method for estimating maize yield for the entire territory of China, however, is currently not available. The inherent trade-off between early estimates of yield and the accuracy of yield prediction also remains a confounding issue. To explore these challenges, we employ indicators such as GPP, ET, surface temperature (Ts), LAI, soil properties and maize phenological information with random forest regression (RFR) and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) machine learning approaches to provide maize yield estimates within China. The aims were to: (1) evaluate the accuracy of maize yield prediction obtained from multimodal data analysis using machine-learning; (2) identify the optimal period for estimating yield; and (3) determine the spatial robustness and adaptability of the proposed method. The results can be summarized as: (1) RFR estimated maize yield more accurately than GBDT; (2) Ts was the best single indicator for estimating yield, while the combination of GPP, Ts, ET and LAI proved best when multi-indicators were used (R-2 = 0.77 and rRMSE = 16.15% for the RFR); (3) the prediction accuracy was lower with earlier lead time but remained relatively high within at least 24 days before maturity (R-2 > 0.77 and rRMSE < 16.92%); and (4) combining machine-learning algorithms with multi-indicators demonstrated a capacity to cope with the spatial heterogeneity. Overall, this study provides a reliable reference for managing agricultural production.

TI  - Using satellite images of nighttime lights to predict the economic impact of COVID-19 in India.
T2  - Advances in space research : the official journal of the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The outbreak of COVID-19 in early 2020 heralded a deep global recession not seen since the Second World War. With entire nations in lockdown, burgeoning economies of countries like India plunged into a downward spiral. The conventional instruments of estimating the short-term economic impact of a pandemic is limited, and as a result, it is challenging to implement timely monetary policies to mitigate the financial impact of such unforeseen events. This study investigates the promise of using nighttime images of lights on Earth, also known as nightlight (NTL), captured by the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrumentation onboard the Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite mission to measure the economic cost of the pandemic in India. First, a novel data processing framework was developed for a recently released radiance dataset known as VNP46A1, part of NASA's Black Marble suite of NTL products. Second, the elasticity of nightlight to India's National Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was estimated using panel regression followed by machine learning to predict the Year-over-Year (YoY) change in GDP during Fiscal Year (FY) 2020Q1 (Apr-Jun, 2020). Electricity consumption, known to closely track economic output and precipitation were included as additional features to improve model performance. A strong relationship between both electricity usage and nightlight to GDP was observed. The model predicted a YoY contraction of 24% in FY2020Q1, almost identical to the official GDP decline of 23.9% later announced by the Indian Government. Based on the findings, the study concludes that nightlight along with electricity usage can be invaluable proxies for estimating the cost of short-term supply-demand shocks such as COVID-19, and should be explored further.

TI  - Erythemal UV radiation across Nigeria: where do we stand?
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - The deleterious effects of solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation on humans are of public health concern which demands constant global monitoring and intervention. This study analysed the latitudinal variations in mean daily and multi-year erythemal ultraviolet radiation (EUVR) across 7 states in Nigeria using satellite data from the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrophotometer (TOMS) and Ozone Mapping Instrument (OMI). The latitudes studied were 13 degrees N, 8 degrees N, 6 degrees N and 4 degrees N respectively, using 37 years of data obtained from phases: 1979-1988, 1989-1998, 1999-2008 and 2009-2020. The data obtained were statistically analysed using Ms Excel and MATLAB. The results of this study show that the mean daily EUVR at the selected latitudes ranges from 32.97 to 390 (mW/m2). The results show that Borno State located at latitude 13 degrees N had the highest EUVR, while Rivers State recorded the least EUVR at latitude 4 degrees N. Comparative analysis of all the locations studied indicates latitudinal and longitudinal variations because the eastern axis recorded higher values than its western counterpart on the same latitude. Box and whisker plots in this study summarized the latitudinal variance in the mean multi-year EUVR in each phase. Box and whisker plots from 2009-2020 showed that there was a drastic reduction in mean multi-year EUVR in this phase unlike in the other phases. The findings of this study when compared to the UV index show that the 37 years mean EUVR obtained across Nigeria ranged from 8-10 which is on the "very high" category. This study recommends the implementation of WHO suggestions in preventing the biological effects of solar UV radiation. Furthermore, the Nigerian government should curb ignorance among its citizens by heightening public awareness of the effects of EUVR.

Due to the relative sparseness of ground-based observations and heterogeneity of satellite data, global atmospheric reanalysis products are considered valuable datasets for studying and monitoring the climate, since these usually ensure spatially complete and continuous temporal coverage. Consequently, evaluating differences among the existing reanalyses is key to identifying inconsistencies. To this aim, the current study intercompares the climatological mean, variability, and linear trends for upper air temperature provided from four recent atmospheric reanalysis products (ERA5, ERA-Interim, MERRA-2, and JRA-55) The Reanalysis Multi-Model Ensemble-mean (RMME) is used as a comparator. Radiosonde observations are included for comparison on the regional scale (tropics). The results reveal that all evaluated reanalyses provide a consistent reproduction of the upper-air temperature profile. Temperature differences from RMME within +/- 0.25 K are found in both the troposphere and lower stratosphere, except for a few specific regions. Larger differences (>+/- 1.5 K) and discrepancies among the datasets are found in the upper stratosphere. Agreement between reanalyses increased after 1998. Differences in the temperature time series and seasonal cycle at the regional scales are smaller in the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes than in the tropics and Southern Hemisphere. A robust cooling trend in the lower stratosphere during the period of largest ozone depletion (1980-1997) and a warming trend in the troposphere for the period 1998-2018 are clearly found, at the global level, in all the datasets. Temperature trends and variability in the tropics are consistent in all reanalysis datasets with the homogenized radiosonde records from the lower to middle troposphere and in the lower stratosphere. However, large differences are found in the upper troposphere, tropical tropopause layer (TTL), and middle stratosphere. The well-known temperature variability in the lower stratosphere associated with Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) is captured in both reanalyses and observational datasets. Among the reanalyses, ERA5 shows the smallest temperature difference with respect to homogenized upper-air radiosoundings records.

TI  - Contrasting trends between peak photosynthesis timing and peak greenness timing across seven typical biomes in Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The peak photosynthesis timing (PPT) is a key factor that affects the seasonality of the terrestrial carbon uptake. Carbon phenology derived from gross primary production (GPP) has been used to validate the peak greenness timing (PGT) from satellite-based vegetation indices (VIs) in phenology research. However, PPT, derived from GPP, has not been comprehensively analyzed, especially taking different GPP estimates, fitting methods, and biomes into account. Moreover, whether or not the PPT trend is consistent with the reported PGT trend still unclear. We explored the above questions at widely used flux sites in Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes and found that no significant differences in PPT derived from GPP using different carbon flux partitioning methods. Moreover, fitting methods performed well in grassland, cropland, wetland, and wood savannas compared with evergreen needleleaf forest, deciduous broadleaf forest, and mixed forest. Unexpectedly, we did not find an advancing trend in PPT derived from GPP compared with PGT from SPOT-VGT normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Our study suggests that the principle of the fitting method and physiological property of the biome should be taken into account when predicting PPT. More importantly, PGT is not a good proxy of the PPT. Therefore, PPT trends based on VIs should be viewed with caution. In general, this study is meaningful for better understanding photosynthesis and carbon cycling in the context of changing climate.

TI  - Detection of maritime traffic anomalies using Satellite-AIS and multisensory satellite imageries: Application to the 2021 Suez Canal obstruction
T2  - JOURNAL OF NAVIGATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study summarises the scenario of maritime traffic anomalies, like the increased congestion and U-turn of ships caused by the ship grounding in the Suez Canal in March 2021. Here, satellite automatic identification system based ship trajectories, and Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images based ship positions are analysed after subdividing the study area into seas, lakes and canals. The results show that the blockage affected the maritime traffic for more than three weeks, waiting ship numbers increased from 5 to 122, and daily one to three ships made a U-turn between 23 and 31 March in the Gulf of Suez. Ship density also increased to more than double in Bitter Lakes with a minimum waiting time of 7 days. Hence, to avoid such prolonged waiting of ships, we propose a warning method based on the sharp speed decrease rate, U-turn and congestion.

TI  - A resilience sensing system for the biosphere
T2  - PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - We are in a climate and ecological emergency, where climate change and direct anthropogenic interference with the biosphere are risking abrupt and/or irreversible changes that threaten our life-support systems. Efforts are underway to increase the resilience of some ecosystems that are under threat, yet collective awareness and action are modest at best. Here, we highlight the potential for a biosphere resilience sensing system to make it easier to see where things are going wrong, and to see whether deliberate efforts to make things better are working. We focus on global resilience sensing of the terrestrial biosphere at high spatial and temporal resolution through satellite remote sensing, utilizing the generic mathematical behaviour of complex systems-loss of resilience corresponds to slower recovery from perturbations, gain of resilience equates to faster recovery. We consider what subset of biosphere resilience remote sensing can monitor, critically reviewing existing studies. Then we present illustrative, global results for vegetation resilience and trends in resilience over the last 20 years, from both satellite data and model simulations. We close by discussing how resilience sensing nested across global, biome-ecoregion, and local ecosystem scales could aid management and governance at these different scales, and identify priorities for further work.This article is part of the theme issue 'Ecological complexity and the biosphere: the next 30 years'.

TI  - Soil moisture-atmosphere feedback dominates land N<sub>2</sub>O nitrification emissions and denitrification reduction
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) is essential to microbial nitrogen (N)-cycling networks in terrestrial ecosystems. Studies have found that SM-atmosphere feedbacks dominate the changes in land carbon fluxes. However, the influence of SM-atmosphere feedbacks on the N fluxes changes, and the underlying mechanisms remain highly unsure, leading to uncertainties in climate projections. To fill this gap, we used in situ observation coupled with gridded and remote sensing data to analyze N2O fluxes emissions globally. Here, we investigated the synergistic effects of temperature, hydroclimate on global N2O fluxes, as the result of SM-atmosphere feedback impact on N fluxes. We found that SM-temperature feedback dominates land N2O emissions by controlling the balance between nitrifier and denitrifier genes. The mechanism is that atmospheric water demand increases with temperature and thereby reduces SM, which increases the dominant N2O production nitrifier (containing amoA AOB gene) and decreases the N2O consumption denitrifier (containing the nosZ gene), consequently will potential increasing N2O emissions. However, we find that the spatial variations of soil-water availability as a result of the nonlinear response of SM to vapor pressure deficit caused by temperature are some of the greatest challenges in predicting future N2O emissions. Our data-driven assessment deepens the understanding of the impact of SM-atmosphere interactions on the soil N cycle, which remains uncertain in earth system models. We suggest that the model needs to account for feedback between SM and atmospheric temperature when estimating the response of the N2O emissions to climatic change globally, as well as when conducting field-scale investigations of the response of the ecosystem to warming.

TI  - Axillary management for early invasive breast cancer patients: Who will truly benefit?
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe implementation of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and further completion axillary lymph node dissection (cALND) after positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) on early invasive breast cancer patients should be cautiously tailored. Identifying predictors for SLN and non-sentinel lymph node (nSLN) metastases can help surgeons make better surgical decisions. MethodsA retrospective case-control study was designed and a total of 560 eligible patients were enrolled consecutively. They were all diagnosed in our center and received appropriate medical care. According to the metastasis of SLN and nSLN, they were divided into metastatic and non-metastatic groups on two successive occasions to investigate the relationship between clinical factors, pathological factors, hematological factors and lymph node metastasis. ResultsIn total, 101 (18.04%) patients developed SLN metastases, including 98 patients with macro-metastases and 3 patients with micro-metastases. Out of 97 patients receiving further cALND, 20 patients (20.62%) developed nSLN metastases. Multivariate analysis revealed that "high expression of Ki-67" and "lymphatic invasion" predicted a higher risk of SLN metastasis; and "increased number of positive SLNs" and "increased systemic inflammation index (SII)" predicted a higher risk of nSLN metastasis. ConclusionSurgery for early invasive breast cancer patients should be more customized and precise. Appropriate axillary management is necessary for patients with the associated predictors.

TI  - Bridge-specific flood risk assessment of transport networks using GIS and remotely sensed data
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel framework for the expedient assessment of flood risk to transportation networks focused on the response of the most critical and vulnerable infrastructure assets, the bridges, is developed, validated and applied. Building upon the recent French guidelines on scour risk (CEREMA, 2019), this paper delivers a thorough methodology, that incorporates three key, risk parameters: (i) the hydrodynamic loading, a hazard component of equal significance to scour, for the assessment of hazard; (ii) the correlation of select scour indicators with a new index relating to flow velocity, a primary measure of the adverse impacts of flow-structure interaction, enabling a more accurate and automated, assessment of bridge susceptibility to scour; (iii) the use of a new, comprehensive indicator, namely the Indicator of Flood Hazard Intensity (IFHI) which incorporates, in a simple yet efficient way, the key parameters controlling the severity of flood impact on bridges, namely flow velocity, floodwater height, flow obstruction, and sediment type. The framework is implemented for the analysis of flood risk in a case study area, considering an inventory of 117 bridges of diverse construction characteristics, which were affected by a major flood that impacted Greece in September 2020. The reli-ability of the method is validated against an extensive record of inspected and documented bridge damages. Regional scale analysis is facilitated by the adoption of the Multi-Criteria Decision-Making method for flood hazard indexing, considering geomorphological, meteorological, hydrological, and land use/cover data, based on the processing of remotely sensed imagery and openly available geospatial datasets in GIS.

TI  - Machine learning approach to estimate soil matric potential in the plant root zone based on remote sensing data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - There is an increasing interest in using the Internet of Things (IoT) in the agriculture sector to acquire soil- and crop-related parameters that provide helpful information to manage farms more efficiently. One example of this technology is using IoT soil moisture sensors for scheduling irrigation. Soil moisture sensors are usually deployed in nodes. A more significant number of sensors/nodes is recommended in larger fields, such as those found in broadacre agriculture, to better account for soil heterogeneity. However, this comes at a higher and often limiting cost for farmers (purchase, labour costs from installation and removal, and maintenance). Methodologies that enable maintaining the monitoring capability/intensity with a reduced number of in-field sensors would be valuable for the sector and of great interest. In this study, sensor data analysis conducted across two irrigation seasons in three cotton fields from two cotton-growing areas of Australia, identified a relationship between soil matric potential and cumulative satellite-derived crop evapotranspiration (ETcn) between irrigation events. A second-degree function represents this relationship, which is affected by the crop development stage, rainfall, irrigation events and the transition between saturated and non-saturated soil. Two machine learning models [a Dense Multilayer Perceptron (DMP) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) algorithms] were studied to explore these second-degree function properties and assess whether the models were capable of learning the pattern of the soil matric potential-ETcn relation to estimate soil moisture from satellite-derived ETc measurements. The algorithms performance evaluation in predicting soil matric potential applied the k-fold method in each farm individually and combining data from all fields and seasons. The latter approach made it possible to avoid the influence of farm consultants' decisions regarding when to irrigate the crop in the training process. Both algorithms accurately estimated soil matric potential for individual (up to 90% of predicted values within +/- 10 kPa) and combined datasets (73% of predicted values within +/- 10 kPa). The technique presented here can accurately monitor soil matric potential in the root zone of cotton plants with reduced in-field sensor equipment and offers promising applications for its use in irrigation-decision systems.

TI  - River sensing: the inclusion of red band in predicting reach-scale types using machine learning algorithms
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to predict channel unit types (CUTs) by combining remotely sensed data with morphological variables using machine learning algorithms (random forest, support vector machines, multiple adaptive regression splines, extreme gradient boosting and adaptive boosting) within the Upper Ogun River Basin, Southwestern Nigeria. In achieving the aim of this study, we identified the most important variable(s) in CUT discrimination using the random forest - recursive feature elimination (RF-RFE). A total of 249 cross-sections across 83 reaches were sampled during the fieldwork. Landsat 8 and Sentinel-1 bands were retrieved for days the fieldwork was carried and mosaiced using the Google Earth Engine platform. The RF-RFE identified five top variables (accuracy: 0.79 +/- 0.14; kappa: 0.39) discriminating the CUT as dimensionless stream power, slope, width, wetted perimeter and Band 4. In essence, there is much hope in the use of remote sensing in CUT mapping at the reach scale.

TI  - Highly Variable Densities and a Decline in Critically Endangered Golden-Crowned Sifaka (<i>Propithecus tattersalli</i>) Abundance from 2008-2018
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Animal abundance is determined by a number of factors, including vegetation structure, food availability and quality, human activities, predation risk, and disease. Vegetation structure, food availability, and human activity often are used to guide conservation efforts, such as protected area zoning and reforestation, especially for primates. We sought to determine whether Critically Endangered golden-crowned sifaka (Propithecus tattersalli) densities could be predicted across a heterogeneous landscape as a function of vegetation structure, food availability, and human activity. We conducted walking transect surveys across the sifakas' entire global range in Loky-Manambato Protected Area of Madagascar from 2016-2018, expanding upon a study conducted in 2006/2008. Potential predictors of sifaka density included metrics of vegetation structure (e.g., tree density, forest type), food availability (e.g., food tree basal area, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)), and human activity (e.g., tree cutting, livestock grazing). Low-intensity tree cutting and wet season NDVI were the best, positive predictors of sifaka densities. Sifaka densities within study units across their restricted range (880 km(2)) were highly variable (range: 6.8-78.1 sifakas/km(2)), emphasizing the importance of large-scale study designs across all suitable land cover types for assessing a species' abundance, regardless of its area of occupancy. We estimated that 10,222-12,631 sifakas remain. Based on previous surveys, this indicates that populations either remained stable over the past 20 years or have declined by 30-43% in the past 10 years; we argue that a decline is most likely based on our updating of forest cover estimates for both of the prior studies. We also found that wet season NDVI is a positive predictor of sifaka densities, which will aid managers in prioritizing conservation actions in this region using widely available remotely sensed data.

TI  - Dermal invasion matters in breast cancer sentinel lymph node biopsy results
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF GYNAECOLOGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate whether cancer invasion of the dermis could hamper drainage of the radiotracer in breast cancer patients who were undergoing a Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (SLNB) procedure. Ten patients who presented with T1T2 breast cancer with dermal invasion alone as confirmed by a punch biopsy of skin were evaluated. For the SLNB procedure, a lymphoscintigraphy was performed 2 hours after intratumoral administration of 2 mCi (74 MBq) of 99mTc nanocolloid. The sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) were evaluated for the presence of tumor cells by hematoxylin-eosin staining and, when negative, by immunocytochemistry using anti-cytokeratin antibody (CAM 5.2). No migration of radiotracer was found in three patients, and one patient had a false negative SLN, so altogether the technique failed in four patients (40%). Axillary nodes proved to be positive in seven patients (70%).The high rate of failure in the lymphatic mapping and the high proportion of axillary positivity suggest a causal relationship with the invasion of the dermis, with possible implications for the validity of the SLNB procedure.

TI  - Collective empiricism at the Paris Observatoire in the late seventeenth century
T2  - SEVENTEENTH CENTURY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article discusses the epistemic practices developed by astronomers at the Paris Observatoire in the late seventeenth century. It compares their approach with the research carried out by Tycho Brahe at the Uraniborg Observatory about a century earlier. The article will focus on three selected epistemological differences between the research at the Observatoire and at Uraniborg. The first is a different way of founding and legitimating astronomy. Tycho understood astronomical research as part of a humanistic philosophical worldview. Cassini and his colleagues at the Observatoire emphasised the empirical nature of astronomy and its practical utility for the state. The second difference was the collectivisation of knowledge. While Tycho approached research in an individualistic way, the astronomers from the Observatoire stressed the importance of collective and coordinated collaboration. The third change was the institutionalisation of science in the context of the administration of the modern absolutist state, which provided research with long-term continuity. The article shows that the practice of collective empiricism connected the astronomers of Paris with other empirical science representatives throughout Europe.

TI  - Spatial biology analysis reveals B cell follicles in secondary lymphoid structures may regulate anti-tumor responses at initial melanoma diagnosis
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionB cells are key regulators of immune responses in melanoma. We aimed to explore differences in the histologic location and activation status of B cell follicles in sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) of melanoma patients. MethodsFlow cytometry was performed on fresh tumor draining lymph nodes (LN). Paraffin slides from a separate cohort underwent NanoString Digital Spatial Profiling (DSP)(R). After staining with fluorescent markers for CD20 (B cells), CD3 (T cells), CD11c (antigen presenting cells) and a nuclear marker (tumor) was performed, regions of interest (ROI) were selected based on the location of B cell regions (B cell follicles). A panel of 68 proteins was then analyzed from the ROIs. ResultsB cell percentage trended higher in patients with tumor in LN (n=3) compared to patients with nSLN (n=10) by flow cytometry. B cell regions from a separate cohort of patients with tumor in the (pSLN) (n=8) vs. no tumor (nSLN) (n=16) were examined with DSP. Within B cell regions of the SLN, patients with pSLN had significantly higher expression of multiple activation markers including Ki-67 compared to nSLN patients. Among 4 patients with pSLN, we noted variability in arrangement of B cell follicles which were either surrounding the tumor deposit or appeared to be infiltrating the tumor. The B cell follicle infiltrative pattern was associated with prolonged recurrence free survival. ConclusionThese data suggest a role for B cell follicles in coordinating effective adaptive immune responses in melanoma when low volume metastatic disease is present in tumor draining LN.

TI  - Central role of the sentinel acute pancreatitis event (SAPE) model in understanding recurrent acute pancreatitis (RAP): Implications for precision medicine
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PEDIATRICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Traditional approaches to understanding the origins of chronic pancreatitis (CP) and find treatments led to abysmal failure. Thus, no drugs now exists to meet this need. Outdated concepts of the etiopathogenesis of CP have been replaced with new insights and disease models that provide the framework for early detection of the pathogenic pancreatitis process. Application of these principals require a new paradigm in disease definition and management, i.e. personalized / precision medicine. The key is acute pancreatitis (AP) starting with the first (sentinel) acute pancreatitis (AP) event (SAPE). This event sensitizes the pancreas to recurrent acute pancreatitis (RAP) as ongoing stressors drive various inflammatory responses to cause CP. The problem is the complex etiologies of AP and the additional genetic and environmental factors that promote progression to RAP and CP. This paper provides a background on the key conceptual changes that facilitate new approaches and the rationale for using mechanism-specific therapies to prevent RAP and CP.

TI  - Robust Multiuser Beamforming for IRS-Enhanced Near-Space Downlink Communications Coexisting With Satellite System
T2  - IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - To the best of our knowledge, this article represents the first attempt toward robust beamforming design for multiuser downlink communications in intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-enhanced satellite (SAT) and high altitude platform (HAP) integrated network. Such network configuration is mainly composed of a single-antenna SAT, a multiple-antenna HAP, multiple single-antenna SAT and HAP terminals and an IRS. Although sharing the same spectrum resource with the SAT, the HAP suspended in the near-space intends to offer temporary higher-speed and lower-delay multiuser communication connections than the SAT. Therefore, the power budget should be carefully tuned at the HAP. Toward this end, we first formally formulate the transmit power minimization problem at the HAP under the constraints of signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio-outage-probability (SINR-OP) at each SAT and HAP terminal by taking into account the imperfect channel state informations and their Gaussian channel estimation errors. Note that the complicated superposition of direct SAT/HAP links and cascaded IRS links, makes the optimization problem rather challenging. Specifically, we transform the probabilistic constraints into approximate deterministic ones, by performing rank relaxation. Based on this, we are able to solve the optimization problem by alternately optimizing the two ensuring subproblems. As verified by extensive simulation results, the proposed IRS-enhanced beamforming schemes can substantially diminish the transmit power at the HAP compared to the beamforming counterparts without IRS.

TI  - Estimating pixel-level uncertainty in ocean color retrievals from MODIS
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The spectral distribution of marine remote sensing reflectance, R-rs, is the fundamental measurement of ocean color science, from which a host of bio-optical and biogeochemical properties of the water column can be derived. Estimation of uncertainty in these derived properties is thus dependent on knowledge of the uncertainty in satellite-retrieved R-rs (u(c)(R-rs)) at each pixel. Uncertainty in R-rs, in turn, is dependent on the propagation of various uncertainty sources through the R-rs retrieval process, namely the atmospheric correction (AC). A derivative-based method for uncertainty propagation is established here to calculate the pixel-level uncertainty in R-rs, as retrieved using NASA's multiple-scattering epsilon (MSEPS) AC algorithm and verified using Monte Carlo (MC) analysis. The approach is then applied to measurements from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the Aqua satellite, with uncertainty sources including instrument random noise, instrument systematic uncertainty, and forward model uncertainty. The u(c)(R-rs) is verified by comparison with statistical analysis of coincident retrievals from MODIS and in situ R-rs measurements, and our approach performs well in most cases. Based on analysis of an example 8-day global products, we also show that relative uncertainty in R-rs, at blue bands has a similar spatial pattern to the derived concentration of the phytoplankton pigment chlorophyll-a (chl-a), and around 7.3%, 17.0%, and 35.2% of all clear water pixels (chl-a <= 0.1 mg/m(3)) with valid u(c)(R-rs) have a relative uncertainty <= 5% at bands 412 nm, 443 nm, and 488 nm respectively, which is a common goal of ocean color retrievals for clear waters. While the analysis shows that u(c)(R-rs) calculated from our derivative-based method is reasonable, some issues need further investigation, including improved knowledge of forward model uncertainty and systematic uncertainty in instrument calibration.

TI  - Role of one-step nucleic acid amplification in colorectal cancer lymph node metastases detection
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Current histopathological staging procedures in colorectal cancer (CRC) depend on midline division of the lymph nodes (LNs) with one section of hematoxylin and eosin staining. Cancer cells outside this transection line may be missed, which could lead to understaging of Union for International Cancer Control Stage II high-risk patients. The one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) assay has emerged as a rapid molecular diagnostic tool for LN metastases detection. It is a molecular technique that can analyze the entire LN tissue using a reverse-transcriptase loop-mediated isothermal amplification reaction to detect tumor-specific cytokeratin 19 mRNA. Our findings suggest that the OSNA assay has a high diagnostic accuracy in detecting metastatic LNs in CRC and a high negative predictive value. OSNA is a standardized, observer-independent technique, which may lead to more accurate staging. It has been suggested that in stage II CRC, the upstaging can reach 25% and these patients can access postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. Moreover, intraoperative OSNA sentinel node evaluation may allow early CRC to be treated with organ-preserving surgery, while in more advanced-stage disease, a tailored lymphadenectomy can be performed considering the presence of aberrant lymphatic drainage and skip metastases.

TI  - Soil erosion risk assessment and treatment priority classification: A case study on guder watersheds, Abay river basin, Oromia, Ethiopia
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion is the most persistent environmental problem in the Upper Blue Nile River (UBNR) basin of Ethiopia. Guder River is one of thetributaries of UBNR basin which critically required soil conservation practices. The main objective of this particular research article was to appraise soil erosion hazard priority classification with an easy and uncomplicated erosion modelling tool, the universal soil loss equation (USLE) using GIS software and RS data. Remote Sensing data such as annual mean precipitation, land-use land-cover, and soil map, digital elevation model map were used to determine the USLE factor values. The average annual rainfall data was derived from the widely used climate dataset CRU TS (Climatic Research Unit gridded Time Series) and converted to rainfall erosivity factor. Soil Erodibility Factor Soil (K) was calculated from FAO soil data "Digital Soil Map of the World -ESRI shapefile format ". Topographic Factor (LS) was delineated from a 30m digital elevation model. Cover Factor (C) and Support Practice Factor (P) were estimated from a 20m Ethiopia Sentinel2 Land-use Land-cover year, 2016. The study classified the Guder watersheds into different kinds of severity classes for prioritization of soil and water management options and conservation strategy. The mean annual soil eroded for the whole sub-basin was estimated at 25.23 tha(-1)y(-1). The study output outcomes demonstrated that about 0.1% (426ha) 6.9% (46764 ha), 8.9% (60055 ha), and 19.8 % (134320ha) have been under Catastrophic, very severe, severe, high erosion severity class respectively. About half of the Guder sub-basin has been underneath a very slight erosion. Nevertheless, the area covered by very severe erosion was 6.9%, and the annual percent of sum-total soil erosion accounted for was 46.86%. The second and third in magnitude soil lost annually from the sub-basin with regards to per cent of total soil loss were severe (26.53%), and high (21.53%) respectively. In only 7% of the area under investigation, soil erosion estimated was to go beyond 100 t/ha/yr. erosion rate. District wise erosion affected and hotspot areas were identified: Middle of Steep slopes Mountainous parts of Ginde Beret, Jeldu, Ifata, Ambo, parts Ababo and Horo Guduru located in the study area borderline, Toke Kutaye, along the boundary of Midakegn and Cheliya were found in severe to very severe erosion. Finally, the study proposed that the government, policy -makers, and soil and water management agents plan and implement the conservation measures and give awareness to stakeholders for optimum use of limited precious resources.

TI  - Warming does not delay the start of autumnal leaf coloration but slows its progress rate
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim Initiation of autumnal leaf senescence is crucial for plant overwintering and ecosystem dynamics. Previous studies have focused on the advanced stages of autumnal leaf senescence and reported that climatic warming delayed senescence, despite the fundamental differences among the stages of senescence. However, the timing of onset of leaf coloration (D-LCO), the earliest visual sign of senescence, has rarely been studied. Here, we assessed the response of D-LCO to temperature. Location 30-75 degrees N in the Northern Hemisphere. Time period 2000-2018. Major taxa studied Deciduous vegetation. Methods We retrieved D-LCO from high-temporal-resolution satellite data, which were then validated by PhenoCam observations. We investigated the temporal changes in D-LCO and the relationship between D-LCO and temperature by using satellite and ground observations. Results D-LCO was not significantly (p > .05) delayed between 2000 and 2018 in 94% of the area. D-LCO was positively (p < .05) correlated with pre-D-LCO mean daily minimum temperature (T-min) in only 9% of the area, whereas the end of leaf coloration (D-LCE) was positively correlated with pre-D-LCE mean T-min over a larger area (34%). Further analyses showed that warming slowed the progress of leaf coloration. Interestingly, D-LCO was less responsive to pre-D-LCO mean T-min in areas where daylength was longer across the Northern Hemisphere, particularly for woody vegetation. Main conclusions The rate of progress of coloration is more sensitive to temperature than its start date, resulting in an extension of the duration of leaf senescence under warming. The dependence of D-LCO response to temperature on daylength indicates stronger photoperiodic control on initiation of leaf senescence in areas with longer daylength (i.e., shorter nights), possibly because plants respond to the length of uninterrupted darkness rather than daylength. This study indicates that the onset of leaf coloration was not responsive to climate warming and provides observational evidence of photoperiod control of autumnal leaf senescence at biome and continental scales.

TI  - Modeling of land surface temperature-multiscale curvatures relationship using XGBoost algorithm (Case study: Southwestern Iran)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a fundamental variable in determining surface energy and water balances due to its control over the exchange of mass and energy between the soil surface and the atmosphere. This research aimed to investigate the relationship between spatial-temporal variability of LST and multiscale curvatures using the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm in southwestern Iran. For this purpose, six curvatures were derived using the Wood method in three neighborhood scales (5 x 5, 15 x 15, and 25 x 25) from the 30-m Shuttle Radar Topography Mission digital elevation model. The Gaussian method was used for the landform classification. Emissivity was estimated based on the thresholding method of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, and the average seasonal LST was calculated based on the Landsat 8 images taken during the 2013-2021 period using the inversion of Planck's function. The results depicted that neighborhood is a regulating factor in the amount of the detailed display of land surface features that in case of increasing its size, the rate of topographic surface bending decreases. In landform maps, four units that include the hill, closed depression, convex saddle, and concave saddle were identified, which have the lowest to the highest area within the studied region, respectively. The results of the Kruskal-Wallis test indicated that only the difference of each of the average LSTs of spring, summer, and winter between landform units classified based on 25 x 25 curvatures is significant (p-value < 0.05). The best performance of XGBoost models in explaining the variability in the average seasonal LST was obtained when the predictor variables were 25 x 25 curvatures (R-2 values between 0.20 for spring LST and 0.11 for winter LST). XGBoost models predicted the values of average LST of the spring and summer more accurately than those of the autumn and winter. The difference between the R-2 values of the XGBoost models based on the curvatures of 5 x 5 and 25 x 25 for the average LST of spring to winter is 0.14, 0.16, 0.15, and 0.11, respectively. The overall results of this research indicated the critical importance of neighborhood scale in capturing the variability of the environmental process studied in the landscape, while in many studies, the multiscale geomorphometric modeling has not been considered.

TI  - Analysis of source distribution of high carbon monoxide events using airborne and surface observations in Korea
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon monoxide (CO) is a key tracer of anthropogenic pollution, and it indirectly affects climate change. Anmyeon-do (AMY, 36.54 N, 126.33 E), a World Meteorological Organization/Global Atmosphere Watch Program (WMO/GAW) regional background station in Korea, provides continuous observations of CO mole fractions at the surface and vertical profiles within 0.5-9 km that are also collected by aircraft campaigns. The vertical profiles collected in 2019 were analyzed using meteorological parameters such as vertical velocity and boundary layer height (BLH), and a strong relationship was observed among them; however, the vertical distribution, which was influenced by unexpected strong pollution plumes, did not exhibit a strong relationship with vertical velocity and BLH. On November 16, we captured a strong CO signal within the boundary layer and at approximately 2 km above the BLH, where vertical profiles of the aerosol scattering coefficient at 550 nm were simultaneously observed with the same vertical structure. To identify the origins and source types of the stratification of the pollution plume for CO and aerosol, we also analyzed surface in situ observations of particle size distributions and reactive gases (NOx, O-3, and SO2) as well as the column averaged dry-air mole fraction of carbon monoxide (XCO) and measurements of aerosol optical depth obtained from the tropospheric monitoring instrument (TROPOMI) and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite, respectively. The high CO event within the BLH, including observations at the surface site, was attributed to domestic burning sources. Convective uplifting of industrial fossil fuel emissions from eastern China was responsible for the high CO dry mole fraction in the low free troposphere (FT) and the elevated aerosol scattering coefficient. Statistical analyses of one-year surface in situ observations of CO reveal that CO-emission sources from eastern China contributed to extremely high CO spikes (>= 80th percentile of CO or >= 350 ppb, approximately) in 2019. Therefore, we concluded that emissions from eastern China have a potentially leading role in the observed high pollution events at the surface and the lower FT over the AMY station in 2019. The increase in ground temperature, with the acceleration of the global warming process, can intensify the convective uplifting of pollution plumes from emission source regions to FT over East Asian regions. In addition, such an occurrence of the stratification of the atmospheric pollution plume in the troposphere should be considered in future studies on radiative forcing to improve air-quality forecasting in this region.

TI  - Analysis of wildfires and associated emissions during the recent strong ENSO phases in Southern Africa using multi-source remotely-derived products
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In southern Africa, drier conditions are more pronounced during the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) years, triggering wildfire activity and extreme drought conditions which, individually or together, lead to loss of crop productivity, deaths of livestock and wildlife, famine, degraded ecosystems, water quality and quantity. However, the fire characteristics in relation to the emissions from biomass burning and surface properties are only examined to a limited extent in the literature, especially in Africa, where anthropogenic activities largely determine the fire activity. This study uses the available data from multi-source remote sensing platforms to (1) analyse the spatial distribution of wildfires and associated emissions during strong El Nino (2015/2016) and La Nina (2010/2011) phases in southern Africa, and (2) examine the effects of the severe El Nino and La Nina years on the relationship between the emission parameters, vegetation parameters and climatic parameters. Generally, the results suggest more emissions from the wildfire in the El Nino phase than that of the La Nina. Overall, the Pearson's correlation clearly shows the influence and the relationship between the climate parameters themselves and also with emission parameters.

TI  - Development of a novel approach for snow wetness estimation using hybrid polarimetric RISAT-1 SAR datasets in North-Western Himalayan region
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow wetness estimates are critical inputs in the understanding of snow hydrological processes. With early warming in winters in the Himalayas, snowpack shows early signs of melting in February with increased snow wetness. Typically, in February, the snowpack comprises a mix of dry and wet snow layers. In the literature, methods for quantitative analysis of snow wetness are mostly based on fully polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. Methods based on the hybrid polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) data for snow monitoring are virtually inexistent. This study proposes a novel methodology for the estimation of snow wetness utilizing the C-band hybrid polarimetric RISAT-1 SAR dataset. Using radar remote sensing to analyze the behavior of such a snowpack requires information on the surface and volume scattering characteristics. The modeled generalized surface and volume scattering parameters (alpha), and (gamma), based on the X-Bragg's reflection coefficients and Fresnel transmission coefficients, are used for the inversion of surface and volume snow permittivities, respectively. The investigations are carried out for February 2014 for a study area in the Manali region in Himachal Pradesh, India. The retrieved snow estimates showed a coefficient of determination of 0.86 and a root mean square error of 0.667 with respect to in-situ measurements. Further, it was observed that the snow wetness estimates derived from the proposed method using RISAT-1 dataset outperformed the estimates based on fully polarimetric RADARSAT-2 dataset using the conventional Shi and Dozier method.

TI  - Machine learning for sinkhole risk mapping in Guidonia-Bagni di Tivoli plain (Rome), Italy
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This work presents a sinkhole susceptibility and risk assessment mapping in Guidonia-Bagni di Tivoli plain (Italy), a travertine sinkhole-prone area where sudden occurrences of sinkholes have happened in past and recent times. We collected a point-like sinkhole inventory and we considered a series of different sinkhole-controlling and precursory factors over the study area, related to its geo-litho-hydrological setting and to its terrain deformational scenario, i.e. ground motion rates derived from InSAR COSMO-SkyMed imagery. A sinkhole susceptibility map was produced through a machine learning model, namely Maximum Entropy algorithm (MaxEnt). Results highlight that the most determining factors for sinkhole formation are the lithology, the travertine thickness, groundwater and the land use. The sinkhole susceptibility map was then combined with data on vulnerability and elements-at-risk economic exposure in order to provide a sinkhole risk map of the area. The outcomes show that areas at higher risk covers about 2% of the total study area and primarily relies on the zoning of the main urban fabric. In particular, it is worth to highlight that 5% of the whole road-network pavement and 27% of all the residential buildings fall into High and Very High risk classes. Overall, results of this work demonstrate capabilities of machine learning models to assess sinkhole susceptibility for predicting potential sinkhole areas, and provide a sinkhole risk map, along with information on urban environment, as a useful tool for urban planning and geohazard risk management.

TI  - What water color parameters could be mapped using MODIS land reflectance products: A global evaluation over coastal and inland waters
T2  - EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - MODIS surface reflectance product (R_land) has been used to monitor waters due to its free availability and higher spatial resolution than MODIS ocean bands. However, its applicability in aquatic remote sensing has not been sufficiently assessed. Some fundamental questions such as the following need to be addressed: How does the R_land product perform in global inland and coastal waters? What water color parameters can be mapped using R_land? This study provided a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of MODIS R_land products against a field optical dataset containing 4143 reflectance spectra, 2320 chlorophyll-a (Chla) samples, and 1467 suspended particulate matter (SPM) samples across global nearshore coastal and inland waters. The results showed that R_land significantly overestimated remote sensing reflectance, particularly in the bands of 469 nm and 859 nm. The noticeable negative values and patchiness were found in the R_land imagery, and existing algorithms did not estimate satisfactory Chla and SPM from R_land across the global inland and coastal waters. Furthermore, we tested popular machine-learning approaches, such as random forest (RF), support vector machine, XGBoost, and deep neural networks, to examine the potential of the R_land product in estimating SPM and Chla. Machine learning models were found to outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms for SPM retrievals from R_land. Specifically, RF and XGBoost showed the good performance with mean absolute errors of -25.0% and mean absolute percentage error of -23% for a broad SPM range of 10-500 mg L-1. Yet, machine learning models cannot retrieve reliable Chla from R_land with approximately 55% uncertainty due to the limited spectral information and uncertainty of R_land products. This implicated that R_land might be able to quantify the parameters that are closely related to SPM (e.g., water clarity and extinction coefficients) in most waters; however, it is challenging to quantify pigments like Chla in waters from R_land. We conclude that R_land might not be an optimal data source for monitoring inland and coastal waters, despite the ease of using this product and its higher spatial resolution than the MODIS ocean bands.

TI  - Cadastral resurvey and integration of geospatial technique using high-resolution satellite image (HRSI): a case study in Indian district
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent developments in digital airborne sensors and satellite platforms make spatially accurate, high-resolution satellite image (HRSI) readily accessible. The potential of geospatial technology provides the opportunity to solve complex old real-world problems. Improvised ground-based survey methods involve detailed survey, which provides highly processed three-dimensional coordinates for surveyed points. An assessment of the capabilities of these increasing spatial resolutions of satellite imagery and hybrid survey systems for the updation/resurvey of land information, such as land parcel size and their real earth position, has been done in this study. It compares chain and tape surveying, traditional survey methods with HRSI-based surveying. This study aims to assess the viability of improvised geospatial technique for surveying in the land modernization program. This study assesses the accuracy of three different methods for comparing land information: (1) old traditional method of land surveying, (2) conversion of hard copies of cadastral maps into digitized maps using computer-aided technique, and (3) improvised ortho-HRSI-based geospatial technology. A discussion of the results and relative merits of each method is included in this study. Even though the area measurement method by ground and computer-aided technique is discrepant, there was a considerable matching of digitized cadastral map to the land records area. The study indicates geospatial technology can be adapted further to other villages and districts and digital information can be updated frequently. This paper provides an overview of the development and maintenance of digital cadastral assessment maps and parcel data layers in a geographic information system. It describes digital mapping system components, modern survey techniques, and the creation of digital maps.

TI  - Evaluation of machine learning-based algorithms for landslide detection across satellite sensors for the 2019 Cyclone Idai event, Chimanimani District, Zimbabwe
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in climatic patterns, manifested as intensified cyclones and torrential rainfalls in a warming world will inevitably impact the frequency of landslides. One such climatic extreme, Cyclone Idai (March 2019), caused significant havoc across southeastern Africa, including Mozambique, Malawi, and eastern Zimbabwe, by triggering thousands of landslides and widespread concurrent flooding, both of which resulted in substantial loss of life. The study was conducted in the Chimanimani District of eastern Zimbabwe to understand the impact of Cyclone Idai on landslide initiation, quantify the volume of mobilized hillslope material during the event, and compare the event-triggered material release against the annual erosional yield across the study area using machine learning and remote sensing techniques. We evaluated satellite imagery of various resolutions, namely, PlanetScope (3m/px),RapidEye (5m/px), and Sentinel-2 (tom/px) and three machine learning algorithms: artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) to identify landslides and compared the efficacy of the models. A total of nine predictor variables derived from the satellite imagery and a 3o-m ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model were employed to identify landslides and differentiate them from concurrent hydrological flooding. The models classified the study area into three classes: (i) landslides, (ii) flooding, and (iii) unaffected area. The RF model using PlanetScope satellite data attained the highest prediction accuracy of 97.88%, whereas the accuracy of other machine learning model-satellite data combinations ranged between 94.58 and 97.27%. Subsequently, landslide size thresholds were applied on the initially mapped landslides to eliminate noise and uncertainty from the data before estimating the final Cyclone Idai event-triggered landslide volume. A probability density function, which corresponds to a logarithmic plot of non-cumulative landslide frequency against the mapped landslide area, was employed to calculate landslide size thresholds using divergence and rollover point cutoff values. Finally, a landslide area-to-volume power-law scaling relationship was exploited to derive landslide volumes in the study area that ranged between 6.8 x 10(6) to 14.7 x 10(6) m(3) and 9.0 x 10(6) to 19.6 x 10(6) m(3) for divergence and rollover point thresholds, respectively, across the different combinations of machine learning models and satellite sensors. The estimated landslide volume indicates hillslope material liberated by Cyclone Idai was 269 to 345 times greater than the estimated annual average background denudation of the study area computed from a topography-based local erosion model.

TI  - Age disparities in triple-negative breast cancer treatment and outcomes: An NCDB analysis
T2  - SURGERY
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 17th Annual Academic Surgical Congress (ASC)
CL  - Orlando, FL
AB  - Background: Race, access to care, and molecular features result in outcome disparities in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). We sought to determine the role of age in TNBC disparity by hypothesizing that younger patients receive more comprehensive treatment, resulting in survival differences. Methods: The National Cancer Database was used to identify women with unilateral TNBC treated from 2005 through 2017. Patients were stratified by age (<= 40, 41e70, >70); demographics, clinical charac-teristics, and treatment factors were compared. Logistic regression determined factors associated with treatment received. Survival outcomes were analyzed using a stratified log-rank test. Results: Of the 168,715 patients, 16,287 (9.6%) were <= 40 years. Patients <= 40 were significantly more likely to present at higher clinical stage (P < .001) and receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC, P < .001). Bilateral mastectomy was the most common surgery for patients <= 40 (37%), whereas partial mastectomy was most often used in patients 41 to 70 years old (48%) and those >70 (49%) (P < .001). Patients <= 40 years were significantly more likely to undergo both NAC and mastectomy than those >40 (odds ratio 1.5, both P < .05) despite a greater in-breast tumor response in the youngest patients. Patients treated with mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection had inferior survival outcomes compared to those treated with partial mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy across all 3 age groups (P < .001). Conclusion: The clinical characteristics of TNBC differ significantly at the extremes of age, likely driving treatment decisions. Although patients <= 40 present with a more advanced disease and appropriately receive NAC, they also undergo more extensive surgery that does not yield a survival benefit. Further research is needed to determine if age disparity is due to oncologic factors or patient and provider preferences. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Flood hazard assessment and mitigation using a multi-criteria approach in the Sinai Peninsula, Egypt
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sinai Peninsula in Egypt is highly vulnerable to flash flooding due to its huge variation in relief and erratic rainfall. However, assessing flood risk in the Sinai is a difficult challenge due to the almost complete lack of accurate flood observations and relevant drainage basin characteristics. Therefore, this study evaluates the flood hazard in the Sinai Peninsula through multi-criteria analysis of morphometric characteristics of the drainage patterns, which can be easily inferred from readily available remote sensing data and geographical analysis tools. From a digital elevation model with a spatial resolution of 30 m, 112 catchments are identified, each characterized by twenty morphometric parameters, grouped into three categories: geometry, drainage network and relief. The importance of the morphometric parameters on flooding is assessed with the analytical hierarchy process. Normalized weights for each parameter and category, obtained from pairwise comparison matrices, allow to derive a flood sensitivity index and create a map showing different degrees of flash flood hazard. The results show that basins characterized as highly sensitive to flooding generally have high values for all three morphometric parameter categories: geometry, flow network and relief. About 17% of the Sinai appears to be very highly sensitive to flooding, 39% highly sensitive and 34% moderately sensitive. The very highly flood-prone basins are all located in the southern Sinai mountain ranges, while the highly flood-prone basins are mainly found along the outer edges of the southern Sinai mountain ranges and in some sub-basins of wadi El-Aris. Comparison with case studies reported in other publications and the media shows a strong agreement, indicating that the proposed methodology is reliable and accurate. Based on the obtained flash flood sensitivity map, management plans are proposed to reduce the risk of flash flooding and to protect major cities and roads by installing side channels and culverts to collect and drain the excess water from areas most affected prone to flooding.

TI  - Exploring the capability of Gaofen-5 hyperspectral data for assessing soil salinity risks
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization has hampered the achievement of sustainable development goals (SDGs) in many countries worldwide. Several countries have recently launched hyperspectral remote sensing satellites, opening new av-enues for accurate soil-salinity monitoring. Among them, Gaofen-5 (GF-5) from China has a high comprehensive performance, including a spectral resolution of 5 nm, 330 bands, and signal-to-noise ratio of 700. However, the potential of GF-5 for estimating soil salinity is not well understood. In this study, we proposed a strategy that includes bootstrap methods, fractional order derivative (FOD) techniques and decision-level fusion models to exploit the soil salinity diagnostic information and reduce estimation uncertainty in the Ebinur Lake oasis in northwestern China. The results showed that the GF-5 data were suitable for assessing soil salinity. The FOD technique enhanced the correlation between soil salinity and spectra, identified more diagnostic bands, improved the accuracy of soil salinity estimation, and reduced model uncertainty. The low-order FOD outperformed the high-order FOD. The spectra processed by the 0.9 order derivative were the most correlated with soil salinity (r =-0.76). The model driven by the 0.8 order derivative produced the optimal estimated model (R2 = 0.95, root mean square error (RMSE) = 3.20 dS m-1 and a ratio of performance to interquartile distance (RPIQ) = 5.96). The model driven by the 0.8 order derivative had less uncertainty than the models based on the original and integer-order derivative (first-and second-derivatives) spectra. This study provides a reference for estimating soil salinity from GF-5 data using the proposed framework with low uncertainty and high accuracy. GF-5 data have great potential for assessing environmental problems and facilitating further SDGs.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The analysis and the exploitation of remote sensing datasets have an effective contribution to geological studies, particularly the lineament extraction process could play an important role in tectonic features identification, well as new ore deposits, hydrogeological, and petroleum re-sources prospection. In this study, we applied an automatic approach to map structural linea-ments in the Ameln valley area of the western Anti-Atlas province. The aim of this work is the mapping of structural lineaments in the region, then the comparison of the results of multi-source datasets in automatic lineaments extraction, where six images have been used including, HyMap, ASTER, ALOS PALSAR DEM, Sentinel-2A, and Sentinel-1A VH and VV polarizations. The principal component analysis was applied on optical images, a 7x7 Kernel matrix in four directions, N-S, NE-SW, E-W, and SE-NW for HyMap hyperspectral data image in order to achieve a clear and detailed contrast of structural features. ALOS PALSAR DEM was used for lineaments mapping after applying hill shading in the main four directions. Combined with the field investigations, the high resolution HyMap data image revealed relatively the highest number of lineaments (2091 lineaments), with lengths varying from a few hundred meters (100 m) to a kilometer wide (1.2 km). Additionally, the NNE-SSW, NE-SW, and ENE-WSW are the main obtained lineaments trends, where the NE-SW lineaments set highlights the main faults orientation in the study area. Whereas, a good number of lineaments was detected using elevation data of ALOS PALSAR and VH polarization data of Sentinel-1A that allowed the best discrimination of trending fracture system, leading to achieve a detailed map of the structural discontinuities in the study region. The lineaments mapping results highlight the significant contribution of the late Ediacaran exten-sional event in the actual tectonic structuration of the eastern Kerdous inlier.

TI  - Changing nature of Land surface temperature and transformation of vegetation cover and water bodies in the 2nd largest urban agglomeration of West Bengal, Eastern India
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST), vegetation and water are very crucial for maintaining a healthy urban ecosystem. Asansol is one of the fast growing urban industrial agglomerations of West Bengal in Eastern India. In the last few decades the city has experienced a rapid urban industrial expansion along with the population growth which is associated with the continuous increase of LST. Considering this the present study has been designed to explain the nature of LST changes and transformation of land cover over the last thirty years utilizing the Landsat imageries in GIS platforms. In this study changing nature of land surface temperature, vegetation cover and surface water bodies and their interrelationship over the last thirty years have been analysed. Landsat 5TM images of May and October for the year 1990, 2000 and 2010 and Landsat 8 OLI images of May and October for 2020 have been utilized in GIS platform. LST and different indices NDVI, MNDWI and NDBI have been extracted for analyzing the nature of change along with image classification. The results of the study depict that LST is increasing continuously. In the first decade (1990-2000) LST increased at 0.24 ?/year followed by an increasing rate of 0.33 ?/year in the second decade (2000-2010) and 0.37 ?/year in the last decade (2010-2020). Same trend is also perceived for built up area, where it increased at 0.96 km2/year, 1.71 km2/year, and 2.49 km2/year in corresponding decades. On the other hand, the vegetation cover is continuously decreasing (1.59 km(2)/year, 0.75 km(2)/year and 0.49 km(2)/year in consecutive decades) as well as the surface water bodies (0.62 km(2)/year in, 0.41 km(2)/year, and 0.25 km(2)/year in corresponding three decades) over the last thirty years. Correlation and regression analysis of land surface temperature and various indices shows positive relation between LST and NDBI, negative relation between LST and MNDWI, and also between LST and NDVI. Urban-industrial expansion is the important factor for increasing temperature and transforming vegetation and surface water bodies.

TI  - Study of the impact of ash fallout from the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjoll (2010) on vegetation using MODIS data
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Volcanic ash fallout is a recurrent environmental disturbance of flora ash deposits from the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjoll (2010) over large areas are responsible for several impacts on ecological processes, agricultural production, and human health in Western Europe. This study assessed the ash fall effects from the subject volcano on the surrounding flora as well as vegetative recovery at two different sites (Scotland and southern Sweden). For this purpose, we analyzed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Leaf Area Index (LAI), and Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation absorbed by Plants (FPAR) data provided by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The cited biophysical variables were most strongly influenced by ash cloud fallout, with the lowest maxima recorded for both sites during the 2010 eruption year. To confirm this impact, a statistical study with climate indicators was performed. The results showed a significant correlation between LAI and precipitation (R-2 = 0.63, p-value = 0.0022) at site 1 (Scotland), while a weak non-significant correlation (R-2 = 0.2248, p-value > 0.5) was observed at site 2. However, climatic data from both sites showed low correlations (R-2 < 50%) with NDVI vegetation indicator. Despite the heavy rainfall and heat recorded during this period, our statistical results show us that ash cloud fallout affects vegetative development.

TI  - Hotspot and trend analysis of forest fires and its relation to climatic factors in the western Himalayas
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fire is one of the main issues of forest ecosystems around the world which has resulted in loss of biodiversity, forest degradation, soil erosion, and greenhouse gas emission. Ironically, the information on the forest fire regime and its pattern are still lacking in the Himalayan region. In this study, Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer active fire data products from 2001 to 2020 have been analysed for understanding the forest fire trends and its hotspots patterns during the active fire season (February to June). About 1347 average fire counts/year were recorded in six natural vegetations with the highest number of fires observed during the year 2012 (n = 3096) and minimum in 2011 (n = 210). Mann-Kendall trends analysis for the spatial and temporal pattern of fires indicated that there is a significant increase of forest fires towards higher elevation. Forest fire hotspot analysis using fire radiative power, fire frequency, and fire density showed that Uttarakhand is the most forest fire-prone state as compared to other north-western Himalayan states. It is also revealed that the May month has a higher number of fire counts and the evergreen needle forests have higher fire frequencies amongst the forest types. The forest fires were found to be more influenced by land surface temperature as compared to rainfall. The outcomes in this study on the temporal and spatial patterns for forest fire can be used for forest fire modelling.

TI  - Global occupation of wetland by artificial impervious surface area expansion and its impact on ecosystem service value for 2001-2018
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland is one of the most critical ecosystems with various functions, it produces the highest ecosystem services value (ESV) per unit area among all land types, thus, its decline has become a global concern in recent years. Since the 21st century, many developing countries have been continuously encroaching on wetlands due to rapid economic and population growth, resulting in the replacement of a large number of wetlands by cities, and how to reconcile urban expansion and wetland conservation has become a significant problem that needs to be considered. In this context, we mapped the spatial distribution of wetlands occupied by the expansion of global artificial impervious surface area (ISA) for 2001-2018 and discussed its temporal and spatial change characteristics at the global, continental, and national scales using the annual maps of global annual impervious area data set and global dynamic land cover data set based on Google Earth Engine platform, the loss of ESV due to wetland occupation was also measured at each spatial scale level. The results show that: (1) A total of 1301.24 km(2) of wetlands were occupied by ISA expansion globally for 2001-2018, and their interannual variation showed an upward trend for 2001-2015, then began to decline rapidly since 2016. The occupation results in a global loss of US$3.46 billion in ecosystem service value; (2) Asia has the highest loss of ESV due to occupation of wetlands by ISA expansion, 624.18 km(2) of occupation of wetlands resulted in a loss of US$1.66 billion in ESV, making it the continent with the largest area of occupied wetlands. Taking into account the different sizes of the continents, Oceania is the continent where ISA expansion occupies the wetlands most, while South America is the continent where it is relatively least severe; (3) China, the USA and Russia account for 50.9 % of global ESV loss due to wetland occupation by ISA expansion, a total of 663.95 km(2) of wetlands were occupied. Although countries have made great efforts to protect wetland resources and deal with urban land expansion, our results show that the problem of wetlands occupied by global urban land expansion is still severe.

TI  - High-resolution surface water dynamics in Earth's small and medium-sized reservoirs
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Small and medium-sized reservoirs play an important role in water systems that need to cope with climate variability and various other man-made and natural challenges. Although reservoirs and dams are criticized for their negative social and environmental impacts by reducing natural flow variability and obstructing river connections, they are also recognized as important for social and economic development and climate change adaptation. Multiple studies map large dams and analyze the dynamics of water stored in the reservoirs behind these dams, but very few studies focus on small and medium-sized reservoirs on a global scale. In this research, we use multi-annual multi-sensor satellite data, combined with cloud analytics, to monitor the state of small (10-100 ha) to medium-sized (> 100 ha, excluding 479 large ones) artificial water reservoirs globally for the first time. These reservoirs are of crucial importance to the well-being of many societies, but regular monitoring records of their water dynamics are mostly missing. We combine the results of multiple studies to identify 71,208 small to medium-sized reservoirs, followed by reconstructing surface water area changes from satellite data using a novel method introduced in this study. The dataset is validated using 768 daily in-situ water level and storage measurements (r2 > 0.7 for 67% of the reservoirs used for the validation) demonstrating that the surface water area dynamics can be used as a proxy for water storage dynamics in many cases. Our analysis shows that for small reservoirs, the inter-annual and intra-annual variability is much higher than for medium-sized reservoirs worldwide. This implies that the communities reliant on small reservoirs are more vulnerable to climate extremes, both short-term (within seasons) and longer-term (across seasons). Our findings show that the long-term inter-annual and intra-annual changes in these reservoirs are not equally distributed geographically. Through several cases, we demonstrate that this technology can help monitor water scarcity conditions and emerging food insecurity, and facilitate transboundary cooperation. It has the potential to provide operational information on conditions in ungauged or upstream riparian countries that do not share such data with neighboring countries. This may help to create a more level playing field in water resource information globally.

TI  - A deep insight into state-level aerosol pollution in India: Long-term (2005-2019) characteristics, source apportionment, and future projection (2023)
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study provides a national scenario of aerosol pollution with the long-term (2005-2019) trend, source apportionment, and future scenario (2023) for each of the Indian states. We used MODIS AOD and FRP, differential AODs from MERRA-2, and trace gases (NO2, SO2) data from OMI. Almost all the states of IGP fall under the red zone ( "highly vulnerable "; AOD > 0.5) whereas central, western, and a few south-Indian states fall under the orange zone ( "vulnerable "; 0.4 < AOD > 0.5). The most alarming feature is that most of the southern Indian states exhibit a shift from blue/green (less vulnerable/safe; AOD < 0.4) to vulnerable zones in 2023 as observed using the auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that the coal-fired thermal power plant (TPP), vehicular, solid fuel/waste, and biomass burning are the major sources of aerosols for the vulnerable states at present and in the future. We estimated and proposed the TPP capacity (GW) that needs to be reduced to bring down the AOD to move the vulnerable zones to less vulnerable and safe zones. The present study would complement and strengthen the ongoing national missions to combat air pollution in India.

TI  - Assessment and characterization of sources of error impacting the accuracy of global burned area products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the sources of error that affect the accuracy of current coarse burned area products is crucial to identifying weaknesses and limitations of burned area (BA) algorithms. In this paper, we propose methods to analyse sources of errors of global BA products, which are applied to assess a widely used product, (FireCCI51), created under the ESA climate change initiative programme. The effect of several variables related to product accuracy are quantified by comparing the FireCCI51 BA product with a large global reference BA dataset for the years 2017-2019. These reference data were obtained from multitemporal analysis of Landsat-8 data. Error maps (commission and omission error layers) were generated for a sample of 316 units (100 km x 100 km) and as-sociations between errors and potential explanatory sources of error were spatially analysed to provide a comprehensive error assessment of the FireCCI51 product. Active fire density, burned severity, burned patch size and land cover class were selected as explanatory variables for omission and commission errors. The results indicated that the largest contribution to the commission errors (70-80%) was related to the pixel size, partic-ularly when pixels are only partially burned. Active fire densities were also associated to error distribution, with higher densities from products derived from the VIIRS sensors versus those generated from MODIS, indicating the potential benefit of the former as an alternative source in upcoming BA algorithms. Burn severity was also associated with error distribution, but this relation varied substantially across biomes. Land cover was also related to errors, with lowest accuracies for croplands with omission error percentages > 85%. Fire size and, to a lesser extent, the shape of burned areas also played a crucial role in determining the accuracy of the BA products. BA accuracy increased for larger and more compact burned patches. Although our results suggest that further improvement of global BA products is possible, they also indicate that the ability of coarse spatial resolution BA sensors to meet the accuracy recommendations of the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) programme is limited.

TI  - TermPicks: a century of Greenland glacier terminus data for use in scientific and machine learning applications
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine-terminating outlet glacier terminus traces, mapped from satellite and aerial imagery, have been used extensively in understanding how outlet glaciers adjust to climate change variability over a range of timescales. Numerous studies have digitized termini manually, but this process is labor intensive, and no consistent approach exists. A lack of coordination leads to duplication of efforts, particularly for Greenland, which is a major scientific research focus. At the same time, machine learning techniques are rapidly making progress in their ability to automate accurate extraction of glacier termini, with promising developments across a number of optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite sensors. These techniques rely on high-quality, manually digitized terminus traces to be used as training data for robust automatic traces. Here we present a database of manually digitized terminus traces for machine learning and scientific applications. These data have been collected, cleaned, assigned with appropriate metadata including image scenes, and compiled so they can be easily accessed by scientists. The TermPicks data set includes 39 060 individual terminus traces for 278 glaciers with a mean of 136 +/- 190 and median of 93 of traces per glacier. Across all glaciers, 32 567 dates have been digitized, of which 4467 have traces from more than one author, and there is a duplication rate of 17 %. We find a median error of similar to 100 m among manually traced termini. Most traces are obtained after 1999, when Landsat 7 was launched. We also provide an overview of an updated version of the Google Earth Engine Digitization Tool (GEEDiT), which has been developed specifically for future manual picking of the Greenland Ice Sheet.

TI  - Checkerboard patterns in E3SMv2 and E3SM-MMFv2
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - An unphysical checkerboard pattern is identified in E3SMv2 and E3SM-MMF that is detectable across a wide range of timescales, from instantaneous snapshots to multi-year averages. A detection method is developed to quantify characteristics of the checkerboard signal by cataloguing all possible configurations of the eight adjacent neighbors for each cell on the model's cubed sphere grid using daily mean data. The checkerboard pattern is only found in cloud-related quantities, such as precipitation and liquid water path. Instances of pure and partial checkerboard are found to occur more often in E3SMv2 and E3SM-MMF when compared to satellite data regridded to the model grid. Continuous periods of partial checkerboard state are found to be more persistent in both models compared to satellite data, with E3SM-MMF exhibiting more persistence than E3SMv2. The checkerboard signal in E3SMv2 is found to be a direct consequence of the recently added deep convective trigger condition based on dynamically generated CAPE (DCAPE). In E3SM-MMF the checkerboard signal is found to be associated with the "trapping" of cloud-scale fluctuations within the embedded cloud-resolving model. Solutions to remedy this issue are discussed.

TI  - Microbial community characteristics of the intestine and gills of medium-form populations of <i>Sthenoteuthis oualaniensis</i> in the South China Sea
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sthenoteuthis oualaniensis (purpleback squid) is an excellent biological resource in the South China Sea. However, the microbiological characteristics of this South China Sea squid, especially those of the medium-form of different sexes and gonadal maturities, are poorly understood. In this study, the characteristics of the bacterial community in the intestinal and gill tissues of female and male S. oualaniensis with different gonadal maturities, collected from the Nansha Sea of China in spring 2020, were analyzed. The results showed that Tenericutes, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes were the dominant phyla in the intestinal microbial samples of female immature gonad (FN), male immature gonad (MN), and male sexual maturity (MY) samples of the S. oualaniensis populations. Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Tenericutes were the dominant phyla in the intestinal microbial sample of the female sexual maturity (FY) group. The microbial community in the gills differed from that of the intestinal flora. The dominant phyla in the gill samples were Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes, regardless of sex or gonadal maturity. According to the random forest analysis, the gill samples had significantly (p<0.001) more Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways in the top 20 than the intestinal samples. Correlation analysis showed that the mantle length of S. oualaniensis was significantly (p<0.05) negatively correlated with the abundance of Tenericutes, but significantly (p<0.01) positively correlated with Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. The mantle length of FY was significantly (p<0.05) longer than that of the other types. The results indicated that the differences in the intestinal bacterial community were related to the growth and feeding characteristics of S. oualaniensis of different sexes and maturities.

TI  - Domain Adaptation on Multiple Cloud Recognition From Different Types of Meteorological Satellite
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Meteorological satellites have become an indispensable meteorological tool for earth observation, as aiding in areas such as cloud detection, which has important guiding significance for maritime activities. However, it is time-consuming and labor-intensive to obtain fine-grained annotations provided by artificial experience or mature satellite cloud products for multi-spectral maritime cloud imageries, especially when new satellites are launched. Moreover, due to the data discrepancy caused by different detection bands, existing models have inadequate generalization performance compared to new satellites, and some cannot be directly migrated. In this paper, to reduce the data distribution's discrepancy, an approach is presented based on unsupervised domain adaption method for marine cloud detection task based on Himawari-8 satellite data as a source domain and Fengyun-4 satellite data as a target domain. The goal of the proposed method is to leverage the representation power of adversarial learning to extract domain-invariant features, consisting of a segmentation model, a feature extract model for target domain, and a domain discriminator. In addition, aiming to remedy the discrepancy of detection bands, a band mapping module is designed to implement consistency between different bands. The result of the experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method with a 7% improvement compared with the comparative experiment. We also designed a series of statistical experiments on different satellite data to further study cloudy perception representation, including data visualization experiment and cloud type statistics.

TI  - Estimation of chromophoric dissolved organic matter and its controlling factors in Beaufort Sea using mixture density network and Sentinel-3 data
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - With the warming of the high-latitude regional climate, melting of permafrost, and acceleration of hydrological cycles, the Arctic Ocean (AO) has undergone a series of rapid changes in the past decades. As a dominant optical component of the AO, the variations in chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) concentration affect the physiological state marine organisms. In this study, machine learning retrieval model based on in situ data and mixture density network (MDN) was developed. Compared to other models, MDN model performed better on test data (R-2 = 0.83, and root mean squared error = 0.22 m(-1)) and was applied to Sentinel-3 OLCI data. Afterward, the spatiotemporal distribution of CDOM during the ice-free (June-September) from 2016 to 2020 in the Beaufort Sea was obtained. CDOM concentration generally exhibited an upward trend. The maximum monthly average CDOM concentration appeared in June and gradually decreased thereafter, reaching its lowest value in September of each year. The maximum value appeared in June 2020 (0.91 m(-1)), and the minimum value was observed in September 2017 (0.81 m(-1)). The CDOM concentration nearshore was higher than that in other areas; and gradually decreased from offshore to the open sea. CDOM was highly correlated with salinity (R-2 = 0.49) and discharge (R-2 = 0.53), and the tight correlation between salinity and CDOM further suggested that terrestrial inputs were the main source of CDOM in the Beaufort Sea. However, sea level pressure contributed to the spatial variations in CDOM. When southerly wind prevailed and wind direction was aligned with the CDOM diffusion direction, the wind accelerated the diffusion of CDOM into the open sea. Meanwhile, seawater was diluted by the sea ice melting, resulting in decrease in CDOM concentration. Herein, this paper proposed a robust and near real-time method for CDOM monitoring and influence factor analysis, which would promote the understanding of AO CDOM budgets.

TI  - Air quality impacts of COVID-19 lockdown measures detected from space using high spatial resolution observations of multiple trace gases from Sentinel-5P/TROPOMI
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this paper is to highlight how TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) trace gas data can best be used and interpreted to understand event-based impacts on air quality from regional to city scales around the globe. For this study, we present the observed changes in the atmospheric column amounts of five trace gases (NO2, SO2, CO, HCHO, and CHOCHO) detected by the Sentinel-5P TROPOMI instrument and driven by reductions in anthropogenic emissions due to COVID-19 lockdown measures in 2020. We report clear COVID-19-related decreases in TROPOMI NO2 column amounts on all continents. For megacities, reductions in column amounts of tropospheric NO2 range between 14 % and 63 %. For China and India, supported by NO2 observations, where the primary source of anthropogenic SO2 is coal-fired power generation, we were able to detect sector-specific emission changes using the SO2 data. For HCHO and CHOCHO, we consistently observe anthropogenic changes in 2-week-averaged column amounts over China and India during the early phases of the lockdown periods. That these variations over such a short timescale are detectable from space is due to the high resolution and improved sensitivity of the TROPOMI instrument. For CO, we observe a small reduction over China, which is in concert with the other trace gas reductions observed during lockdown; however, large interannual differences prevent firm conclusions from being drawn. The joint analysis of COVID-19-lockdown-driven reductions in satellite-observed trace gas column amounts using the latest operational and scientific retrieval techniques for five species concomitantly is unprecedented. However, the meteorologically and seasonally driven variability of the five trace gases does not allow for drawing fully quantitative conclusions on the reduction in anthropogenic emissions based on TROPOMI observations alone. We anticipate that in future the combined use of inverse modeling techniques with the high spatial resolution data from S5P/TROPOMI for all observed trace gases presented here will yield a significantly improved sector-specific, space-based analysis of the impact of COVID-19 lockdown measures as compared to other existing satellite observations. Such analyses will further enhance the scientific impact and societal relevance of the TROPOMI mission.

TI  - The associations between residential greenness and allergic diseases in Chinese toddlers: A birth cohort study
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Green space in the living environment has been linked to the development of allergic diseases. However, evidence regarding early-onset allergy in toddlers was limited, and the critical exposure window remained unclear. We aimed to investigate associations between residential greenness with allergic diseases in early life.Methods: This prospective birth cohort study included 522 mother-child pairs in Guangzhou, China. We quan-tified prenatal, postnatal, and early-life (i.e., the first 1000 days of life) residential greenness, estimated from remote satellite data using normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and tree cover. We identified physician-diagnosed allergic diseases (eczema, atopic dermatitis, urticaria, allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, food allergy, and asthma) based on medical records at age 2 years. Generalized linear regression was conducted to examine the associations of greenness with allergic outcomes.Results: The ranges of residential NDVI and EVI values in 500-m buffer during early life were 0.06-0.70 and 0.03-0.46, respectively. We found a 0.1 unit increase of NDVI in 500-m buffer throughout early life was asso-ciated with higher odds of any allergic diseases (prenatal: OR [odds ratio], 1.25; 95%CI, 1.02-1.53; postnatal: OR, 1.24; 95%CI, 1.02-1.52; early-life: OR, 1.25, 95%CI: 1.02-1.53) and higher odds of eczema (prenatal: OR, 1.28; 95%CI, 1.04-1.59; postnatal: OR, 1.24; 95%CI, 1.01-1.54; early-life: OR, 1.26, 95%CI: 1.02-1.56). The results were consistent when using EVI as a proxy for greenness. We only observed that prenatal exposure to the highest tertile of NDVI-500 was adversely associated with any allergic diseases (OR, 1.63; 95%CI, 1.03-2.58) and eczema (OR, 1.70; 95%CI: 1.04-2.78) compared with the lowest tertile.Conclusions: This study identified detrimental associations of residential greenness with allergic diseases espe-cially eczema among toddlers, and pregnancy appears to be the critical exposure window. Our findings high-lighted the importance of urban planning to develop friendly-green neighborhood to improve maternal and child health.

TI  - Evaluation of perfluoropropane (C<sub>3</sub>F<sub>8</sub>)-filled chitosan polyacrylic acid nanobubbles for ultrasound imaging of sentinel lymph nodes and tumors
T2  - BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate sentinel lymph node (SLN) identification is an important prerequisite for sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). However, existing SLN mapping techniques, mainly imaging-guided methods, are severely restricted by the high cost of the instruments, harmful radiation or unsatisfactory imaging depths. Herein, we prepared a new ultrasound contrast agent by filling perfluoropropane (C3F8) into chitosan polyacrylic acid nanobubbles for precise SLN identification. The obtained ultrasound contrast agent, coined C3F8-CS-PAA nanobubbles, presents a nanometer size with a diameter of approximately 120 nm. The C3F8-CS-PAA nanobubbles of desirable size are able to enter lymphatic vessels and accumulate in the sentinel lymph node to enhance ultrasound imaging. As a result, the injection of C3F8-CS-PAA nanobubbles can remarkably enhance the ultrasound imaging lymph system, providing image guidance for sentinel lymph node biopsy. Furthermore, it was shown that such C3F8-CS-PAA nanobubbles can effectively permeate into the tumor region via the tumor-enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect to enhance tumor ultrasound imaging for monitoring tumorigenesis. This work highlights a novel nanoscale ultrasound contrast agent for the lymphatic system and tumor imaging, with great promise for subsequent studies and clinical applications.

TI  - Satellite assessment of coastal plume variability and its relation to environmental variables in the Sofala Bank
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Monthly composites of remote sensing reflectance at 555 nm wavelength (R(rs)555) from ocean color imagery of the MODIS sensor onboard the Aqua platform were used to characterize the spatial and temporal variability of coastal plume in the Sofala Bank and its relation to river discharge, local rainfall, and wind speed. To achieve the objective, maps of monthly composites of R(rs)555 over the Sofala Bank were inspected and statistical analysis was performed, including correlation, analysis of variance, and wavelet coherence between environmental variables and both plume area and R(rs)555. Climatology of R(rs)555 revealed that both plume dispersion and R(rs)555 values are higher during June to December and lower during January to May. A positive correlation (r = 0.77) between wind speed and monthly time series of R(rs)555, and a negative correlation between the Zambezi river discharge (r = -0.21) and rainfall (r = -0.67) with R(rs)555 were found. These results suggest that variation of suspended matter in the Sofala Bank is mainly controlled by erosion and re-suspension by winds rather than the input of terrigenous matter by the Zambezi River discharge and rainfall, assuming that R(rs)555 can be a valid proxy for the inorganic suspended matter. The southern portion of the Sofala Bank (i.e., near the mouths of the Pungue and Buzi Rivers) presented higher values of R(rs)555 if compared to the center region near Zambezi river mouth and the northern region near Licungo river mouth. The higher R(rs)555 values in the southern region might be associated with higher re-suspension rates due to increased tide mixing, dredging activities, and the shallower nature of bathymetry in the southern region. The dominance of wind in controlling the variability of suspended sediments and the eventual relatively greater contribution of Pungue and Buzi River than the Zambezi in supplying sediments could represent an evidence of weakening of Zambezi River supply of sediments, a process that might have started after damming the Zambezi Catchment.

TI  - The combination of singular values decomposition with constant false alarm algorithms to enhance ship detection in a polarimetric SAR application
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Ships remote sensing is an essential tool for marine traffic management. It can enhance the monitoring system and ensure the security of sailing ships. We aim in this research paper to identify the best ship detection procedure that combines Singular Values Decomposition (SVD) and Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) algorithms. The SVD is now known as a Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (Pol-SAR) decomposition that can increase the contrast between the ships and the sea in SAR images. The CFAR algorithms are defined as detectors having an adaptive threshold based on well known distributions that model sea clutter. The dataset processed in this research was acquired using RADARSAT-2 satellite over a portuary zone situated in Vancouver. In this paper, it was shown that combining between singular values decomposition and CFAR algorithm based on the exponential distribution outperforms all the combination studied in this paper and existing algorithms present in the CFAR literature, and it attains the best probability of detection (PD) of 93% with a probability of false alarm (PFA) of 0.1%. This result is validated by comparing it to the achievement obtained with the state of the art CFAR algorithms based on distributions such as generalized Gamma where we obtained a PD of 84%, G0A a PD of 82%, Weibull a PD of 75% and 68% for generalized Pareto distribution.

TI  - Assessment of urban thermal field variance index and thermal comfort level of Addis Ababa metropolitan city, Ethiopia
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use land cover (LULC) conversion around urban areas is the root cause for the increasing trend of land surface temperature (LST) in many cities. The increase in LST is driven by the replacement of vegetation cover and other LULC by impervious surface. This study is aimed to assess the extent of urban thermal field variance index (UTFVI) and thermal comfort level of Addis Ababa city using geospatial techniques and linear regression model. Landsat image of 1990 TM, 2000 of ETM+ and 2020 of OLI/TIRS are used to analyze LST and Urban Heat Islands (UHI) for assessing UTFVI and urban thermal comfort level. The results showed that the UHI over Addis Ababa city is substantial increased over the past decades. The results reveled that LST has increased by 7.9 degrees C due to decline of vegetation cover and expansion of built-up area. Results show that about 225 km(2) (42.7%) is excellent comfort for urban resident while about 241.4 km(2 )(45.8%) is categorized as worst ecological evaluation index, which results discomfort to the city dwellers. The key findings of from this study are crucial for informing city administrators and urban planners to reduce urban heat islands by investing on urban green areas and open spaces.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Environmental Drivers of Eastern Equine Encephalitis Virus in Central Florida: Towards a Predictive Model for a Lethal Disease
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) is a mosquito-borne virus that affects humans and horses, with a high case fatality rate in both species. The virus can be transmitted by several mosquito species and maintained in multiple reservoir hosts, making EEEV dynamics difficult to anticipate. In this study, we identified spatial and temporal factors that precede EEEV detection using sentinel chicken surveillance data from Orange County, Florida, from 2003 to 2017. We first examined the land cover and mosquito species composition associated with sentinel chicken sites. We then fit distributed lag nonlinear models of EEEV detection at the county scale, using monthly temperature, precipitation, and Southern Oscillation Index values, and at the sentinel flock-scale, using remotely sensed temperature and wetness indicators. We found positive associations between the percent wooded wetlands and the count of EEEV detections. We found Culiseta melanura (Diptera: Culicidae) were more abundant at positive sites in winter and summer, but Coquillettidia perturbans (Walker) were more abundant at positive sites in spring. In the county-wide model, precipitation, temperature, and Southern Oscillation Index values at lags of two, nine, and twelve months were significant, respectively, while temperature and wetness were significant at lags of eight and six months in the flock-specific models.

TI  - Monitoring spatial and temporal dynamics of wetland vegetation and their response to hydrological conditions in a large seasonal lake with time series Landsat data
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Periodic hydrological processes of seasonal lakes are the dominant factors leading to the development of vegetation communities and ecological processes. Dongting Lake is a typical seasonal lake in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and its hydrological conditions have changed significantly due to the con-struction of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD). However, there are knowledge gaps in the responses of wetland vegetation dynamics to the changes of hydrological conditions, especially in cloudy and rainy regions, where continuous large-scale monitoring is still challenging. In this study, by using time series of Landsat data on Google Earth Engine, a long-term cloudless remote sensing images dataset of Dongting Lake during the dry season was constructed. The multi-year wetland vegetation from 2003 to 2020 was mapped using the random forest model. Relationships between wetland vegetation dynamics and hydrological conditions (e.g., water level and inundation character) were examined using correlation and linear analysis. Results revealed that wetland vegetation in the Dongting Lake experienced significant inter-annual spatial heterogeneity and temporal dy-namic equilibrium with a slight increase during the post-TGD period. Only Carex communities at elevations above 28 m and below 26 m displayed apparent changes. Reed communities have relatively high selectivity to inundation frequency, and are affected mainly by changes in water levels during the dry season of the current year. Hydrological conditions during the rising period have an important impact on the first growth and reproduction stage of Carex, while higher water levels or more rapid surface submergence lead to a decrease in seed density in the soil of low-elevation floodplains. This study deepens our knowledge of changes of wetland vegetation and their response to hydrological conditions, and is of great significance to the ecological protection and restoration of Dongting Lake.

TI  - Hydro-abrasive erosion modelling in Francis turbine at different silt conditions
T2  - SUSTAINABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES AND ASSESSMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydro-abrasive erosion creates problems for the safe and effective running of hydropower projects. This is of even greater concern in hilly regions. The huge losses in the revenue of the hydropower plant have become a burden on the hydropower project developers. These losses are mainly due to the reduced capacity of the generation of electricity units (kWh). The high amount of silt entering the plant, especially in the monsoon season causes heavy hydro-abrasive erosion in the turbine and other underwater components. The deterioration of underwater plant equipment due to this kind of erosion can also lead to a total shutdown of the hydropower plant. In the current scope of the study, efforts have been made to validate the existing erosion models for the Francis turbine with the operational hydropower plant and carry out the numerical erosion modelling in the Francis turbine to predict the turbine efficiency losses at maximum and part-load conditions. Various developed erosion models are analyzed for the study period of FY 2018-19 based on influencing parameters like silt concentration, silt size, hardness, and site-specific flow constant. The site chosen for this purpose was the MB-II hydropower plant, a 304 MW hydropower project having four generating units of Francis turbine located at the foot of the Himalayan hills in the Uttarkashi district of Uttarakhand, India. The calibration factor is calibrated for the MB-II hydropower plant using GRG Nonlinear algorithm using a multi-start solver.

TI  - A Review on remote sensing application in river ecosystem evaluation
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - A river is a huge natural freshwater stream that plays a significant role in hydrological dynamics, water resource management, and global activities. Understanding the dynamics of the river ecosystem, such as water quality, morphological traits, and so on, is crucial to determining its health. This article provides a broad review on Geographic Information System (GIS) and Remote Sensing (RS) applications for achieving geographical advantages, particularly in the river ecology. In recent years, the accessibility, accuracy, and popularity of RS technology have all increased dramatically. Land use and cover mapping, land cover changes, deforestation vegetation dynamics, and water quality dynamics at many scales utilising efficient methods are all covered using remote sensing data. RS may now be utilised for a variety of engineering-related applications at the same time. The importance of Landsat data and multispectral sensors in mapping and monitoring many environmental parameters of river ecosystems is highlighted. According to a recent research study, these technologies will aid in the establishment of safety measures prior to disasters. Additionally, river cleaning can be done in conjunction with the creation of an appropriate drainage system to protect the river from becoming contaminated. Future research is expected to build on developing technology, enhance present methodologies, and include innovative analytical approaches.

TI  - Improving model-satellite comparisons of sea ice melt onset with a satellite simulator
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonal transitions in Arctic sea ice, such as the melt onset, have been found to be useful metrics for evaluating sea ice in climate models against observations. However, comparisons of melt onset dates between climate models and satellite observations are indirect. Satellite data products of melt onset rely on observed brightness temperatures, while climate models do not currently simulate brightness temperatures, and must therefore define melt onset with other modeled variables. Here we adapt a passive microwave sea ice satellite simulator, the Arctic Ocean Observation Operator (ARC3O), to produce simulated brightness temperatures that can be used to diagnose the timing of the earliest snowmelt in climate models, as we show here using Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2) ocean-ice hindcasts. By producing simulated brightness temperatures and earliest snowmelt estimation dates using CESM2 and ARC3O, we facilitate new and previously impossible comparisons between the model and satellite observations by removing the uncertainty that arises due to definition differences. Direct comparisons between the model and satellite data allow us to identify an early bias across large areas of the Arctic at the beginning of the CESM2 ocean-ice hindcast melt season, as well as improve our understanding of the physical processes underlying seasonal changes in brightness temperatures. In particular, the ARC3O allows us to show that satellite algorithm-based melt onset dates likely occur after significant snowmelt has already taken place.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variation and dynamic scenario simulation of ecological risk in a typical artificial oasis in northwestern China
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Landscape ecological risk assessments have played a critical role in measuring and predicting the quality and dynamic evolution of the ecological environment. In this study, a typical artificial oasis in the Alar reclamation area of Northwest China was selected as the research area. We acquired Landsat images from the past 30 years for the study area. Based on these remote sensing images, continuous long-term series and multi-temporal syntheses were combined to classify and construct a landscape ecological risk index. Our results showed a clear downward trend in the overall ecological risk in the Alar reclamation area between 1990 and 2019. Through scenario simulation, we found that the ecological risk of the research area is predicted to decrease in 2025 and 2030 under the two scenarios of natural growth and strict government control. Compared to the natural growth scenario, the increased area of construction and cultivated land is predicted to be less under the government control scenario, which contributes to the decrease in the overall ecological risk. Therefore, when formulating the overall plan for land use, the government should strictly control the increase in construction and cultivated land and prohibit illegal cultivation and blind reclamation of cultivated land. We used a classification method that is more suitable for the local study area, thereby increasing classification accuracy, and in turn, simulating and evaluating future landscape patterns more accurately. Our study provides a good reference for similar studies to be conducted in arid regions of northwest China and around the world.

TI  - Remarkable improvement of ecosystem service values promoted by land use/land cover changes on the Yungui Plateau of China during 2001-2020
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantitative evaluation of the relationship between land use/land cover (LULC) change and ecosystem service values (ESVs) is of great significance for the scientific optimization of land use structure and the formulation of sustainable land use policy, However, the responses of ESVs to LULC changes in fragile ecosystem regions over long time scales and large spatial scopes in the context of ecological restoration measures have seldom been studied. In this study, the Yungui Plateau in China was used as the study region. Based on annual Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land cover datasets (MCD12Q1) from 2001 to 2020, using the equivalent coefficient value of ESVs modified for the specific situation of China, and adopting the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic method and Spearman's rank correlation analysis, the study estimated the values of 11 types of ecosystem services, and analyzed the dynamics of LULC and its impact on ESVs from 2001 to 2020. The results showed that the LULC pattern in the Yungui Plateau changed dramatically in the past two decades, with a significant increase in forestland. The total ESVs improved remarkably from 638.10 billion yuan in 2001 to 746.99 billion yuan in 2020, and was mainly affected by forest restoration and the conversion of grassland to forestland and farmland to grassland. The distribution of ESVs shows obvious spatial and temporal heterogeneity; ESV hot spots were mainly distributed in the edge regions, while ESV cold spots were concentrated on the central and eastern of Yungui Plateau, and the decline in total ESVs still existed and displayed an increasing trend caused by farmland expansion and forestland degradation. Thus, we conclude that the LULC changes caused by ecological restoration measures have a significant positive effect on the improvement of the total ESVs in the Yungui Plateau and suggest that declines in ESVs in local areas should be of high concern in future land use planning and management.

TI  - A global terrestrial evapotranspiration product based on the three-temperature model with fewer input parameters and no calibration requirement
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate global terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET) estimation is essential to better understand Earth's energy and water cycles. Although several global ET products exist, recent studies indicate that ET estimates exhibit high uncertainty. With the increasing trend of extreme climate hazards (e.g., droughts and heat waves), accurate ET estimation under extreme conditions remains challenging. To overcome these challenges, we used 3 h and 0.25 degrees Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) datasets (net radiation, land surface temperature (LST), and air temperature) and a three-temperature (3T) model, without resistance and parameter calibration, in global terrestrial ET product development. The results demonstrated that the 3T model-based ET product agreed well with both global eddy covariance (EC) observations at daily (root mean square error (RMSE) = 1 1 mm (d(-1), N = 294 058) and monthly (RMSE = 24 9 mm month(-1), N = 9632) scales and basin-scale water balance observations (RMSE = 116.0 mm yr(-1), N = 34). The 3T model-based global terrestrial ET product was comparable to other common ET products, i.e., MOD16, P-LSH, PML, GLEAM, GLDAS, and Fluxcom, retrieved from various models, but the 3T model performed better under extreme weather conditions in croplands than did the GLDAS, attaining 9.0 %-20 % RMSE reduction. The proposed daily and 0.25 degrees ET product covering the period of 2001-2020 could provide periodic and large-scale information to support water-cycle-related studies. The dataset is freely available at the Science Data Bank (https://doi.org/10.57760/sciencedb.o00014.00001, Xiong et al., 2022).

TI  - Decision support system based on spatial and temporal pattern evolution of ecological environmental quality in the Yellow River Delta from 2000 to 2020
T2  - SOFT COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Yellow River Delta is the youngest large river delta in the world and is an important part of the national coordinated regional development strategy. In this paper, using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, Landsat remote sensing images in the summer (June-September) of 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020 were selected to remove clouds and mask water body information. The median value is taken to synthesize the remote sensing images of each year and extract multiple indices of greenness, wetness, heatness, and dryness. Then integrate the population density data by principal component analysis to quickly construct an improved composite remote sensing ecological index (CRSEI). The results showed that the average contribution of the six indicators of greenness (NDVI and FVC), wetness (NDMI), heatness (LST), dryness (NDBSI), and population density (Pop) to the first principal component (PC1) was above 79%, and the construction of an improved comprehensive remote sensing ecological index (CRSEI) based on PC1 was feasible in the Yellow River Delta. In the past 20 years, the ecological and environmental quality of the Yellow River Delta has shown a continuous trend of improvement. The ecological environment quality has improved by 3570.95 square kilometers, accounting for 48.0% of the total area, while the ecological environment quality has degraded by 712.99 square kilometers, accounting for only 9.6% of the total area. The improved area is 38.4% more than the degraded area, which shows that the ecological environment quality has improved in general. The ecological environment quality in Kenli County has improved the most. The ecological projects have been implemented in this area with the most obvious effect, and the investment in ecological environmental protection in this area should be continued or increased. The use of the GEE platform can obtain timely and accurate spatial and temporal patterns and evolution of ecological environmental quality in the Yellow River Delta, which is of great significance for ecological environmental protection and construction.

TI  - Multiscale spatial analysis of headwater vulnerability in South-Central Chile reveals a high threat due to deforestation and climate change
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Headwaters represent an essential component of hydrological, ecological, and socioeconomical systems, by providing constant water streams to the complete basin. However, despite the high importance of headwaters, there is a lack of vulnerability assessments worldwide. Identifying headwaters and their vulnerability in a spatially explicit manner can enable restauration and conservation programs. In this study, we assess the vulnerability of headwaters in South -Central Chile (38.4 to 43.2 degrees S) considering multiple degradation factors related to climate change and land cover change. We analyzed 2292 headwaters, characterizing multiple factors at five spatial scales by using remote sensing data related to Land Use and Cover Change (LUCC), human disturbances, vegetation cover, climate change, potential water demand, and physiography. We then generated an index of vulnerability by integrating all the analyzed vari-ables, which allowed us to map the spatial distribution of headwater vulnerability. Finally, to estimate the main drivers of degradation, we performed a Principal Components Analysis with an Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering, that allowed us to group headwaters according to the analyzed factors. The largest proportion of most vulnerable headwa-ters are located in the north of our study area with 48.1 %, 62.1 %, and 28.1 % of headwaters classified as highly vul-nerable at 0, 10, and 30 m scale, respectively. The largest proportion of headwaters are affected by Climate Change (63.66 %) and LUCC (23.02 %) on average across all scales. However, we identified three clusters, in which the north-ern cluster is mainly affected by LUCC, while the Andean and Coastal clusters are mainly affected by climate change. Our results and methods present an informative picture of the current state of headwater vulnerability, identifying spa-tial patterns and drivers at multiple scales. We believe that the approach developed in this study could be useful for new studies in other zones of the world and can also promote Chilean headwater conservation.

TI  - Constructing high-resolution groundwater drought at spatio-temporal scale using GRACE satellite data based on machine learning in the Indus Basin
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The complicated phenomenon induced by inadequate precipitation is a drought that impacts water resources and human life. Traditional methods to assess groundwater drought events are hindered due to sparse groundwater observations on a spatio-temporal scale. These groundwater drought events are not well studied in the study area of the Indus Basin Irrigation System (IBIS) holistically. This study applied four machine learning models to the training datasets of Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) Terrestrial Water Storage (TWS) and Groundwater Storage (GWS) data to improve resolution to 0.25 degrees from 1 degrees. The Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model outperformed the four models and results showed Pearson correlation (R) (0.99), Nash Sutcliff Efficiency (NSE) (0.99), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) (5.22 mm), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) (2.75 mm). The GRACE Groundwater Drought Index (GGDI) was calculated by normalizing XGBoost-downscaled GWS. The trend characteristics, the temporal evolution, and spatial distribution of GGDI were analyzed across the IBIS from 2003 to 2016. The wavelet coherence approach was used to evaluate the relationship between teleconnection factors and GGDI. The XGBoost downscaling model can accurately reproduce local groundwater behavior, with the acceptable correlation of coefficient values for validation (ranging from 0.02 to 0.84). The accumulated Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) with the time of 1, 3, and 6 months, and selfcalibrated Palmer Drought Severity Index (sc-PDSI) were used to validate GGDI. The findings have demonstrated that GGDI has comparable drought patterns to SPEI-3 and SPEI-6 and sc-PDSI. The teleconnection factors have a significant impact on the GGDI shown by the wavelet coherence technique. The impact of the sea surface temperature index (namely, NINO3.4) on GGDI was observed significantly high among other teleconnection factors in the IBIS. The proposed framework can serve as a useful tool for drought monitoring and a better understanding of extreme hydroclimatic conditions in the IBIS and other similar climatic regions.

TI  - Recent advances and opportunities in data assimilation for physics-based hydrological modeling
T2  - FRONTIERS IN WATER
M3  - Review
AB  - Data assimilation applications in integrated surface-subsurface hydrological models (ISSHMs) are generally limited to scales ranging from the hillslope to local or meso-scale catchments. This is because ISSHMs resolve hydrological processes in detail and in a physics-based fashion and therefore typically require intensive computational efforts and rely on ground-based observations with a small spatial support. At the other end of the spectrum, there is a vast body of literature on remote sensing data assimilation for land surface models (LSMs) at the continental or even global scale. In LSMs, some hydrological processes are usually represented with a coarse resolution and in empirical ways, especially groundwater lateral flows, which may be very important and yet often neglected. Starting from the review of some recent progress in data assimilation for physics-based hydrological models at multiple scales, we stress the need to find a common ground between ISSHMs and LSMs and suggest possible ways forward to advance the use of data assimilation in integrated hydrological models.

TI  - Ground-level ozone estimation based on geo-intelligent machine learning by fusing in-situ observations, remote sensing data, and model simulation data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, near-surface ozone (O-3) pollution has been increasing, seriously endangering both the ecological environment and human health. Accurately monitoring spatially continuous surface O-3 is still difficult with only remote sensing observations. In this paper, to address this issue, we propose a method for estimating surface O-3 by fusing multi-source data, including in-situ observations, O-3 precursors obtained by remote sensing, and model simulation data, including O-3 profile data and reanalysis products of meteorological and radiative elements. The estimation method is geo-intelligent light gradient boosting (Geoi-LGB) which takes into account both the spatial and temporal geographical correlation based on the standard LGB model. The spatio-temporal autocorrelation factors of the site observations are also constructed and added into the input variables. In a case study of China, centered on North China in 2019, the Geoi-LGB method obtained a root-mean-square error of 10.25 mu g/m(3), a mean absolute error of 7.30 mu g/m(3), and a coefficient of determination of 0.912 under the site-based cross-validation strategy. The proposed method has the advantages of being able to obtain a higher accuracy than some of the popular O-3 estimation models. Furthermore, the excellent spatial mapping ability of the Geoi-LGB method was demonstrated, in that about 85 % of the sites had an annual average absolute error of less than 10 mu g/m(3). We believe that this study could provide some important reference information for the accurate estimation of ground-level O-3.

TI  - Maternal proximity to mountain-top removal mining and birth defects in Appalachian Kentucky, 1997-2003
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Extraction of coal through mountaintop removal mining (MTR) alters many dimensions of the landscape. Explosive blasts, exposed rock, and coal washing have the potential to pollute air and water. Previous research suggests that infants born to mothers living in areas with MTR have a higher prevalence of birth defects. In this cross-sectional study, we further examine the relationship between MTR activity and several types of birth defects. Maternal exposure to MTR was assessed using remote sensing data from Skytruth, which captures MTR activity in the Central Appalachian region of the United States. Active MTR area was quantified within a five-kilometer buffer surrounding geocoded maternal address captured on birth records for live births to Appalachian Kentucky mothers between 1997 and 2003 (N = 95,581). We assigned high, medium, and low exposure based on the tertile of total MTR area within 5-km, and births with no MTR within this buffer were assigned zero exposure. The presence or absence of a birth defect grouped into six major organ systems was identified using birth records alone. Finally, we applied conditional multiple imputation for variables with missing values before conducting separate multivariable log-binomial regression models for each birth defect group. Prevalence ratio (PR) estimates were adjusted for individual level covariates from birth records. The prevalence of gastro-intestinal defects was significantly higher in birth records with high and low active MTR exposure compared to records with no exposure. (High exposure: PR = 1.99, 95% CI = 1.14-3.47; low exposure PR = 1.88, 95% CI = 1.06-3.31). This study supports some of the existing findings of previous ecological studies. Research addressing the relationship between gastro-intestinal birth defects and MTR coal mining is warranted but should carefully consider temporal dimensions of exposure.

TI  - World Health Organization critical priority <i>Escherichia coli</i> clone ST648 in magnificent frigatebird (<i>Fregata magnificens</i>) of an uninhabited insular environment
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance is an ancient natural phenomenon increasingly pressured by anthropogenic activities. Escherichia coli has been used as markers of environmental contamination and human-related activity. Seabirds may be bioindicators of clinically relevant bacterial pathogens and their antimicrobial resistance genes, including extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (ESBL) and/or plasmid-encoded AmpC (pAmpC), in anthropized and remote areas. We evaluated cloacal swabs of 20 wild magnificent frigatebirds (Fregata magnificens) of the Alcatrazes Archipelago, the biggest breeding colony of magnificent frigatebirds in the southern Atlantic and a natural protected area with no history of human occupation, located in the anthropized southeastern Brazilian coast. We characterized a highly virulent multidrug-resistant ST648 (O153:H9) pandemic clone, harboring bla(CTX-M-2), bla(CMY-2), qnrB, tetB, sul1, sul2, aadA1, aac(3)-VIa and mdfA, and virulence genes characteristic of avian pathogenic (APEC) (hlyF, iroN, iss, iutA, and ompT) and other extraintestinal E. coli (ExPEC) (chuA, kpsMII, and papC). To our knowledge, this is the first report of ST648 E. coli co-producing ESBL and pAmpC in wild birds inhabiting insular environments. We suggest this potentially zoonotic and pathogenic lineage was likely acquired through indirect anthropogenic contamination of the marine environment, ingestion of contaminated seafood, or by intra and/or interspecific contact. Our findings reinforce the role of wild birds as anthropization sentinels in insular environments and the importance of wildlife surveillance studies on pathogens of critical priority classified by the World Health Organization.

TI  - Community-based assessment of coastal erosion in Lagos, Nigeria
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal erosion is a natural process that constantly reconfigures beaches, either in a landward or seaward direction. This study aims to assess the situation, causes, and impacts of coastal erosion on selected communities in Lagos State, Nigeria. Three local government areas (LGAs) that share boundaries with the coast (Ibeju-Lekki, Eti-Osa and Badagry-West LGAs) were purposively sampled. Google Earth Pro images were acquired from Landsat, Copernicus, Maxar technologies, and TerraMetrics for 1984, 1999 and 2021 to analyze shoreline movement dynamics using Digital Shoreline Analysis Software. A structured questionnaire was used to elicit information on the communities' perceptions. We used the convenience sampling method to administer 670 samples of the questionnaire at a 95.52% response rate. Images analysis revealed that Eti-Osa has the highest erosion distance (98.54 m) at an erosion rate of 8.88 m/year, while Badagry-West LGA has the least erosion distance (25.82 m) at an erosion rate of -2.31 m/year. This confirms the respondents' perception of coastline erosion and accretion which varies significantly across communities at X-2 (18) = 378.54, p < 0.05. The perceived leading causes of coastal erosion include heavy rainfall, intense storms, sea-level rise, developmental activities, and the anger of the gods, and they vary significantly across the communities at communities (X-2 (36) = 135.46, p < 0.05). The malevolent effects of this phenomenon, which include loss of homes and properties, groundwater quality impairment, relocation of settlement, and a threat to tourism, also vary significantly across communities. These communities are characterized by a low level of resilience to coastal erosion, hence susceptible to impending effects of climate change.

M3  - Article
AB  - The present study identifies drought risk zones in a river basin by analysing Landsat images from three selected precipitation deficit years (2000, 2009 & 2018). A set of seven parameters including standard precipitation index (SPI), long-term temperature condition index (TCI), long-term vegetation condition index (VCI), vegetation health index (VHI), long-term soil moisture index (SMI), long-term soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) and long-term normalised difference water index (NDWI) has been assessed, and drought risk zones have been identified using the fuzzy DEMATEL model to classify the causative and effective groups better represented through the causal diagram. A summary of the results shows that VHI, SPI, and TCI are the three most influential indicators of drought. A yield anomaly index (YAI) has been calculated for validation and the cropping pattern has been mapped.

TI  - Global dynamics of the offshore wind energy sector monitored with Sentinel-1: Turbine count, installed capacity and site specifications
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - With the promotion of renewable energy production and a planned phaseout of fossil fuels until 2040, the offshore wind energy sector has expanded and will continue to increase its capacity in the upcoming decades. This study presents a novel approach to deriving the installed capacity of offshore wind turbines on a global scale from spaceborne radar imagery provided by the Sentinel-1 mission. This new method contributes significantly to the information depth of freely available data sets, which provide the spatiotemporal patterns of offshore wind turbines. Furthermore, by combining freely available Earth observation and GIS data, commonly reported attributes of the offshore wind energy sector are compiled to provide a first impression of how this data can be used. All attributes are investigated to provide an in-depth overview of the developments in the offshore wind energy sector over the last five years. Between July 2016 and June 2021, the installed capacity worldwide grew from 13.5 GW to 40.6 GW. This corresponds to an increase of 27.1 GW or 200%. In total 8885 OWTs were installed until June 2021 with an additional 852 under construction. The European Union (15.2 GW), China (14.1 GW) and the United Kingdom (10.7 GW) are the three major contributors to the offshore wind energy sector. China has seen the largest growth in the last five years of 13 GW, followed by the EU with 8 GW and the UK with 5.8 GW. The provided analysis at the end of this study describes the offshore wind energy sector in a transition phase between decades of maturity and massive growth at a time when carbon-neutral energy production is massively supported. Overall the proposed approaches for independent offshore wind turbine capacity estimation and spatiotemporal investigation of the offshore wind energy sector can be used by all stakeholders involved in the upcoming challenge of integrated planning and implementation of offshore wind energy projects.

TI  - Mapping 10 m global impervious surface area (GISA-10m) using multi-source geospatial data
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Artificial impervious surface area (ISA) documents the human footprint. Accurate, timely, and detailed ISA datasets are therefore essential for global climate change studies and urban planning. However, due to the lack of sufficient training samples and operational mapping methods, global ISA datasets at a 10 m resolution are still lacking. To this end, we proposed a global ISA mapping method leveraging multi-source geospatial data. Based on the existing satellite-derived ISA maps and crowdsourced OpenStreetMap (OSM) data, 58 million training samples were extracted via a series of temporal, spatial, spectral, and geometric rules. We then produced a 10 m resolution global ISA dataset (GISA-10m) from over 2.7 million Sentinel optical and radar images on the Google Earth Engine platform. Based on test samples that are independent of the training set, GISA-10m achieves an overall accuracy of greater than 86 %. In addition, the GISA-10m dataset was comprehensively compared with the existing global ISA datasets, and the superiority of GISA-10m was confirmed. The global road area was further investigated, courtesy of this 10 m dataset. It was found that China and the US have the largest areas of ISA and road. The global rural ISA was found to be 2.2 times that of urban while the rural road area was found to be 1.5 times larger than that of the urban regions. The global road area accounts for 14.2 % of the global ISA, 57.9 % of which is located in the top 10 countries. Generally speaking, the produced GISA-10m dataset and the proposed sampling and mapping method are able to achieve rapid and efficient global mapping, and have the potential for detecting other land covers. It is also shown that global ISA mapping can be improved by incorporating OSM data. The GISA-10m dataset could be used as a fundamental parameter for Earth system science, and will provide valuable support for urban planning and water cycle study. The GISA-10m can be freely downloaded from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5791855 (Huang et al., 2021a).
